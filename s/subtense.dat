The hypothesis has been advanced that the limiting target situation might reasonably be equivalent to the instance in which the entire visual field is divided, as it becomes fatuous to speak of targets larger than can be accommodated in the binocular visual field. An experiment was performed which yielded data for both the upper limiting circular target size of the previously used data of the Tiffany research (6 °) and for a "split field" in which the target comprised a luminance increment on {{one half of the}} visual field.

A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm). Photographic lens and film resolution are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.|$|E
5000|$|Bridgman's {{theory was}} criticized because we measure [...] "length" [...] {{in various ways}} (e.g. it's {{impossible}} to use a measuring rod {{if we want to}} measure the distance to the Moon), [...] "length" [...] logically isn't one concept but many, some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be defined by the measuring operations used. Another example is the radius of a sphere, obtaining different values depending on the way it is measured (say, in metres and in millimeters). Bridgman said the concept is defined on the measurement. So the criticism is that we could potentially end up with endless concepts, each defined by the things that measured the concept, such as angle of sighting, day of the solar year, angular <b>subtense</b> of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the three}} basic color perceptions, hue, brightness, and colorfulness, hue has no {{relative}} version, but brightness has lightness, and colorfulness has chroma and saturation. Correlates of chroma {{are widely used}} in color difference formulae, but saturation currently plays little part in color science and technology.

In the real world, it is common for solid objects to be seen in directional lighting; in these circumstances saturation is a more useful percept than chroma because saturation remains constant in shadows.

The contralateral retina was later processed for HRP histochemistry {{to mark the}} cells that had axons in the fascicles. Labeled cells were found in a partial half anulus in ventral hemiretina, centered on the optic disk. The distance of the partial anulus from the disk depended on which tectal fascicle had been labeled; the more rostrocentral the fascicle, the smaller was the annular radius.

40|$|The avian retina {{possesses}} one of {{the most}} diverse complements of photoreceptor types among vertebrates but little is known about their spatial distribution. Here we used retinal wholemounts and stereological methods to present the first complete maps of the topographic distribution of rods and cones in four species of Australian passerines with diverse trophic specializations. All species studied have one central and one temporal rod-free zone. In the insectivorous yellow-rumped thornbill, the central rod-free zone is unusually large, occupying ∼ 17 % (56 °) of the retinal area (angular <b>subtense),</b> whereas in nectarivorous and frugivorous species it represents only ∼ 0. 1 % (5 - 7 °) to 0. 3 % (10 °) of the retinal area (angular <b>subtense).</b> In contrast, the temporal rod-free zone varies little between species (∼ 0. 02 - 0. 4 %; 2 - 10 °). In all species, rods follow a pronounced dorsoventral gradient with highest densities in the ventral retina. The topographic distribution of cones is concentric and reveals a central fovea and a temporal area. In the yellow-rumped thornbill, cone densities form an extended plateau surrounding the fovea, beyond which densities fall rapidly towards the retinal periphery. For the other species, cone densities decline gradually along a foveal to peripheral gradient. Estimates of spatial resolving power calculated using cone peak densities are higher in the central fovea (19 - 41 cycles/degree) than in the temporal area (9 - 15 cycles/degree). In conclusion, we suggest that the unusual organization of the rod-free zone and the distinct topographic distribution of rods and cones correlate with specific ecological needs for enhanced visual sensitivity and spatial resolution in these birds. 22 page(s...|$|E

The result shows that: the acceleration of switch rail and nose rail is larger than that of track in common section under foundation settlement; large vibration and deformation of the track structure arise when the vehicle is going through, meanwhile the peak of foundation lateral vibration response is higher than that of vibration caused by the vehicle passing switch rail.

The filters were designed to achieve one just-noticeable-difference (JND) in quality between images viewed from a certain distance and having a certain displayed image size (and thus angle of <b>subtense).</b> During psychophysical experiments, the filtered images were used as a test series for sharpness matching. For the capture of test-images, a digital SLR camera with a quality zoom lens was used for recording natural scenes with varying scene content, under various illumination conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{document}} the development of an accurate, affordable, reliable machine to perform the relatively long distance measurements routinely made by land surveyors. Prior to the development of the technology, surveyors used a variety of contact instruments for measurement: ropes, rods, poles, chains and steel tapes. The difficulty of obtaining results on long measurements by contact devices led innovators of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries to develop alternate non-contact methods of measuring: <b>subtense</b> bar, stadia wires and triangulation, all of which came with their own inadequacies. In 1951, Erik Bergstrand, a physicist with the Swedish Geographical Survey Office culminated thirteen years of research by bringing an electronic distance meter which measured distances based on the speed of light to the market. Research efforts undertaken during and after World War II in applied electronics and wave propagation led to the maser, which allowed South Africans Harry Baumann and T. L.

40|$|Locusts possess visual neurons {{that can}} be uniquely {{identified}} in each locust and that respond selectively to looming stimuli, giving the animal a warning of impending collision. It {{has been suggested that}} one such neuron, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), issues this warning by generating a peak in its response that occurs ca. 25 ms after a looming object reaches a <b>subtense</b> of 17 degrees on the eye. This peak is proposed to be a trigger for escape behaviour. We use both modelling and electrophysiological techniques to show that this early peak in LGMD response is not the 'essential functional variable' used naturally by the locust to trigger escape, but rather results from the unnaturally large stimulus used in the previous experimental work. The natural predators of Locusta in Africa, where the locust evolved, are small birds such as the fiscal shrike Lanius collaris humeralis and the carmine bee-eater Merops nubicus, with pectoral diameters of 40 - 45 mm (measurements from museum specimens). Locusta in flight are less than 100 mm wing tip to wing tip. When a locust views small approaching objects, the response of the LGMD continues to increase throughout the object's approach and the locust is able to trigger escape behaviours without the LGMD response peaking prior to collision...|$|E

40|$|Planned {{vacuum tank}} testing of a solar dynamic space power system {{requires}} a solar simulator. Several solar simulators were previously built {{and used for}} vacuum tank testing of various space systems. However, the apparent solar <b>subtense</b> angle, i. e., the angular size of the apparent sun as viewed from the experiment, of these solar simulators is too large to enable testing of solar dynamic systems. A new design was developed {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the solar dynamic testing. This design provides 1. 8 kW/m(sup 2) onto a 4. 5 M diameter test area from a source that subtends only 1 deg, full cone angle. Key features that enable this improved performance are (1) elimination of the collimating mirror commonly used in solar simulators to transform the diverging beam into a parallel beam; (2) a redesigned lamp module that has increased efficiency; and (3) the use of a segmented reflective surface to combine beams from several individual lamp modules at the pseudosun. Each segment of this reflective surface has complex curvature to control the distribution of light. By developing a new solar simulator design for testing of the solar dynamic system instead of modifying current designs, the initial cost was cut in half, the efficiency was increased by 50 percent reducing the operating costs by one-third, and the volume occupied by the solar simulator was reduced by a factor of 10...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to define the spatial {{frequencies}} that underlie judgments of Landolt C orientation under test conditions designed to favor either the magnocellular (MC) or parvocellular (PC) pathway. Contrast thresholds of two observers were measured for briefly presented Landolt Cs of four sizes, using steady- and pulsed-pedestal paradigms to bias performance toward the MC and PC pathways, respectively. Contrast thresholds were derived from a two-alternative forced-choice orientation judgment task using the QUEST procedure. The Landolt Cs were either low-pass or high-pass Gaussian filtered with a range of cutoff object spatial frequencies (cycles per letter) to limit their frequency content. Center object frequencies were derived from plots of log contrast threshold for orientation judgments vs. log filter cutoff object frequency. The function relating center object frequency to Landolt C angular <b>subtense</b> was nonlinear on log–log coordinates for both the steady- and pulsed-pedestal paradigms, indicating that different object frequencies were used to judge Landolt C orientation at different optotype sizes. However, the function was substantially steeper under the pulsed-pedestal than under the steady-pedestal paradigm, such that a large change in optotype size produced a relatively small change in retinal spatial frequency (cycles per degree). The pattern of results is consistent with previously reported differences between the spatial contrast sensitivity functions of the inferred MC and PC pathways...|$|E
