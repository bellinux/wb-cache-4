50|$|Born in Aberdare, Glamorgan, {{one of the}} six {{children}} of William Phillips, Phillips was brought up in Bargoed. He left school when he was 12 to become a colliery <b>surface</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in Torkington, Normansell was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age, and all his three siblings died while young, Normansell being brought up by his grandparents and an aunt. He became a <b>surface</b> <b>worker</b> at a coal mine {{at the age of}} seven, and moved to work underground when he was fourteen. When he married, at the age of twenty-two, he was illiterate, but his wife could read and write and persuaded him to learn.|$|E
50|$|In 1896 the {{colliery}} employed 262 {{underground and}} 104 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> By {{the time the}} pit closed, coal had been got from the Three Feet, Four Feet, Cannel, Plodder, Haigh Yard and Arley mines. In 1923 the colliery had 319 underground and 72 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> and produced gas, household and steam coal. The pit closed in 1929.|$|R
50|$|In 1923 the {{colliery}} employed 1524 men {{underground and}} 436 surface workers; which increased to 1631 underground and 492 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> by 1933. At Nationalisation in 1947 the colliery employed 1375 below and 561 above ground. The <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> included women, known as pit brow lasses, who sorted coal on the screens. Women were employed at Astley Green until the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all women}} who had worked {{underground}} gained employment as <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> Lighter work on the surface had traditionally been reserved for older men and {{men who had been}} injured below ground and some colliery owners considered pits unsuitable places for women. Other colliery owners were happy to employ {{women who had}} proved themselves reliable and strong workers and were used to the language and habits of the miners. Male <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> earned twice the wages of the women who worked twelve-hour shifts, five days a week and a shorter shift on Saturdays. Women <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> were concentrated in Scotland, South Wales, Cumberland, Shropshire and South Staffordshire and Lancashire, particularly in the Wigan area.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Several {{studies suggest}} that coal miners are under risk of severe health {{problems}} such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, renal, hematological and musculoskeletal disorders. However, there are limited data on biochemical changes in underground workers. In our study we aimed to evaluate the association between serum homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B 12, cystatin C and folate levels {{in the blood of}} underground coal miners. Materials and Methods: Eighty one coal miners who work as underground or surface workers were recruited into our study. The study population was divided into two groups: the <b>surface</b> <b>worker</b> group (control group, n= 33) and the underground worker group (n= 48). The folate, vitamin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{representations of}} Cornwall in literature from 1880 to 1940. It identifies alternative literary ‘Cornwalls’ {{and seeks to}} understand {{their relationship to the}} predominant ways in which Cornwall has been culturally produced. The Cornwalls identified are all influenced by a nineteenth century seismic shift from mining to tourism. Until its catastrophic collapse mining dominates how Cornwall is represented within and without of the county. Its replacement by tourism gives impetus to different ways of representing Cornwall in literature and other cultural mediums. Touristic friendly Cornwalls – Celtic, exotic, Arthurian – dominate. Economic necessity requires that these Cornwalls persist to radiate an enticing version of Cornwall to potential visitors. Some authors seize upon these dominant images and develop them, but there exists other literary Cornwalls – voices lost, hidden, subsumed –which counter hegemonic representation. Chapter One provides a cultural geography of Cornwall and discusses the dominant constructions of Cornwall in their historical and literary context. Chapter Two examines literature of Cornish mining. Salome Hocking’s novel focuses on the balmaiden, the female mine <b>surface</b> <b>worker,</b> while other mining texts adhere to a narrative of masculine achievement and toil. Chapter Three examines how visiting writers Dinah Craik and Edith Ellis negotiate established constructions of Cornwall. While Craik is unable to imagine a Cornwall uncoupled from Arthurianism, Ellis disengages from dominant representations of place in order to produce a form of literary anthropology. Chapter Four begins by positioning Jack Clemo and Daphne du Maurier as contrasting inheritors of the period of study. Du Maurier’s literature forms part of Tourist Cornwall while Clemo’s novels of the china clay region embrace an antitouristic, bleak, harsh, industrial world. Their literary worlds, however, though disparate, are in dialectic with each other. There can be identified, therefore, connections between the dominant and alternative versions of place under exploration. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|In 1896 the {{colliery}} had 86 underground {{workers and}} 13 on the surface. By 1923 the workforce numbered 179 and 175 ten years later. At nationalisation the colliery had 234 underground and 40 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> The colliery employed 222 {{workers in the}} 1970s.|$|R
50|$|At Nationalisation in 1947 Manchester Collieries {{employed}} 14,868 {{workers on}} the Lancashire Coalfield. Some of the <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> were women, known as pit brow lasses, who sorted coal on the screens at the pit head. As coal reserves were exhausted, the older collieries closed.|$|R
50|$|The colliery, sunk in 1846, {{was owned}} by Andrew Knowles and Sons and had two ten foot {{diameter}} shafts 24 yards apart.>The colliery originally had pitch pine timber headgear and a winding engine supplied by John Musgrave & Sons of Bolton that operated until 1944.The colliery was ventilated by furnace until the 20th century when ventilation fans were installed. Wrought iron boilers to raise steam for powering pumps, air compressors and haulage were originally sited {{near the bottom of}} No.2 shaft, the upcast shaft. The shaft bottom was reached at 1,775 feet. The colliery accessed several coal seams including the Rams, Crumbouke and Doe mines.In 1896 the colliery employed 640 men underground and 165 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> while in 1923 there were 563 underground and 172 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Four of the company's collieries {{survived to}} become part of the National Coal Board (NCB) in 1947. They were Golborne, Lyme Pits, Wood Pit and Old Boston {{employing}} a total of 3,195 underground and 557 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> The NCB's St.Helens Area Central Workshops were at Haydock until 1963.|$|R
50|$|After 1929 the {{colliery}} {{became part}} of Manchester Collieries and its railway {{was connected to the}} Astley and Tyldesley Collieries railway system between Nook and Gin Pit collieries. Manchester Collieries made improvements including new headgear and screens. The colliery {{became part of}} the National Coal Board in 1947. It closed in 1967 having employed 518 underground and 131 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1896, {{there were}} 340 {{underground}} workers and another 70 {{working on the}} surface. The manager was R E Jones, who was also responsible for the neighbouring Whitwell Colliery. Independent numbers for the workforce are not available for 1923, when the Colliery Year Book showed a joint figure for Steetley and Shireoaks, but in 1933, there were 460 men working underground, {{and the number of}} <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> was the same as in 1896. H J Atkinson was the manager in both years, and again, was also responsible for Whitwell. In 1940, the number underground had decreased to 440, but those working on the surface had increased to 80, and Steetley now had its own manager, in J A Barrass. The trend continued in 1947, with a drop to 403 men underground and 83 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> The manager was now L L Harrison, who had previously been the manager at Whitwell in 1940.|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{assessment}} of exposures to diesel exhaust were evaluated, including various biomarkers of internal exposure and early biological effects. The impact of possible biomarkers of susceptibility was also explored. Underground workers (drivers of diesel-powered excavators) at an oil shale mine in Estonia were compared with <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> Personal exposures to particle-associated 1 -nitropyrene (NP) were some eight times higher underground than on the surface. Underground miners were also occupationally exposed to benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as indicated by excretion of urinary metabolites of benzene and pyrene. In addition, increased O 6 -alkylguanine DNA adducts were detected in the white blood cells of underground workers, suggesting higher exposure to nitroso-compounds. However, no differences between underground and <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> were observed in the levels of other bulky DNA adducts determined by 32 P-postlabelling, or in DNA damage. The study indicated that smoking, diet and residential indoor air pollution are important non-occupational factors to consider when interpreting biomonitoring results...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} to diesel exhaust was studied in underground mining of oil shale in Estonia. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate different approaches to exposure assessment. Fifty men who drove diesel-powered excavators underground were compared with 50 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> who had no known occupational {{exposure to}} diesel exhaust. Samples of respirable air were analyzed for 1 -nitropyrene and pyrene. Urine samples were collected at the start and after the first and the last shift of the same week, and were analyzed for 1 -hydroxypyrene. Although ambient monitoring of 1 -nitropyrene indicated a relatively high exposure of underground workers to diesel exhaust compared to <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> (approximately 10 -fold higher), only a small increase in the excretion of 1 -hydroxypyerene was observed. Nonoccupational exposures such as smoking, recent consumption of grilled food, and recent proximity to an open fire had a greater impact on urinary excretion of 1 -hydroxypyrene than occupational exposure to diesel exhaus...|$|R
50|$|The mine {{produced}} coal for {{the industrial}} markets, supplying coking coal, gas coal, manufacturing coal and steam coal. Shortly after opening, it {{was affected by}} the miners strike of 1926, but production resumed afterwards. By 1938 the colliery was owned by Firbeck Main Collieries Ltd of Chesterfield, who employed 1,457 underground <b>workers</b> and 357 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> After nationalisation in 1946, it {{became part of the}} National Coal Board's No.1 Worksop area. At its peak in 1953, the mine employed 1,448 underground <b>workers</b> and 393 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> Problems gradually occurred, as the mine was affected by water, ventilation difficulties and geological faults. Transport of the coal to the surface was slow, as the shafts were unsuitable for the installation of mechanical skip winding, and by 1968, the mine was deemed to be uneconomical. It closed on 31 December 1968, and many of the miners moved to other local pits at Maltby, Manton, Shireoaks and Steetley.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 the Shakerley Collieries {{employed}} 442 underground <b>workers</b> and 87 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> {{in their}} pits. In 1933 the company employed 330 underground and 115 workers who produced 90,000 tons of coal annually from the Plodder, Cannel, Arley, Smith and Yard mines.Ramsden's Collieries joined Manchester Collieries in 1935. The Wellington Pit was {{abandoned in the}} same year and the Nelson Pit closed in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The Chair of the NCB, former Labour MP Alf Robens, {{proposed}} {{to resolve the}} dispute by conceding the wage claim of 27 shillings and 6 pence (£1.375) per week. Vic Feather, the TUC general secretary, negotiated a return {{to work on the}} basis of the salary increase proposed by Robens but with the issue of working hours for <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> unchanged pending future negotiations.|$|R
50|$|After the Industrial Revolution {{the main}} {{industry}} {{of the town}} was coal mining {{and there was a}} brickworks. In 1869 the collieries operating in Blackrod included Anderton Hall, Dootson Vauze, Park Hall, Rigby Hill, Marklands and Blackrod. The Scot Lane Colliery employed 628 men underground and 122 <b>surface</b> <b>workers</b> in 1923, it closed in 1932. There were formerly bleachworks, a calico-printing works and weaving mill was built in 1906.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause was}} {{the hours of}} work for <b>surface</b> <b>workers,</b> who were often older mineworkers who were no longer capable of working {{underground}}. Wages were lower, and working hours were longer for surface work than for underground work. The {{annual conference of the}} NUM had voted in July 1968 to demand the surface workers' hours be lowered to seven and three-quarters, but the union's executive had not acted upon the vote.|$|R

50|$|In 1871, {{the owner}} of Bradford Colliery was R. T. Parker and the occupier, for rate purposes, was T. & C. Livesey. When deeper pit shafts were sunk, seams of {{fireclay}} were discovered and consequently a brickworks {{was built on the}} north side of the colliery site to manufacture firebricks for use in lining furnaces. In 1896, the pit manager was F. L. Ward and the under-manager was George Bentley. At that time there were 404 underground <b>workers</b> and 125 <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> Coal were mined for making gas, for household and manufacturing use and for raising steam. The brickworks was operational in 1896 owned by Edward Williams. It employed three underground workers extracting clay and two <b>surface</b> <b>workers.</b> In 1935 Bradford Colliery became part of Manchester Collieries and became part of the National Coal Board on nationalisation in 1947. It remained open until September 1968 when it closed, not because its supply of coal was exhausted, but because of the damage to property caused by subsidence that would have been caused in the exploitation of new coal seams under built-up areas.|$|R
