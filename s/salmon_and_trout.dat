5|$|Recreational fishing, {{particularly}} angling, {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular participation activities in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 3—4 million anglers in the country. The most widely practised form of angling in England and Wales is for coarse fish while in Scotland angling is usually for <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fishing industry, {{although}} still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia's fish in 2006 {{and with the}} volumes steadily growing in 2007–2010. Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia's largest, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet. Fish breeding, especially of <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> is a growing industry.|$|E
5|$|Supporting a large {{population}} of <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> the Chetco's water is of very high quality. The watershed is home to many other species, including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area. The northernmost grove of Redwoods—the tallest trees on Earth—grow in the southern region of the Chetco's drainage basin. In total, the river is home to over 200species of animals, and 97percent of the watershed is forested.|$|E

5|$|Behnke in his <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native {{to a separate}} geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|The EPA {{approved}} temperature TMDLs {{for three}} Rogue River tributaries: Upper Sucker Creek in 1999, Lower Sucker Creek in 2002, and Lobster Creek in 2002. It approved temperature, sedimentation, and biological criteria TMDLs for the Applegate River basin in 2004, and temperature, sedimentation, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed in 2007. In 1992 it had approved pH, aquatic weeds and algae, and dissolved oxygen TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed. In December 2008, DEQ developed two TMDLs for the Rogue River basin (except the tributaries {{with their own}} TMDLs); a temperature TMDL was meant to protect <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> from elevated water temperatures, and a fecal contamination TMDL was intended to safeguard people using surface waters for recreation.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River below Shoshone Falls {{is home to}} thirty-five native fish species, {{of which}} twelve are {{also found in the}} Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake: the relict sand roller (Percopsis transmontana) of the Percopsidae family, the shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), the maginated sculpin (Cottus marginatus), and the Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri). The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also {{supports}} seven species of Pacific <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus). There are also high, often localized levels of mollusc endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River. The mollusc richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River.|$|E

25|$|In {{tandem with}} the decline of sea-fishing, {{commercial}} fish farms – especially in salmon, have increased in prominence in the rivers and lochs of {{the north and west}} of Scotland. Inland waters are rich in fresh water fish such as <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> although here too there has been an inexorable and so far unexplained decline in abundance over the past decades.|$|E
25|$|Many healthy {{populations of}} fish are present, {{including}} salmonids such as {{several species of}} salmon, trout, char. Besides <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> sport-fishers in BC also catch halibut, steelhead, bass, and sturgeon. On the coast, harbour seals and river otters are common. Cetacean species native to the coast include the orca, humpback whale, grey whale, harbour porpoise, Dall's Porpoise, Pacific white-sided dolphin and minke whale.|$|E

25|$|Two tributaries, Trout Brook and Orwell Brook, {{enter the}} river below the dam {{and are also}} {{accessible}} to migrating <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> where they are actively sought by anglers. Salmon may also run up a third tributary, Beaverdam Brook, however fishing is restricted on that stream due to its association with the Salmon River Fish Hatchery. The hatchery connects to the stream, where it directly takes in broodstock and releases juvenile hatchery-raised fish.|$|E
25|$|Marys Peak in the Central Coast Range is {{the highest}} peak at 4,097feet (1,248m). Logging is a major {{industry}} in the range in both private and government owned forests. Both {{the state and federal}} government manage forests in the Oregon Coast Range. The mountains are home to a variety of wildlife including black bear, elk, deer, beaver, many species of birds, and bats among others. Fish, including <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> and other aquatic life inhabit the streams and rivers flowing through the range.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1960s, the Lake's {{food web}} and {{zooplankton}} populations have undergone major changes. In 1963–65, opossum shrimp (Mysis diluviana) {{were introduced to}} enhance the food supply for the introduced Kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The shrimp began feeding on the lake's cladocerans (Daphnia and Bosmina), and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971. The shrimp provide a food resource for <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton. Since the 1970s, the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered, but not to former levels.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>trout</b> — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>trout</b> stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> 700 sea <b>trout</b> returning to the river to spawn.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} beaver-related {{flooding}} issues that people encounter {{are caused by}} blocked road culverts or freestanding beaver dams. Beaver-related flooding issues can usually be resolved with properly designed and installed water control devices, also known as flow devices. Flow devices are either specially designed pipes installed through beaver dams, or pipe and/or fence systems that protect road culverts from being blocked. The beneficial effects of beavers on stream flow, riparian habitat, <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout,</b> and wetland creation can be sustained with application of these inexpensive technologies, which require little maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Around 1900, {{different}} salmon {{were introduced}} as sport fish. Only the king salmon (Chinook) {{adapted to the}} environment. For decades, the development of <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> aquaculture in New Zealand was opposed by recreational fishers, {{on the grounds that}} disease would spread from fish farms into recreational fisheries, and that wild fish would be poached if they could be sold. In 1973 the government compromised by making trout farms illegal, but salmon farms legal. New Zealand is probably the only country in the world where trout farming is illegal, despite commercial interest from companies already farming salmon.|$|E
25|$|Farmed {{salmonids}} can, {{and often}} do, escape from sea cages. If the farmed salmonid is not native, it {{can compete with}} native wild species for food and habitat. If the farmed salmonid is native, it can interbreed with the wild native salmonids. Such interbreeding can reduce genetic diversity, disease resistance and adaptability. In 2004, about 500,000 <b>salmon</b> <b>and</b> <b>trout</b> escaped from ocean net pens off Norway. Around Scotland, 600,000 salmon were released during storms. Commercial fishermen targeting wild salmon not infrequently catch escaped farm salmon. At one stage, in the Faroe Islands, 20 to 40 percent of all fish caught were escaped farm salmon.|$|E
