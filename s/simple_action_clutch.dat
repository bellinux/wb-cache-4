30|$|We {{have already}} {{mentioned}} the first difficulty, namely {{that it is}} not clear, why the ascription of causal consequences of an action to the agent requires a specific causal verb to be existent and applicable. In addition, according to Feinberg, the accordion effect does not work with <b>simple</b> <b>actions.</b> The reason he gives is that <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> have no causal components therefore “one cannot play the accordion with them” (Feinberg, 136). Obviously Feinberg, like Davidson, thinks that <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> (raising one’s arm) cannot be squeezed down to e.g. he contracted his muscles thereby causing his arm to be raised. So the accordion effect cannot be used to narrow <b>simple</b> <b>actions.</b> This does not explain, however, why it should be impossible to stretch out the accordion i.e. to incorporate the consequences of a <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> into the actionb.|$|R

Complex actions can be presented {{in the form of}} a set of <b>simple</b> <b>actions.</b> If the logical organisation of this set is open, a complex action can be described as an algorithm consisting of <b>simple</b> <b>actions.</b> That means various kinds of operational activities develop from the same simple and typica...|$|R

30|$|The same {{explanation}} {{also works}} for the other exception. Feinberg claims that the accordion affect {{cannot be applied to}} <b>simple</b> <b>actions.</b> From a forward point of view, which uses the accordion effect to create new sentences, the following problem arises: why should it be impossible to stretch out the accordion and incorporate the consequences of a <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> into the description? Feinberg probably would not deny this—in fact, it is implied by his description and examples of the accordion effect—yet it is not his perspective. He is concerned with dissecting the sentence in order to see if causality can be found in it. If he is looking at a <b>simple</b> <b>action,</b> it is immediately clear, that nothing is hidden here. So this second exception also does make sense in Feinberg’s concept. It has to be said, however, that Feinberg could have seen the other, more obvious side and pointed out that the accordion effect can be applied to <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> as forward a tool to redescribe them in terms of their consequences but not to analyze them in terms of causality.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{recognition}} of complex actions. Our method combines automatic learning of <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> and manual definition of complex actions in a single grammar. Contrary to the general trend in complex action recognition that consists in dividing recognition into two stages, our method performs recognition of <b>simple</b> and complex <b>actions</b> in a unified way. This is performed by encoding <b>simple</b> <b>action</b> HMMs within the stochastic grammar that models complex actions. This unified approach enables a more effective influence of the higher activity layers into the recognition of <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> {{which leads to a}} substantial improvement in the classification of complex actions. We consider the recognition of complex actions based on person transits between areas in the scene. As input, our method receives crossings of tracks along a set of zones which are derived using unsupervised learning of the movement patterns of the objects in the scene. We evaluate our method on a large dataset showing normal, suspicious and threat behaviour on a parking lot. Experiments show an improvement of ~ 30 % in the recognition of both high-level scenarios and their composing <b>simple</b> <b>actions</b> with respect to a two-stage approach. Experiments with synthetic noise simulating the most common tracking failures show that our method only experiences a limited decrease in performance when moderate amounts of noise are added...|$|R
