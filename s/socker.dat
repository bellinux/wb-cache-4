60|$|The bleating of {{the sheep}} heralded another day. With the {{brightening}} light began the drive over the sand. Under the cliff the shade was cool and fresh; there was no wind; the sheep made good progress. But the broken line of shade crept inward toward the flock, and passed it. The sun beat down, and the wind arose. A red haze of fine sand eddied about the toiling sheep and shepherds. Piute trudged ahead leading the king-ram, old <b>Socker,</b> {{the leader of the}} flock; Mescal and Hare rode at the right, turning their faces from the sand-filled puffs of wind; August and Dave drove behind; Wolf, as always, took care of the stragglers. An hour went by without signs of distress; and with half the five-mile trip at his back August Naab's voice gathered cheer. The sun beat hotter. Another hour told a different story--the sheep labored; they had to be forced by urge of whip, by knees of horses, by Wolf's threatening bark. They stopped altogether during the frequent hot sand-blasts, and could not be driven. So time dragged. The flock straggled out to a long irregular line; rams refused to budge till they were ready; sheep lay down to rest; lambs fell. But there was an end to the belt of sand, and August Naab at last drove the lagging trailers out upon the stony bench.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether bone could be formed in peri-implant defects at {{immediate}} transmucosal implants using guided bone regeneration. Ten patients (median age 48 years) underwent comprehensive dental care including the placement of an implant into an extraction <b>socker</b> immediately following removal of a tooth. An expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and the mucoperiosteal flap were adapted around the neck of the implants, leaving the sites to heal in a tranmucosal fashion. During implantation (baseline) and at membrane removal surgery 5 months later, the following clinical measurements from the implant shoulder were assessed at six sites: implant-bone contact (defect width). Estimates of the defect volume bordered by the membrane, the implant, and the bony walls were calculated. At baseline, the mean defect depth was 4. 7 mm (SD 1. 3 mm, range 1 to 14 mm). At membrane removal, the mean defect depth had decreased to 2. 1 mm (SD 1. 3 mm, range 1 to 14 mm). At membrane removal, the mean defect depth had decreased to 2. 1 mm (SD 0. 8 mm). Compared to baseline, this decrease was statistically significant (p <. 01). The mean increase in bone height at the deepest defect site of each implant was 6. 7 mm (SD 3. 0 mm), which was significant (P <. 01). At baseline, the mean value for the defect volume estimates was 9. 45 mm 3 (SD 5. 75 mm 3). At membrane removal, a significant decrease (P <. 01) was found.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a dietary change, physical activity or a combination of both gave the best result when treating obesity, concerning weight loss and BMI. Excessive weight and obesity are today a big health-issue and it is estimated that 10 % of the men and 12 % of the women in Sweden have a BMI over 30, i. e. are suffering from obesity. The corresponding number for children is 3 %. No one can say for sure what causes obesity but there are many theories. Lifestyle has great impact on it, as have genetic factors. The every-day exercise has been decreased as the conditions at work have changed and we have become more inactive. At the same time our energy-intake has increased and the surplus of energy is added to our body in the form of fat. Research shows that obesity is more common among certain groups in society. The prevalence of obesity is higher among people with little or no education at all, than among people with high education. Labourers have a higher prevalence of obesity than white-collar workers and geographically seen, the prevalence is higher in the countryside than in the cities. Obesity is a large contributing factor to the metabolic syndrome which means an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, cardio-vascular diseases and the development of diabetes. All over the world it is agreed that something must be done to stop the obesityepidemic. Thirty minutes of physical activity every day is the general recommendation. Four of the studies I have analyzed include different amounts and intensity of exercise and the outcome of these. Also one study brings up the effects of diets alone. Two of the four studies that involved exercise also had restrictions in energy-intake as a complement to the activity-goals. All articles in my study are based on open randomized trials. My conclusion is that in many cases, thirty minutes of physical activity is sufficient to stop or counteract the obesity-epidemic, but for those who already suffer from obesity, an increase in physical activity often leads to better results. To alter the diet and obtain from, or reduce, the intake of certain products, e. g. sugar, also contributes to weight loss. It is my opinion that a combination of a healthy diet and exercise is the best recommendation for weight loss, and that other factors like support from family and friends can increase the chances of success. Syftet med denna litteraturstudie var att undersöka om kostförändring, motion eller en kombination av de båda gav bäst resultat vid behandling av fetma, med avseende på vikt och BMI. Övervikt och fetma är idag ett stort folkhälsoproblem och man räknar med att ca 10 % av männen och 12 % av kvinnorna i Sverige har ett BMI över 30, dvs. lider av fetma. Även barnen är drabbade, och ca 3 % beräknas tillhöra motsvarande kategori. Ingen kan med säkerhet säga vad fetma beror på men det finns många teorier. Livsstilen påverkar, liksom genetiska faktorer, men världen över är man ense om att något måste göras för att hejda fetma-epidemin. Trettio minuters fysisk aktivitet om dagen är den generella rekommendationen. Fyra av de studier jag tar upp i detta arbete innefattar olika mängd och intensitet av motion samt resultaten av dessa. Likaså finns en studie som endast tar upp dieter. Två av de fyra motionsstudierna har även begränsningar i kosten som komplement till motionen. Alla artiklar som tas upp i min litteraturstudie är baserade på öppna randomiserade prövningar. Min slutsats är att trettio minuters motion räcker i många fall för att hejda och motverka fetma-epidemin, men för de som redan lider av fetma innebär ökad fysisk motion oftast bättre resultat. Att förändra sin kost och utesluta eller skära ner på vissa saker som t. ex. <b>socker</b> bidrar också till viktnedgång. Jag tror att en kombination av bra kost och motion är det bästa receptet på viktnedgång, samt att andra faktorer som stöd från familj och omgivningen kan öka chanserna att lyckas ytterligare. 2008 :F...|$|E
