5|$|After the Nazi Party {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was <b>swiftly</b> scrapped; a ruling on 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and {{the flag of}} the Nazi Party.|$|E
5|$|The Israelis {{expected}} a forty-eight-hour warning beforehand from their intelligence services. At any rate, they were confident that any Arab attack would be <b>swiftly</b> decimated by the IAF.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{invasion}} of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the Ba'athist Iraqi government, it was <b>swiftly</b> recaptured by Saudi ground forces. The battle serves as a modern demonstration that air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.|$|E
5|$|As well as Groening, Simon {{was often}} {{at odds with}} Brooks and {{production}} company Gracie Films. While working on The Simpsons, he and Brooks had co-created the series Sibs (1991) and Phenom (1993) {{as part of a}} multi-series deal for ABC. Simon did not want to work on either series, both of which were poorly received and <b>swiftly</b> canceled, which put a strain on the pair's relationship.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{improved}} slightly {{after the}} death of Peter II, and Euler <b>swiftly</b> rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him {{as the head of the}} mathematics department.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow <b>swiftly</b> over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|Ferens was industrious and forward-thinking; {{he moved}} <b>swiftly</b> through the company's {{managerial}} ranks. In 1874 he became works manager with {{a share in}} profits; in 1879, secretary; in 1880, general manager. He joined {{the board of directors}} in 1888 when Reckitt and Sons became a private joint-stock company. When James Reckitt died, 36 years later, Ferens was named joint chairman.|$|E
5|$|In June 1835, Lucas {{dispatched}} a delegation consisting of U.S. Attorney Noah Haynes Swayne, former Congressman William Allen, and David T. Disney to Washington D.C. {{to confer with}} President Andrew Jackson. The delegation presented Ohio's case and urged the President to act <b>swiftly</b> to address the situation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997–98 season, Gunn {{was forced}} out of the Norwich team by the {{emergence}} of Andy Marshall. With his first-team opportunities at Norwich now limited, he signed a deal with Hibernian in February 1998, for a three-month loan. According to Scottish transfer regulations the loan deal was invalid, so instead he was <b>swiftly</b> transferred on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee, later revealed by Gunn to have been £25,000.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} <b>swiftly</b> silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Continued dissatisfaction with {{this state of affairs}} would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.|$|E
5|$|On 7 and 8 May 1940, in the British House of Commons, the Norway Debate {{revealed}} intense {{dissatisfaction with}} and outright hostility toward {{the government of}} Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Two days later, with events moving <b>swiftly,</b> Chamberlain resigned and was succeeded by Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The 14th Panzer Division <b>swiftly</b> {{captured}} Vrbosko, linking up {{with the}} Italians as they attacked down the Adriatic coast, thereby cutting off the remaining elements of the 7th Army. It was then ordered to split into three columns to pursue the Yugoslavs across Bosnia. The northern column headed for Doboj, the central column for Sarajevo, and the southern column drove towards Mostar in Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The Achaean League {{chose this}} moment to fight Rome but was <b>swiftly</b> defeated. In 146 BC (the same year as the {{destruction}} of Carthage), Corinth was besieged and destroyed, {{which led to the}} league's surrender. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, Achaea and Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish plan in {{the south}} in Karelia was to advance as <b>swiftly</b> as {{possible}} to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the Finnish territories east of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the Karelian Isthmus, including the recapture of Vyborg, commenced. The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance <b>swiftly.</b> The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was {{the final}} war between Rome and Macedon and began when Andriscus usurped the Macedonian throne. The Romans raised a {{consular}} army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, who <b>swiftly</b> defeated Andriscus at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes. The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move <b>swiftly</b> and easily over large distances.|$|E
5|$|The fact that, in a digitally-connected world, {{a modern}} {{aircraft}} could disappear {{was met with}} surprise and disbelief by the public. While changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented, airlines and air transport authorities responded <b>swiftly</b> to take action on several measures to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a similar incident.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{seems to}} have {{involved}} {{the two of them}} overthrowing Tiberius, {{with the support of the}} Julians, and either assuming the Principate themselves, or serving as regent to the young Tiberius Gemellus or possibly even Caligula. Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and <b>swiftly</b> dealt with.|$|E
5|$|There were rumours that Levant would <b>swiftly</b> {{return to}} active service, but these proved unfounded and she {{remained}} tied up at Portsmouth. Her hull and fittings were surveyed in late 1763 to determine maintenance requirements, but no repairs were made. In September 1763 {{a member of}} her skeleton crew was robbed and murdered at Liphook, a village some distance from Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Udin's death <b>swiftly</b> {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre, with {{the circumstances of his}} death and the resulting investigation covered extensively in national media. Muslim prayer services held by Bernas seven days after Udin's death attracted hundreds of mourners and saw several community leaders give speeches on politics and Udin's death. Others, such as Goenawan Mohamad, wrote poems and flowery obituaries.|$|E
5|$|When the floodwaters receded, Watson {{was able}} to inspect the BX {{and found that the}} only damage done was some twisted and broken timbers that were quickly replaced. The company <b>swiftly</b> shipped up the {{replacement}} tools and supplies from Ashcroft and work resumed once more.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the {{opposing}} forces met in earnest at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine {{disagreed with the}} battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of <b>swiftly</b> returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were <b>swiftly</b> defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E
5|$|After {{they left}} The Simpsons, Oakley and Weinstein created Mission Hill. The show {{was plagued by}} promotional issues and was <b>swiftly</b> canceled. They worked as {{consulting}} producers on Futurama, then created The Mullets in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on Sit Down, Shut Up in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute. He has since written for The Cleveland Show and Portlandia, without Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on Portlandia, sharing a Writers Guild of America Award with his fellow writers in 2013. Oakley is married to fellow writer Rachel Pulido.|$|E
5|$|As Roman {{troops were}} spread {{increasingly}} thin over its long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in {{size as the}} population of the empire declined. Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces <b>swiftly</b> finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul. Several months after Orestes took power, a coalition of Heruli, Scirian and Turcilingi mercenaries demanded that he give them {{a third of the}} land in Italy. When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and <b>swiftly</b> executed.|$|E
5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were <b>swiftly</b> released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in Vidin, {{probably}} {{in support of his}} deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and <b>swiftly</b> caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The Muslim forces <b>swiftly</b> conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Byzantine Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine Empire and the entire Sasanian Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead {{the assault on the}} Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the temptation to <b>swiftly</b> overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{graduated}} from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force <b>swiftly,</b> which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move <b>swiftly,</b> and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the Greeks (and {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans <b>swiftly</b> defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was <b>swiftly</b> written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Phokas, the {{rebellion}} collapsed, and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk. Released from the threat to his rear, Basil II <b>swiftly</b> and decisively defeated George I, and imposed his terms on him. The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025, after {{the death of}} Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family, Bardas Phokas (possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.|$|E
