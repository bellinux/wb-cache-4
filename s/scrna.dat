40|$|Abstract Background Mosquitoes are the {{transmissive}} vectors {{for several}} infectious pathogens that affect man. However, {{the control of}} mosquitoes through insecticide and pesticide spraying has proved difficult in the past. We hypothesized that, {{by virtue of their}} reported vertical inheritance among mosquitoes, group II introns – a class of small coding ribonucleic acids (<b>scRNAs)</b> – may form a potential species-specific biomarker. Structurally, introns are a six-moiety complex. Depending on the function of the protein encoded within the IV moiety, the highly mobile class of group II introns or retroposons is sub-divided into two: Restriction Endonuclease (REase) -like and Apurinic aPyramydinic Endonuclease (APE) -like. REase-like retroposons are thought to be the ancestors of APE retroposons. Our aim in this study was to find evidence for the highly species-specific conservation of the APE subclass of mosquito retroposons. Methods and Results In silico targeted sequence alignments were conducted across a 1, 779 -organism genome database (1, 518 bacterial, 59 archeal, 201 eukaryotic, and the human), using three mosquito retroposon sequence tags (RST) as BLASTN queries [AJ 970181 and AJ 90201 of Culex pipien origin and AJ 970301 of Anoplese sinensis origin]. At a calibration of E = 10, A & D = 100, default filtration and a homology cut-off of > 95 % identity, no hits were found on any of the 1, 518 bacterial genomes. Eleven (100 %) and 15 (100 %) hits obtained on the 201 -eukaryote genome database were homologs (> 95 % score) of C. pipien quinquefasciatus JHB retroposons, but none of An. sinensis. Twenty and 221 low score (30 – 43 % identity) spurious hits were found at flanking ends of genes and contigs in the human genome with the C. pipien and An. sinensis RSTs respectively. Functional and positional inference revealed these to be possible relatives of human genomic spliceosomes. We advance two models for the application of mosquito RST: as precursors for developing molecular biomarkers for mosquitoes, and as RST-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) -DDT immunoconjugates to enhance targeted toxicity. Conclusion We offer evidence to support the species-specific conservation of mosquito retroposons among lower taxa. Our findings suggest that retroposons may therefore constitute a unique biomarker for mosquito species that may be exploited in molecular entomology. Mosquito RST-specific MAbs may possibly permit synthesis of DDT immunoconjugates {{that could be used to}} achieve species-tailored toxicity. </p...|$|R

The <b>scRNA</b> consists of three domains corresponding to domains I, II, and IV of human SRP 7 S RNA. To identify the structural determinants required for its function, we constructed mutant scRNAs in which individual domains or conserved nucleotides were deleted, and their importance was assayed in vivo.

In the current study we have examined the role of the NRF 2 in doxorubicin sensitivity and tumor growth by establishing stable cell line expressing NRF 2 shRNA in the human ovarian carcinoma cell line OV 90. On knockdown of NRF 2 through NRF 2 -specific shNRF 2 expressing lentiviral plasmid, antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity as well as the expression of NRF 2 -target genes were significantly suppressed compared to nonspecific scrambled RNA (<b>scRNA)</b> expressing cells. In addition, shNRF 2 expressing OV 90 -shNRF 2 cells showed a reduction in total GSH levels by 82 % and cell growth was observed to be significantly retarded compared to <b>scRNA</b> control cells. Furthermore, stable inhibition of NRF 2 sensitized OV 90 cells were seen following doxorubicin treatment as shown by the anal-ysis with MTT assay and propidium iodide-fluorescence-activated cell sorting. OV 90 -shNRF 2 cells showed higher levels of cell death and apoptosis in response to doxorubicin than OV 90 -scRNA cells.

40|$|AbstractWhile a role of promoter-proximal RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) pausing in {{regulation}} of eukaryotic gene expression is implied, the mechanisms and dynamics {{of this process}} are poorly understood. We performed genome-wide analysis of short capped RNAs (scRNAs) and Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells to better understand Pol II pausing (Samarakkody, A., Abbas, A., Scheidegger, A., Warns, J., Nnoli, O., Jokinen, B., Zarns, K., Kubat, B., Dhasarathy, A. and Nechaev, S.

40|$|ABSTRACT: RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{mediated by}} small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enables knockdown {{of a gene}} of choice, executing the logical operation: silence gene Y. The fact that the siRNA is constitutively active is a significant limitation, {{making it difficult to}} confine knockdown to a specific locus and time. To achieve spatiotemporal control over silencing, we seek to engineer small conditional RNAs (scRNAs) that mediate ‘conditional RNAi ’ corresponding to the logical operation: if gene X is transcribed, silence independent gene Y. By appropriately selecting gene X, knockdown of gene Y could then be restricted in a tissue- and time-specific manner. To implement the logic of conditional RNAi, our approach is to engineer scRNAs that, upon binding to mRNA ‘detection target ’ X, perform shape and sequence transduction to form a Dicer substrate targeting independent mRNA ‘silencing target ’ Y, with subsequent Dicer processing yielding an siRNA targeting mRNA Y for destruction. Toward this end, here we design and experimentally validate diverse <b>scRNA</b> mechanisms for conditional Dicer substrate formation. Test tube studies demonstrate strong OFF/ON conditional response, with at least an order of magnitude increase in Dicer substrate production {{in the presence of the}} cognate mRNA detection target. By appropriately dimensioning and/or chemically modifying the scRNAs, only the product of signal transduction, and not the reactants or intermediates, is efficiently processed by Dicer, yielding siRNAs. These mechanism studies explore diverse design principles for engineering <b>scRNA</b> signal transduction cascades including reactant stability vs metastability, catalytic vs noncatalytic transduction, pre- vs post-transcriptional transduction, reactant and product molecularity, and modes of molecular self-assembly and disassembly...|$|E
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura 16 - 06 - 2006 Streptomyces lividans is a Gram positive {{bacteria that}} secretes and produces many extracellular proteins (Gilbert et al., 1985), {{which has been}} used as a host for the secretory production of heterologous proteins (Gilbert et al., 1985; Van Mallaert & Anné, 1994). The study of the mechanisms and bottlenecks of protein secretion in Streptomyces is of high relevance in order to improve the production of proteins with industrial application. The general secretion mechanism (Sec) begins with the interaction of the intracellular machinery with secretory proteins N terminus signal sequences. Two different targeting pathways functioning in a substrate-specific manner have been described in bacteria. The SecB/SecA pathway functions in the posttranslational transport and membrane targeting of the protein signal sequencecontaining precursors (Beck et al., 2000) and the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway, formed by Ffh and <b>scRNA</b> and its receptor FtsY, that mediates the cotranslational targeting of proteins to the translocon (Kock et al., 1999), many of them being membrane proteins, as in the E. coli case (Dalbey & Chan, 2005). SecB homologues in the S. lividans genome have not been found, however the SRP machinery genes, ffh, <b>scRNA,</b> and ftsY, are present (Palacín et al., 2003). Ffh and <b>scRNA</b> constitute the S. lividans SRP (Palacín et al., 2003). A complex formed by SRP, FtsY and two model secretory proteins, a-amilase and agarase, has been detected in the major signal peptidase mutant (SipY), where protein secretion is severely diminished (Palacín et al., 2002), suggesting that the S. lividans SRP machinery mediates transporting of extracellular proteins to the membrane. Furthermore, the SipY mutant causes membrane retention of SRP components carrying the a-amilase precursor. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we have observed SRP components localized at specific peripheral sites in S. lividans SipY mutant cells. The location pattern resembles that of translocon distribution, as determined by SecY-GFP protein microscopic localization. It has been described that the absence of available translocons in the endoplasmic reticulum eukaryote cells induces an accumulation of protein translocation intermediates formed by Ffh, its receptor and preproteins (Song et al., 2000). A similar situation may occur in the major signal peptide mutant where signal peptide processing is less efficient and may trigger a temporal blocking of the translocon. Finally, the SRP components carrying pre a-amilase apparently form a complex with the SRP machinery and SecA protein in the membrane, which may indicate that proteins targeted by SRP could be translocated by the action of Sec...|$|E

We determined the requirement in the cariogenic oral pathogen Streptocococcus mutans of the three universally conserved elements of the SRP pathway: Ffh/SRP 54, <b>scRNA,</b> and FtsY/SRα. Previously, we reported that insertional interruption of S. mutans ffh was not lethal, but resulted in acid sensitivity. To test whether S. mutans could survive extensive disruption of the SRP pathway, single and double deletions of genes encoding Ffh, <b>scRNA,</b> and FtsY were generated. Without environmental stressors, all mutant strains were viable, but unlike the wild-type, none could initiate growth at pH 5. 0 or in 3. 5 % NaCl. Survival of challenge with 0. 3 mM H 2 O 2 was also diminished without ffh.

The signal recognition particle (SRP) protein-targeting pathway plays {{a pivotal role}} in membrane biogenesis. S. mutans SRP pathway mutants demonstrate growth defects, cannot contend with environmental stress, and exhibit multiple changes in membrane composition. This study sought to define a role for ylxM, which in S. mutans and numerous other bacteria resides directly up-stream of the ffh gene, encoding a major functional element of the bacterial SRP. YlxMwas observed as a produced protein in S. mutans. Its predicted helix-turn-helix motif suggested that it has a role as a transcriptional regulator of components within the SRP pathway; however, no evidence of transcriptional regulation was found. Instead, capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), affinity chromatography, and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) demonstrated that S. mutans YlxM interacts with the SRP components Ffh and small cytoplasmic RNA (<b>scRNA)</b> but not with the SRP receptor FtsY. In the absence of FtsY, YlxM increased the GTP hydrolysis activity of Ffh alone and in complex with <b>scRNA.</b> However, in the presence of FtsY, YlxM caused an overall diminution of net GTPase activity. Thus, YlxM appears to modulate GTP hydrolysis, a process necessary for proper recy-cling of SRP pathway components. The presence of YlxM conferred a significant competitive growth advantage under nonstress and acid stress conditions when wild-type and ylxMmutant strains were cultured together. Our results identify YlxM as a com-ponent of the S. mutans SRP and suggest a regulatory function affecting GTPase activity.

40|$|Ciliated {{protozoa}} contain {{two types}} of nuclei, germ line micronuclei (Mic) and transcriptionally active macronuclei (Mac). During sexual reproduction (conjugation), the parental Mac degenerates and a new Mac develops from a mitotic product of the zygotic Mic. Macronuclear development involves extensive endoreplication of the genome. However, very {{little is known about}} its regulation. The gene ASI 2 in Tetrahymena thermophila encodes a putative signal transduction receptor and is nonessential for vegetative growth. It is, however, required to complete sexual reproduction. Cells that lack ASI 2 in the developing Mac anlagen are arrested in DNA endoreplication and die. The present study shows that both the parental Mac and the Mac anlagen contribute to the increased level of ASI 2 transcripts during conjugation. The parental Mac is the source of ASI 2 transcripts early in conjugation, and the Mac anlagen is the source at later stages. Over-expressed Asi 2 p tagged with HA was present at early stages, and localized at the periphery of a cell, which is a characteristic of signal transduction receptor. The phenotype of the ASK germ line knockouts was further analyzed by the occurrence of later events during conjugation, including Pddlp distribution and the presence of small <b>scRNA</b> (<b>scRNA),</b> chromosome breakage and telomere addition and de novo DNA methylation. All these events happened similarly in matings between ASI 2 germ line knockouts compared to that of wild type cells. The phenotype of the somatic ASI 2 knockouts was analyzed to investigate the function of parental ASI 2 by the occurrence of early events during conjugation. Without the parental ASK, various molecular events, including synthesis of Pddlp and scRNAs and methylation of the Mac DNA occurred similarly to that of wild type cells. However, DNA endoreplication was delayed at early stages of the Mac anlagen development. Mutagenesis study showed that a Tyr to Phe mutation at the predicted phosphorylation site in the parental Mac also affected DNA endoreplication during the Mac anlagen development. These results suggested that AS 12 specifically regulates endocycling during the Mac anlagen development, instead of a general checkpoint for cell survival...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{ribonucleoprotein}} (RNP) particle {{showing a}} highly compact and characteristic {{structure in the}} electron microscope was found associated with globin and other repressed mRNA in the cytoplasm of duck, mouse and HeLa cells. This 19 S complex is of extraordinary stability: dissociated by 0. 5 M KCl or EDTA from the (still repressed) core globin mRNP, it can be purified on gradients containing 1 % Sarkosyl, and resists (unfixed) caesium sulphate-dimethylsulphoxide density centrifugation. Its density of 1. 31 g/cm 3 indicates an RNP complex with a 15 % RNA component. In mouse and duck it contains approximately 10 proteins in the 20 000 - 30 000 mol. wt. range, a few components of 50 000 - 70 000 mol. wt., and two specific small cytoplasmic RNAs (<b>ScRNA)</b> of 70 - 90 nucleotides. Both of these RNAs have identical 3 '-terminal oligonucleotides. We propose the name 'prosome' for this ScRNP particle which somehow participates in negative control of mRNA translation, and we believe {{will prove to be}} ubiquitous to animal species...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} a 180 kb contiguous sequence in the replication origin {{region of the}} Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Open reading frames (ORF) in this region were unambiguously identified from the determined sequence, using criteria characteristic for the B. subtilis gene structure, i. e., starting with an ATG, GTG or TTG codon preceded by sequences complementary to the 3 ' end of the 16 S rRNA. Four rRNA gene sets, 7 individual tRNA genes and 1 <b>scRNA</b> gene were identified, occupying 20 kb in total. In the remaining 160 kb region, 158 ORFs were identified, suggesting that 1 ORF is coded on average by 1 kb of DNA of the B. subtilis genome. Among the 158 ORFs, the functions of 48 ORFs were assigned and those of 11 ORFs are suggested through significant similarities to known proteins present in data banks. However, the functions of {{more than half of}} the ORFs (63 %) remain to be determined. Key words: Bacillus subtilis, genome sequencing project, systematic sequencing, open reading frame 1...|$|E
40|$|We cloned a Bacillus subtilis gene (srb) {{encoding}} a homologue of the mammalian {{signal recognition}} particle receptor a-subunit (SRa). The gene is 987 bp {{in length and}} encodes a 329 -amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein shared 26. 6, 36. 2 and 49. 7 % identity with those of mammalian SRa, archaebacterial DPa and Escherichia coli FtsY, respectively. The protein contains three conserved GTP-binding elements like the other three SRP receptor proteins, though the N-terminal portion of the putative B. subtilis protein was shorter than the others. Secondary structure prediction showed that an amphipathic a-helix is positioned in the N-terminal region. A defect in srb inhibited cell growth and protein translocation. Key words: Bacillus subtilis; signal recognition particle (SRP); SRP receptor Small cytoplasmic RNA (<b>scRNA)</b> and Ffh protein of Bacillus subtilis are homologues of SRP 7 S RNA and SRP 54 proteins of the mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP), 1 " 3 respectively, which function in targeting pre-secretory protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} 4. 5 S RNA of Escherichia coli {{contains a}} structural motif, {{which is also}} present in RNAs from other organisms, i. e. Bacillus subtilis <b>scRNA,</b> Halobacterium halobium 7 S RNA and eukaryotic 7 SL RNAs. This suggests a common function in all organisms, which {{could be related to}} protein translocation, since 7 SL RNA is essential for this process in eukaryotes. We have analysed the structure and expression of the 4. 5 S RNA gene from another gram-negative eubacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The single copy gene encodes a 113 nucleotides long RNA, which shares 75 % sequence homology to the E. coli 4. 5 S RNA and also exhibits the completely conserved hairpin structure of the corresponding RNAs of B. subtilis and E. coli. Transcription initiates 24 nucleotides upstream from the mature 5 ' end and exceeds beyond the 4. 5 S RNA coding region. A distal open reading frame, similar to that described for E. coli, does not exist downstream from the P. aeruginosa 4. 5 S RNA gene...|$|E
