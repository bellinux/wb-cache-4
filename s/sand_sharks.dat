2500|$|In Ocean City, {{there have}} been several shark sightings. More and more sharks have been spotted close to shore on beaches in Delaware and Ocean City. Some {{biologists}} believe that this may be a result of the fishermen who are attempting to catch <b>sand</b> <b>sharks</b> through bait that they have placed in the ocean. Besides <b>sand</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{there have been}} sightings of Tiger Sharks as well. On August 1, 2014, a 12.8 foot long, 1,000-pound tiger shark was spotted {{in the middle of the}} Isle of Wight Bay, located in Ocean City. The female shark was nicknamed Septima by scientists, and has traveled over thousands of miles along the East Coast since being tagged in South Carolina. However, even though there has been an increase in shark sightings, there haven’t been any recorded fatalities from shark attacks in Ocean City, Maryland. [...] North Ocean City in recent years has seen more deer sightings and red foxes as well as development has increased on the barrier island as well.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{not known}} to attack humans. If a person were to provoke a sand shark, it may retaliate defensively. <b>Sand</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{generally}} not aggressive but will harass divers who are spearfishing.

50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>shark</b> has {{a unique}} hunting strategy. It is able to gulp air from above the surface and collect the air in its stomach. This enables them to become buoyant and {{approach}} their prey virtually motionless. During the day, the <b>sand</b> <b>shark</b> stays mostly inactive, but at night, it becomes active and resumes hunting activities. Their staple is small fish, but they will eat crustaceans and squid, as well. They occasionally hunt in shivers (groups), and have even been known to attack full fishing nets.|$|R

5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} <b>sand</b> tiger <b>shark</b> (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the <b>sand</b> tiger <b>shark</b> than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since <b>sand</b> tiger <b>sharks</b> are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large <b>sand</b> tiger <b>shark</b> would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the threat}} gone {{the beaches are}} reopen and the party is back on. However the tooth found earlier is only a baby tooth and Sandy {{believes}} the dead shark's mother is out there looking for its baby. With the party underway it is revealed there are more <b>sand</b> <b>sharks</b> as both Amanda and Willie are killed by one. More <b>sand</b> <b>sharks</b> appear and start killing the party goers and Brenda is also killed {{trying to get people}} off the beach. John and Sandy are stuck on rocks where the sharks can't get to them and the sharks attack the docks with few casualties as Angus shows up to get the people out of there. With the ferry not showing up for another day, Jimmy, John, Angus and Sandy take one final stand against the <b>sand</b> <b>sharks</b> using Jimmy's speakers, napalm and Angus' homemade flamethrower. Unfortunately, the music stops and Jimmy goes to fix the speakers but the wire is torn and the <b>sand</b> <b>sharks</b> swarm Jimmy, who sacrifices himself so the sharks stay in one place as Angus encases them all in glass.|$|E

Trapped in Angus' hut John and Sandy make one last effort to kill the mother by tossing a {{flamethrower}} full of napalm into her mouth as they escape the hut the flamethrower explodes in the shark's mouth, destroying her and the hut at the same time.

50|$|Examples of {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish are}} many of the squaliform sharks, which include <b>sand</b> <b>sharks,</b> mackerel sharks, nurse sharks, requiem sharks, dog sharks and hammerheads, among others, and the lobe finned coelacanth. Some species of rockfish (Sebastes) and sculpins (Comephoridae) produce rather weak larvae with no egg membrane and are also, by definition, ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity occurs in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>sharks</b> only develop two embryos, {{one in each}} uterus. The {{largest and}} strongest embryos consume their {{siblings}} in the womb (intrauterine cannibalism) before each surviving pup is born.
