They are the originals, cast in 1859 in the Victoria Foundry in Ottawa. The larger turbines can generate 40-horse power and the smaller one makes 20-horse power. The turbines could operate all year, because the constant flow of water through the flume never froze.

For example, Monsanto sued the Pilot Grove Cooperative Elevator in Pilot Grove, Missouri, {{which had been}} cleaning conventional seeds for decades before the issuance of the patent that covered genetically engineered seeds. Similarly, a <b>seed</b> <b>cleaner</b> from Indiana, Maurice Parr, was sued by Monsanto for inducing farmers to save seeds in violation of Monsanto’s patent rights. Parr told his customers that cleaning patented seeds for replanting was not infringing activity. The case was settled and in exchange for paying no monetary damages, Parr agreed to an injunction requiring Parr to obtain certification from his clients that their seeds were not Monsanto patented seeds and to advise clients that seed-saving of patented seeds is illegal. Mr. Parr was featured in a documentary, Food, Inc.|$|E

40|$|Context: Noise of {{machines}} in various agro-based industries {{was found to}} be the major occupational hazard for the workers of industries. The predominant noise sources need to be identified and the causes of high noise need to be studied to undertake the appropriate measures to reduce the noise level in one of the major agro-based industries, oil mills. Aims: To identify the predominant noise sources in the workrooms of oil mills. To study the causes of noise in oil mills. To measure the extent of noise exposure of oil mill workers. To examine the response of workers towards noise, so that appropriate measures can be undertaken to minimize the noise exposure. Settings and Design: A noise survey was conducted in the three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India. Materials and Methods: Information like output capacity, size of power source, maintenance condition of the machines and workroom configurations of the oil mills was collected by personal observations and enquiry with the owner of the mill. Using a Sound Level Meter (SLM) (Model- 824, Larson and Davis, USA), equivalent SPL was measured at operator&#x 2032;s ear level in the working zone of the workers near each machine of the mills. In order to study the variation of SPL in the workrooms of the oil mill throughout its operation, equivalent SPL was measured at two appropriate locations of working zone of the workers in each mill. For conducting the noise survey, the guidelines of Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) were followed. Grid points were marked {{on the floor of the}} workroom of the oil mill at a spacing of 1 m x 1 m. SPL at grid points were measured at about 1. 5 m above the floor. The direction of the SLM was towards the nearby noisy source. To increase accuracy, two replications were taken at each grid point. All the data were recorded for 30 sec. At the end of the experiment, data were downloaded to a personal computer. With the help of utility software of Larson and Davis, USA, equivalent SPL and noise spectrum at each reading was obtained. Noise survey map of equivalent SPL was drawn for each oil mill by drawing contour lines on the sketch of the oil mill between the points of equal SPL. The floor area in the oil mill where SPL exceeded 85 dBA was identified from the noise survey map of each oil mill to determine the causes of high level of noise. Subjective assessment was done during the rest period of workers and it was assessed with personal interview with each worker separately. Demographic information, nature of work, working hours, rest period, experience of working in the mill, degree of noise annoyance, activity interference, and psychological and physiological effects of machine noise on the worker were asked during the interview. These details were noted in a structured form. Statistical Analysis Used: Nil. Results: The noise survey conducted in three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India revealed that about 26 &#x 0025; of the total workers were exposed to noise level of more than 85 dBA. Further, 10 &#x 0025; to 30 &#x 0025; floor areas of workrooms, where oil expellers are provided have the SPL of more than 85 dBA. The noise in the oil mills was dominated by low frequency noise. The predominant noise sources in the oil mills were <b>seed</b> <b>cleaner</b> and power transmission system to oil expellers. Poor maintenance {{of machines}} and use of bamboo stick to prevent the fall of belt from misaligned pulleys were the main reason of high noise. Noise emitted by the electric motor, table ghani and oil expellers in all the oil mills was well within 85 dBA. Subjective response indicated that about 63 &#x 0025; of the total workers felt that noise interfered with their conversation. About 16 &#x 0025; each were of the opinion that noise interfered in their work and harmed their hearing. About 5 &#x 0025; of workers stated that the workroom noise gave them headaches. Conclusions: The workers engaged in the workrooms of the oil mills are exposed to high noise, which will have detrimental effect on their health. The poor maintenance of drive system {{was found to be}} the main reason for high noise level...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{caused by}} the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico can be greatly reduced by using natural products, such as cotton, in lieu of synthetics to absorb and recover oil from the ocean. Cotton and many cotton byproducts are much more efficient than synthetics in absorbing oil. Agricultural engineers reported in 1994 that cotton fiber can absorb about 40 times its weight in oil, as compared to synthetics that currently absorb 10 to 20 times their weight. The oil absorbed by cotton along with the cotton itself will degrade naturally in the environment, {{which is not the}} case for synthetics. Additionally, cotton fiber and its fibrous byproducts can be reused to absorb additional oil. Research by agricultural engineer and ASABE Fellow Wm. Stanley Anthony at the U. S. Department of Agriculture (Anthony, 1994) demonstrated that cotton lint absorbs up to 80 times its weight in oil, and cleaned lint cleaner waste can absorb up to 67 times its weight in oil. Gin waste products containing more lint fiber by weight were more effective than those whose composition was dominated by non-lint materials such as hulls and <b>seed</b> cotton <b>cleaner</b> waste. With chemical modifications such as the addition of acetic anhydride, the absorptive capacity can be increased. Furthermore, cotton can be reused through several cycles after removal of absorbed oil although the oil absorption decreases (Deschamps et al., 2003). Based on these reports, lint-containing cotton fiber and fibrous gin waste products appear to be superior to many of the synthetic materials currently being used in the oil cleanup...|$|R
40|$|IPM {{training}} for women Cue: In sub-Saharan Africa, 80 per cent of food crops are grown by women. But while {{women have a}} huge responsibility for food production, they typically have low levels of training in farming methods. As a result, the harvests from their plots are much lower than they should be. There are many reasons why women have tended to receive little training. Extension activities may have focussed on cash crops; women have been restricted from attending because they are looking after babies or small children. But that situation {{does seem to be}} changing. For example, by belonging to a group, women are gaining new opportunities for training. Dr Florence Olubayo is a senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi, and a specialist in crop protection. She spoke to Eric Kadenge about her work with women?s groups to give training in pest management. IN:	?Well I would say in terms ? OUT:	? we need to continue training. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 59 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Florence Olubayo, giving some reasons why {{training for}} Africa?s women farmers in pest management techniques is so important. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Olubayo	Well I would say in terms of now practical IPM it would actually be profitable or it would be advisable if we had training, field training for women groups. Because a lot of women groups are involved in farming activities and knowledge is important and I would like just to cite an example where, through our funded research we have done pest management through farmer field schools and we find that most of the groups that we meet out there are actually women and they are very willing to learn. So an increase in these kind of field trainings, funding for researchers or even university lecturers {{to go out there and}} do field training for women groups in safe pest management, which is really what IPM is about, would be very important for our agriculture. I personally have done that on several crops in terms of training, where we go out there with our actual insects and the pest management options. Even while you train you actually get knowledge from the farmers, how are they coping and you can be able to incorporate this in the research programmes, to be able to validate the kind of methods they are using and then include in IPM packages. Kadenge	Perhaps you could point out maybe one women?s group somewhere that has been very successful in this and what kind of PM you have been working with them on? Olubayo	Now the group that we worked with in Deya and in Jambini, a majority were women and these are groups that grow seed potatoes. Now our programme was mainly on how can they grow safe seed potatoes, because potatoes have a lot of virus problems and these viruses are passed by insects. So we actually went practically to show them what the symptoms look like, what the insect that is passing the virus looks like and how they can manage. Simple methods just like pulling out those that look like they are too affected by the virus therefore it would not be good seed, and that is really a component of IPM, a safe one. And then we were advocating how they can sample the aphid now that they know the insect and how they can tag the plants that are looking healthy enough so that they can continue with the <b>cleaner</b> <b>seed</b> and then eat the potatoes that are coming from the virused plants. And the reception was very good. Why I am saying I can consider this mainly knowledge that went majority to women, because three quarters of these groups were women and they were really excited to be able to know the small insects they see are actually passing a disease which makes them produce less seed and therefore produce less potatoes. So it can be done and I think that it is a very good way of actually taking IPM to the farmers. Kadenge	Now eating the potatoes that are infected does not cause any harm to their bodies? Olubayo	No it does not because it just means the virus is in the latent form in the potato, it has no problem. The only thing is if you plant it then that plant will express the symptoms and you will get less yield. Kadenge	Anything else that you would probably like to share as we wind up this interview? Olubayo	I would just like to say, as a women scientist, I have seen an increase in women getting interested in science in terms of agriculture. And we need to encourage - if we have to increase food production and therefore meet the millennium development goal number one which is food security - we actually need to encourage women to get into these practical sciences, so that when they go out there to the field the encouragement is there, not only for the women who are growing to see that our daughters are actually interested in what we are doing, they want to help us, but also in encouraging young girls to get into the science of agriculture so that we can sustain food production. Because you find that the children in high school tend to think agriculture is a dirty business and yet for any country, if you cannot feed yourself then therefore, even the economy you are talking about will not work. Because first and foremost we have to feed ourselves and IPM is the way forward for managing pests and diseases because you cannot eradicate. We have to think of ways how we can safely reduce the damage caused by diseases and pests because we have to safeguard the environment. And with changing of climate we are likely to get more challenges, so we need to be on our toes and we need capacity. So we need to continue training.
