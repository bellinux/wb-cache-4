40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{economic}} integration {{has led to an}} increased degree of currency substitution in the EU countries, which could bring instability in national money demand functions while an EU-wide money demand function could be more stable. Currency substitution usually takes the form of cross border deposits (CBD), which are not included in the traditional monetary aggregates. Thus, extended monetary aggregates that include the relevant CBDs are defined in this study. In order to investigate the implications of currency substitution for the stability of the demand functions, the traditional and extended monetary aggregates for five EU countries are defined in addition to EU-wide monetary aggregates. The estimated EU-wide demand for extended money appears to be stable suggesting that there is scope for monetary policy at the European level. However, the stability of the area-wide aggregate has been impaired when the relevant CBDs are not included. currency <b>substitution,</b> <b>cross</b> border deposits, extended monetary aggregates, demand for money, vector autoregression...|$|R
40|$|Time {{independent}} quantum scattering calculations {{have been}} carried out on the SN 2 Walden inversion reaction Cl-+CH 3 Cl(v,k) →ClCH 3 (v ′,k′) +Cl-. The two C-Cl stretching degrees of freedom (quantum numbers v and v′) and the azimuthal angle describing the rotation of the CH 3 group (quantum numbers k and k′) are treated explicitly. An infinite order sudden approximation has been introduced using Radau coordinates for the stretching modes. The potential energy surface of Vande Linde and Hase is used. The scattering problem is formulated in hyperspherical coordinates. For the reaction (k= 0 →k′= 0) substitution is observed for initial vibrational excitation with v≥ 2. If the system departs from the collinear reaction pathway (initial rotational excitation) the <b>substitution</b> <b>cross</b> sections are strongly decreased. The state-to-state cross sections σvk→v′k′ are large only for transitions with Δk= 0. The total reaction cross sections σvk for given v vary only slightly at low values of the azimuthal quantum number k and rise for larger values of k. This is explained by multiple (avoided) crossings of the hyperspherical adiabats. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

It was found that male mating behavior is controlled by factors located in the PGM-marked chromosome (which, in other Drosophila species, is part of the X chromosome) and in the Y chromosome. The other chromosomes influence male sexual behavior through their interactions {{with each other and with}} the PGM-marked chromosome, but their overall effect is minor. Female mating behavior is controlled by factors located in the ODH-marked and AMY-marked chromosomes, with the other chromosomes exercising a small additive effect. Hence, the two sex-specific behaviors are under different genetic control. Cytoplasmic origin has no effect on the mating behavior of either sex. There appears to be no correlation between a chromosome's structural diversity (i. e., amounts of inversion polymorphism within a species or numbers of fixed inversions across species) and its contribution to sexual isolation. These findings are in general agreement with those from similar Drosophila studies and may not be specific to the species studied here...|$|R

40|$|The Austrian {{theory of}} the "{{marginal}} use" is restated and extended. It is found that the Austrian concept of marginal utility (as derived from the marginal use) is not dependent on cardinal utility, and indeed is consistent with "intrinsically ordinal" utility. In this system, diminishing (ordinal) marginal utility is an implication of rational choice, rather than an assumption. Examples of the rank-ordering on commodity space, derived from the underlying rank ordering on want-set space {{in conjunction with the}} technological relationship between goods and wants, are given in the cases of independent, rival, and complementary goods. In each case the derived commodity preferences are quasi-concave, which suggests that the Hicksian assumption of quasi-concavity is superfluous. In each case, the Auspitz and Lieben-Edgeworth-Pareto criterion for net complementarity or rivalness emerges. It is shown that while a negative <b>cross</b> <b>substitution</b> elasticity is not a necessary condition for net complementarity, it is a sufficient condition under not very restrictive conditions. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the impact of structurally distinct carboxamides on target site resistance development and to assess possible impact on fitness. We used a UV mutagenesis approach in Mycosphaerella graminicola, a key pathogen of wheat to compare the nature, frequencies and impact of target mutations towards five subclasses of carboxamides. From this screen we identified 27 amino acid substitutions occurring at 18 different positions on the 3 subunits constituting the ubiquinone binding (Qp) site of the enzyme. The nature of <b>substitutions</b> and <b>cross</b> resistance profiles indicated significant differences in the binding interaction to the enzyme across the different inhibitors. Pharmacophore elucidation followed by docking studies in a tridimensional SDH model allowed us to propose rational hypotheses explaining some of the differential behaviors for the first time. Interestingly all the characterized substitutions had a negative impact on enzyme efficiency, however very low levels of enzyme activity appeared to be sufficient for cell survival. In order to explore the impact of mutations on pathogen fitness in vivo and in planta, homologous recombinants were generated for a selection of mutation types. In vivo, in contrast to previous studies performed in yeast and other organisms, SDH mutations did not result in a major increase of reactive oxygen species levels and did not display any significant fitness penalty.

Unfortunately these {{tend to be}} unstable, e. g. to attack by carbonation. Previous work has highlighted the possibility of utilising barium zirconate to provide a chemically stable electrolyte; however such materials are difficult to sinter yielding very high overall resistances.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal direct/indirect tax mix {{in a setting}} where {{individuals}} differ in several unobservable characteristics (productivity and endowments). Tax instruments (income and commodity taxes) are constrained solely by the information structure. It presents general expressions for the optimal commodity tax rates and proves that contrary to Atkinson and Stiglitz's (1976) result, differential commodity taxation remains a useful instrument of optimal tax policy even if preferences are separable between labor and produced goods. The following, more specific, results are also derived. First, when <b>cross</b> <b>substitution</b> effects are small the expressions resemble traditional (many households) Ramsey rules. Second, if differences in endowments are confined {{to some of the}} goods, the tax rate on goods in which endowments are zero is positively related to income elasticity. Finally, in a Cobb-Douglas illustration with two goods, where endowments differ only in good 1 (and are interpreted as "wealth"), the tax on good 2 provides an indirect way to tax the unobservable wealth. It is higher (i) the more significant are the wealth differentials, (ii) the stronger is the correlation between wealth and earning ability and (iii) the larger are the (political) weights attached to low wealth individuals. ...|$|R

It {{deals with the}}ir impact on changes of agricultural producer’s position in a framework of food production systems. Concretely paper deals {{with the problems of}} risk related to milk products pricing distortion due to possibility of substitution milk fat behalf vegetable fat. Together with formation of such a risk, food producers are dealing with the other problem, which is using of the similar product name on the common market of EU. Problem is currently related to using the term “spread butter“, which is denoted as deceive because of harming a butter producers. There is an argument that by the influence of currently used term might be those two products consider as a perfect substitutes, between which arise an elicitation of the <b>cross</b> <b>substitution</b> effect. On the European enlarged market of the food could to several situations occur, particularly if there is an offer of the products of the similar, or even the same product name. This is very often visible on the EU common market, this naturally cause problems especially if the composition of the product and the production technology are completely different. The solution of this problem is linked {{to the question of the}} economical substitution, which is usually related to completely different products. This brings about damage to food producers on the first side, and also a deception of consumer on the second side. The example of such as situation is currently visible on the European dairy market, concretely in the case of dairy products. In this article will be explained the situation linked to problem of the Czech producers of “Spread butter”, which is a traditional Czech product and the producers of the “Traditional butter”. European Commission ruled in producers of “Traditional Favour” favour, which means that it will be no longer possible to sell products, with lower than 39 % of milk fat, under the product name “butter”. From the economic theory is well known [3] GRAVELLE, that substitution effect describes the effects of changes in relative prices on consumption. According to the substitution effect, an increase in price of one good causes a buyer to buy more of the other good, since the first good has become relatively expensive, and vice versa. The buyer substitutes consumption of the second good for consumption of the first. Therefore even a small price change could cause a significant change of the optimal combination in the terms of the quantity of the both commodities (in our case spread butter and traditional butter. <b>Cross</b> <b>substitution</b> effect, retail price, butter, spread butter, agribusiness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of mouse atherosclerotic lesions {{may differ from}} that of humans, and mouse atherosclerotic plaques do not rupture except in some specific locations such as the brachiocephalic artery. Recently, our group {{was the first to}} observe that the amplitudes of in vivo stresses in ApoE-/- mouse aortic atherosclerotic lesions were much lower and differed from those found in a previous work performed on human lesions. In this previous preliminary work, we hypothesized that the plaque mechanical properties (MP) may in turn be responsible for such species differences. However, the limited number of human samples used in our previous comparative study was relevant but not sufficient to broadly validate such hypothesis. Therefore, in this study, we propose an original finite element strategy that reconstructs the in vivo stress/strain (IVS/S) distributions in ApoE-/- artherosclerotic vessels based on <b>cross</b> <b>substitution</b> of ApoE-/- mouse and human plaque components stiffnesses and including residual stress/strain (RS/S). Our results: (1) showed that including RS/S decreases by a factor 2 the amplitude of maximal IVS/S, and more importantly, (2) demonstrated that the MP of the ApoE-/- plaque constituents are mainly responsible for the low level-compared with human-of intraplaque stress in ApoE-/- mouse aortic atherosclerotic lesions (8. 36 ± 2. 63 kPa vs. 182. 25 ± 55. 88 kPa for human).

It is shown that conversion spectrum types are not necessarily distinct, but can completely intergrade, on the criteria of both post-meiotic segregation frequency and direction of correction. Genetic differences between strains in the present work resulted in much interchangeability of spectrum types for the same mutation in different crosses; e. g., from type C in one cross to type B/D type in another cross, although the mutation is presumably of the same molecular type (addition or deletion frame shift, or base <b>substitution)</b> in each <b>cross.</b> These changes of conversion properties for a given mutation in different crosses mean that previous interpretations of spectrum types in terms of specific conversion properties for various molecular types of mutation are inapplicable, or inadequate on their own, to explain the present data.

Because of asymmetric hybrid DNA formation, correction properties may differ from observed conversion properties...|$|R
