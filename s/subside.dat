40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} plan and utilize water {{resources}} of <b>subsided</b> water area, the basic water quality information of <b>subsided</b> water area is needed. fourteen large scaled <b>subsided</b> water areas have been selected in Panji coal mining area of Huainan city, the investigation and sampling have been carried out. Heavy element of water quality has been analyzed and fuzzy synthetic evaluation method {{was used to evaluate}} water environment. The results show that most of the twelve investigated <b>subsided</b> water areas which developed for the fish farming have been polluted already. Only one <b>subsided</b> water area was assessed as class III. Appropriate measures are taken to control <b>subsided</b> water areas of different areas and pollution, then comprehensive development and utilization of water resources can be adopted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{based on}} a new {{definition}} we propose for “urban space ecological compensation” from view of ecology, we summarize the space-time development law of <b>subsided</b> land in Xuzhou mining area, and describe the ecological degradation characters of <b>subsided</b> land and the present status of land-use, obtaining a conclusion that the present reclamation mode can not meet the existing conditions of <b>subsided</b> land, such as large <b>subsided</b> area and dynamic change, large volume of accumulated water, and complex landform. In addition, the standard of reclamation was changed in new reclamation regulation. Therefore, we analyze the internal relation between <b>subsided</b> land and urban space structure {{with the idea of}} urban space ecological compensation and try to discover the great value of ecosystem service function of <b>subsided</b> land, which can help to realize ecological balance of urban space. At last, we put forward a strategy for re-use of <b>subsided</b> land based on the principle of ecological compensation, that is, “the minimal manual intervention” and “the largest ecological efficiency”, in which <b>subsided</b> land is regarded as a new resource that can promote urban-rural harmonious development and sustainable development in mining area...|$|R

5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to <b>subside,</b> and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, his strongest supporter, and the {{adulthood}} of King Rajendra, weakened {{his hold on}} power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa {{responsible for the death}} of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not <b>subside</b> with his death, and the political instability eventually paved way for the establishment of the Rana dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to <b>subside</b> relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E

The route curves back to the northwest as it enters the village of Massena. Just past the village line, NY420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation. The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to <b>subside</b> with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to <b>subside,</b> which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to <b>subside</b> after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} a French {{invasion}} did not <b>subside,</b> but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working {{with the support of}} Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or <b>subside</b> with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, {{the state}} did not {{disintegrate}} and Treniota took over the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claims to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated by Treniota. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas' former servants. His son Vaišvilkas and his brother-in-law Shvarn from Volhynia took over the control in Lithuania. Daumantas was forced to flee to Pskov, was baptized Timofei, ruled successfully from 1266 to 1299 and even became a saint. In 1265 Vaišvilkas, as a Christian, reconciled with the Livonian Order and, without support from Lithuania, the rebellions among the Balts that had been fueled by Treniota began to <b>subside.</b> In 1267 he returned to a monastic life and transferred the Grand Duchy to Shvarn.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{resemble}} several edible species commonly {{consumed by}} humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can {{be confused with the}} edible A. velosa, A. lanei or Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible Agaricus mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (A. phalloides) and destroying angels of Europe (A. virosa) and eastern North America (A. bisporigera), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California. Its principal toxic constituent, α-amanitin, damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise. The initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. These <b>subside</b> temporarily after 2–3days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6–16days post ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to <b>subside</b> and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

5|$|By mid-December, Eisenhower {{had been}} {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began to <b>subside,</b> McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command. Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in Operation Dragoon, but Eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in the Normandy campaign. Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on field army after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting army group. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only {{that he would be}} relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army. On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the Third United States Army, he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat. This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to <b>subside</b> on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to <b>subside.</b> He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
