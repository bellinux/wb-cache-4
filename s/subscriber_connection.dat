The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components. In short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.The system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for <b>subscriber</b> terminal <b>connections</b> to the Internet.In the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky.

40|$|The UK Digital Economy Act 2010 (DEA), which {{comprises}} graduated {{response measures}} {{intended to prevent}} virtual intellectual property (IP) contravention has generated heated debate. While some research has started to investigate the provisions for dealing with online copyright infringement, {{little attention has been}} paid to the fact that technology is fast exceeding the confines of this legislation. Drawing on, inter alia, the provisions of the DEA, a number of online copyright infringement cases and some European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) jurisprudence, this paper evaluates the suitability of the graduated response approach to copyright enforcement where internet subscribers alleged to be unlawfully file-sharing will be disconnected from the internet following increasingly strong warnings. The paper presents the findings of a case law research study of recent graduated response decisions, makes use of information obtained from publicly available sources and discusses a number of possible implications. In particular, it considers whether tracking software technology employed to detect alleged copyright infringers constitutes monitoring of personal internet usage under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and whether detecting an IP address in this manner would be able to establish if any contravention of copyright has occurred. The paper also assesses the deterrent potential of the DEA process and whether in view of the double edge-sword of peer-to-peer technology its online copyright infringement provisions may be deemed proportionate. It suggests that given that as online copyright infringement takes place via non-P 2 P methods P 2 P is similarly employed for non-infringing purposes, in order to strike a fairer balance between the interests of copyright holders and users a global licensing scheme might be a better alternative instead of resorting to tactics, such as, terminating <b>subscribers</b> internet <b>connections.</b> 1...|$|R

Since {{there is a need to}} estimate the transmission speed, we have used MATLAB Web Server to design a simulator of xDSL lines that is available at our web pages. This paper compares simulations with measurement results and proposes a methodology for evaluation of measurements based on the suggestions from Slovak Telecom in connection with the practical introduction of ADSL 2 + technology in 2006. The original analogue telephone lines use xDSL digital systems to a lesser or greater extent. Let us focus on the trend in the metallic access networks field and the potential possibilities for further development. Apart from the evolution of ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) standards the transfer methods for the very high speed VDSL (Very-high-speed Digital Subscriber Line) are being optimized. An ADSL line transmits digital signals at various transfer speeds in opposing directions of transfer. For the connection of larger companies, especially those, which operate their own application and web servers, ADSL connection is not suitable although the SHDSL (Single-pair High-bit-rate Digital <b>Subscriber</b> Line) <b>connection</b> can be used. Allocation of bands for transfer directions downstream and upstream and also the total width of the band is dependent on the ADSL variant given by the ITU-T standard. According to the recommendation of the ITU-T G. 992. 1 today’s systems use a frequency band of up to 1. 104 MHz. The lower part of the spectrum is of course used for telephone channels and for this reason it counts on the coexistence of ADSL in one conduit with the original analogue telephone connection (ADSL/POTS), which is preserved thanks to separation filters (adapter, splitter).

40|$|Abstract—In IPTV networks, channel change latency is a {{major concern}} for {{achieving}} the desired quality of experience at the <b>subscribers.</b> Since IPTV <b>connections</b> are established over limited capacity links, the number of channels available to each subscriber’s use, at any given point in time, is strictly limited. As a direct consequence of this limitation, channel change requests need to go through the IP infrastructure, causing significant, and oftentimes unacceptable, channel switching delays. To minimize this latency, various approaches have been proposed. Among these approaches, server-based approaches are shown to achieve the best latency performance. However, since the server-based approaches typically utilize unicast-based delivery techniques, they are susceptible to introduce significant overhead at the designated servers, leading to scalability related problems. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a semi-distributed, i. e., user-assisted server-based, channel change framework. The proposed approach integrates the capabilities of a dedicated channel change server with that of IPTV subscribers to create a resource-efficient and scalable channel change framework. Through extensive simulations, we showed that the proposed framework can achieve sufficiently low channel change latency values, while significantly improving the servicing capacity of the network when compared to server-based-only channel change policies.

The EDS {{is a member}} of a new family of all-digital switching systems that internally handle data in digital form. To accommodate analog voice and data circuits, conversions between analog and digital formats occur at the system interfaces. The EDS consists of six groups of configuration items: System-level control and monitoring is centralized in the Control and Display Subsystem. Workstations provide subsystem-level control and monitoring. The Central Switching Subsystem, as the primary interface with the range environment, provides system connectivity to radios, telephone circuits, and communications links to other facilities. It integrates the EDS with links to the Control Room Switching Subsystems. Each Control Room Switching Subsystem connects individual user stations within a Mission Control Room or other localized area. The user equipment element consists of a Subscriber Terminal Unit, Channel Expander, and interface panels for headsets, foot switches, and speakers. The Remote Radio Control Unit optimizes usage of available frequencies, allowing control of tunable radios from the Control and Display Subsystem. *The original name, Edwards Communication Switching System (ECSS) was changed to Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) in 1990. The Site Selection Unit facilitates the handover of voice communications between receiver sites when a long-range test is monitored. The system architecture is based on a central system-level control element, a central switch, multiple subsystem-level control elements, multiple subsystem switches, and end-equipment items that are interconnected through the switch network. The EDS combines multiple voice communications applications in a single system. The system is being expanded to integrate voice and data switching. Its major function is support of multiparty networked voice communications within Mission Control Rooms and between other test participants. Other voice functions are an intercom capability including both Direct Access (hot line) and Indirect Access (dial-up), <b>subscriber</b> loop <b>connections</b> to the base-level telephone exchange, and the Public Switched Network System. Digital interfaces allow integration of ciphertext data and Time Space Position Information data switching functions.

Even in the Sri Lankan context, the telecommunication industry {{has changed dramatically}} since the late 1990 s, statistic show that {{the total number of}} mobile subscribers is now greater than the fixed line subscribers. What was considered a luxury in the 1990 s has become a commodity in 2004, driven by low cost and convenience. This revolution in the communications industry can largely be attributed to Dialog GSM and its policy of low costs, coverage expansion and its leveraging of Value Added Services (VAS). In the current context other operators are attempting to replicate these success factors to increase and develop their businesses. However the criticality of VAS in the success of Dialog GSM has not been fully evaluated and the importance of the role that VAS can play for the growth of other operators needs to be ascertained. The {{mobile telecommunications}} industry in Sri Lanka is approaching an era where mobile subscribers are learning that mobile phones can do more than facilitate making a simple call. They have identified that there is a "value" in mobile VAS. More and more subscribers are attracted to mobile network operators due to their VAS offering, even if they do not use all these services. Mobile network operators are capitalizing on this fact and are using VAS to create more connections within their networks. But the effectiveness and significance of VAS in attracting a new <b>subscriber</b> or <b>connection</b> has not been investigated VAS is primarily centered on the most prominent services offered by the network operators, which include Short Message Service (SMS); SMS based services, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). However, the term VAS in the telecommunications industry applies to a host of less prominent and well-known technologies. Including all these diverse services in this research project would prevent presentation of a cohesive, concise and usable research paper.

The research used a sample consisting of using early adopters and trendsetters to provide an indication of the likely direction of VAS in the future. The research investigated the influence VAS has on different perspectives of the mobile market including usage, awareness, quality of service and social influences on the subscriber, to evaluate the state of the mobile VAS market.

Since the cost is the main inhibiting factor, any technical solution for access in sparsely populated rural areas has to be reliable, efficient, and deployable at low-cost. This thesis studies the utilization of Multihop Wireless Networks (MWN) as an appealing alternative for rural communication. MWN are designed with a self-configuring capability and can adapt to the addition or removal of network radio units (nodes). This makes them simple to install, allowing unskilled users to set up the network quickly. To increase the performance and cost-efficiency, this thesis focuses on the use of Advanced Antenna Systems (AAS) in rural access networks. AAS promise to increase the overall capacity in MWN, improving the link quality while suppressing or reducing the multiple access interference. To effectively exploit the capabilities of AAS, a proper design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols is needed. Hence, the results of system level studies into MAC protocols and AAS are presented in this thesis. Two different MAC protocols are examined: Spatial Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) and Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with handshaking. The effects of utilizing advanced antennas on the end-to-end network throughput and packet delay are analyzed with routing, power control and adaptive transmission data rate control separately and in combination. Many of the STDMA-related research questions addressed in this thesis are posed as nonlinear optimization problems that are solved by the technique called "column generation" to create the transmission schedule using AAS. However, as finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive, we also introduce low-complexity algorithms that, while simpler, yield reasonable results close to the optimal solution. Although STDMA {{has been found to be}} very efficient and fair, one potential drawback is that it may adapt slower than a distributed approach like CSMA/CA to network changes produced e. g. by traffic variations and time-variant channel conditions. In CSMA/CA, nodes make their own decisions based on partial network information and the handshaking procedure allows the use of AAS at the transmitter and the receiver. How to effectively use AAS in CSMA/CA with handshaking is addressed in this thesis. Different beam selection policies using switched beam antenna systems are investigated. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed techniques can be applied in a rural access scenario in Nicaragua. The result of a user-deployed MWN for Internet access shows that the supported aggregated end-to-end rate is higher than an Asymmetric Digital <b>Subscriber</b> Line (ADSL) <b>connection.</b> QC 2010090...|$|R
40|$|Connectedness to the {{internet}} is a matter that is important for Australians in order to engage in educational activities, access information and tele-communicate, writes Gerry White in DERN. Today, there are many points of access to {{the internet}} such as desktop computers, laptops, mobiles, tablets and other processing devices. The methods of connection are as diverse, with a range of methods for fixed line access and wireless access. Wireless access could include satellite, fixed wireless, mobile wireless, via datacard, dongle, USB modem or tablet SIM and other wireless broadband, suggests the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). In a recently released report on Internet Activity in Australia, June 2011 by the ABS the number of ‘mobile wireless internet (excluding mobile handset) connections (44 %) now exceed Digital <b>Subscriber</b> Line (DSL) <b>connections</b> (41 %) in Australia’ (p. 2). This finding excludes mobile handsets but the fact that some mobile handsets can act as internet conduits for wireless internet connections complicates matters further. Something to bear in mind in this discussion is that wireless connections {{to the internet}} frequently require fixed line infrastructure. However, what is not ambiguous is that Australians are moving towards mobile internet access using a variety of methods. Another finding which indicates an important movement is that 95 % of internet connections (p. 1) are broadband and Australians are increasingly accessing faster download speeds (p. 1). The advent of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is timely, especially for education which, as has been reported previously on DERN, is the main internet activity for 5 to 14 year olds, both at school and out of school. Australians {{in the last six months}} used fixed line internet connections to download 255 Terabytes of data which represents 92 % of the total download, as opposed to wireless downloads (8 %). When mobile phones are included, of which there has been an 18. 1 % increase since December 2010, then the volume of data downloads would increase by a further 3. 7 Terabytes. In fact, 37 % of mobile handsets ‘were dedicated to data subscriptions’ (p. 4). These findings in Internet Activity in Australia, June 2011 from the ABS, based on information reported by ISPs, about the internet activities of Australians, have some relevance to education in terms of broadband, mobile devices and download facilities in places where learners engage in education. As the types of devices grow more diverse, the methods for accessing the internet expand and internet activity increases, then educational connectivity may need to become more mobile and more versatile.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the different challenges a telecommunications company would face {{when trying to}} implement an HDTV video service over a Digital <b>Subscriber</b> Line (DSL) <b>connection.</b> Each challenge is discussed in detail and a technology, protocol, or method is suggested to overcome that particular challenge. One {{of the biggest challenges}} is creating a network architecture that can provide enough bandwidth to support video over a network that was originally designed for voice traffic. The majority of the network connections to a customer premises in a telephony network consists of a copper pair. This type of connection is not optimal for high bandwidth services. This limitation can be overcome using Gigabit Ethernet (GE) over fiber in the core part of the network and VDSL 2 in the access part of the network. For the purposes of this document, the core portion of the network is considered to be an area equal to several counties or approximately 50 miles in radius. The core network starts at the primary central office (CO) and spreads out to central offices in suburbs and small towns. The primary central office is a central point in the telecom operator 2 ̆ 7 s network. Large trunks are propagated from the primary central office to smaller central offices making up the core network. The access portion of the network is considered to be an area within a suburb or small town from the central office to a subscriber 2 ̆ 7 s home. Appendix A, located on page 60, contains a network diagram illustrating the scope of each of the different portions of the network. Considerations must also be given for the internal network to the residence such as category 5 (Cat 5) cable or higher grade and network equipment that can provide up to 30 Megabits per second (Mbps) connections or throughput. The equipment in the telecommunications network also plays a part in meeting the challenge of 30 Mbps bandwidth. GE switches should be used with single mode fiber optic cable in the core part of the network. Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAM) with the capability to filter Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) messages should be used in the access part of the network to facilitate bandwidth utilization. Placement of this equipment and how the data is aggregated is another issue to consider when implementing HDTV service. Another major challenge facing the implementation of HDTV over DSL networks is controlling quality of service (QoS) throughout the network. Class of Service (CoS) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is a method of QoS that would enable video packets to have a higher priority and less delay than other data packets. The consumer could have data, video, and voice traffic all over the same DSL connection. Data, video and voice packets would need to have a different priority in order to maintain appropriate QoS levels for each service. The use of advanced technology in video encoding will be essential {{to the success of the}} video service. MPEG- 2, MPEG- 4, and Windows Media 9 are just a few of the video encoding technologies that could be used to reduce the necessary bandwidth for HDTV. The advancement of this technology is essential to allow telecommunications providers to offer HDTV. Another challenge for the telecom operator concerns the security of the network and service after implementation. Theft of service will be another area that the telecomm operator will be forced to resolve. The cable operators currently face this issue and lose millions of dollars in revenue. Authentication, IP filtering and MAC address blocking are a few possible solutions to this problem...|$|R
