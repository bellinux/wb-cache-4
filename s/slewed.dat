5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then <b>slewed</b> broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty {{announced}} that Vanguard would be scrapped, {{as she was}} considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain for Â£560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship {{was scheduled to be}} towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she <b>slewed</b> across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically <b>slewed</b> to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E

25|$|Further changes {{occurred}} when the City Loop was built. In addition to the relocation of the electrical substation, numerous tracks at Richmond Junction needed to be relocated {{to make room for}} the ramps descending into the tunnel, and tracks in the yard itself were <b>slewed</b> as work progressed on the cut and cover tunnels. The Metrol train control complex was also constructed beside the yards on Batman Avenue, to control the loop as well as to replace the five Flinders Street signal boxes. During construction the public discovered that the building would block the view from Russell Street to the Botanic Gardens and Government House, and that it had occurred due to no planning permit being applied for. State Premier Rupert Hamer responded to public outrage and instructed the half built building to be demolished, and instructed all government departments that they must apply for planning permits, whether they were legally needed or not. The building was redesigned to be lower and resulting in completion being delayed until early 1980.|$|E

500|$|Tyler's report led to {{an unusual}} alteration, as it was {{discovered}} that the loading gauge of the line was too small.

Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.1 suffered from excessive [...] "vertical motion" [...] and No.2 was said to suffer from [...] "horizontal oscillation". No.1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the springs on No.2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.|$|E

500|$|In October 1946, the Southern Railway {{announced}} a programme to electrify all lines in Kent and East Sussex in three stages. The Hastings line between Tonbridge and Bopeep Junction {{was to be}} part of the third stage. Track would have been <b>slewed</b> within the affected tunnels with only one train normally allowed in the tunnel. In an emergency, two trains would be allowed in the tunnel at the same time, but restricted to [...] Standard [...] wide stock would be used. Following the nationalisation of railways in the United Kingdom under the Transport Act 1947, the Southern Region of British Railways shelved new electrification schemes, concentrating on the construction of new steam locomotives. In 1952, the possibility of operating standard rolling stock on the line had been examined. The Operating Department objected to the use of single line sections through the various tunnels. The 1930s stock was refurbished with the aim of extending its service by a further ten years. The first two phases of the Southern Railways' electrification scheme were revived in 1955. This did not include the Hastings line and it was announced in 1956 that a fleet of diesel-electric trains would be constructed to operate the service until the line was electrified. At that time, the rolling stock built in the 1930s was overdue for replacement. The modernisation to the Hastings line and the introduction of the diesel-electric trains cost Â£797,000, [...] of which Â£595,000 was the cost of the first seven trains.

40|$|The working {{state of}} {{equipments}} such as wind turbines, cranes, and excavators is {{directly affected by}} the damage of the <b>slewing</b> bearing. Condition monitoring system is a good method to identify the defects; however, the measuring range and distribution of the sensors have important influence on the monitoring efficacy. Due to the thin-wall and cyclic structure characteristics of a <b>slewing</b> bearing, the defect characteristic response is unusual and unknown. To solve this problem, a finite element model for local defect on the raceway of a <b>slewing</b> bearing was established by ABAQUS, and the operating process of the <b>slewing</b> bearing was simulated based on the explicit dynamic finite element algorithm. The pulse waveforms of vibration responses under different defect sizes are obtained, and the influencing mechanism of the damage sizes on the <b>slewing</b> bearing was studied. The simulation {{results show that the}} increase in defect length is the dominant influence on the operation of a <b>slewing</b> bearing and the effect of height is negligible under the same conditions. Furthermore, the explicit dynamic finite element analysis model was reasonable by comparing the simulation results with the test results. Therefore, the localized defect on the raceway surface of a <b>slewing</b> bearing can be reflected by finite element simulation analysis, and the analytical results can help develop the raceway damage monitoring system of a <b>slewing</b> bearing...|$|R
