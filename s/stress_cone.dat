40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) {{cable termination}} {{is an important}} component of the HTS cable system, which functions to connect the HTS cable and the conventional cable accessory. The stress cones of the HTS cable termination can improve the internal electric field distribution and the electrical insulation strength of the cable termination. In this paper, the mathematical model and equivalent circuit model of the stress cones are built and the genetic algorithm is adopted to the design of 110 -kV HTS cable terminal <b>stress</b> <b>cone.</b> The capacitance, radial electric field, axial electric field, voltage, insulation thickness and other parameters of the <b>stress</b> <b>cone</b> were compared before and after the optimization of the <b>stress</b> <b>cone.</b> Finally, the simulations of the <b>stress</b> <b>cone</b> with the optimized structure were made using finite-element analysis software COMSOL to test the optimization result...|$|E
40|$|High {{voltage cable}} {{terminations}} {{are widely used}} in power system networks. A proper design of cable termination is essential in reducing the electric field distribution {{around the end of}} high voltage cable. However, if there are defects exist at cable termination structure, the electric field can be enhanced significantly and can be the source of electrical discharges. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the effect of defects on the electric field distribution at cable terminations. In this work, a 132 kV XLPE outdoor cable termination has been modelled using finite element analysis (FEA) method. The model has been used to simulate the electric field distribution in the cable termination in the presence of defects. Defects that have been considered are void defect in porcelain, <b>stress</b> <b>cone</b> and fluid, sharp pin on the porcelain surface and delamination defect between the insulator and the <b>stress</b> <b>cone.</b> The effect of different void location, material dielectric constant and porcelain radius on the electric field magnitude at cable termination have also been investigated. From the results obtained in this work, a better understanding of the electric field distribution at the cable termination with defects can be attained...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} field distributions in high voltage direct current cable termination are investigated with silicone rubber nanocomposite being the electric stress control insulator. The nanocomposite {{is composed of}} silicone rubber, nanoscale carbon black and graphitic carbon. The experimental {{results show that the}} physical parameters of the nanocomposite, such as thermal activation energy and nonlinearity-relevant coefficient, can be manipulated by varying the proportion of the nanoscale fillers. The numerical simulation shows that safe {{electric field}} distribution calls for certain parametric region of the thermal activation energy and nonlinearity-relevant coefficient. Outside the safe parametric region, local maximum of electric field strength around the <b>stress</b> <b>cone</b> appears in the termination insulator, enhancing the breakdown of the cable termination. In the presence of the temperature gradient, thermal activation energy and nonlinearity-relevant coefficient work as complementary factors to produce a reasonable electric field distribution. The field maximum in the termination insulator show complicate variation in the transient processes. The stationary field distribution favors the increase of the nonlinearity-relevant coefficient; for the transient field distribution in the process of negative lighting impulse, however, an optimized value of the nonlinearity-relevant coefficient is necessary to equalize the electric field in the termination...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} control the {{equipotential}} lines (that is {{to control the}} electric field) a device is used that is called a stress-cone, see figure 3. The crux of stress relief is to flare the shield end along a logarithmic curve. Before 1960, the <b>stress</b> <b>cones</b> were handmade using tape—after the cable was installed. These were protected by potheads, so named because a potting compound/dielectric was poured around the tape inside a metal/ porcelain body insulators. About 1960, preformed terminations were developed consisting of a rubber or elastomer body that is stretched over the cable end. On this rubber-like body R a shield electrode is applied that spreads the equipotential lines to guarantee a low electric field.|$|R

This technique was patented by Martin Hochstadter in 1916; the shield is sometimes called a Hochstadter shield. The individual conductor shields of a cable {{are connected to the}} ground at the ends of the shield, and at splices. <b>Stress</b> relief <b>cones</b> are applied at the shield ends.|$|R

40|$|High-power voltage sourced converters(VSC’s) are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in modern transmission systems. These systems primarily use switching schemes generating kHz range harmonics, which may be magnified {{by one or more}} system resonances. Despite the high frequency harmonics, VSC systems widely use insulated equipment designed for operation at power frequencies; this includes critical substation components such as medium voltage polymeric cables and terminations. The stress grading systems of non-geometric (compact) cable terminations are susceptible to insulation degradation and eventual flashover failure, under high frequency harmonic stresses. As such, the present work studies high frequency voltage effects in cross-linked polyethylene cable terminations, and their relationship to stress grading (SG) design and material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) has been used to analyze electric field and resistive heating in termination designs, in response to parametric variations in SG material properties. Experimental studies investigate thermal behaviour in a variety of commercial termination designs, using a high voltage, high frequency test setup developed to replicate conditions of high frequency harmonic resonance in a VSC system. The study results show that high frequency voltage application increases the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise, in non-geometric (compact) termination designs using field-dependant stress grading materials. Geometric (<b>stress</b> <b>cone)</b> designs are insensitive to high frequency harmonics; however, they have disadvantages compared to compact designs, making them a less practical long-term solution for high frequency applications. Among non-geometric designs, the field-dependent electrical conductivity σ (E), the permittivity ε, and the temperature dependencies of σ (E) and ε strongly influence the termination electrical and thermal behaviour under high frequency stress. Since thermal hotspots in cable termination SG areas may lead to material degradation and eventual failure, recommendations are made for an optimal non-geometric stress grading design, for terminations operating in environments where high frequency harmonics may be present...|$|E
50|$|Medium and {{high-voltage}} power cables, in circuits over 2000 volts, {{usually have}} a shield layer of copper or aluminium tape or conducting polymer. If an unshielded insulated cable is in contact with earth or a grounded object, the electrostatic field around the conductor will be concentrated at the contact point, resulting in corona discharge, and eventual destruction of the insulation. Leakage current and capacitive current through the insulation presents a danger of electrical shock. The grounded shield equalizes electrical stress around the conductor, diverts any leakage current to ground. <b>Stress</b> relief <b>cones</b> should be applied at the shield ends, especially for cables operating at more than 2 kV to earth.|$|R

Most spectacularly, stress chains may bend back and transmit forces oppositely to the original direction. None of these phenomena arises in solutions for uniform media in Cartesian coordinates.

They also shed light on, and are supported by, hitherto unexplained experimental observations of curved and back-bending chains, which we point out.

40|$|Earlier {{research}} {{performed on}} axially loaded concrete prisms shows that crack widths close to reinforcement are smaller and {{less dependent on}} concrete cover than crack widths at the concrete surface. To check practical applicability of these results a similar experimental investigation of cracking behaviour has been undertaken for beams loaded in bending. The influence of steel stress and concrete cover on crack widths close to the reinforcement and at the concrete surface has been investigated. The {{results show that the}} main features of cracking behaviour for axially loaded prisms and beams are similar. Beams resemble axially loaded prisms in that cone-shaped concrete failure occurs in the bond zone where the bar meets a crack. At higher steel <b>stresses</b> this concrete <b>cone</b> follows the displacement. For this reason crack widths close to the bar are significantly smaller and much less affected by the thickness of concrete cover than at the concrete surface. Surface crack widths consequently are poor indicators of the potential for exposure to corrosive attacks on reinforcement and current design methods can be counter-productive for service life of concrete structures.

The average stress field hasstrong maxima on the sides of the growth cone, directed inward towardthe growth cone neck. This pattern represents a contractile stresscontained within the growth cone, and a net force that is balanced bythe axon tension. Using high time-resolution measurements of the growthcone traction stresses, we show that the stress field is composed offluctuating local stress peaks, with a large number peaks that live fora short time, a population of peaks whose lifetime distribution followsan exponential decay, and a small number of very long-lived peaks.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of eruptive vents around volcanoes can be complex and evolve as a volcano grows. Observations of vent distribution at contrasting volcanoes, from scoria cones to large shields, show that peripheral eruptive vents concentrate close to the volcano base. We use analogue experiments to explore the control of volcano load on magma ascent and on vent location. Results show that the local loading stress field favors eruption of rising magma away from the volcano summit if a central conduit is not established or is blocked. Two sets of scaled experiments are developed with contrasting rheological properties to analyze similarities and differences in simulated magma rise below a volcano: (1) Golden syrup (magma analogue) is injected into a sand-plaster mixed layer (crust analogue) under a cone; (2) water or air (magma analogues) is injected into gelatin under a sand cone. Rising dykes approaching the <b>cone</b> <b>stress</b> field are stopped by the load compressive stress. With continued intrusion, dyke overpressure builds up; dykes extend laterally until their tips are able to rise vertically again and to erupt in the flank or {{at the base of}} the volcano. Lateral offset of the extrusion point relative to the edifice summit depends on substratum thickness, volcano slope, and dyke overpressure. The 3 D geometry of Golden syrup intrusions varies with experimental parameters from cylindrical conduits to dyke and sill complexes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{developing}} Drosophila bristles {{two species}} of cross-linker, the forked proteins and fascin, connect adjacent actin filaments into bundles. Bundles form in three phases: (a) tiny bundles appear; (b) these bundles aggregate into larger bundles; and (c) the filaments become maximally cross-linked by fascin. In mutants that completely lack forked, aggregation of the bundles does not occur so that the mature bundles consist of � 50 filaments versus � 700 for wild type. If the forked concentration is genetically reduced to half the wild type, aggregation of the tiny bundles occurs but the filaments are poorly ordered albeit with small patches of fascin cross-linked filaments. In mutants containing an excess of forked, all the bundles tend to aggregate and the filaments are maximally crossbridged by fascin. Alternatively, if fascin is absent, phases 1 and Bundles of actin filaments are key components in many eukaryotic cells. Obvious examples include microvilli, the acrosomal process of many invertebrate and lower vertebrate sperm, the stereocilia of the inner ear, the bristles and hairs of Drosophila, the sertoli cells of the testes, the ring canals and nurse cell bundles in insect oocytes, the fertilization <b>cone,</b> <b>stress</b> fibers, filopodia, and growth cones. Studies in the 1970 s and 1980 s focused our attention on the packing of actin filaments into bundles and identified and characterized some of the macromolecular cross-linking components involved. Details on how these cross-linkers were positioned {{in order to maximize}} the packing of actin filaments into bundles—no small feat as each actin filament is a helical polymer—followed and are reviewed by DeRosier and Tilney (1982).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the measurement and modelling {{of the fire}} reaction and resistance properties of fibre glass polyester and vinyl ester composite laminates. A new small-scale loading frame was designed and fabricated to apply tensile and compressive <b>stresses</b> in a <b>cone</b> calorimeter under a constant heat flux of 75 kW/m 2. It was found, for the first time, that stress has a small but {{significant effect on the}} fire reaction properties. Increasing tensile stress increased heat release rate and smoke production, while shortening the time-to-ignition. Compressive stress had the reverse effect. This was attributed to the fact that tensile stress promotes the formation of matrix microcracks, facilitating the evolution of flammable volatiles. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that stress has the greatest effect on the early heat and smoke release peaks, with a lower effect on the final `run-out' values. Another new small scale testing rig was developed along with a calibrated conical radiant heater, which resembles the cone calorimeter's heater, to allow testing composite laminates at high tensile and compressive stresses. Stress rupture (time-to-failure) curves were produced. It was shown that, in tension, the behaviour was fibre dominated, with failure times roughly ten times those in compression. Compressive failure involved resin dominated local fibre kinking initiated near the cold face and was controlled by the matrix glass transition temperature. The existing thermal model was upgraded to include the mass flux effect into the net total energy on the hot face of the composite laminate at flashover. This novel approach has resulted in very good predictions of the most important fire reaction properties obtained from the cone calorimeter such as time-to-ignition, mass loss rate, heat release rate and flame-out time. In addition, the predicted temperature and resin content profiles combined with the temperature dependent properties values were used to model the failure times by applying a suitable empirical relationship. Good agreement was found. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceLibyan Higher Education Secretary : Culture Affairs Department of the Libyan People's Bureau, LondonGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|When {{cultivated}} {{properly in}} bioreactors, microalgae {{have been found}} to produce vast amounts of biomass. In the case of diatom cultivation where the organisms will fall out of suspension quite easily, paddle wheels or pumps are the primary means to maintain the necessary velocity in the raceway. This study will focus on the potentially harmful shear stress these devices may impart onto the organisms. The system used to impart shear stress to a diatom culture was a cone and plate viscometer. Cells were counted using a fluorescein diacetate staining method with a fluorescent and brightfield microscope. Under the white light all cells were visible while only the healthy cells were visible under fluorescent light. The sample was exposed to shear <b>stress</b> with the <b>cone</b> and plate viscometer at 6 Pascals for 10 minutes and compared against a non-sheared sample. For each sample, 5 pairs of white and fluorescent light images were captured, counted, and averaged. A non-sheared sample was paired with a sheared sample to calculate the decrease in cell viability. The slope was calculated from the plot of shear stress and cell viability for 9 strains. In each case shear stress resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability; however, there was no statistical difference between strains. While effective, this method would be impractical for a commercial algae cultivation facility as the viscometer in this study costs approximately $ 100, 000. Therefore, tests were performed to determine if a rotary mixer could be substituted for the viscometer. The hypothesis was that the cell damage was a product of shear stress and exposure time. For the viscometer test, the shear exposure was 3600 Pa s. Two rotational mixer tests were performed, one at 1250 RPM for 7 hours and one at 313 RPM for 28 hours, providing the same 3600 Pa s shear exposure. After staining, cell viability decreased 35. 62 % and 11. 07 % in the 1250 RPM and 313 RPM test, respectively. This difference was significant compared to the 6. 04 % decrease in the viscometer test.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{evaluation}} of the limit values which are stated in CUR 236 – Micropiles is presented. This evaluation has been done by means of a dataset. The dataset contained information on failure tests performed on four different types of micropiles, and was initially used for research on relations between logged installation aspects and the final capacity of the piles; such relations were however not found. This was mainly caused by the shape in which the data was logged, and the lack of details in the data. During this research, significant differences between raw data and data adapted according the limit values stated in CUR 236, were found. This led to a change in research direction towards the evaluation of the limit values. Limit values are values that are used to build in additional safety in a design, and thus, to prevent unsafe situations. The values are based on the shape of data in which in general a linear relation between maximum mobilized shear <b>stresses</b> (τ_(mob;max)) and <b>cone</b> resistance (q_c). This relation continues up to a certain cone resistance level, after which τ_(mob;max) does not increase significantly anymore. The point where no significant increase in τ_(mob;max) over q_c was seen, was used as the limit value for the cone resistance. The limit for α_t was chosen to be 2. 5 % and the limit for τ_(mob;max) 2. 5 % of the cone resistance limit. Data with values above these limits, has to be reduced to the limit values. (CUR 236, 2011) Differences were thus found between raw data, the same data but then adapted according the limit value method stated in CUR 236, and values stated in CUR 236 Table 6. 1. For further investigation on how these differences were caused, the available dataset was combined with data from the appendix ‘Bijlage A. Proefbelastingen’ of CUR 236. This showed that the current limit values did not suit the shape of the data very well. Investigation on the usefulness of the limit values showed that they are useful for the design process by preventing under- and overestimations of the capacity. Limit values are thus useful, but not in their current form. New limit values were therefore proposed based on a statistical analysis of the available data points. Next to limit values, also design values (expectancy and lower bound) are added. Because no detailed data for all micropile types was available, it is advised to re-elaborate the limit- and design values for the types that were left out of the proposal given in this thesis, in a similar, statistical way. Furthermore is it advised to investigate a different method to estimate the shear stresses that can be mobilized along the anchor body of a micropile, based on a more fundamental approach. Currently are those stresses often based on full-scale tests from which τ_(mob;max) is derived, but bounded by the limit values. A different approach to this might be more time- and cost-effective.
