5|$|Depression Quest is an {{interactive}} fiction game, which presents descriptions of various situations and prompts the player {{to choose their}} response. In addition, most pages feature a set of <b>still</b> <b>images</b> and atmospheric music. The game has over 40,000 words of text, and multiple possible endings.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} film, the film's {{marketers}} continued the trend established during Skyfalls production of releasing <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of clapperboards and video blogs on Eon's official social media accounts. 17 brands {{appear in the}} film through product placement, and many of those, such as Heineken, Bollinger, Omega and Sony – owner of the film's co-distributor Columbia Pictures – did Spectre tie-in advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of <b>still</b> <b>images,</b> but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E

5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, {{performed}} four dives in two days. Its key aims were {{to assess the}} current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic were also a key focus of investigation. The second expedition, from 27 May– 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and stereoscopic <b>still</b> <b>images.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The Gold Rush, a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of <b>still</b> <b>images</b> into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E

5|$|On February 21, 2014, junior Brunson scored 57 {{points in}} a double {{overtime}} victory over Lake Forest High School. The performance gave him both the school single-game and career scoring records. On March 21, Brunson set the IHSA playoff single game scoring record against the Jahlil Okafor-led Whitney Young High School by scoring 56 {{points in a}} 7568 state playoff semifinal loss. In the game, <b>still</b> <b>images</b> of a movement by Brunson {{appeared to be an}} obscene gesture, but video of the gesture were deemed to be inconclusive and an initial suspension for the subsequent consolation game was overturned. Brunson averaged 26.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.9 steals for a Stevenson team that finished the season with a 322 record. Two members of his high school team were National Football League athletes' offspring: Matt Morrissey and Cameron Green. Brunson was named Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Illinois as a junior. Following the season, Associated Press named him as the only non-senior on the Class 4A All-state first team that also included Okafor, Cliff Alexander, Tyler Ulis and Sean O'Mara. He finished fourth in the 2014 Illinois Mr. Basketball voting. In April 2014, Illinois, Purdue, Kansas and Villanova had in-home visits. On May 3, 2014, he announced the eight schools that he was considering playing college basketball for: UConn, Michigan State, Illinois, Kansas, Purdue, Villanova, Michigan and Temple. That summer he was the number one rated point guard according to ESPN, although the class had a notable shortage of elite pure point guards. On June 25the day after Jalen won a gold medal at the FIBA Americas Under-18 ChampionshipRick Brunson received an offer as an on-bench assistant coach from Temple. The Temple offer fell through when Rick Brunson was arrested on various charges on July 25, and Temple fell out of the running for Jalen's services. Brunson participated in the July 911 LeBron James Skills Academy. On August 5, he announced official visits to Illinois on August 2931, Villanova on September 46 and then Temple from September 1113 and on August 9, he announced official visits to Michigan State from September 1921 and Purdue on September 2628.|$|E
