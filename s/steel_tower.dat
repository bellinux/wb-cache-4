5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. <b>Steel</b> <b>Tower</b> and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental {{in the development of the}} US weather radar program. The installation consisted of a <b>steel</b> <b>tower</b> supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and box trailers, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|E

25|$|An unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad <b>steel</b> <b>tower</b> {{supported}} by cables, the Skylon was the “Vertical Feature” {{that was an}} abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It had a steel latticework frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller in situ. The architects' design {{was made possible by}} the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The Skylon was scrapped in 1952 on the orders of Winston Churchill, who saw it {{as a symbol of the}} preceding Labour Government. It was demolished and sold for scrap after being toppled into the Thames.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> {{have been}} widely applied in the {{countries}} like the United States and Japan for many years. However, in recent years, China has begun to use <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> in the bridge construction because of the national situation. In this paper, the development, application and related researches of <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> in China are presented. Two tests on the local buckling behaviors of <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> are introduced. Through the tests, the local buckling modes and mechanical characteristics of <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> are summarized and analyzed, and the mechanical behaviors between <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> with different cross sections are also demonstrated. The new achievements have been adopted by the new edition of China highway steel bridge design code. At last, the prospects of <b>steel</b> bridge <b>towers</b> are discussed...|$|R

An explosion of more than [...] would vaporize the steel and make it hard to measure the thermal effects. Even [...] would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment. It was therefore decided not to use it.

40|$|The {{vibrations}} of <b>steel</b> <b>towers</b> {{under the}} action of wind {{have not yet been}} clarifiedcompletely. This paper sets forth the problems of wind forces acting on the <b>steel</b> <b>towers</b> thatare vibrating. Usually, we assume that the design wind load on <b>steel</b> <b>towers</b> is the staticpressure and the structure of tower is perfectly rigid. However, the deformations of structuremay induce additional aerodynamic forces, and the vibrations have a significant effect upon thestress distributions in the structure. The vibration tests on the actual transmission towers are reviewed and as the results,the dynamic force of wind acting on the structure is introduced under the simple assumption. In conclusion, the mathematical analysis on a simple model is made...|$|R

As a community held by fellowship and goodwill, Kingsley has become home to many who love it dearly". In June 1894, a 1,500 gallon water tower was used to pump water. In October 1905, the water tower collapsed so a new <b>steel</b> <b>tower</b> was built in January 1906. In 1915, yet another new water tower was built to replace the 1906 water tower. In 1912, a sewer system and 2,775 feet of pipe were laid. The sewer system was expanded on in 1968.|$|E
500|$|The Gadget was hoisted {{to the top}} of a [...] <b>steel</b> <b>tower.</b> The height {{would give}} a better {{indication}} of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout. The tower stood on four legs that went [...] into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of corrugated iron that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch. A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell. The seven man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.|$|E

Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less nuclear fallout. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of Norris Bradbury at the nearby McDonald Ranch House on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day. Observers included Bush, Chadwick, Conant, Farrell, Fermi, Groves, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Tolman. At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an energy equivalent of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of Trinitite (radioactive glass) in the desert [...] wide.

500|$|The state {{made other}} {{improvements}} in the park, including replacing or removing all of Ricketts' dams. At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949–1950 to replace Ricketts' 1905 timber dam; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to [...] and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond. On April 20, 1958, the 1907 concrete dam at Lake Leigh developed a hole, causing Pennsylvania State Police to evacuate close to 2,000people from the park. Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level, draining the lake. The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish stocked in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek. The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956. The last of Ricketts' dams, at Lake Rose, was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity. The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969. At Grand View the state built a wooden fire tower {{at the site of}} Ricketts' earlier observation tower, then replaced it with a [...] <b>steel</b> <b>tower.</b> The tower is usually closed to the public, but may be visited if it is staffed by a forest fire warden.
