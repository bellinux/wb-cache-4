5|$|Soap bubbles {{have very}} large surface areas {{with very little}} mass. Bubbles in pure water are unstable. The {{addition}} of <b>surfactants,</b> however, can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni effect).

30|$|Equations (1 – 8) in <b>surfactant</b> model depend {{either on}} <b>surfactant</b> {{concentration}} or IFT. These equations {{are applied to}} calculate the key parameters such as capillary pressure, relative permeability, capillary number, water viscosity, and <b>surfactant</b> adsorption using tabled values. There are five different tables in the <b>surfactant</b> input file. Among these input, the <b>surfactant</b> concentration with IFT, viscosity and adsorption tables are the most influential. The IFT versus <b>surfactant</b> concentration table is inserted as in an input parameter and this table is used to calculated capillary pressure, relative permeability, capillary number, water viscosity, and <b>surfactant</b> adsorption. The study uses constant values of viscosity, and adsorption to {{examine the effect of}} IFT values with varying <b>surfactant</b> and alcohol concentrations. As <b>surfactant</b> model in eclipse does not include chemical reaction and phase behavior of <b>surfactant,</b> it gives most likely acceptable results when <b>surfactant</b> and co-surfactant solution concentration and IFT table are given an input. To get good oil recovery, {{it would be better to}} add <b>surfactant</b> losses in designing <b>surfactant</b> flood system by adding more <b>surfactant</b> to make sure the operating <b>surfactant</b> concentration is above the CMC.|$|R
30|$|The IFT between Angsi {{crude oil}} and various <b>surfactant</b> {{concentrations}} are also shown in Fig.  1. The polymeric <b>surfactant</b> showed good results {{in term of}} IFT reduction, where the IFT between the crude oil and <b>surfactant</b> solution could be reduced from 13.6  mN/m to 0.323  mN/m using 0.2  wt% <b>surfactant</b> concentration. As seen in Fig.  1, the IFT reduced drastically upon the addition of <b>surfactant</b> concentration which explains the surface adsorption and aggregative properties of the <b>surfactant.</b> As the <b>surfactant</b> concentration increase, more <b>surfactant</b> molecules will be aggregated at the oil/water interface to form micelle solution. Using the selected <b>surfactant</b> concentration of 0.4  wt%, the IFT decreased to 0.192  mN/m where the IFT was stabilized.|$|R

40|$|The {{rationale}} for <b>surfactant</b> replacement therapy {{in patients with}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is to restore the normal composition of the <b>surfactant</b> system, {{as well as to}} overcome ongoing inactivation of present <b>surfactant.</b> Indeed, <b>surfactant</b> replacement therapy call normalize the composition of the <b>surfactant</b> system and restore its surface activity. which results in restoration of the gas exchange.

40|$|Developmental {{deficiency}} in pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> leads to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants, but all newborns may have impaired <b>surfactant</b> metabolism secondary to lung disease or ventilator induced lung injury. Exogenous <b>surfactant</b> treatment is usually administered {{in conjunction with}} mechanical ventilation. If instead <b>surfactant</b> administration is followed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), the treatment response {{appears to be more}} sustained. The aims of the thesis were to (1) distinguish normal and abnormal <b>surfactant</b> turnover in term and preterm infants using a novel stable isotope technique, (2) determine if high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) decreases <b>surfactant</b> production in preterm infants with RDS, (3) systematically examine stable isotope methodology for in vivo studies of <b>surfactant</b> metabolism (4) follow-up the implementation of INSURE, i. e. <b>surfactant</b> administration during a brief intubation, and (5) experimentally test the hypothesis, that <b>surfactant</b> administration followed by spontaneous breathing improves the treatment response. After an intravenous infusion of stable isotope (13 C) labeled precursors for <b>surfactant</b> phospholipid, the 13 C-enrichment over time was measured in serial tracheal aspirates using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Term infants without lung disease had significantly faster endogenous <b>surfactant</b> turnover compared to preterm infants with RDS. Term infants with severe respiratory failure exhibited disrupted <b>surfactant</b> metabolism and decreased amounts of <b>surfactant</b> phospholipids in tracheal aspirates, suggesting delayed maturity of the <b>surfactant</b> system or impairment from the underlying disease. HFOV versus conventional ventilation did not affect the <b>surfactant</b> metabolic indices in preterm infants with RDS. The method yielded reproducible data and similar <b>surfactant</b> metabolic indices regardless of mass spectrometry instrumentation and the <b>surfactant</b> phospholipid pool being analysed. Fractional catabolic rate, which is tracer independent, is suggested to be the primary measure of <b>surfactant</b> turnover. A retrospective, 10 -year follow-up of all inborn infants with RDS (n= 420, gestational age >= 27 to < 34 weeks) at two Stockholm neonatal units showed that after the implementation of INSURE, the number of infants requiring mechanical ventilation was reduced by 50 %, with no adverse effects on outcome. <b>Surfactant</b> treatment by INSURE resulted in a sustained improvement in oxygenation and a significant reduction in additional <b>surfactant</b> doses. In a preterm rabbit model, animals received radiolabeled <b>surfactant</b> and were randomized to spontaneous breathing or mechanical ventilation. The mechanical ventilation group exhibited impaired tissue association of labeled <b>surfactant,</b> lower dynamic compliance and evidence of <b>surfactant</b> inactivation, consistent with a poorer treatment response. In conclusion, this investigation {{is one of the first}} to describe normal <b>surfactant</b> turnover in vivo in term infants. Severe lung disease in term infants disrupts endogenous <b>surfactant</b> metabolism similar to that of infants with developmental <b>surfactant</b> deficiency. Mode of mechanical ventilation has minimal impact on endogenous <b>surfactant</b> turnover in preterm infants with RDS. However, the treatment response to exogenous <b>surfactant</b> is significantly impaired by mechanical ventilation, both clinically and experimentally. The INSURE strategy for <b>surfactant</b> treatment is a powerful approach to improve the treatment response and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in moderately preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{function}} of pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> {{is affected by}} lung transplantation, contributing to impaired lung transplant function. A decreased amount of <b>surfactant</b> protein-A (SP-A) after reperfusion is believed {{to contribute to the}} impaired <b>surfactant</b> function. <b>Surfactant</b> treatment has been shown to improve lung transplant function, but the effect is variable. We investigated whether SP-A enrichment of <b>surfactant</b> improved the efficacy of <b>surfactant</b> treatment in lung transplantation. Methods. Left and right lungs of Lewis rats, inflated with 50 % O- 2, were stored for 20 hr at 8 degreesC. <b>Surfactant</b> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from right lungs was investigated after storage (n= 6). Left lungs were transplanted into syngeneic recipients and treated with SP-A-deficient <b>surfactant</b> (n= 6) or SP-A-enriched <b>surfactant</b> (n= 6) just before reperfusion. Air was instilled into untreated lung transplants (n= 6). Sham operated (n= 4) and normal (n= 8) animals served as controls. Lung function was measured during 1 hr of reperfusion; <b>surfactant</b> components in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured after reperfusion. Results. After storage the amount of SP-A decreased by 27 %, whereas <b>surfactant</b> phospholipids changed minimally. After reperfusion a further decrease of SP-A was paralleled by profound changes in <b>surfactant</b> phospholipids. Lung transplant function, however, remained relatively good. After instillation of SP-A-enriched <b>surfactant,</b> PO 2 values were reached that approximated sham control PO 2 values, whereas after SP-A-deficient <b>surfactant</b> treatment, the PO 2 values did not improve. Conclusion. Enrichment of <b>surfactant</b> with SP-A for treatment of lung transplants improves the efficacy of <b>surfactant</b> treatment...|$|R
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. <b>Surfactants</b> are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which <b>surfactants</b> bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require <b>surfactants</b> to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
40|$|Nano-sized {{particles}} (NSPs) have {{a diameter}} of less than 100 nm. When inhaled, they preferentially deposit in the deeper lung, where pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> covers the thin aqueous lining layer. Thus, pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> is the initial contact where NSPs impinge. This can lead to various consequences. For example, binding of NSPs to single <b>surfactant</b> components like phospholipids or <b>surfactant</b> proteins can occur, which might modulate toxic particle effects. Moreover, particle clearance can be modulated. Furthermore, the biophysical <b>surfactant</b> function itself can be disturbed by interaction with NSPs. In addition, <b>surfactant</b> displaces particles into the aqueous hypophase of the lining layer, where they can {{come into contact with}} type II pneumocytes. This interaction has been suggested to affect pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> metabolism. The potential interactions of nano-sized particles with the pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> system and the effects on biophysical <b>surfactant</b> function, <b>surfactant</b> metabolism, particle clearance, and on particle-induced toxicity are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary <b>surfactant</b> is a {{lipoprotein}} mixture {{responsible for}} reducing surface {{tension of the}} lung. In this thesis, we investigate the impact of lung injury on <b>surfactant</b> composition and function, with a specific focus on cholesterol content. First, {{the impact of a}} high cholesterol diet on <b>surfactant</b> function was assessed in three models of lung injury. It was hypothesized that serum hypercholesterolemia would increase host susceptibility to <b>surfactant</b> functional impairments. Secondly, the impact of injurious ventilation on intracellular <b>surfactant</b> within the lung was investigated. It was hypothesized injurious ventilation would produce alterations to lamellar body <b>surfactant.</b> Overall, the data suggest that a high cholesterol diet contributes to altered <b>surfactant</b> function during lung injury. Additionally, injurious ventilation promoted functional impairments to intracellular <b>surfactant</b> prior to secretion into the airspaces.

40|$|AbstractPulmonary <b>surfactant</b> is {{composed}} of approx. 90 % lipids and 10 % protein. This review article focusses on the lipid components of <b>surfactant.</b> The first sections will describe the lipid composition of mammalian <b>surfactant</b> and the techniques that have been utilized to study the involvement of these lipids in reducing the surface tension at an air-liquid interface, the main function of pulmonary <b>surfactant.</b> Subsequently, the roles of specific lipids in <b>surfactant</b> will be discussed. For the two main <b>surfactant</b> phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, specific contributions to the overall surface tension reducing properties of <b>surfactant</b> have been indicated. In contrast, {{the role of the}} minor phospholipid components and the neutral lipid fraction of <b>surfactant</b> is less clear and requires further study. Recent technical advances, such as fluorescent microscopic techniques, hold great potential for expanding our knowledge of how <b>surfactant</b> lipids, including some of the minor components, function. Interesting information regarding <b>surfactant</b> lipids has also been obtained in studies evaluating the <b>surfactant</b> system in non-mammalian species. In certain non-mammalian species (and at least one marsupial), <b>surfactant</b> lipid composition, most notably disaturated phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, changes drastically under different conditions such as an alteration in body temperature. The impact of these changes on <b>surfactant</b> function provide insight into the function of these lipids, not only in non-mammalian lungs but also in the <b>surfactant</b> from mammalian species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Avery and Mead {{showed in}} 1959 that {{pulmonary}} <b>surfactant</b> deficiency {{is a major}} factor in the pathophysiology of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In 1980 Fujiwara et al. administered exogenous <b>surfactant</b> for the first time successfully to preterm infants with RDS (2). This was followed by numerous clinical trials that demonstrated a decrease in death rates and complications. There are now accumulating data which suggest that a disturbed <b>surfactant</b> metabolism plays a role in several other neonatal lung diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), <b>surfactant</b> protein-B (SP-B) deficiency, and neonatal pneumonia and/or sepsis.
