25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture {{than they have}} areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, <b>silty</b> <b>loam</b> soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E

50|$|Precambrian {{formations}} of the Daling {{series of}} quartzites and phyllites dominate the area. This rock type is overlain by crystalline Darjeeling Gneiss comprising gneisses and granitoides. Recent alluvium of sandy loam, <b>silty</b> <b>loam</b> and clayey material of varying thickness overlay the rock formations. The {{banks of the}} Rangit River depict silty clay material with large rock blocks. Many land slides are observed in the catchment, which add to the siltation problems of the reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Selecting an {{appropriate}} {{particle size distribution}} (PSD) model for a particular soil may be important for a precise estimation of soil hydraulic properties. Various models have been proposed for describing soil PSDs. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the quality of fitting of eight PSD models (Fredlund, Gompertz, van Genuchten, Jaki, Logarithmic, Exponential, Logarithmic-Exponential and Fractal) in 71 soil samples collected from Lordegan and Saman in Charmahal-va-Bakhtiari province, Iran. Coefficient of determination () and Akaike’s information criterion () were used to compare the goodness-of-fit of the models to the experimental data. Results showed that Fredlund model is best for describing PSD of silt <b>loam,</b> <b>silty</b> clay <b>loam,</b> <b>silty</b> clay and sandy loam soil textures. While Fractal, Exponential and Logarithmic-Exponential models produced the poorest-fit in silt <b>loam,</b> <b>silty</b> clay <b>loam</b> and <b>silty</b> clay, they had the best performance in sandy loam texture. The performance of Fredlund and Gompertz models improved with an increase in clay and silt content from 25 and 40 percentage, respectively. The performance of Fractal, Exponential and Logarithmic-Exponential models improved by increasing the sand content. Reverse correlation was observed between silt content and the performance of the Fractal model...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} migration of N. carpocapsae infective juveniles {{applied to the}} soil surface or introduced 14 cm below the soil surface was studied in four different soil types (pure silica sand, coarse sandy <b>loam,</b> <b>silty</b> clay <b>loam,</b> and clay). The percentage of juveniles able to migrate and infect wax moth pupae placed in the soil decreased {{as the percentage of}} clay and silt increased. Most nematodes placed on the soil surface remained within 2 cm of the surface, but some penetrated to a depth of 10 cm in pure silica sand and coarse sandy loam to infect pupae. Some pupae at the same depth were also infected with nematodes in <b>silty</b> clay <b>loam</b> soil. In pure silica sand and coarse sandy loam, nematodes introduced 14 cm below the soil surface were able to infect wax moth pupae located between 4 and 24 cm. Movement was least in clay soil and limited in <b>silty</b> clay <b>loam.</b> Nematodes showed a tendency to disperse upwards from the point of application. In all cases the number of migrating nematodes was greatest when wax moth pupae were present...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the soils}} in the San Mateo Creek {{drainage}} area are loamy, well-drained and also fertile in the lowlands. In the mountains the soil cover is very shallow {{and there are}} many exposed cliffs, large boulders and outcroppings of sedimentary rock. In the lower watershed are sandy or <b>silty</b> <b>loams</b> which have a clay substructure. These soils are classified as highly fertile and there are a few farms on the foothills and the floodplain of the San Mateo Creek watershed.|$|R
5000|$|The area {{takes it}} {{name from the}} [...] "chalky" [...] white soils of the region. However the soils {{themselves}} do not contain any chalk but rather are composed of a mixture of quartzite abundant volcanic ash, sand and <b>silty</b> <b>loam.</b> The volcanic was emitted into the area by Mount St. Helena over a course of centuries, creating vineyard soils that are not very fertile {{and are able to}} restrain vigor in the vines.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the waters}} of the Tigris and Euphrates above their {{confluence}} are heavily silt- laden, irrigation and fairly frequent flooding deposit large quantities of <b>silty</b> <b>loam</b> in much of the delta area. Windborne silt contributes to the total deposit of sediments. It has been estimated that the delta plains are built up at the rate of nearly twenty centimeters in a century. In some areas, major floods lead to the deposit in temporary lakes of as much as thirty centimeters of mud.|$|E
