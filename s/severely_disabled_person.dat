40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is to describe a Puertorrican working model that integrates recreation {{in the physical education}} curriculum of <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> students. Adapting physical education programs for mildly disabled students poses no great difficulty to most teachers in Puerto Rico, so they receive greater opportunities for integrated recreation in school or in their communities. However, inclusion of physical education programs within the educational or rehabilitative services for <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> students tend to receive minimal priority or none. Most administrators and teachers in Puerto Rico have very low expectations for progress and independence in physical activities of <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> students. Contrastingly, physical education is viewed as the most relevant program for <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> students (Dunn, Morehouse & Fredericks, 1986; Jansma, 1984).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 109 - 123) The Problem. The {{project was}} undertaken {{in an effort}} to evaluate whether extended care facilities (ECFs) or independent living resources have the capacity to adequately provide for the needs of <b>severely</b> physically <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> living in the San Fernando Valley. This research was designed to reveal the method of providing long-term care which allows the individual to achieve his/her maximum potential. Method. A questionnaire was developed to compare 50 disabled individuals who lived at home with support and 50 persons in ECFs. Five need areas: Care, sexuality, education, employment, and transportation, were examined. Comparisons were also made based upon the experience of group members with either extended care facilities or the employment of an assistant. Variables were compared using Chi Square analysis. Purpose. This project proposed to discover possible differences between <b>severely</b> physically <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> living in ECFs and comparably <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> living at home. These differences were likely to occur in any of the five categories mentioned above. It was anticipated that the assessment of differences would reveal whether either group experienced greater need satisfaction. Results. Significant differences were found to exist between the two groups on 32 of the 22 variables. Although some members of the ECF group were left <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> than many <b>persons</b> in the Non-ECF group, more ECF residents had spent long periods of time in a facility. In the areas of assistant services, sexuality, education and employment, members of the ECF group indicated negative experiences and a poor self-image. The availability of transportation for members of the ECF group were so remote that some individuals had lost all hope of ever going outside the institution. Recommendations. The paper makes a number of recommendations including the following: 1. In order to provide optimal independence, home care services must be provided regardless of whether the <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> chooses to live with another person, spouse, alone or some other arrangement. 2. Devices to facilitate independence should be developed and provided at a cost commensurate with the individual's ability to pay. 3. In each locality there should be a pool of pre-screened persons interested in being assistants. 4. Physicians and allied help personnel must be aware of resources where information, counseling and other services are available to <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> 5. In order to expand their minds all physically <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> must have access to a college or university and other cultural establishments. 6. In order to gain a skill, develop experience, achieve self-worth and receive compensation, all <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> must have access to employment. 7.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 2. 8 million {{adults in}} the United States suffer from psychiatric illness that has persisted or is likely to persist over time (National Institute of Mental Health, 1989). Many of these adults who suffer from mental illness are served by the community mental health system. Although case management has emerged as an important service delivery model in community mental health, there exists a very high incidence of staff turnover. Champney (1989) reports an annual turnover rate of 40 % to 60 % among case managers who work in community mental health centers {{in the state of}} Ohio. Fee (1991) has found an annual turnover rate among case managers of about 30 % at one large inner-city community mental health center, at which he is the di rector. There are a number of serious consequences of high turnover among case managers. As Fee (1991) suggests, it takes about six months for many <b>severely</b> mentally <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> to form a meaningful and trusting relationship with a case manager. Because this bonding between a <b>severely</b> mentally <b>disabled</b> client and his or her case manager is so critical, Fee maintains that the frequent turnover of case managers is disastrous in terms of effectiveness of service. Fee (1991) also asserts that dissolving this relationship can sometimes have serious results for a person who is <b>severely</b> mentally <b>disabled,</b> the most extreme result being when the <b>severely</b> mentally <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> deals with the loss by committing suicide.

This study acknowledges the resulting dearth of user consultation data {{as one of the}} gaps and addresses it through utilising a wide user consultation exercise to direct and inform the research and development of Smart Homes. Users stress that the role of technology is to complement and enhance existing living arrangements and cannot act as a substitute to the care and support received from other people, either informally from family and friends or formally from service providers. A technology and design review informed design exercises culminating in the design of smart homes capable of being constructed for <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and those requiring lifetime homes. Internal and external doors, locks and all windows are motorised and a system of sensors and devices share data in order to act, react and interact in an appropriate way. Post-occupancy studies identified that radio frequency remote controllers appear to have performed better than infrared alternatives and that motorised doors are the most frequently used elements in the system, particularly front doors, doors to the garden, and kitchen doors. There have been difficulties experiences in the successful implementation of Smart Homes research and in the successful provision of Smart Homes when using some methods of procurement. These issues are addressed through a survey of the actual procurement methods utilised and their impact on the success of a number of smart home projects across the UK.

Another development to be taken equally seriously stands out for a particular group in this army of unemployed people: unemployed <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> people. These people, too, are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain an adequate position. Besides their disability the loss of a job comes as an additional difficulty for them and is frequently the first step on the path to social isolation.

Against the background of this a project was introduced in Rheinland-Pfalz in 1994 which focuses on the (re) integration of <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> people into working life. In order to achieve this, those participating in the project pursue two different paths. Firstly in the companies, representatives of the disabled and works councils and secondly those responsible for personnel matters and/or personnel managers are contacted and are each offered special support services for the integration of <b>severely</b> <b>disabled</b> people. The effectiveness of these measures is additionally assessed by means of a scientific research parallel to this. What was of interest in the parallel research was first of all which area the integration efforts would affect. For this purpose a total of 4800 companies in four regions were asked to give an assessment of the integration. It is obvious that on the one hand the companies do not see anything in the existing qualifications which would constitute a serious obstacle to considering the recruitment of a <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> On the other hand it is clear that there is a considerable lack of information as to what support services and support opportunities are available for a company when opting to employ a <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> " (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Schwerbehinderte, Arbeitsmarktchancen, Arbeitgeber - Einstellungen, betriebliche Integration, Arbeitssituation, Arbeitslosigkeitsbekämpfung, Qualifikationsanforderungen, Personalpolitik...|$|R
