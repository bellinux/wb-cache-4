5|$|This is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to {{the stance}} taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E

50|$|In {{black-and-white}} still photography, many photographers {{choose to}} shoot in solely black-and-white since the <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> enhance the subject matter.|$|R
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E

50|$|His use of <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> and emotionality is {{credited}} {{to the influence}} of Vincent van Gogh. His characterizations of overemphasized grotesque personalities inspired the expressionist painters.|$|R
50|$|Baujot {{developed}} a distinct style of coloring, involving mixing of shades {{as opposed to}} the standard use of <b>stark,</b> <b>contrasting</b> colors. She would hone her technique throughout the upcoming Tintin projects, the next being Cigars of the Pharaoh (Les Cigares du Pharaon, 1955).|$|R
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E

50|$|Despite Panama's upper-middle {{per capita}} GDP, {{it remains a}} country of <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts.</b> Perpetuated by {{dramatic}} educational disparities, over 25% of Panama's population lived in national poverty in 2013 and 3% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to latest reports by the World Bank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} at Locke High School, where {{the story was}} based, {{as well as at}} other locations in South Central and East Los Angeles.

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
50|$|The galleryrepresents the {{classics}} of the Soviet constructivist photography: Boris Ignatovich,Jakov Khalip, Mikhail Prekhner, whose innovative techniques - unconventionalangles, tilted horizons, <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> {{of light and}} shadow - reveal influenceof their teacher and associate Alexander Rodchenko and recall the formalexperiments of Moholy-Nagy Laszlo and New Objectivity group led by Albert Renger-Patzsch.|$|R
50|$|Sonata No. 4 in four parts (1957) {{contains}} elements of Satie, Shostakovich, even Rachmaninov. Its architectural clarity of form {{is mixed with}} <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts.</b> The first movement opens with three bell-like chords and progresses through an withdrawn, extended pp passage. The fourth movement offers stand-alone polytonal phrases and intervals that's architecture dictates its form.|$|R
5000|$|History {{records the}} horrendous {{aftermath}} of the lovers' catastrophe, events in <b>starkest</b> <b>contrast</b> to the conciliatory tone expressed by Shakespeare's Lords Montague and Capulet on the last page of that play.

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the rate of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The Marble Index is {{the second}} solo album and third studio album by German {{musician}} Nico, which was released in November 1968 on Elektra Records. The avant-garde sound introduced in the album—a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> with her folk pop debut, Chelsea Girl—was {{the result of the}} combination of Nico's droning harmonium and somber vocals, and producer John Cale's musical arrangements, which were inspired by modern European classical music. Nico envisioned the release as an attempt to get artistic legitimacy, thus also drastically changing the looks that had initially made her famous as a fashion model.|$|E
50|$|The scenery around Skaftafell {{is full of}} <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts.</b> The various glacial tongues are {{flanked by}} jagged mountains, with the glacier-topped peak of Hvannadalshnjúkur rising highest. Evidence abounds of the erosive forces exerted by glacial ice and rivers. From {{the time of the}} first sagas, this ice has {{variously}} advanced or retreated, reaching farthest around 1890, since when it has retreated.|$|R
5000|$|The Dandelion War {{combines}} {{elements of}} post-rock and atmospheric indie music. The band's sound relies a <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> between quiet minimalism and colossal crescendos. AbsolutePunk described the band as [...] "sounding like {{what would happen}} if someone melted Explosions In The Sky, Radiohead and The Antlers’ Hospice together." [...] The Dandelion War has also been compared to Sigur Ros and My Morning Jacket.|$|R
25|$|King's {{earliest}} lithographs of 1962 {{were simply}} brilliant, {{not only in}} context of his own work, but within the broader context {{of the art of}} lithography. The use of lithographic crayons, the watery film of touche and the scraping back of surfaces to produce <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> in the surface textures were all properties which were unique to lithography and which King exploited with unerring skill.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> {{to the previous}} year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
50|$|Ferdinand Fleck, notable as {{the first}} German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the {{character}} as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts,</b> {{such as in the}} banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.|$|R

50|$|Several {{decades after}} independence, Thomas Cole started an artistic {{movement}} by painting America's wild and rugged landscapes— especially, at first, the Highlands— with the <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> and shadows they offered, {{in a way}} that suggested raw nature, a world reborn. After the movement had faded, a critic derisively referred to the movement as the Hudson River School; the name stuck as the label for the new nation's first homegrown artistic movement.|$|R
