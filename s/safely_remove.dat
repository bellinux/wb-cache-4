5|$|Luna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville {{join them}} in the forest and all six fly to the Ministry on thestrals, expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises that his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort; however, he finds a glass sphere that bears his and the Dark Lord's names. Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a {{recording}} of a prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort, which is revealed to be the object Voldemort {{has been trying to}} obtain for the whole year, the Dark Lord believing that there was something he missed when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of the prophecies, in this case Harry or Voldemort, can <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> them from the shelves. During a heated fight Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, enter a battle with the Death Eaters, during which Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius and Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him and climatically fights the Dark Lord to a stalemate. In the midst of the duel, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill the boy, then escapes just as Cornelius Fudge appears, finally faced with first-hand evidence that Voldemort has truly returned.|$|E
25|$|The {{process can}} break down organic poisons, due to {{breaking}} chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape {{needed for the}} poison's activity. It {{is likely to be}} highly effective at killing pathogens, including prions. It can also <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> heavy metals from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.|$|E
25|$|Environmental campaigners {{opposed the}} road, from its inception. While {{the road was}} being built some advocates of direct action dug tunnels under Moneymore Cottage and two large {{underground}} bunkers in an adjacent wood named the Greenwood Camp. The camp was {{in the path of}} the road in order to frustrate and delay the work. Peter Faulding, a confined space rescue specialist from Specialist Group International who removed Swampy the anti roads protester from the A30 protest and from the Newbury Bypass tunnels was brought in to <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> a number of protesters tunnelled deep underground. The tunnels were very complex and on different levels in Moneymore Cottage. Operation Encompass as it was called by the police was run by the Under sheriff of Staffordshire Mr John James, the eviction operation ran for fourteen days enabling construction to begin.|$|E

500|$|The highest winds {{associated}} with the storm occurred at Albany, and were clocked at [...] The lowest barometric pressure also occurred at Albany, dropping to 1007.5 mb. A large number counties in western {{parts of the state}} reported downed trees and powerlines, with widespread power outages across the region. In Decatur, a man was killed when a large tree fell onto his bedroom. Near the city of Atlanta, there were closures on two major interstate highways due to high water; at least one bridge was closed south of the city. Also, a tractor trailer overturned on a two-lane road, sending the driver to the hospital and closing the road for several hours. In total, about 55,000customers lost electricity, with 38,000of them being from the Atlanta area. A man also died while working with utility crews to restore power. Also, a large tree fell on a woman's house, trapping her. Emergency crews managed to <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> her, although damage to her home was extensive.|$|E
500|$|Bounty hunter Samus Aran {{explores the}} surface of the planet SR388 with a survey crew from Biologic Space Laboratories (BSL). There, she is {{attacked}} by parasitic organisms known as [...] "X". Samus is unknowingly infected by the parasite, and proceeds to return to the BSL station, when she suddenly loses consciousness and is ejected from her ship before it crashes into a nearby asteroid belt. The Galactic Federation recovers her body and discovers that the X Parasite infected Samus's central nervous system. They counteract the parasite's damage by creating a vaccine made from a remaining cell culture of the infant Metroid that Samus had previously contacted, as the Metroids were the X's main predators on SR388. The vaccine cures Samus and while it gives her the ability to absorb and use the nuclei of X Parasites for nourishment, it also burdens her with the Metroids' vulnerability to cold. Her infected Power Suit is sent to the BSL station for examination, although parts of the suit were too integrated with her body to <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> during surgery, forming a partially armored suit called the Fusion Suit.|$|E
60|$|She {{could now}} <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> her mittens and {{manipulate}} her own feet, with {{the wisdom of}} the initiated, being watchful that the heat of the fire was absorbed slowly. While she did this, he attacked his hands. The snow did not melt nor moisten. Its light crystals were like so much sand. Slowly the stings and pangs of circulation came back into the chilled flesh. Then he tended the fire, unstrapped the light pack from her back, and got out a complete change of foot-gear.|$|E

50|$|Bounds-{{checking}} elimination: Many languages, {{for example}} Java, enforce bounds checking of all array accesses. This is a severe performance bottleneck on certain {{applications such as}} scientific code. Bounds-checking elimination allows the compiler to <b>safely</b> <b>remove</b> bounds checking in many situations where it can determine that the index must fall within valid bounds, for example {{if it is a}} simple loop variable.|$|E

50|$|A new variable, B2, {{has been}} {{declared}} as a copy of B in a new instruction, instruction N. The anti-dependency between 2 and 3 has been removed, meaning that these instructions may now be executed in parallel. However, the modification has introduced a new dependency: instruction 2 is now truly dependent on instruction N, which is truly dependent upon instruction 1. As flow dependencies, these new dependencies are impossible to <b>safely</b> <b>remove.</b>|$|E
