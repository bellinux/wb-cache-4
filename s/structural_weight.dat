5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's <b>structural</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

50|$|Aircraft {{have two}} major types of weight limits: the maximum takeoff weight and the maximum <b>structural</b> landing <b>weight,</b> with the maximum <b>structural</b> landing <b>weight</b> almost always being the lower of the two. This allows an {{aircraft}} on a normal, routine flight {{to take off}} at the higher weight, consume fuel en route, and arrive at a lower weight. There are other variables involving takeoff and landing weights, but they are omitted from this article {{for the sake of}} simplicity.|$|R
40|$|Future {{missions}} {{to the moon}} and Mars have been investigated with regard to propulsion system selection. The results of this analysis show that near state-of-the-art LO 2 /LH 2 propulsion technology provides a feasible means of performing lunar missions and trans-Mars injections. In other words, existing cryogenic space engines with certain modifications and product improvements would be suitable for these missions. In addition, present day cryogenic system tankage and <b>structural</b> <b>weights</b> appear to scale reasonably when sizing for large payload and high energy missions such as sending men to Mars...|$|R
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
25|$|The Lavi {{employed}} a mainly traditional airframe, {{the majority of}} development focus being upon the avionics and systems to provide the aircraft's performance edge instead. In {{order to meet the}} low <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> requirements imposed, the use of composite materials was employed in elements such as the wing and its substructure, as well as the fin and the skin. The forward fuselage was shaped in a manner that resulted in it naturally directing air into the engine intake and to avoid inlet blanking while flown at a sideslip condition.|$|E
25|$|Despite its <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> liabilities, the single-tailed {{prototype}} set a speed record over a 100km (60mi) circuit on 1 April 1937 {{by reaching}} 517.84km/h (322mph), taking the record away from France. Another record was obtained on 10 April 1937 when it achieved 475km/h (295mph) over 1,000km (620mi). Piloted by Furio Niclot Doglio, the Ba.88 prototype had two 671kW (900hp) Isotta-Fraschini K 14 engines. This record speed was increased to 554km/h (344mph) when the modified prototype, using a double tail, was re-equipped with the definitive engines; the 746kW (1,000hp) Piaggio P.XI-RC40s. This time it broke German records in a 100km (60mi) stage {{at an average}} speed of 554.4km/h/344.5mph (with 1,000kg/2,200lb load) on 5 December 1937. Finally on 9 December 1937, another world record was set when averaging 524km/h (326mph) over 1,000km (621mi) with a 1,000kg (2,200lb) load.|$|E
40|$|The unique {{challenge}} {{of this concept}} to the structural designer is discussed. The potential of the application of advanced structural design concepts and new titanium fabrication processes is emphasized.

These advantages are now being demonstrated by design, fabrication, and tests of three boron-epoxy reinforced C- 130 E center wing boxes. This structural component was previously redesigned using an aluminum build-up to meet increased severity of fatigue loadings. Direct comparisons of relative <b>structural</b> <b>weights,</b> manufacturing costs, and producibility can therefore be obtained, and the long-time flight service performance of the composite reinforced structure can be evaluated against the wide background of metal reinforced structure...|$|R

Nevertheless, compared to other special interest tourism products, visitor behavior in homestay tourism has been neglected by the literature. This study fills this void by investigating the relationships between perceived value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention, and by examining the moderating influence of psychographics in a homestay tourism context.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{will make}} {{extensive use of}} composites; on the first prototype, composites comprise 25% of the <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> and almost 70% of the outer surface. Weapons are housed in two tandem main weapons bays between the engine nacelles and smaller bulged, triangular-section bays near the wing root. Internal weapons carriage eliminates drag from external stores and enables higher performance compared to external carriage, as well as enhancing stealth. Advanced engines and aerodynamics enable the Su-57 to supercruise, sustained supersonic flight without using afterburners. Combined with a high fuel load, the fighter has a supersonic range of over 1,500km, {{more than twice that}} of the Su-27. In the Su-57's design, Sukhoi addressed what it considered to be the F-22's limitations, such as its inability to use thrust vectoring to induce roll and yaw moments and a lack of space for weapons bays between the engines, and complications for stall recovery if thrust vectoring fails.|$|E
500|$|Tsesarevichs {{most obvious}} design feature was her {{tumblehome}} hull. This had several advantages because it allowed greater freeboard since the narrow upper decks reduced the <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> of the vessel's hull, it increased {{the field of}} fire of guns mounted on the sides, and it reduced the ship's roll in heavy seas. Its great disadvantage was that it reduced buoyancy and stability which contributed to excessive heel during turns. [...] During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, Imperial Japanese Navy observers thought the Tsesarevich was going to capsize when she suddenly turned out of the battleline.|$|E
2500|$|The 1964 [...] "D" [...] model {{brought the}} first {{dramatic}} {{change to the}} 150 – {{the introduction of a}} rear window under the marketing name Omni-Vision.

It also resulted in a larger baggage compartment and a greater <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> allowance for baggage from 80 to [...] The unswept tailfin from previous years was retained for another two years. Elevator and rudder mass balances were increased to reduce flutter potential caused by the less aerodynamic rear fuselage. The gross weight of the aircraft was also increased in 1964 to , where it would stay until the advent of the Cessna 152. 804 150Ds were built.|$|E
50|$|As jets began {{flying with}} US {{airlines}} {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the FAA rule in effect at the time mandated that if the ratio between an aircraft's maximum <b>structural</b> takeoff <b>weight</b> and its maximum <b>structural</b> landing <b>weight</b> was greater than 105%, the aircraft {{had to have a}} fuel dump system installed. Aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and 727 and the Douglas DC-8 had fuel dump systems. Any of those aircraft needing to return to a takeoff airport above the maximum landing weight would jettison an amount of fuel sufficient to reduce the aircraft's weight below that maximum landing weight limit, and then land.|$|R

2500|$|In January 2010 Airbus {{opted to}} develop the -800 as a shrink of the {{baseline}} -900, avoid a specific development and increasing its payload by [...] or its range by [...] but leading to a fuel burn penalty by [...] "a couple of percent" [...] according to John Leahy. The previously planned optimisation to the structure and landing gear was not beneficial enough against better commonality and maximum takeoff weight increase by 11t from 248t. The −800's fuselage is 10 frames shorter (six forward and four aft of wing) than the −900 aircraft. It was designed to supplement the Airbus A330-200 long-range twin. Airbus planned to decrease <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> in the -800 as development continued, which should have been around airframe 20.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{military}} description BN.2 indicates, the Wib 2 {{was designed as}} a two-seat night bomber, but the designer had hopes of a passenger carrying derivative. As it was structurally an all-metal aircraft it had, {{by the standards of the}} times, a low <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> and, as a consequence, a high useful load of [...] making the suggested capacity of thirteen passengers plausible. In addition to its metal construction, contemporaries noted other unusual design features, in particular the position of the wings well back along the fuselage, Flight speculated the idea being to distribute the passenger (or bomb) load symmetrically about the centre of pressure and over a greater longitudinal distance than usual, rather than along the span. The pilot sat quite close to the tail with the gunner (in the bomber version) in a separate, gun mounting equipped cockpit immediately behind him. [...] Its span was large for a biplane with only a single set of struts and its upper wing had a shorter span than the lower.|$|E
2500|$|Variable {{incidence}} {{allowed the}} fuselage {{to be kept}} at the optimum angle for good visibility whilst maintaining lift – particularly useful for a carrier-borne aircraft and with tail-wheel undercarriage. [...] The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the flap setting was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. [...] The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a stalling speed of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded – a remarkable technical achievement {{in view of the}} small increase in <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity. It would have been very challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings. It was primarily of wooden construction, in common with the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber since, when it was being built, there was a danger of light alloy being in short supply. [...] The Exe was cancelled in 1938, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin was substituted in the design.|$|E

A structural analysis of a proposed HL- 20 configuration with a cylindrical pressurized crew cabin is presented in this paper. Loads for the vehicle are assembled from mission loading conditions such as abort, on-orbit pressurization, blast overpressure, aerodynamic maneuver, and touchdown.

40|$|Through {{a recent}} NASA contract, Boeing Research and Technology in Huntington Beach, CA {{developed}} and optimized a conceptual design {{of an open}} rotor hybrid wing body aircraft (HWB). Open rotor engines offer a significant potential for fuel burn savings over turbofan engines, while the HWB configuration potentially allows to offset noise penalties through possible engine shielding. Researchers at NASA Langley converted the Boeing design to a FLOPS model which {{will be used to}} develop take-off and landing trajectories for community noise analyses. The FLOPS model was calibrated using Boeing data and shows good agreement with the original Boeing design.

In May the contract was also extended to include Northrop, inviting them to submit a design along the lines they were already exploring.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new design}} was {{considerably}} larger, carrying {{three times the}} initial fuel load and designed around larger, more powerful Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets. The greater dimensions of the J57 engines required modifications to the engine bays, and modification to the intakes to allow a larger amount of airflow to the engine. The new intakes were also designed to be more efficient at higher Mach numbers. In order to increase aerodynamic efficiency, reduce <b>structural</b> <b>weight</b> and alleviate pitch-up phenomena recently identified in flight testing of the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket, an aircraft with a control surface configuration similar to the XF-88, the horizontal tail was relocated {{to the top of}} the vertical stabilizer, giving the F-101 its signature [...] "T-tail". In late 1952, the mission of the F-101 was changed from [...] "penetration fighter" [...] to [...] "strategic fighter", which entailed equal emphasis on both the bomber escort mission and on nuclear weapons delivery.

The design was approved, and an initial order for 29 F-101As was placed on 28 May 1953, no prototypes being required as the F-101 was considered a simple development of the XF-88, with the Cook-Cragie production policy, in which initial low-rate production would be used for testing without the use of separate prototypes, chosen instead.|$|E
