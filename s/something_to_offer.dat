5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> to his cause. Their holding hands while running {{was meant to}} signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to {{question}} their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E

He {{was allowed to}} nominate his successor, Billy McNeill, and Stein thought an agreement was in place for him to join the Celtic board of directors. Celtic instead offered a management position in their pools company, which Stein rejected as he believed he still had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> football. A testimonial match for Stein was played against Liverpool at Celtic Park on 14 August 1978. After the game, the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley encouraged Stein, who was three years younger than Paisley, to stay in football. There was also the example of Bill Shankly, who had experienced an unhappy retirement since leaving Liverpool in 1974.|$|E

She said Akane is [...] "uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well". Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post was more optimistic; he said, [...] "Akane provides a good voice for this, since she’s new to it all and wants to bring nuance to the numbers and the situations, but we see how experience plays out against her at times, but also that she does have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> with it".|$|E

In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions {{to pay more attention to}} the New Age's interest in such topics as [...] "new socio-political thinking" [...] and [...] "New Economics", topics Rose discussed in his book Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus, issued by a European academic publisher.|$|E

In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer,</b> but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} of royalties {{was a source}} of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for [...] "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part [...] "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: [...] "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material... but Dave did have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer,</b> and only managed to get a couple of things on there." [...] Mason recalled: [...] "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." [...] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: [...] "Animals...wasn't a fun record to make... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band... that it was only because of him that [...] were still going... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me." ...|$|E

2500|$|L'Amour {{also did}} some ground {{breaking}} {{work in the}} audio publishing field.

He [...] summarised the tour special stating, [...] "Beyoncé and Jay-Z style themselves as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde... But why settle for bank robbers? The pair, African Americans who write, produce, and perform their own music, are never just one thing to anyone. It has been a horrible... summer — for them, {{for all of us}} — but On The Run, a symphony of spectacles, absorbs all of that into something small that feels huge: the most important marriage in pop culture." [...] Erin Strecker of Billboard also gave the special a positive review, explaining that there were many high points from a musical perspective, before adding that the whole show was set up to look as one major high point with the pair changing turns to perform their songs as a medley showcasing their talents. He felt that it had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> to every viewer and added that the slow-motion footage focusing on Beyoncé and the audience was among the best executed of the special.

Clarke and two of her fellow people (Octavia and Bellamy) hold Lincoln in the dropship; he is a Grounder and was experimented on with a serum to become a reaper (a mindless, zombie-like killer). When Lincoln is almost mercy-killed, his heart stops and he is revived by Clarke, who believes curing reapers depends on waiting for the serum to leave their bodies, even though the reaper might temporarily die in the process. With this information, Clarke realizes they have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the Grounders. When Abby is successful in curing Lincoln, Lexa grants Clarke the truce, but says she {{must be allowed to}} execute Finn before it can begin. In [...] "Spacewalker," [...] Clarke returns to camp and tells them the Grounders will cease their attack if they are given Finn, who is the one who massacred a number of their people. The tension between the people in Camp Jaha rises as opinions are divided whether to give Finn to the Grounders or not. At the camp, Abby and Kane, having returned, think they can bargain with the Grounders by offering to put Finn on trial, but such plans are wasted as Finn gives himself up to the Grounders. In the end, Clarke goes to meet with Lexa in a last-ditch effort to save Finn from the brutal execution process Lincoln has explained. When Lexa refuses clemency, Clarke asks if she can say goodbye to Finn. She approaches, kisses him, and tells him she loves him while stabbing him in the heart, killing him quickly.|$|E

He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to [...] "his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up," [...] was [...] "seldom sufficiently appreciated." [...] "His book," [...] Mill continued, [...] "is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him..." [...] He was also highly praised by Thomas De Quincey: [...] "or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson {{on the possibility of}} imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian" [...] In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and {{is an integral part of}} the history of education. He is believed to be the “earliest spokesman for a child-centered education” (141), which is discussed above under his early childhood education theories. As well, he has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of tropes and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the post-structuralist and formalist theories. For example, the works of Jacques Derrida on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian’s assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes.|$|E
