40|$|Abstract — A {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional {{numerical model}} for the dispersion of air pollutants is presented. This model deals with the dispersion of both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> emitted from an area source with mesoscale wind along with large scale wind. The mesoscale wind is chosen to simulate the local wind produced by urban heat island. It is found that the mesoscale wind reduces the concentration of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the upwind side centre of heat island and enhances the concentration in the downwind side of centre of heat island, and as the gravitational settling velocity increases, the concentration of <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> decreases. The concentration of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> is less in magnitude for neutral atmosphere when compared to stable condition. The neutral atmospheric condition enhances vertical diffusion carrying the pollutant concentration to greater heights and thus the concentration of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> is less at the surface region of the urban city...|$|R

The model describes the long term average (annual or seasonal) airborn pollutant concentration due to a single source. Because the chemical transformation and physical deposition processes are assumed to be linear in the concentrations, the contributions of many sources may be determined by superposition. Simplified forms of the source-receptor relation are derived for ranges of the model parameters which are appropriate to sulfur oxide species.

40|$|The {{chemical}} processing of pollutants emitted {{into the atmosphere}} leads {{to a variety of}} oxidised products, which are commonly referred to as <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Such pollutants are often formed on local or regional scales in the planetary boundary layer, and may have direct health impacts and/or play wider roles in global atmospheric chemistry. In the present review, a comparatively detailed description of our current understanding of the chemical mechanisms leading to the generation of <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the troposphere is provided, with particular emphasis on chemical processes occurring in the planetary boundary layer. Much of the review is devoted to a discussion of the gas-phase photochemical transformations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and their role in the formation of ozone (O- 3) The chemistry producing a variety of other oxidants and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> (e. g., organic oxygenates; oxidised organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds), which are often formed in conjunction with O- 3, is also described. Some discussion of nighttime chemistry and the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in tropospheric chemistry is also given, since these are closely linked to the gas-phase photochemical processes. In many cases, the discussion of the relative importance of the various processes is illustrated by observational data, with emphasis generally placed on conditions appropriate to the UK and northwest continental Europe.

40|$|AbstractAir {{pollution}} from fossil fuel combustion {{has been known}} to affect human health for centuries. More detailed insights developed in the 20 th century, as a result of studies prompted by severe air pollution episodes such as those in the Meuse Valley, Belgium in 1930, and London, UK in 1952. The focus in the early studies was on local pollution produced by industry, power generation and home heating sources. Later, the emphasis shifted to so-called <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants,</b> the products of atmospheric reactions producing pollutants such as ozone, sulphates and nitrates. The <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> typically affected large areas extending hundreds of kilometers downwind from primary sources. Effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> on human health became evident from population studies and, in case of ozone, also from controlled human laboratory experiments. On an even larger scale, we are now confronted with air pollution masses extending over thousands of kilometers, and occupying several kilometers of the troposphere, the so-called ‘brown clouds’. Emissions from megacities, industry, energy production plants, home heating, biomass combustion for cooking and heating in rural areas as well as wildfires contribute to these ‘brown clouds’. Adverse effects of such clouds on human health are suspected but have not yet been conclusively proven. On {{the other end of the}} spatial scale, it has become convincingly clear that at the very local level, indoor air {{pollution from}} biomass combustion and exposure to traffic-related air pollution constitute major health hazards. Developing economies such as in China are confronted with each of these types of air pollution simultaneously, posing tremendous challenges for public health policy...|$|R

30|$|Nonetheless, ozone is not {{regulated}} {{under the}} UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Kyoto and Paris Protocols). This is probably {{because it is}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutant,</b> and these Protocols focus on primary pollutants. Likewise, ozone appears not to have a recognised global warming potential (GWP). Most greenhouse gases are assigned a GWP by the UNFCCC, but ozone is not, and a literature search has generated no GWP estimates for it. Even a 2016 authoritative estimate listed its GWP as ‘NA’. 1 This lack of GWP might be due to ozone’s secondary status. It might also be due to ozone’s low persistence at ground level.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of airborne fine particle composition and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutant</b> characteristics {{in the case}} of Augsburg, Germany, during winter (31  January– 12  March 2010) is studied on the basis of aerosol mass spectrometry (3  non-refractory components and organic matter, 3  positive matrix factorizations (PMF) factors), particle size distributions (PSD, 5  size modes, 5  PMF factors), further air pollutant mass concentrations (7  gases and VOC, black carbon, PM 10, PM 2. 5) and meteorological measurements, including mixing layer height (MLH), with one-hourly temporal resolution. Data were subjectively assigned to 10 temporal phases which are characterised by different meteorological influences and air pollutant concentrations. In each phase hierarchical clustering analysis with the Ward method was applied to the correlations of air pollutants, PM components, PM source contributions and PSD modes and correlations of these data with all meteorological parameters. This analysis resulted in different degrees of sensitivities of these air pollutant data to single meteorological parameters. It is generally found that wind speed (negatively), MLH (negatively), relative humidity (positively) and wind direction influence primary pollutant and accumulation mode particle (size range 100 – 500 nm) concentrations. Temperature (negatively), absolute humidity (negatively) and also relative humidity (positively) are relevant for secondary compounds of PM and particle (PM 2. 5, PM 10) mass concentrations. NO, nucleation and Aitken mode particle and the fresh traffic aerosol concentrations are only weakly dependent on meteorological parameters and thus are driven by emissions.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} three-dimensional unsteady {{mathematical model}} of primary {{as well as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> is presented. This model deals with {{the various types of}} time dependent sources, like, (i) instantaneous (ii) continuous (constant flux) (iii) step function type to investigate mainly the effect of settling of larger particles due to gravitational acceleration. This intricate problem is solved analytically and explicit expressions for primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> concentration are obtained for all the cases. It is found that when the source is of constant flux type (continuous) there will be an increase of ground level concentration near the source for small values of settling velocity compared to the no settling situation for all time. This increment will be maximum for large values of time. When settling is enhanced beyond that due to total deposition, the enhancement of concentration will prevail for all time at any location. However, when the source is of step function type, the enhancement of concentration for small values of settling velocity near the source is significantly only for a limited interval of time starting from the time of emission...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although several {{previous}} studies have found a positive association between ambient ozone and mortality, the observed effect may be confounded by other <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants</b> that are produced concurrently with ozone. OBJECTIVES: We addressed {{the question of whether}} the ozone–mortality relationship is entirely a reflection of the adverse effect of ozone, or whether it is, at least in part, an effect of other <b>secondary</b> <b>pollutants.</b> METHODS: Separate time-series models were fit to 3 – 6 years of data between 2000 and 2005 from 18 U. S. communities. The association between nonaccidental mortality was examined with ozone alone and with ozone after adjustment for fine particle mass, sulfate, organic carbon, or nitrate concentrations. The effect estimates from each of these models were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain an across-community average. RESULTS: We found a 0. 89 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 45 – 1. 33 %] increase in nonaccidental mortality with a 10 -ppb increase in same-day 24 -hr summertime ozone across the 18 communities. After adjustment for PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2. 5 µm) mass or nitrate, this estimate decreased slightly; but when adjusted for particle sulfate, the estimate was substantially reduced to 0. 58 % (95 % CI, – 0. 33 to 1. 49 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the association between ozone and mortality is confounded by particle sulfate, suggesting that some <b>secondary</b> particle <b>pollutants</b> could be responsible for part of the observed ozone effect...|$|R
