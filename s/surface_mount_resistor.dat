This unit is one part of a test system, which has the capability to characterize ultrasound transducer arrays up to 128 elements. This beamformer consists of three stages: delay unit, delay switches and summing unit. They have the following characteristics: the delay and summing units are realized in the analog domain, utilizing 4 -zone dynamic focusing, and dynamic aperture switching with very wide bandwidth. The delay unit consists of a set of fixed delays with Sns resolution, and a set of adjustable delay lines with a resolution of 1 ns. A set of 4 : 1 multiplexers is used to switch the different delays for different focusing zones. In our system, the focal range is divided into 4 zones consisting of a near, middle, far and fourth zone with a different set of delays for each zone. Dynamic aperture switching is accomplished by sequential selection of the multiplexer network. The aperture is set according to the focusing zone.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{geometric}} and ambient parameters on static structural integrity of solder joints in <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>resistor</b> assembled on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) is investigated to improve the thermo-fatigue reliability of the joints and components. The optimisation of resistor thickness (RT) and components standoff height (CSH) {{in a range of}} operating homologous temperature (TH) is poised to produce optimal assembly which could accumulate least strain energy density (ωacc) in resistor joints and consequently possesses longer cycles to failure (Nf). Taguchi design of experiment (DOE), L 9 (3 3), is used to generate nine designs and finite element modelling (FEM) is employed to simulate the responses of the assemblies to reliability influencing factors (RIFs). The Garofalo-Arrhenius constitutive creep relation is utilised to model high-temperature response of the soldered joints while the concept of signal to noise ratio and statistics are used to determine the optimal design. The results show that settings of lowest RT, highest CSH and TH of 0. 86 produce optimal assembly which demonstrates potential of reducing ωacc and increasing Nf of the best design of DOE by 46. 9 % and 88. 3 %, respectively. More results show that the nature of finite element model and difference in magnitude of thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of two bodies bonded together and which experience the same temperature change determine the degree of damage on the interface with the former being more determining.

40|$|With the {{development}} of mass spectrometry (MS) instruments starting in the late 19 th century, more and more research emphasis {{has been put on}} MS related subjects, especially the instrumentation and its applications. Instrumentation research has led modern mass spectrometers into a new era where the MS performance, such as resolving power and mass accuracy, is close to its theoretical limit. Such advanced performance releases more opportunities for scientists to conduct analytical research that could not be performed before. This thesis reviews general MS history and some of the important milestones, followed by introductions to ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) technique and quadrupole operation. Existing electronic designs, such as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) preamplifiers (for ion signal detection) and radio-frequency (RF) oscillators (for ion transportation/filtering) are reviewed. Then the potential scope for improvement is discussed. Two new FT-ICR preamplifiers are reported; both preamplifiers operate at room temperature. The first preamplifier uses an operational amplifier (op amp) in a transimpedance configuration. When a 18 -k feedback resistor is used, this preamplifier delivers a transimpedance of about 85 dB, and an input current noise spectral density of around 1 pA/ p Hz. The total power consumption of this circuit is around 310 mW when tested on the bench. This preamplifier has a bandwidth of fi 3 kHz to 10 MHz, which corresponds to the mass-to-charge ratio, m/z, of approximately 18 to 61 k at 12 T for FT-ICR MS. The transimpedance and the bandwidth can be adjusted by replacing passive components such as the feedback resistor and capacitor. The feedback and bandwidth limitation of the circuit is also discussed. When using an 0402 type <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>resistor,</b> the maximum possible transimpedance, without sacrificing its bandwidth, is approximated to 5. 3 M. Under this condition, the preamplifier is estimated to be able to detect 110 charges. The second preamplifier employs a single-transistor design using a different feedback arrangement, a T-shaped feedback network. Such a feedback system allows 100 -fold less feedback resistance at a given transimpedance, hence preserving bandwidth, which is beneficial to applications demanding high gain. The single-transistor preamplifier yields a low power consumption of 5. 7 mW, and a transimpedance of 80 dB in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 1 MHz (m/z of around 180 to 180 k for a 12 -T FT-ICR system). In trading noise performance for higher transimpedance, an alternative preamplifier design has also been presented with a transimpedance of 120 dB in the same frequency range. The previously reported room-temperature FT-ICR preamplifier had a voltage gain of about 25, a bandwidth of around 1 MHz when bench tested, and a voltage noise spectral density of 7. 4 nV/ p Hz. The bandwidth performance when connecting this preamplifier to an ICR cell has not been reported. However, from the transimpedance theory, the transimpedance preamplifiers reported in this work will have a bandwidth wider by a factor of the open-loop gain of the amplifier. In a separate development, an oscillator is proposed as a power supply for a quadrupole mass filter in a mass spectrometer system. It targets a stabilized output frequency, and a feedback control for output amplitude stabilization. The newly designed circuit has a very stable output frequency at 1 MHz, with a frequency tolerance of 15 ppm specified by the crystal oscillator datasheet. Within this circuit, an automatic gain control (AGC) unit is built for output amplitude stabilisation. A new transformer design is also proposed. The dimension of the quadrupole being used as a mass filter will be determined in the future. This circuit (in particular the transformer and the quadrupole connection/mounting device) will be finalised after the design of the quadrupole. Finally, this thesis concludes with a discussion between the gain and the noise performance of an FT-ICR preamplifier. A brief analysis about the correlation between the gain, cyclotron frequency, and input capacitance is performed. Future work is also suggested for extending this research...|$|E

2500|$|The {{thermal noise}} of a {{practical}} resistor {{may also be}} larger than the theoretical prediction and that increase is typically frequency-dependent. Excess noise of a practical resistor is observed only when current flows through it. This is specified in unit of μV/V/decade – μV of noise per volt applied across the resistor per decade of frequency. [...] The μV/V/decade value is frequently given in dB so that a resistor with a noise index of 0dB exhibits 1 μV (rms) of excess noise for each volt across the resistor in each frequency decade.

Wire-wound and thin-film resistors are often used for their better noise characteristics.

A programmable 16 _ 8 array of <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>resistors</b> suspended 0. 1 – 2 mm above the liquid provides dynamic millimeter-sized heat sources to locally heat the liquid surface to temperatures from approximately 28. 5 to 36. 5 °C.

It is shown through measurement that by engineering the reflection phase response of such surfaces they can be made to reflect an incident circularly polarised. wave with the same sense as that of the incident polarisation, or with a sense opposite to that of the incident wave. Such properties can be potentially useful in radar cross-section control. Having characterised the textured surface, we then demonstrate its use as an efficient ground plane for a wire dipole. For this structure, we demonstrate that the dipole excites surface currents which, in turn, contribute to the far-field radiation pattern. This is confirmed by the examination of the 'measured near-field and far-field energy distributions close to the antenna.

This article illustrates a structural modeling approach in which the digital PCB is considered as an assembly of parts which are modeled as electrical networks with input and output ports. The networks are linked together to form a complete system of equivalent circuit in SPICE format. Various methods have been developed by many authors [1 – 19] for modeling a certain aspect of the digital PCB system. Based on their work, the authors consolidate the methods and propose a structural approach to derive a system level equivalent circuit model for a digital PCB system. Section 2 outlines the modeling procedures using the structural approach. Section 3 gives the EM Field Method for deriving equivalent circuit models of sockets, connectors, interconnecting traces and discontinuities in PCB. Section 4 contains circuit models of discontinuities and IC buffers using measurement techniques. In Section 5, the power planes are modeled using a planar circuit approach [20].

The trap environment of beta irradiated SMRs includes a series of closely spaced traps covering thermal depths between 0. 9 - 1. 4 eV; predicting an average lifetime for thermal fading at RT of ca 23 years. Trapped charges evicted by thermal or optical stimulation are likely to recombine at F-type centres and contribute to the luminescence response that is likely to be thermally assisted via the vibrational modes of the lattice. A phonon-assisted de-excitation of the trapped charge population could additionally be involved in the mechanism of athermal or anomalous fading. Based on the temperature dependence of the rate of fading, a model is presented for the anomalous fading observed where phonon-assisted and tunnelling effects alternate or operate simultaneously depending on the temperature of the material. A number of aspects related to the use of SMRs in dosimetry seem to benefit from the investigation of the physical processes, although for accurate dose reconstruction it is imperative to know the energy of the ionising radiation source and the position of the mobile phone relative to the direction of the source. For example, at low-energy exposures the dose may be over-estimated, not only due to the non-flat energy response of the alumina, but also due to the presence of several parts of the mobile phone which can increase the amount of energy deposited in alumina substrates due to backscatter effects. In addition, MCNP simulations indicated that for low-energy exposures, such as for 192 Ir, differences of up to an order-of-magnitude between resistor and whole body dose are expected. Finally, to specify the most appropriate dose conversion coefficients that can be applied to estimate whole body dose from OSL / TL determinations, the knowledge of the exposure geometry is crucial...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we report}} about an {{assembly}} tech-nology for a wideband distributed amplifier (DA). The amplifier MMIC is fabricated in a commercially available GaAs pHEMT process with 150 nm gate length. The amplifier {{is connected to}} a 50 Ω microstrip-line on an external rf-laminate with 2. 4 mm connectors attached to the input and output. A via-hole process was developed for the Teflon based substrate material. All elements are assembled {{on top of this}} substrate. To provide bias decoupling down to the kHz-range, an external <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> device (SMD) <b>resistor</b> and capacitor are attached to the artificial drain line termination of the DA. This enables the amplifier to operate in non-return to zero (NRZ) optical communication systems. The packaged amplifier exhibits a gain of 11. 2 dB near dc. The midband gain equals to 8. 9 dB± 1. 5 dB between 2 GHz and 48. 5 GHz.

40|$|Reflow profile has {{significant}} impact on solder joint performance because it influences wetting and microstructure of the solder joint. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of reflow profile and thermal shock on the shear performance of eutectic SnPb (SnPb) and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) solder joints. Test boards were assembled with four different sized <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> chip <b>resistors</b> (1206, 0805, 0603 and 0402). Nine reflow profiles for SAC 305 and nine reflow profiles for SnPb were developed with three levels of peak temperature (12 ºC, 22 ºC, and 32 ºC above solder liquidus temperature, or 230 ºC, 240 ºC, and 250 ºC for SAC 305; and 195 ºC, 205 ºC, and 215 ºC for SnPb) and three levels of time above solder liquidus temperature (30 sec., 60 sec., and 90 sec.). Half of the test vehicles were then subjected to air-to-air thermal shock conditioning from - 40 to 125 °C. The shear force data were analyzed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The fracture surfaces were studied using a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that thermal shock degraded both SnPb and SnAgCu joints shear strength, and that the effect of thermal shock on solder joint shear strength is much more significant than that of reflow profile. The SnAgCu solder joints have weaker shear strength than the SnPb solders. SnAgCu solder joint after thermal shock retains more of its shear strength than that of SnPb for small components and vice versa for larger components...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The demands for compact, light weight and Iow cost electronic products {{have resulted in the}} miniaturisation of solder interconnects to a sub-millimetre scale. With such a reduction in size, the solder joints cannot be assumed to behave {{in the same way as}} bulk solder in terms of reliability due to the fact that their material behaviours are influenced by the joint size and microstructure. The complexity of their reliability assessment is furthermore compounded by the demand for the replacement of traditional SnPb solder alloys with lead-free alloys, due to the presence of the toxic and health hazardous element (Pb) in the former alloy. However, these new lead-free alloys have much less history of industrial applications, and their material and reliability data is not as well developed as traditional lead-based alloys. In addition, most previous reliability assessments using finite element analysis have assumed a uniform distribution of temperature within the electronic assembly, which conflicts the actual temperature conditions during circuit operation. Therefore, this research was undertaken to analyse the effect of solder joint size on solder material properties from which material models were developed, and to determine the effect of an actual (nonuniform) temperature distribution in an electronic assembly on the reliability of its solder joints. Following a review of lead-free solders and potential lead-free alloys, lead-free solder microstructures, and the reliability issues and factors affecting the reliability of solder joints, the practical aspects of this research were carried out in two main parts. The first part consisted of substantial work on the experimental determination of the temperature distribution in a typical <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> chip <b>resistor</b> assembly for power cycling conditions, and the stress-strain and creep behaviour for both Sn 3. 8 AgO. 7 Cu solder joints and reflowed bulk solder. This also included building material models based on the experimental data for the solder joints tested and comparison with that for bulk solder. Based on the comparison of the material properties, two extreme material models were selected for the reliability study. Size and microstructure effects on the solder material properties were also discussed in this part. The second part comprised of extensive finite element analysis of a <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> chip <b>resistor</b> assembly and reliability assessment of its solder joints. The simulation began with elasto-plastic analysis for 2 D and 3 D chip resistor assemblies to decide upon the kind of formulation to be used when the full complexity of both plasticity and creep is considered. The simulation was carried out considering the determined non-uniform temperature distribution and idealized or traditional uniform temperature condition. The solder joint's material properties were modelled using the two material models determined from the experimental results. The effect of temperature distribution during thermal cycling and of the selected material models on the solder joint reliability was demonstrated using finite element analysis and subsequent fatigue life estimation. In summary, this research has concluded that the material behaviour of the solder joint is different from that of bulk solder due to the effect of its size and microstructure. The anisotropic behaviour of the solder joint cannot be ignored in reliability studies, since it has a significant effect on the solder joint's fatigue life. The research also showed the significant effect of an actual (non-uniform) temperature distribution in the electronic assembly on the solder joint fatigue life...|$|R
