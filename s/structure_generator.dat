40|$|Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation {{has been}} used for decades to {{discover}} the chemical structure of unknown compounds. In this work we introduce the first open source <b>structure</b> <b>generator,</b> Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> can accept as additional input one or multiple nonoverlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on {{a modified version of the}} Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available <b>structure</b> <b>generator.</b> The results obtained, i. e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck...|$|E

40|$|Artificially-created {{hydrological}} catchments are characterised by sediment structures from technological construction {{processes that}} can potentially {{be important for}} modelling of flow and transport and for understanding initial soil and ecosystem development. The subsurface spatial structures of such catchments {{have not yet been}} sufficiently explored and described. Our objective was to develop a <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> programme for modelling the 3 -D spatial distribution patterns of dumped sediments depending on the technical earth-moving and deposition processes. We are focussing in a first step on integrating sediment dumping, particle size, and bulk density modification processes on the catchment scale. For the model development, the artificially-constructed hydrological catchment "Chicken Creek" located in Lower Lusatia, Germany, served as an example. The <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> describes 3 -D technological sediment distributions at two scales: (i) for a 2 -D-vertical cross-section, texture and bulk density distributions are generated within individual spoil cones that result from mass dumping, particle segregation, and compaction and (ii) for the whole catchment, the spoil cones are horizontally arranged along trajectories of mass dumping controlled by the belt stacker-machine relative to the catchment's clay layer topography. The generated 3 -D texture and bulk density distributions are interpolated and visualised as a gridded 3 -D-volume body using 3 -D computer-aided design software. The generated subsurface sediment distribution for the Chicken Creek catchment was found to correspond to observed patterns already without calibration. Spatial aggregation and interpolation in the gridded volume body modified the generated distributions towards more uniform (unimodal) distributions and lower values of the standard deviations. The modelling approach is generally applicable to all situations where large masses of unconsolidated sediment are moved and dumped thereby allowing generation of basic soil structures and patterns of hydrological systems...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the use of}} crystal structure prediction (CSP) in the evaluation and design of novel organic semiconductors. Heteroatom substitution into common organic semiconductors (pentacene in this thesis) offers a way of modulating their crystal packing and electronic properties. Initially CSP was performed on six human designed molecules and the charge mobility of their predicted crystal structures was calculated. The packing landscapes changed significantly from the unsubstituted pentacene. We found that seven nitrogen atoms led to a landscape showing a range of packing motifs, while seven nitrogen atoms favours the adoption of sheet-like motifs. Substitution patterns expected to result in the highest mobilities were found to perform worse than assumed, showing the importance of tuning both molecular electronic properties and crystal engineering. A genetic algorithm was then developed to generate new nitrogen substituted pentacenes. A population members fitness was calculated using two molecular properties important for electron transport in organic semiconductors. Five runs of the genetic algorithm gave 12 promising candidates for CSP and mobility calculations. The packing landscapes {{were similar to those}} of the seven nitrogen substituted human designed molecules. One genetic algorithm molecule showed a high number of high mobility structures close to the global minimum, making this molecule an attractive target for synthesis. Extensions to include CSP within the fitness function of the genetic algorithm represents possible future work. Addition work included the design and testing of <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> for the generation of trial crystal structures during a CSP. The novel <b>structure</b> <b>generator</b> performed well in locating the experimental structures of three test molecules and was used in the group's submission to the 6 th blind test, of which one molecule is also presented here.

The CONGEN program for constructing structures under constraints has been discussed by Carhart et al. (1975).

From an algorithmic standpoint, CONGEN is successful if it can, in a reasonable amount of time and without exhausting storage resources, produce a list of candidate structures satisfying the chemist's constraints. However, this list is often quite large, and it remains for the chemist to discriminate among the candidates, eventually reducing the possibilities to just one structure. Ways are studied for providing computer assistance in examining and further constraining lists of structural candidates...|$|E

The constructor of such objects gets two parameters as input: an n-vector a of non negative integers and a boolean function B on the types of order restrictions on the coordinates of the valid n-vectors bounded by a. At compiler time, the phorma constructor builds, from the pair a,B, a digraph G(a,B) with a single source s and a single sink t such that the st-paths are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the members of the B-restricted a-bounded array A(a,B). Besides perfectly hashing A(a,B), G(a,B) is an instance of an NW-family. This permits other useful computational tasks on it. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

D., Dept. of Algebra Abstract: Binary equality set of two morphisms g, h : ⌃⇤ ! A⇤ {{is a set}} of all words w over two-letter alphabet ⌃ satisfying g(w) = h(w). Elements of this set are called binary equality words. One of the important results of research on binary equality sets is the proof of the fact that each binary equality set is generated by at most two words provided that both morphisms g and h are non-periodic. Moreover, if a binary equality set is generated by exactly two words, then the <b>structure</b> of both <b>generators,</b> and therefore of the whole set, is uniquely given. This work presents the results of our research on the structure of binary equality sets with a single generator. Importantly, these generators can be decomposed into simpler <b>structures.</b> <b>Generators</b> which can not be further decomposed are called simple equality words.
