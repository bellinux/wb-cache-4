5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|Anton is a {{special-purpose}} supercomputer {{built for}} molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-Âµs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> this space.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and direction of}} statistical bias from nonrandom <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> specific types was investigated. Samples from school district populations were generated by a multistage sampling technique, with a modification that substituted for random selec-tion the nomination <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> units at each stage. Within these stages, superintendents were asked to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "repre-sentative " schools, principals to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "representa-tive " classrooms, and teachers to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "representa-tive " students. Statistics for the nominated samples were compared to the corresponding theoretical sampling distributions, determined by the appropriate population parameters, under the assumption of random selection. As the sampling proceeded from <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> schools, to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> classrooms, to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> students, the respective sample statistics increasingly deviated from expectation implying greater degrees of statistical bias...|$|R
