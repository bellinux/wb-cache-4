5000|$|A {{standard}} {{telegraph circuit}} connects all the keys, sounders and batteries {{in a single}} <b>series</b> <b>loop.</b> Thus the sounders actuate only when both keys are down (closed, also known as [...] "marking" [...] - [...] after the ink marks made on paper tape by early printing telegraphs). So the receiving operator has to hold their key down or close a built-in shorting switch in order to let the other operator send. As a consequence, the receiving operator could interrupt the sending operator by opening their key, breaking the circuit and forcing it into a [...] "spacing" [...] condition. Both sounders stop responding to the sender's keying, alerting the sender. (A physical break in the telegraph line {{would have the same}} effect.) ...|$|E

40|$|An antenna, {{which may}} be a search coil, is {{connected}} to an operational amplifier circuit which provides negative impedances, {{each of which is}} in the order of magnitude of the positive impedances which characterize the antenna. The antenna is connected to the inverting input of the operational amplifier; a resistor is connected between the inverting input and the output of the operational amplifier; a capacitor-resistor network, in parallel, is connected between the output and the noninverting input of the operational amplifier; and a resistor is connected from the noninverting input and the circuit common. While this circuit provides a negative resistance and a negative inductance, in series, which appear, looking into the noninverting input of the operational amplifier, in parallel with the antenna, these negative impedances appear in a <b>series</b> <b>loop</b> with the antenna positive impedances, so as to algebraically add. This circuit is tuned by varying the various circuit components so that the negative impedances are very close, but somewhat less, in magnitude, to the antenna impedances. The result is to increase the sensitivity of the antenna by lowering its effective impedance. This, in turn, increases the effective area of the antenna, {{which may be}} broadband...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMagnetic field {{gradients}} are nowadays {{indispensable to}} most {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} experiments and are at the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of time, gradients of the static magnetic field are employed. Gradients of the radio-frequency (rf) field may constitute an interesting alternative. Until now, they were produced by a single loop. We demonstrate in this paper how two unsymmetrical <b>series</b> <b>loops</b> can be optimized to produce rf gradients of much better performances. This optimization {{is based on a}} thorough theoretical approach and the gradient uniformity is studied through accurate simulations. Two prototypes were devised: one for a 2. 34 T horizontal magnet (used in MRI), the other for a 4. 7 T vertical magnet (used for pure spectroscopic applications). These two-loop systems were designed for proton resonance frequencies (100 MHz and 200 MHz, respectively). Performances of bot...|$|R

40|$|A <b>loop</b> <b>series</b> {{expansion}} for {{the partition}} {{function of a}} general statistical model on a graph is carried out. If the auxiliary probability distributions of the expansion are chosen to be a fixed point of the belief-propagation equation, the first term of the <b>loop</b> <b>series</b> gives the Bethe-Peierls free energy functional at the replica-symmetric level of the mean-field spin glass theory, and corrections are contributed only by subgraphs that are free of dangling edges. This result generalize the early work of Chertkov and Chernyak on binary statistical models. If the belief-propagation equation has multiple fixed points, a <b>loop</b> <b>series</b> expansion is performed for the grand partition function. The first term of this series gives the Bethe-Peierls free energy functional at the first-step replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) level of the mean-field spin-glass theory, and corrections again come only from subgraphs that are free of dangling edges, provided that the auxiliary probability distributions of the expansion are chosen to be a fixed point of the survey-propagation equation. The same <b>loop</b> <b>series</b> expansion can be performed for higher-level partition functions, obtaining the higher-level RSB Bethe-Peierls free energy functionals (and the correction terms) and message-passing equations without using the Bethe-Peierls approximation.

40|$|Two main {{types of}} dorsal vessels {{were found in}} the 101 species dissected, {{representing}} 61 genera and including most of the major groups of bees. In one type the dorsal vessel is straight and ruris dorsal to the gut; in the other type it makes an arch between the dorsal longitudinal muscles of the thorax, sometimes with a <b>series</b> of <b>loops</b> just behind the ascending portion. Intermediate types occur. Within any family or tribe in which both main types occur, that with the straight thoracic portion is always found in the primitive forms; and vessels with a <b>series</b> of <b>loops</b> are found only in the most specialized bees. An evolutionary trend is evident toward reduction of the posterior section of the dorsal vessel and its ostia. In the Meliponini, or stingless bees, a trend is found toward enlargement of the last two chambers, culminating in the Euglossini where the enlarged chambers probably serve as a powerful pumping mechanism. Some characteristics of the dorsal vessel are of possible taxonomic importance. The number and location of the metasomal ostia are significant for separation of some families, while other characteristics are typical of groups of genera and of tribes or subfamilies...|$|R
