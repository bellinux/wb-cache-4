5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases; {{in one of the}} cases, the player also controls Edgeworth's father Gregory. The gameplay is mostly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the previous game, , and is divided into two types of phases: investigations and rebuttals.|$|E
5|$|In France, at some {{stage the}} apothecaries' pound of 12ounces was {{replaced}} by the larger civil pound of 16ounces. The subdivisions of the apothecaries' ounce were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the other Romance countries, however, and were different from the subdivisions of the otherwise identical civil ounce.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was essentially the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution {{took place during}} the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E

5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E

5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are much the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E

5|$|Below centurion/decurion rank, junior {{officers}} in the Roman army were known as principales. An auxiliary cohort's ranks appear the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> a legionary centuria. These were, in ascending order: tesserarius ("officer of the watch"), signifer (standard-bearer for the centuria), optio (centurion's deputy) and vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole regiment, from vexillum). In the turmae of cohortes equitatae (and of alae?), the decurion's second-in-command was probably known as a curator, responsible for horses and caparison. As in the legions, the principales, together with some regimental specialists, were classified in two pay-scales: sesquiplicarii ("one-and-a-half-pay men") and duplicarii ("double-pay men"). These ranks are probably most closely resembled by the modern ranks of corporal and sergeant respectively.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{attainment}} in Southcote {{is lower}} than the Reading and national average. 47% of students at GCSE (or equivalent) attain five or more A* to C passes, compared to the Reading figure of 57% and 61% nationally. The number of students achieving Level 2 writing at Key Stage 1 is 83%—the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the wider Reading area—though the national percentage is higher at 85%. Overall, the proportion of Southcote residents with no qualifications is higher than Reading.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the printed volume.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly {{modified version of the}} proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1910, {{the design}} board chose the 30.5cm, to be mounted in four twin turrets on the {{centerline}} of the ship. The armor layout was kept the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> Seydlitz. In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E
