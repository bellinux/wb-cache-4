40|$|AbstractPotential {{adverse effects}} of {{chemical}} substances on thyroid function are usually examined by measuring serum levels of thyroid-related hormones. Instead, recent risk assessments for thyroid-active chemicals have focussed on <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> inhibition, an upstream event that by itself is not necessarily adverse. Establishing the extent of uptake inhibition that can be considered de minimis, the chosen benchmark response (BMR), is therefore critical. The BMR values selected by two international advisory bodies were 5 % and 50 %, a difference that had correspondingly large impacts on the estimated risks and health-based guidance values that were established. Potential treatment-related inhibition of thyroidal <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> is usually determined by comparing thyroidal <b>uptake</b> of radioactive <b>iodine</b> (RAIU) during treatment with a single pre-treatment RAIU value. In the present study it is demonstrated that the physiological intra-individual variation in <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> is much larger than 5 %. Consequently, in-treatment RAIU values, expressed {{as a percentage of}} the pre-treatment value, have an inherent variation, that needs to be considered when conducting dose-response analyses. Based on statistical and biological considerations, a BMR of 20 % is proposed for benchmark dose analysis of human thyroidal <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> data, to take the inherent variation in relative RAIU data into account. Implications for the tolerated daily intakes for perchlorate and chlorate, recently established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiolabeled <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> is {{a useful}} tool {{in the study of}} thyroid diseases. Aim: To obtain normal values for 131 <b>Iodine</b> thyroid <b>uptake</b> in healthy volunteers. Material and methods: A total of 105 {{subjects}} were included (52 males and 53 females), {{with a mean age of}} 45 years (range: 20 to 68, evenly distributed in decades). A questionnaire was applied and a clinical examination was performed to rule out endocrine diseases. Serum TSH and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were also measured. The oral 131 I dose was 5 - 10 fiCi, and a Thyrad equipment was used for measurements at 2 and 24 h. Results: Mean global <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> was 5. 5 %± 1. 8 % (range: 2. 3 - 12. 0) at 2 h and 16. 2 ± 4. 8 % (range: 6. 5 - 30. 1) at 24 h. The values at 2 h among women and men were 6. 0 ± 1. 8 and 4. 9 ± 1. 6 %, respectively, (p < 0. 02). At 24 h, the figures were 17. 3 ± 4. 5 and 15. 0 ± 4. 9 %, respectively (p = 0. 01). Compared to their younger counterparts, radioactive <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> was lower among volunteers older than 40 years, at 2 h (5. 0 ± 1. 7 and 6. 0 ± 1. 8, respectively, p < 0. 02) and at 24 h (14. 9 ± 4. 4 and 17. 6 ± 4. 9 %, respectively, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Normal thyroid uptake values in adults are influenced bygender and age. Normal thyroid <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> values are slightly higher in females. <b>Iodine</b> thyroid <b>uptake</b> values decrease slightly in subjects aged more than 40 years...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Perchlorate is a known {{competitive}} inhibitor of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). Possible thyroid-related {{effects of}} environmental perchlorate have created great health concerns, {{especially in the}} U. S., resulting in a debated reference dose (RfD) of 0. 0007 mg/kg-day in drinking water recommended by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). However, the impact of other environmental NIS inhibitors {{and the role of}} iodine seem to have received little attention in the whole debate. Methods: We performed a PubMed search for articles published up to February 2006, using the key terms perchlorate, nitrate, thiocyanate, iodine, NIS, RfD, thyroid (alone or in combinations), with particular attention for human studies. In parallel, we critically analysed the January 2005 NAS’ report, entitled “Health implications of perchlorate ingestion”. Results: The relative potencies of prevalent environmental NIS inhibitors (nitrate, thiocyanate, perchlorate) to inhibit <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> have been estimated repeatedly with robust results. Our calculations show that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> inhibition than perchlorate. Furthermore, the <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> inhibitory effects of nitrate and thiocyanate – as defined by their legally accepted maximal contaminant levels in drinking water - exceed the potential effect of the proposed reference dose for perchlorate by far. Conclusions: <b>Iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself. These potential confounders should therefore be considered in future studies and calculations for risk assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cells of}} the marine {{bacterium}} strain C- 21, which is phylogenetically closely related to Arenibacter troitsensis, accumulate iodine {{in the presence of}} glucose and iodide (I−). In this study, the detailed mechanism of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> by C- 21 was determined using a radioactive iodide tracer, 125 I−. In addition to glucose, oxygen and calcium ions were also required for the <b>uptake</b> of <b>iodine.</b> The <b>uptake</b> was not inhibited or was only partially inhibited by various metabolic inhibitors, whereas reducing agents and catalase strongly inhibited the uptake. When exogenous glucose oxidase was added to the cell suspension, enhanced <b>uptake</b> of <b>iodine</b> was observed. The uptake occurred {{even in the absence of}} glucose and oxygen if hydrogen peroxide was added to the cell suspension. Significant activity of glucose oxidase was found in the crude extracts of C- 21, and it was located mainly in the membrane fraction. These findings indicate that hydrogen peroxide produced by glucose oxidase plays a key role in the <b>uptake</b> of <b>iodine.</b> Furthermore, enzymatic oxidation of iodide strongly stimulated <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> in the absence of glucose. Based on these results, the mechanism was considered to consist of oxidation of iodide to hypoiodous acid by hydrogen peroxide, followed by passive translocation of this uncharged iodine species across the cell membrane. Interestingly, such a mechanism of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> is similar to that observed in iodine-accumulating marine algae...|$|R

40|$|Concept: Redifferentiation of thyroid {{carcinoma}} cells has {{the potential}} to increase the efficacy of radioactive iodine therapy in treatment-refractory, nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma (TC), leading to an improved disease outcome. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell fate affecting survival and differentiation, with autophagy and inflammation as prominent downstream pathways. Methods: The effects of mTOR inhibition were studied for its redifferentiation potential of the human TC cell lines BC-PAP, FTC 133, and TPC 1 by assessment of mRNA and protein expression of thyroid-specific genes and by performance of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> assays. Results: In thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF 1) -expressing cell lines, mTOR inhibition promoted redifferentiation of TC cells by the up-regulation of human sodium-iodine symporter mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, these cells exhibited markedly elevated <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> capacity. Surprisingly, this redifferentiation process was not mediated by autophagy induced during mTOR inhibition or by inflammatory mediators but through transcriptional effects at the level of TTF 1 expression. Accordingly, small interfering RNA inhibition of TTF 1 completely abrogated the induction of human sodium-iodine symporter by mTOR inhibition. Conclusion: The present study has identified the TTF 1 -dependent molecular mechanisms through which the inhibition of mTOR leads to the redifferentiation of TC cells and subsequently to increased radioactive <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{cause of}} the {{association}} between breast cancer (BC) and thyroid autoimmunity is still unknown. Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is highly expressed in BC cells, and previous studies demonstrated that iodine content in BC is lower than in remote normal breast tissue, suggesting a disorder of iodide uptake in BC. In this study, we evaluated the presence of putative serum autoantibodies able to block the function of NIS in BC patients with thyroid autoimmunity. IgGs were obtained from: a) 11 patients with BC and high antithyroglobulin (TgAb) and antithyroperoxidase (TPOAb) autoantibodies serum concentration; b) 34 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (1 was euthyroid, 4 had subclinical hypothyroidism and 29 were overtly hypothyroid); c) 15 control subjects. The biological activity of NIS was studied using a chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing NIS (NIS-CHO). The course of iodide accumulation in NIS-CHO was studied after addition of Na 125 I in culture medium. The accumulation of iodide linearly increased between 2 and 10 min, reaching a plateau at 45 min. The preincubation of NIS-CHO with IgGs purified from sera of BC with {{the highest levels of}} TPOAb and TgAb caused an inhibition of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> of no more than 5 %. Similar results were obtained using IgGs purified from patients with HT and control subjects. Our data showed no interference of autoantibodies on <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> in patients with BC and thyroid autoimmunity and the very low percentage of inhibition of <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> cannot explain the lower content of iodine in BC tissue...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: High <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> {{levels are}} widely {{accepted}} {{as a condition for}} successful treatment with radioiodine (RAI). However, the existing data are controversial and the correlation of pretherapeutic RAI uptake level and outcome of RAI therapy has not yet been quantified. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the influence of RAI uptake on the outcome after RAI treatment and to estimate uptake-dependent success rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 229 patients (m = 53, f = 176; age 64 +/- 14 years) suffering from toxic adenoma, multinodular goitre or Graves' disease, respectively. Clinical status and T 3, fT 4 and TSH levels were assessed 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after treatment. Successful treatment was defined as loss of hyperthyroidism 18 months after radioiodine therapy. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation between the maximum <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> and the rate of success and hypothyroidism, respectively, after RAI treatment. RESULTS: Overall, patients presented with pretherapeutic RAI uptake values between 17 % and 100 %. Eighteen months after RAI treatment, an euthyroid state was achieved in 136 patients (60 %), hypothyroidism occurred in 47 patients (20 %) and 46 patients (20 %) remained hyperthyroid. The patients with the lowest pretherapeutic RAI uptakes showed the highest success rates. The overall success rate significantly decreased from 92 % at low RAI uptakes to 57 % at high uptakes (P = 0. 002). This effect was found in the patients suffering from multinodular goitre as well as in the patients with Graves' disease. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the current opinion, our results provide evidence that the pretherapeutic <b>iodine</b> <b>uptake</b> level and post-therapeutic outcome are inversely correlated...|$|R
