5|$|Monument 15 {{is a large}} boulder with an Olmec-style relief {{sculpture}} of the head, <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is carved with the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, {{to the point}} where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a furrowed, sweaty brow.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} William Dakin in his 1941 book The Art of Camouflage followed Thayer {{in describing}} countershading in some detail, {{and the book}} was reprinted as a military handbook in 1942. Dakin photographed model birds, much as Thayer and Cott had done, and argued that the <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> arms of battledress should be countershaded.|$|E
40|$|Obstetrical {{brachial plexus}} palsy {{invariably}} involves the upper roots. The {{natural history of}} the injury shows that if the condition is left untreated, spontaneous reinnervation that occurs in a variable degree in these patients leaves characteristic deformities of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> elbow. Common sequelae are the internal rotation and adduction deformity of the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> elbow flexion contractures. Early microsurgical reconstruction of the affected plexus leads to more rewarding overall function of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> elbow, but residual deformities might appear again, {{similar to the ones}} noticed in untreated cases, that are even less serious. Thus, secondary procedures are mandatory to reanimating the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> elbow, and especially to provide adequate abduction and external rotation of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> a more neutral appearance of the elbow regarding flexion–extension equilibrium...|$|R
500|$|Elephants are {{the largest}} living {{terrestrial}} animals. On average, male African bush elephants are [...] tall at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> weigh , whereas females are [...] tall at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> weigh [...] Asian elephants are smaller, with males being [...] tall at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> weighing [...] on average, and females being [...] tall at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> weighing [...] African forest elephants are the smallest extant species, with the average height for the species being [...] at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> average weight being [...] Male African elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females. The skeleton of the elephant {{is made up of}} 326–351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.|$|R

30|$|The human arm {{has three}} joints: <b>shoulder,</b> elbow, <b>and</b> wrist. They connect the arm proper, forearm, <b>and</b> hand. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> elbow joints {{allow people to}} carry out 5 {{distinct}} types of motions (see Fig.  10), while the wrist joint allows us to perform 3 types of rotations [44, 45]. Our study shows that participants have not made use of wrist motions but instead they have used either <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> elbow movements, or combinations of the two. That is, {{it is based on}} shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, shoulder internal rotation, <b>shoulder</b> flexion, <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> horizontal abduction.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the event}} began, a thirty-minute pre-show aired with a match between The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) and Mikey Batts and Jerrelle Clark. The Naturals won the match by pinfall, after Stevens and Douglas lifted Batts up, placed Batts {{head and neck}} onto one of their <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> fell to a seated {{position}} to perform a move they dubbed the Natural Disaster.|$|E
5|$|For {{both sexes}} clothes were tight-fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were appreciated. The silhouettes for grown men and young girls {{emphasized}} wide <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> narrowed to the waist; the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more complicated. The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization {{in the ensuing}} centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common.|$|E
5|$|Matusow {{was first}} {{introduced}} to poker when he played video poker at the Maxim Casino {{at the age of}} 18. He was a regular and played so much that he suffered from repetitive strain injury in his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> arms. He occasionally stole money from his mother's purse and at one point attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Matusow was taught Texas hold 'em in 1989 by a rounder named Steve Samaroff.|$|E

5|$|Roddy Piper was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Jeff Hardy and Scott Hall, {{which was}} the {{following}} contest. After the two fought for a few minutes, Hardy gained the pinfall victory after he jumped off the top rope and performed a Swanton Bomb, a high-angle front flip from the top rope, onto Hall who was laying flat against the mat. Abyss attacked Hardy after the match finished, and lifted Hardy up onto his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> then dropped to a seated position, a move which Abyss dubbed the Shock Treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{art critic}} Hugh Davies has {{suggested}} that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a thick mop of dark hair. Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the variation and variability of cuetip, <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> pelvis on stop shot, push shot and draw shot during warm-up strokes (W 3, W 2, W 1) and final stroke (FS). Eight cameras were used to determine three-dimensional motions of cue, <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> pelvis for a pool world cup championships winner. The results showed that the largest variation was presented in the final stroke as well as the greatest consistence through trials. Variation of <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> pelvis was supposed an essential factor for a pool shoot. The cuetip, <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> pelvis all demonstrate the similar pattern with greatest variability in first warm stoke and greatest consistence on the final stroke. The variability will converge to from the warm-up strokes to the final stroke...|$|R
5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates that {{are found in the}} western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles on the head and <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E
5|$|The team {{adopted a}} new home kit, which {{featured}} red shirts with white collars, white trims on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> white sleeves that included red trims. York started the season wearing red shorts with white trims, but these were replaced {{later in the season}} with navy blue shorts with white trims. The home kit also included red shorts with white trims. The away kit, retained from the previous season, comprised light blue shirts with white horizontal stripes, light blue shorts and light blue socks. Pryers Solicitors continued as shirt sponsors for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren {{that lives}} in diverse habitats across most of Australia. Four subspecies are recognised. In a species that exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> azure crown and ear coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of the subspecies rogersi and dulcis (previously termed lavender-flanked fairywren) have mainly blue-grey plumage.|$|E

40|$|Shoulder {{impingement}} causing interference on {{the motion}} of the <b>shoulder</b> joint activities <b>and</b> result in functional activity disorder. These injuries usually are caused by faulty movement, overuse, poor posture, occupational factors and trauma. This will cause a burden on one part of the body and cause imbalances in anatomy, which will eventually lead to disruption of the body that experienced work. This study aimed to investigate the effect of functional <b>shoulder</b> exercise <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior with <b>shoulder</b> stabilization exercises <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior to the decline in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm disabilities in subacromial impingement syndrome. This research method was experimental clinical trials with pre test and post test group design. Population student Academy Physiotherapy Widya Husada Semarang, which consists of 3 men and 12 women, aged between 18 - 21 years, divided into two groups. Group I was given <b>Shoulder</b> Stabilization exercises <b>and</b> Traction humerus to Inferior (n= 7) and group II Functional <b>Shoulder</b> Exercise <b>and</b> Traction humerus to Inferior (n= 8). This research was conducted for 3 weeks. Measurement of the value of disability <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm by using the <b>Shoulder</b> Pain <b>and</b> Disability Index (SPADI). The test results on the group I average value pre 34. 17, SB = 6. 31, and the average value of post 11. 54, SB = 4. 02, p = 0. 001 found significant differences obtained test results paired sample t-test, and testing group II average value pre 40. 18, SB = 3. 53, and the average value of post 7. 82, SB = 1. 57, p = 0. 001 found significant differences obtained test results paired sample t-test. Comparison of Group I and II, p = 0. 005 there were significant differences, test results obtained independent sample t-test. Conclusions: The combination of <b>shoulder</b> stabilization exercises <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior can reduce disability <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm on subacromial impingement syndrome. The combination functional <b>shoulder</b> exercise <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior can reduce disability <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm on subacromial impingement syndrome. The combination functional <b>shoulder</b> exercises <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior better than the combination <b>shoulder</b> stabilization exercises <b>and</b> traction humerus to inferior in lowering disabilities <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm on subacromial impingement syndrome...|$|R
