25|$|<b>Semi-sparkling</b> is a {{wine with}} 1 to 2.5 {{additional}} bars of pressure. <b>Semi-sparkling</b> wines include wines labelled as Frizzante, Spritzig, Pétillant and Pearl.|$|E
25|$|Anjou Pétillant AOC Wines labeled {{under this}} {{designation}} are <b>semi-sparkling</b> (similar to the Italian wine frizzante) {{and sold in}} regular still wine bottles and corks rather than Champagne bottles. These wines are aged in the bottle {{for a minimum of}} 9 months before release and can range in sweetness levels from dry to medium sweet. The white wines produced under this style must be composed of a minimum 80% Chenin blanc with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc responsible for the remaining 20%. A <b>semi-sparkling</b> rosé style may be produced under the Rosé d'Anjou Pétillant AOC designation and be composed of predominantly Grolleau with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis also permitted.|$|E
25|$|Vouvray {{produces}} {{more than a}} million cases of wine a year. The traditional style of winemaking in Vouvray is a minimalist approach, often using neutral fermentation vessel such as stainless steel and not submitting the wine to malolactic fermentation. While some winemakers are experimenting with oak, very few wines are made with new oak. Vouvrays are usually bottled early and expected to age in the wine bottle. Sparkling wines are made according to the traditional method and can either be pétillant (<b>semi-sparkling)</b> or mousseux (fully sparkling).|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane based {{polymers}} {{are used}} as adhesives in agglomerated cork stoppers. These cork stoppers improve wine quality when comparing to screw caps or foam. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still wines, <b>semi-sparkle</b> and gaseous wines, beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used {{in the production of}} polyurethane based adhesive due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric MDI (fm-MDI) can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages. Therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC with the advantage of decreasing time and solvent consumption. Although optimization is necessary because column and solvent conditions are not the same in both systems. Agglomerated cork stoppers glued with MDI based polyurethane were produced and put in contact with food simulant, ethanol:water 50 : 50, with different times after production. Samples were taken, from each contact time after production, after 15, 60, 120, 360 min, 1 day and 1 month contact period. The same proceeding was also performed using dichloromethane as extraction solvent with agglomerated cork stoppers with two days after production. The samples in contact with food simulant (EtOH:H 2 O) was dried with rotary evaporator, dissolved in the appropriated solvent and fm-MDI determined with the analytical method that was optimized. Secondly key parameters of the migration process are expected to be calculated according to a mathematical model based on the second Fick’s equation. Regarding that MDI reacts rapidly very low concentrations of fm-MDI are expected...|$|R
40|$|Isocyanates are {{included}} into a class with an extreme commercial importance because {{their use in}} the manufacture of polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are used in several applications such as adhesives, coatings, foams, thermoplastics resins, printing inks, foundry moulds and rubbers. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still wines, <b>semi-sparkle</b> and gaseous wines, beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used in the production of polyurethane based adhesive in use due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric TDI or MDI, depending on the based polyurethane, can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine which method is better to analyze isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers, essentially TDI to quantify its monomer. A Design of Experiments (DOE) with three factors, column temperature, flow and solvent, at two levels was done. Eight experiments with three replications and two repetitions were developed. Through an ANOVA the significance of the factors was evaluated and the best level’s factors were selected. As the TDI has two isomers and in this method these two isomers were not always separated an ANOVA with results of resolution between peaks was performed. The Design of Experiments reveals to be a suitable statistical tool to determine the best conditions to quantified free isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers to real foodstuff. The best level’s factors to maximize area was column temperature at 30 ºC, flow to 0, 3 mL/min and solvent 0, 1 % Ammonium Acetate, to maximize resolution was the same except the solvent that was 0, 01 % Ammonium Acetate.

The objective {{of this study is}} to determine which solvent is better to extract isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers, essentially MDI to quantify its free monomer. A long term migration study was performed in order to compare with soxhlet extraction. Firstly a global migration test was performed in order to select the best solvents for soxhlet extraction. A Design of Experiments (DOE) with two factors, solvent and wax (to spike adhesive film), at six and two levels, respectively, was done. Six different solvents were put in contact with adhesive film during ten days at a temperature of forty degrees. Experiments were replicated and repeated three times. Through a TWO-WAY ANOVA the significance of solvents was evaluated and the three better solvents selected. Afterwards, soxhlet extraction was performed with the three better solvents, ethanol, acetonitrile and n-heptane, regarding ANOVA results. The other control factors were cycles’ number (20, 55 and 90) and sample type (natural, agglomerated cork stopper and adhesive film). In a fractional factorial DOE, with three factors at three levels, nine experiments with three replicates were performed. The significance of the factors/interactions was evaluated and the best level’s factors were selected. The Design of Experiments reveals to be a suitable statistical tool to determine the best conditions to measure the migration of free isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers to real foodstuff. The best solvent to monitor the migration from cork to wine by soxhlet extraction was ethanol although in long term migration the best solvent was acetonitrile.

25|$|The precise {{origins of}} Muscat blanc à Petits Grains are not known, though Greece and Italy can both make {{compelling}} cases {{due to the}} proliferation of clones, mutations and offspring. Today, the grape is found throughout the wine-producing world, making {{a wide range of}} wine, from light, sweet sparkling and <b>semi-sparkling</b> Asti and Moscato d'Asti wine in the Piedmont wine region of Italy and Clairette de Die region of France, fortified vin doux naturels (VdN) in southern France in AOC regions such as Muscat de Beaume de Venise, Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois and Muscat de Frontignan, fortified Liqueur Muscat in the Victoria wine region of Rutherglen in Australia, to dry wines in the Wachau wine of Austria and Südsteiermark.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{sparkling}} wines, such as Champagne, {{are generally}} sold with 5 to 6 atmospheres of {{pressure in the}} bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German Sekt, Spanish Espumoso, Italian Spumante and French Crémant or Mousseux wines. <b>Semi-sparkling</b> wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German spritzig, Italian frizzante and French pétillant wines. The amount of pressure in the wine {{is determined by the}} amount of sugar added during the tirage stage {{at the beginning of the}} secondary fermentation with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.|$|E
25|$|A rosé wine {{incorporates}} some of {{the color}} from the grape skins, {{but not enough to}} qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines can be made still, <b>semi-sparkling,</b> or sparkling, {{with a wide range of}} sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.|$|E
25|$|The Vin de Savoie AOC covers 1,500 {{hectares}} (3,705 acres) {{northeast of}} Lyon towards to the Swiss border. Here Mondeuse noire is grown and permitted to be blended with Gamay and Pinot noir {{in the red}} and rosé wines of the AOC. Here yields are restricted to 60 hl/ha (approximately 3.2 tonnes/acre) for the basic AOC and 55 hl/ha for cru classified wine and minimum alcohol levels are 9.5% for basic AOC and 10% for cru classified. While rarely used, Mondeuse noire is also permitted in the sparkling Vin de Savoie Mousseux or <b>semi-sparkling</b> Vin de Savoie Pétillant wines of the region. Like Pinot noir, which is a red wine grape used in Champagne, Mondeuse noire destined for sparkling wine production would be pressed soon after harvest {{in order to avoid}} having the white grape juice tinted by the color phenolics in the skins that are usually leached out by the maceration process.|$|E
25|$|Outside Piedmont, Barbera {{is found}} {{throughout}} Italy, {{often as a}} component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the Lombardy region, {{it is seen as}} a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to <b>semi-sparkling</b> frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and {{as part of a larger}} blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.|$|E
2500|$|Simpler, cheaper {{sparkling}} {{wines are}} manufactured simply by adding CO2 to the wine from a carbonator. The bubbles created by using this method will be relatively large and volatile.

2500|$|Sangiovese is {{considered}} the [...] "workhorse" [...] grape of central Italy, producing everything from everyday drinking to premium wines {{in a variety of}} styles-from red still wines, to rosato to sweet passito, <b>semi-sparkling</b> frizzante and the dessert wine Vin Santo. In northern Italy, the grape is a minor variety with it having difficulties ripening north of Emilia-Romagna. In the south, it is mainly used as a blending partner with the region's local grapes such as Primitivo, Montepulciano and Nero d'Avola.|$|E
2500|$|Muscadet {{wines are}} usually bottled {{in the spring}} or autumn {{following}} the vintage though they {{can be made in}} the vins de primeur style (like a Beaujolais nouveau) and be released as early as the third Thursday of November. At time of bottling some carbon dioxide may still be present in the wine, giving it a slight effervescence that can come across as a [...] "prickly" [...] sensation to the tongue. This effervescence is rarely seen to the degree of a <b>semi-sparkling</b> wine such as Lambrusco. Under French AOC regulations, the maximum alcohol content of a Muscadet must be no more than 12% (after chaptalization)-making it the only unfortified French wine to have a maximum alcohol content stipulation.|$|E
2500|$|Sekt is a German {{term for}} some {{sparkling}} wine. The majority of Sekt produced (around 95%) {{is made by}} the Charmat method with the remaining premium Sekt being made according to the méthode traditionnelle. Cheap sparkling wine made with CO2 injection must not be called Sekt, but rather Schaumwein (German for sparkling wine, literally [...] "foam wine"), <b>semi-sparkling</b> wine is called Perlwein. [...] Around 90 percent of Sekt is made at least partially from imported wines from Italy, Spain and France. Sekt labeled as Deutscher Sekt is made exclusively from German grapes, and Sekt b.A.

50|$|According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Bombino bianco {{tends to}} produce {{relatively}} neutral flavored wines {{that are not}} very aromatic but can have some citrus or herbaceous notes with some examples showing minerality. While the wine can be made as a varietal, it is most often used as a blending variety in both red and white wines {{that can be made}} {{in a wide range of}} sweetness levels. In addition to still wines, some DOCs produce <b>semi-sparkling</b> frizzante and fully sparkling spumante styles from the grape.|$|E

Sparkling wines are made according to the traditional method and can either be pétillant (<b>semi-sparkling)</b> or mousseux (fully sparkling).|$|E
50|$|Along {{the banks}} of the Reno river in Emilia-Romagna, Montù is the primary variety in the white DOC wine of Montuni del Reno. Here the grape must make up at least 85% of the blend with other non-aromatic local white grape {{varieties}} permitted to make up the remainder. The wine can be made in both a still and <b>semi-sparkling</b> frizzante style. Grapes destined for DOC production must be harvested with to yield no greater than 18 tonnes/hectares with the finished wine needing to attaining a minimum alcohol level of 10.5%.|$|E
