40|$|The thesis {{considers}} whether international {{research should}} {{contribute to the}} reduction of global health disparities and, if so, how the enterprise should do so. To answer these questions, I systematically analyse cosmopolitan and middle ground theories of justice {{in order to determine}} if they support the conduct of international health research. I then investigate which theory, if any, can provide the most comprehensive guidance about what is owed by external research actors from high-income countries to parties in low and middle-income countries and is, therefore, best-equipped to serve as the basis of a justice framework for international research. The analysis reveals that the human rights cosmopolitan theories of Thomas Pogge and Henry Shue, Peter Singer’s consequentialist cosmopolitan theory, and Jennifer Ruger’s health capability paradigm each provide grounds for the contention that international research should advance justice in global health. Of these theories, the health capability paradigm is selected to serve as the starting point of a justice framework for international clinical research. Relying on premises derived from the health capability paradigm, I develop the ‘research for health justice’ framework. The framework provides guidance on how four key aspects of international clinical research should be structured so that the enterprise most effectively reduces health disparities between and within countries. Those four aspects are: the research target, research capacity strengthening, ancillary care, and post-trial benefits. The framework identifies the obligations of multilaterals, governments, research funders, <b>sponsors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> towards putting this model of international clinical research into practice. The thesis then utilises empirical methods to test the theoretical concepts that it develops. To determine whether high-income country governments meet their obligations under the ‘research for health justice’ framework, I evaluate the alignment of research law and policy in the United States and United Kingdom against its requirements. Neither country is shown to have enacted research law and policy similar to that called for by the framework. Due to their sustained commitment to technology transfer legislation, both countries’ health research systems are organised to promote domestic economic ends rather than health equity. To establish whether and how research funders, <b>sponsors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> meet their obligations under the ‘research for health justice’ framework, case study research was performed on an ongoing equity-oriented international clinical trial—the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit’s vivax malaria treatment trial. Data were collected utilising a mix of qualitative research methods and analysed according to the principles of thematic analysis. The results demonstrate that international clinical research can meet ethical requirements linking it to justice in global health, even in difficult circumstances (i. e., where a research population largely cannot access its government health system). Framework requirements were largely upheld by Wellcome Trust (funder), Oxford University (<b>sponsor),</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> on the vivax malaria treatment trial. A number of factors facilitated adherence to the requirements, including chief investigators’ intentions and practices and the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit’s dual role as a research unit and health care provider...|$|R

40|$|Scholarship {{focusing}} on how international research {{can contribute to}} justice in global health has primarily explored requirements {{for the conduct of}} clinical trials. Yet health systems research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has increasingly been identified as vital to the reduction of health disparities between and within countries. This paper expands an existing ethical framework based on the health capability paradigm - research for health justice - to externally-funded health systems research in LMICs. It argues that a specific form of health systems research in LMICs is required if the enterprise is to advance global health equity. "Research for health justice" requirements for priority setting, research capacity strengthening, and post-study benefits in health systems research are derived in light of the field's distinctive characteristics.

40|$|Group {{sequential}} {{design has}} been widely applied in clinical trials {{in the past few}} decades. The sample size estimation is a vital concern of <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators.</b> Especially in the survival group sequential trials, it is a thorny question because of its ambiguous distributional form, censored data and different definition of information time. A practical and easy-to-use simulation-based method is proposed for multi-stage two-arm survival group sequential design in the article and its SAS program is available. Besides the exponential distribution, which is usually assumed for survival data, the Weibull distribution is considered here. The incorporation of the probability of discontinuation in the simulation leads to the more accurate estimate. The assessment indexes calculated in the simulation are helpful to the determination of number and timing of the interim analysis. The use of the method in the survival group sequential trials is illustrated and the effects of the varied shape parameter on the sample size under the Weibull distribution are explored by employing an example. According to the simulation results, a method to estimate the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution is proposed based on the median survival time of the test drug and the hazard ratio, which are prespecified by the <b>investigators</b> <b>and</b> other participants. 10 + simulations are recommended to achieve the robust estimate of the sample size.

However, {{more and more}} patients are enrolled in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. The involvement of patients in new geographical settings raises questions about scientific and ethical integrity, especially when experience with those settings is lacking {{at the level of}} trial management. We therefore studied to what extent the geographical shift in patient enrolment is anticipated in the composition of trial management teams using the author nationalities on the primary outcome publication as an indicator of leadership. Methods and Findings We conducted a cohort-study among 1, 445 registered trials in www. clinicaltrials. gov that could be matched with a primary outcome publication using clinical trial registry numbers listed in publications. The name of the <b>sponsor</b> <b>and</b> the enrolment countries were extracted from all registrations. The author-addresses of all authors were extracted from the publications. We searched the author-address of all publications to determine whether enrolment countries <b>and</b> <b>sponsors</b> listed on registrations also appeared on a matched publication. Of all sponsors, 80. 1 % were listed with an author-address on the publication. Of all enrolment countries, 50. 3 % appeared with an author-address on the publication. The listing of enrolment countries was especially low for industry-funded trials (39. 9 %) as compared to government (90. 4 %) and not-for-profit funding (93. 7 %). We found that listing of enrolment countries in industry-funded trials was higher for traditional research locations such as the United States (98. 2 %) and Japan (72. 0 %) as compared to nontraditional research locations such as Poland (27. 3 %) and Mexico (14. 1 %). Conclusions Despite patient enrolment efforts, the involvement of researchers from nontraditional locations in trial management as measured by their contribution to manuscript writing is modest.

40|$|On 9 August 1994 the German {{legislature}} {{revised the}} German Drug Law (AMG). Included in the revision is a passage requiring, {{for the first}} time, that the <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> of clinical studies involving human subjects first obtain the approval of an ethics committee before carrying out such studies. According to the legislation, which takes effect on 17 August 1995, approval is to come from 'an independent ethics committee, set up and administered according to state law [emphasis added]' (1). Although it is clear according to the text that the 16 federal states have been empowered to establish ethics committees within their jurisdictions, {{this does not mean}} that the state governments are free to transfer exclusive authority in the matter to their respective medical associations, a step that would effectively abolish Germany's private ethics committees. First, the legislation does not rule out the authorization of private ethics committees. Second, as legal scholars attest, the exclusive control of ethics committees by the medical associations would constitute an illegal monopoly. Third, it is arguable that medical-association ethics committees fail to meet the one prior federal requirement, that of independence. There is a great deal of confusion in Germany today about which kinds of ethics committees (public and/or private) the states will sanction before 17 August 1995. In an attempt to sort things out we present a brief explanation of how ther came to be two kinds of ethics committees in Germany, review the legal battle between the two over the issue of authorization, point out how the German legislature, in passing the recent bill, has missed an opportunity to clarify the issue and, finally suggest why the administration of ethics committees by the medical associations may be incompatible with the requirement that ethics committees be independent...|$|R
40|$|Background]A {{number of}} {{clinical}} trials have encountered difficulties enrolling {{a sufficient number}} of patients upon initiating the trial. Recently, many screening systems that search clinical data warehouses for patients who are eligible for clinical trials have been developed. We aimed to estimate the number of eligible patients using routine electronic medical records (EMRs) and to predict the difficulty of enrolling sufficient patients prior to beginning a trial. [Methods]Investigator-initiated clinical trials that were conducted at Kyoto University Hospital between July 2004 and January 2011 were included in this study. We searched the EMRs for eligible patients and calculated the eligible EMR patient index by dividing the number of eligible patients in the EMRs by the target sample size. Additionally, we divided the trial eligibility criteria into corresponding data elements in the EMRs to evaluate the completeness of mapping clinical manifestation in trial eligibility criteria into structured data elements in the EMRs. We evaluated the correlation between the index and the accrual achievement with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. [Results]Thirteen of 19 trials did not achieve their original target sample size. Overall, 55 % of the trial eligibility criteria were mapped into data elements in EMRs. The accrual achievement demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the eligible EMR patient index (r[*]=[*] 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 42 to 0. 92). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an eligible EMR patient index cut-off value of 1. 7, with a sensitivity of 69. 2 % and a specificity of 100. 0 %. [Conclusions]Our study suggests that the eligible EMR patient index remains exploratory but could be a useful component of the feasibility study when planning a clinical trial.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The global {{entrepreneurialism}} of {{biomedical research}} and its {{close ties with}} the private sector have introduced strong financial incentives into the public arena. In Israel, powerful forces of privatization have strengthened the enterprise of competitive research. A pivotal concern is whether an increasingly competitive research environment will create conflicts of interest (COI) impacting researchers and research institutions' ability to protect research validity and research participants' health and safety. In Israel, scandals have raised concerns about whether those responsible for conducting and evaluating research are committed to ethical standards. In response, the government has introduced regulatory mechanisms aimed at limiting the negative influence of commercial COI. The regulatory scheme imposes upon the hospitals and the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) the responsibility to identify and eliminate COI arising from the relationships between commercial <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> <b>investigators.</b> The scheme also calls for screening to determine eligibility of government advisors used for scientific input in the review of new trial applications. This dissertation evaluates whether government-created mechanisms are adequate responses to commercial incentives in the otherwise self-regulated research landscape in Israel. The collection and analysis of empirical data reveals practical interpretations and implementation of the regulatory mechanisms. The U. S. regulatory model illuminates a comparative model for attending to similar COI challenges. This dissertation suggests that current Israeli regulatory safeguards are lacking crucial standards and norms. The lack of standardized objectives and responsibilities, and the substantial variations found in institutional interpretation and implementation, require further regulatory intervention by the Israeli government. The objectives of this dissertation are to promote transparency and accountability within the Israeli biomedical scheme. The analysis is premised {{on the assumption that the}} protection of human subjects and the preservation of integrity within the context of medical research must evolve in tandem with the changing world of innovation and creative technologies. Securing legitimate standards and norms will benefit not only the research community, but also the welfare of the general public and those who contribute to scientific inquiry as clinical trial participants...|$|R

These parties usually assume the responsibility for drafting and driving data sharing or consortium agreements. Intellectual Property (IP) regulatory and guidance frameworks typically have a European or North American basis. Moreover, there is often no or poor intellectual property expertise available to consortium partners from developing countries. Accordingly, data sharing or consortium agreements drafted by PIs or sponsors from affluent countries are sometimes perceived by consortium partners in developing countries as being biased in favour {{of the interests of}} their consortium partners from the developed world. PIs from affluent countries should accordingly ensure that their colleagues from the developing world are prospectively involved in the drafting of consortium or data-sharing agreements. Such an approach could see data access and research output issues explicitly and meaningfully governed. Such an agreement should describe the management of intellectual property rights related to the proposed project, including plans for sharing data, information, and materials resulting from the award.

METHODS: We used a structured, cross-sectional mail survey of medical-school research administrators responsible for negotiating clinical-trial agreements with industry sponsors. RESULTS: Of 122 institutions approached, 107 participated. There was a high degree of consensus among administrators about the acceptability of several contractual provisions relating to publications. For example, more than 85 percent reported that their office would not approve provisions giving industry sponsors the authority to revise manuscripts or decide whether results should be published. There was considerable disagreement about the acceptability of provisions allowing the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses in manuscripts (24 percent allowed them, 47 percent disallowed them, and 29 percent were not sure whether they should allow them), draft the manuscript (50 percent allowed it, 40 percent disallowed it, and 11 percent were not sure whether they should allow it), <b>and</b> prohibit <b>investigators</b> from sharing data with third parties after the trial is over (41 percent allowed it, 34 percent disallowed it, and 24 percent were not sure whether they should allow it). Disputes were common after the agreements had been signed and most frequently centered on payment (75 percent of administrators reported at least one such dispute in the previous year), intellectual property (30 percent), and control of or access to data (17 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Standards for certain restrictive provisions in clinical-trial agreements with industry sponsors vary considerably among academic medical centers. Greater sharing of information about legal relationships with industry sponsors is desirable in order to build consensus about appropriate standards. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

An international phase 3 trial was done to assess the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in these patients. Methods We did this trial at 114 centres in 16 countries. Patients with documented metastatic colorectal cancer and progression during or within 3 months after the last standard therapy were randomised (in a 2 : 1 ratio; by computergenerated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size six); stratifi ed by previous treatment with VEGF-targeting drugs, time from diagnosis of metastatic disease, and geographical region) to receive best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily, for the fi rst 3 week s of each 4 week cycle. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The study <b>sponsor,</b> participants, <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> were masked to treatment assignment. Effi cacy analyses were by intention to treat.

40|$|Total kidney volume (TKV) is a {{promising}} imaging biomarker for tracking and predicting {{the natural history}} of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Methods: A drug development tool was developed by linking longitudinal TKV measurements to the probability of a 30 % decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease. Drug development tools were developed based on observational data collected over multiple decades for an eGFR decline and end-stage renal disease in 641 and 866 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively. Results: The statistical association between predicted TKV at the time of a 30 % decline of eGFR and {{that at the time of}} end-stage renal disease were both highly significant (P < 0. 0001). The drug development tool was applied to demonstrate the utility of trial enrichment according to prespecified baseline TKV, age, and eGFR as enrollment criteria in hypothetical clinical trials. Patients with larger TKV (≥ 1000 ml) displayed steeper slopes of hazard, which translated into a higher risk of a 30 % decline of eGFR within each baseline age (< or ≥ 40 years) or baseline eGFR (< or ≥ 50 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2) subgroups. Discussion: These results suggest that, when eGFR is preserved, patients with larger TKV are more likely to progress to a 30 % decline of eGFR within the course of a clinical trial, whereas eGFR and age displayed limited predictive value of disease progression in early disease. Pharmaceutical <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> academic <b>investigators</b> are encouraged to prospectively employ the above drug development tool to optimize trial designs in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease...|$|R

METHODOLOGY: Two surveys were conducted through the portal of National Monitoring Centre of Clinical Trials ([URL] The first survey focused on the local IEC resources and on the "centre-specific" documentation that local IEC required from the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>and</b> local Principal <b>Investigator</b> (PI). The second focused on "single document" required in the form of statements from the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>and</b> the PI.

40|$|Clinical Study Agreements (CSAs) {{can have}} {{profound}} effects {{both on the}} protection of human subjects and on the independence of investigators to conduct research with scientific integrity. <b>Sponsors,</b> institutions, <b>and</b> even <b>investigators</b> may fail to give adequate attention to these issues in the negotiation of CSAs. Despite the key role of CSAs in structuring ethically important aspects of research, they remain largely unregulated and unreviewed for adherence to ethical norms. Academic institutions routinely enter into research contracts that fail to meet adequate ethical standards. This is a failing that can have serious consequences. Accordingly, {{it is necessary that}} some independent body have the authority both to review research contracts for compliance with norms of subject protection and ethical integrity, and to reject studies that fail to meet ethical standards. Such review should take place {{prior to the start of}} research, not later. Because of its expertise and authority, the institutional ethics review board (IRB or REB) is the appropriate body to undertake such review. Much recent commentary has focused on contractual restrictions on the investigator’s freedom to publish research findings. The Olivieri experience, and that of other investigators, has brought freedom of publication issues into sharp focus. Clinical study agreements also raise a number of other ethical issues relating to human subjects and research integrity, however, including disclosure...|$|R

40|$|To attain good {{medication}} compliance {{is the major}} premise in well-controlled clinical trials. We conducted a questionnaire survey on 40 clinical <b>investigators,</b> 25 <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> 20 trial subjects during Oct. -Dec. 1998 to investigate the correlation among actual circumstances of {{medication compliance}} in trial subjects and the evaluation of medication compliance by clinical <b>investigators</b> <b>and</b> <b>sponsors,</b> <b>and</b> to determine effective measures to improve medication compliance. Whereas almost all clinical <b>investigators</b> <b>and</b> <b>sponsors</b> evaluated or expected over 70 % of medication compliance, the trial subjects answered over 90 %. The clinical <b>investigators</b> (95 %) <b>and</b> the <b>sponsors</b> (96 %) thought in actuality that the primary means to maintain good compliance was for the clinical investigator to individually interview the trial subjects. The sponsors proposed possible adoption of clinical research coordinator's (CRC) support, a specific dispenser device or container, the use of medication diary, etc. However, only a few beneficial medication devices and medication diaries have been provided by the sponsors to date. This survey suggests that the medicine dispenser device and the interview by CRC are very effective to attain good medication compliance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{treatment}} options {{are available for}} patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that progresses after all approved standard therapies, but many patients maintain a good performance status and could be candidates for further therapy. An international phase 3 trial was done to assess the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in these patients. METHODS: We did this trial at 114 centres in 16 countries. Patients with documented metastatic colorectal cancer and progression during or within 3 months after the last standard therapy were randomised (in a 2 : 1 ratio; by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size six); stratified by previous treatment with VEGF-targeting drugs, time from diagnosis of metastatic disease, and geographical region) to receive best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The study <b>sponsor,</b> participants, <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> were masked to treatment assignment. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01103323. FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2010, and March 22, 2011, 1052 patients were screened, 760 patients were randomised to receive regorafenib (n= 505) or placebo (n= 255), and 753 patients initiated treatment (regorafenib n= 500; placebo n= 253; population for safety analyses). The primary endpoint of overall survival was met at a preplanned interim analysis; data cutoff was on July 21, 2011. Median overall survival was 6 · 4 months in the regorafenib group versus 5 · 0 months {{in the placebo group}} (hazard ratio 0 · 77; 95 % CI 0 · 64 - 0 · 94; one-sided p= 0 · 0052). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 465 (93 %) patients assigned regorafenib and in 154 (61 %) of those assigned placebo. The most common adverse events of grade three or higher related to regorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (83 patients, 17 %), fatigue (48, 10 %), diarrhoea (36, 7 %), hypertension (36, 7 %), and rash or desquamation (29, 6 %). INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib is the first small-molecule multikinase inhibitor with survival benefits in metastatic colorectal cancer which has progressed after all standard therapies. The present study provides evidence for a continuing role of targeted treatment after disease progression, with regorafenib offering a potential new line of therapy in this treatment-refractory population.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Until now, only imatinib and sunitinib {{have proven}} {{clinical}} benefit {{in patients with}} gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), but almost all metastatic GIST eventually develop resistance to these agents, resulting in fatal disease progression. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST progressing after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. METHODS: We did this phase 3 trial at 57 hospitals in 17 countries. Patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable GIST, with failure of at least previous imatinib and sunitinib were randomised in a 2 : 1 ratio (by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size 12); stratified by treatment line and geographical region) to receive either oral regorafenib 160 mg daily or placebo, plus best supportive care in both groups, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The study <b>sponsor,</b> participants, <b>and</b> <b>investigators</b> were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). At disease progression, patients assigned placebo could crossover to open-label regorafenib. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01271712. RESULTS: From Jan 4, to Aug 18, 2011, 240 patients were screened and 199 were randomised to receive regorafenib (n= 133) or matching placebo (n= 66). Data cutoff was Jan 26, 2012. Median PFS per independent blinded central review was 4 · 8 months (IQR 1 · 4 - 9 · 2) for regorafenib and 0 · 9 months (0 · 9 - 1 · 8) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0 · 27, 95 % CI 0 · 19 - 0 · 39; p< 0 · 0001). After progression, 56 patients (85 %) assigned placebo crossed over to regorafenib. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 130 (98 %) patients assigned regorafenib and 45 (68 %) patients assigned placebo. The most common regorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypertension (31 of 132, 23 %), hand-foot skin reaction (26 of 132, 20 %), and diarrhoea (seven of 132, 5 %). INTERPRETATION: The {{results of this study}} show that oral regorafenib can provide a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic GIST after progression on standard treatments. As far as we are aware, this is the first clinical trial to show benefit from a kinase inhibitor in this highly refractory population of patients.
