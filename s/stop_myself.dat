500|$|After {{the success}} of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. [...] Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: [...] "This last Christmas, {{there were so many}} fucking presents under the tree... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't <b>stop</b> <b>myself</b> from spoiling her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to <b>stop</b> <b>myself</b> in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Down the Line {{followed}} in 1990. This album produced four more singles for Loveless. The title track, also penned by Kostas, was first at No.5 on the Hot Country Songs charts. Following {{it was a}} cover of Lucinda Williams' [...] "The Night's Too Long", then [...] "I'm That Kind of Girl" [...] and [...] "Blue Memories". Her final MCA studio album, 1991's Up Against My Heart, produced the Top 10 hit [...] "Hurt Me Bad (In a Real Good Way)", while followup singles [...] "Jealous Bone" [...] and [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Myself</b> from Loving You", were less successful. Following the latter, she also sang a guest vocal on [...] "Send a Message to My Heart", a single from Dwight Yoakam's If There Was a Way. Up Against My Heart included backing vocals from Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, Mac McAnally, and Lyle Lovett, who also wrote the final track [...] "God Will".|$|E

60|$|I floated on, and I {{would have}} floated past the Inn, and perhaps {{have gotten into}} the Land of Never-Come-Back-Again, only I caught at the branch of an apple-tree, and so I <b>stopped</b> <b>myself,</b> though the apple-blossoms came falling down like pink and white snowflakes.|$|R
2500|$|Midway {{through the}} 1996 NBA Finals, Seattle coach George Karl made the {{decision}} to assign Payton to play defense as a shooting guard instead of his normal point guard assignment in order to defend Jordan. Though the Bulls won the series, Seattle's (and especially Payton's) defense held Jordan and the Bulls to their lowest offensive output in an NBA finals and [...] "frustrated {{the best player in the}} game." [...] In his first three NBA Finals, Jordan averaged 36.3 points per game and had scored at least 30 points in 14 of his 17 games. However, in the 1996 Finals, Jordan averaged 27.3 points per game and scored more than 30 points in only one of the six games. In a game 5 preview after Payton had held Jordan to a career NBA Finals low of 23, an NBA pregame show described the rivalry of two strong defensive players renowned for their competitiveness. [...] " [...] lowest output in a Finals game, much of it with Payton guarding him. Though afterwards, Jordan refused to give Payton credit, saying 'No one can stop me, I can only <b>stop</b> <b>myself.</b> I missed some easy shots.' [...] The truth is, Jordan finds the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year [...] annoying. He views the [...] as impudent, and he would love to have a big game at [...] expense." [...] (NBA on NBC Preview, Game 5) The Sonics won that game by 21 points and Payton held Jordan to 26 points – Jordan's second-lowest-scoring Finals game in his career up to that point. In game 6, which the Bulls would win to capture the Championship, Payton played 47 minutes and Jordan missed 14 of his 19 shots, getting a career Finals low 22 points. Bill Walton, commentating for NBC at the time, said Payton [...] "outplayed" [...] Jordan during the second half of the series, and that Seattle coach George Karl would [...] "rue" [...] the decision to [...] "hide [...] from 'the king'" [...] in the early games of the series. During this series, Payton and his Sonics also held Jordan's Bulls to the lowest-scoring quarter in their NBA Finals history. Michael Jordan would never score fewer points in an NBA Finals game than his 22 points in game 6, and would never be held under 30 points more than twice in a Finals series, which the Sonics did five times.|$|E

60|$|No young actor, {{receiving}} {{his first}} round of applause, could have felt a keener thrill of gratification than I did at those words.

60|$|I was so {{delighted that}} for a moment I nearly forgot myself and shouted with joy, but I remembered in time how shy he was, and <b>stopped</b> <b>myself.</b> But I ran to him and jumped up quite quietly, and he told me to lie down.

6000|$|... "At last he grew impatient, {{and without}} warning lifted {{his gun and}} fired at me, aiming low, for he feared lest the ball should pierce my mistress.

"I {{was about}} to tell her Isadore, but I <b>stopped</b> <b>myself.</b> It was barely {{possible}} that she might have heard the name of the man who for two years had composed the peculiar and delicious ices of which she was so fond; she might even have seen him, and the name might call up some recollection. 'Did you say your name was Isaac?' I called out to the man.|$|R
6000|$|Something in {{the manner}} in which he {{pronounced}} these words conveyed to Beatrice a sense of the emptiness and worthlessness of her motives, and she answered earnestly, [...] "I was wrong, papa; I know it is a love of saying clever things that often leads me wrong. It was so to-day, for I could have <b>stopped</b> <b>myself,</b> but for the pleasure of making fun. It is vanity, and I will try to subdue it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am always}} prudent," [...] I answered, and started in advance. I found the descent of the {{mountain}} much more pleasant than the ascent. It was positively exhilarating. I jumped from rocks and bluffs eight and ten feet in height, and touched the ground as gently as if I had stepped down but two feet. I ran down steep paths, and, {{with the aid of}} my alpenstock, <b>stopped</b> <b>myself</b> in an instant. I was careful to avoid dangerous places, but the runs and jumps I made were such as no man had ever made before upon that mountain-side. Once only I heard my companion's voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I {{have cut}} my {{fingers to the}} bone," [...] Beorn groaned; [...] "I feel as if I were holding a bar of hot iron. You had {{scarcely}} started before I heard voices; they were evidently those of men going their rounds, so I caught hold of the rope and swung myself off, but before I got my legs fairly round the rope I began to slip, and though I gripped it as hard as I could I could not <b>stop</b> <b>myself,</b> but slid down like lightning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{was running}} {{along by the}} side of the cliff, when my foot slipped. I came down on my knee and hurt myself frightfully; I was in such pain that I could not <b>stop</b> <b>myself</b> from rolling over. I tried to swim, which, of course, would have been nothing for me, but I think my knee is smashed, and it hurt me so frightfully that I screamed out with pain, and had to give up. I could not have held on much longer, and should {{certainly}} have been drowned had you not seen me. I was never so pleased as when I heard your voice above.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reaction}} from my fear, {{and the knowledge}} that the terrible deed I had come to do was no longer necessary, made me boyish and eager. I went up the steerage companion-way two steps at a time, with nothing distinct in my mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the surprise breakfast was quite ready for her. As I rounded the galley, a new satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils inside. I sprang up the break of the poop, and saw—Wolf Larsen. What of my impetus and the stunning surprise, I clattered three or four steps along the deck before I could <b>stop</b> <b>myself.</b> He was standing in the companion-way, only his head and shoulders visible, staring straight at me. His arms were resting on the half-open slide. He made no movement whatever—simply stood there, staring at me.|$|E
60|$|There are already, you see, some quaint {{restrictions}} in that last sentence, whereat sundry {{of our friends}} will start, and others stop. I must <b>stop</b> also, <b>myself,</b> therefore, {{for a minute or}} two, to insist on them.|$|R
60|$|I had now leisure {{to examine}} the purse. It was a stiff leather purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had evidently {{polished}} up with whitening, for my greater delight. But its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together {{in a bit of}} paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, 'For Davy. With my love.' I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and <b>stopped</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
60|$|But I did not <b>stop.</b> I found <b>myself</b> in {{the dining}} room, and at once put the long table between us.|$|R
