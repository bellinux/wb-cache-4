40|$|Falls {{of small}} pieces of rock from between roof bolts {{continue}} to cause fatalities and to injure hundreds of coal miners each year. Roof screen {{is the most effective}} way to prevent these incidents, but some mines are reluctant to use it because they believe installing screen can be awkward, expensive and time-consuming. The most common type of roof bolting machine used in mines today is the dual boom, outside-controlled roof bolter. Mines who install roof screen using these machines have developed some machine modifications and techniques to ease roof <b>screen</b> <b>installation.</b> This paper describes some successful techniques and machine modifications that are being used in productive mines to assist with roof <b>screen</b> <b>installation.</b> Since the material handling involved with roof <b>screen</b> <b>installation</b> can expose miners to an increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ergonomists, designed machine modifications and implemented a series of tests to evaluate roof screen handling procedures for outside-controlled, dual boom roof bolting machines. Roof <b>screen</b> <b>installation</b> can also have a positive economic impact on a mine by reducing the cost of injuries, workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 compensation, required spot or re-bolting, and clean-up of long term travel and belt entries...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} the annual increase in juvenile Chinook and steelhead survival from screen installation/restoration at four water diversion locations on the Sacramento River (Wilkins Slough, Tisdale, M&T Ranch, and the Consolidated Pumping Facility). Of these four diversions, the largest benefit to salmonids {{was estimated to}} come from <b>screen</b> <b>installation</b> at the Tisdale diversion and the Consolidated Pumping Facility diversion. At the Tisdale diversion, late-fall Chinook, steelhead, and fall Chinook would benefit the most from <b>screen</b> <b>installation,</b> with an estimated 1. 88 %, 1. 68 %, and 1. 42 % annual increase in total outmigrant survival, respectively. At the Consolidated Pumping Facility diversion, late-fall Chinook, steelhead, and fall Chinook would also benefit the most from <b>screen</b> <b>installation,</b> with an estimated 0. 59 %, 0. 52 %, and 0. 44 % annual increase in total outmigrant survival, respectively. The majority of fish passage through the section of river adjacent {{to each of the}} four diversions is taking place at a time when water diversion is generally low. This temporal separation between run timing and peak water diversion limits the number of fish threatened by any deficiency in screen function, and results in relatively small benefit...|$|R

While the screen prevents rock fall injuries, its installation may expose the miner to musculoskeletal stress. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate methods of handling roof <b>screen.</b> Subjects performed <b>installation</b> tasks under a normal and intervention condition while trunk kinematics and muscle activity data were collected. Trunk kinematics were not affected by the intervention but were significantly higher in the morning than in the afternoon.

30|$|The inside-casing {{gravel packing}} {{is the best}} option for the {{candidate}} well for two reasons. First, it is mechanically reliable, {{and it would be}} convenient to install. Second, the gravels are not packed during completion of the well. Therefore, it is easier and quicker to perform the operation through workover since the well is already under production. It is also noted that the open-hole <b>screen</b> <b>installation</b> would not be a solution for this well because the completion is not open-hole. Even though the underreamed-casing gravel pack technique eliminates flow restriction, it can only be used at single-zone completions.|$|R

This draws upon French writer Georges Perec’s idea of the infra-ordinary – ‘the banal, the quotidian, the obvious, the common, the ordinary, the infra-ordinary’ – in domestic spaces. The works aim to bring attention to the enigmatic power of these spaces.
