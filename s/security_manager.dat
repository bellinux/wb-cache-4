5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel car so Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still {{spent most of his}} life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his <b>security</b> <b>manager,</b> which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E

Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site <b>security</b> <b>manager</b> told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café.

25|$|Version 3.0 {{retained}} {{all of the}} functionality {{from previous}} versions and added new features and tools. Support for DirectX 8.1 and OpenGL was added, allowing Mac users to play some Windows games without the need to boot into Windows with Boot Camp. A new feature called SmartSelect offers cross OS file and application integration by allowing the user to open Windows files with Mac OS X programs and vice versa. Parallels Explorer was introduced, which allows the user to browse their Windows system files in Mac OS X without actually launching Windows. A new snapshot feature was included, allowing one to restore their virtual machine environment to a previous state in case of issues. Further, Parallels added a <b>security</b> <b>manager</b> to {{limit the amount of}} interaction between the Windows and Mac OS X installations. This version included a long-awaited complete “Parallels tools'” driver suite for Linux guest operating systems. Therefore, integration between Mac OS X and Linux guest-OS's has been greatly improved.|$|E

Regarding information security of secure sustainable computing, the role of information <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> has received attention.

This study shows that the transformational leadership (in forms such as idealized influence, individualized consideration, and inspirational motivation) of information <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> can improve the effectiveness of information security. The enforcement and relevance of information security policies could be mediating effects {{on the effectiveness of}} information security.

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>managers</b> must scan through {{multiple}} continuous data streams issuing from diverse sources {{in an effort}} to defend computer networks from attack. However, manual aggregation of this information is not achievable for vital decision-making within a narrow timeframe if <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> are not welleducated in current attack vectors. Thus, extensive and periodic training in attack methods, situation awareness and decision-making strategy should be required. However, it is challenging to provide training environments that can properly simulate multi-stage attacks effectively. <b>Security</b> <b>managers</b> are also impeded by the lack of dynamic feedback afforded by traditional training. This can result in false positive or negative readings of their preparedness. In this paper we discuss strategies to provide effective simulation and training of computer network defense for <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> through the integration of knowledge, intelligent agents, and proven network defense technologies...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a common}} {{perception}} among corporate <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> that their occupation is afforded less status and is rewarded less well than the other management functions within business. In response to similar conceptions {{of the need to}} raise the value and status of their work, other occupations have historically embarked on so-called ‘professional projects’ whereby they collectively attempt to harness their specialist skills and knowledge as a commodity, the value of which they seek to raise and maintain. This small- scale qualitative study is intended to provide an insight into the analysis of corporate <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> and directors as to the health of their occupation and its standing in the modern corporate world. The study then examines the methods which other occupations have used to successfully improve the status of their practitioners and the value of their work. Finally, based on the analysis of the <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> and directors and the experience of other occupations, a broad strategy for corporate security’s own professional project is proposed. This study suggests that corporate security is currently enjoying divergent fortunes. The most successful <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> and directors enjoy parity of status with their peers from other functions and have taken on responsibilities far in excess of the traditional security department’s remit. However, {{at the other end of}} the spectrum there are many <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> who are afforded an inferior status to that of managers from other functions. As a result, they struggle to attract significant responsibility or resources within their organisations. The research suggests that other management functions have historically faced similar problems in their development. These other functions have used strategies of occupational negotiation, boundary work, closure and monopolisation to overcome their problems. Together these measures have constituted professional projects. Based on the appetite for professionalisation among our <b>security</b> <b>managers,</b> and the success of professional projects in comparable occupations, this study concludes that security management should embark on a professional project of its own...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSecuring {{surveillance}} {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) in hostile environments such as borders, perimeters and battlefields during Base Station (BS) {{failure is}} challenging. Surveillance WSNs are highly vulnerable to BS failure. The attackers can render the network useless by only destroying the BS as the needed efforts to destroy the BS is much less than {{that is needed to}} destroy the network. This attack scenario will give the attackers the best chance to compromise many legitimate nodes. Previous works have tackled BS failure by deploying a mobile BS or by using multiple BSs. Despite the best electronic countermeasures, intrusion tolerance and anti-traffic analysis strategies to protect the BSs, an adversary still can destroy them. This paper proposes a novel security architecture called Surveillance Security (SurvSec) for reliable network recovery from single BS failure of surveillance WSN with single BS. SurvSec relies on a set of sensor nodes serve as <b>Security</b> <b>Managers</b> for management and storage of the security related data of all sensor nodes. SurvSec security architecture provides methodologies for choosing and changing the <b>security</b> <b>managers</b> of the surveillance WSN. SurvSec has three components: (1) Sensor nodes serve as <b>Security</b> <b>Managers,</b> (2) Data Storage System, (3) Data Recovery System. Furthermore, both the frame format of the stored data is carefully built and the security threats are encoded to allow minimum overheads for SurvSec security architecture. In this paper, we provide detailed specifications of SurvSec security architecture. We evaluate our designed security architecture for reliable network recovery from BS failure. Our evaluation shows that the proposed new security architecture can meet all the desired specifications and our analysis shows that the provided <b>Security</b> <b>Managers</b> are capable of network recovery from BS failure...|$|R
