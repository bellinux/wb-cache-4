5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} I {{have learned that}} the public peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have suffered this too long.|$|E
5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

25|$|Ladies and Gentlemen I {{accept the}} flowers as a memento of {{reconciliation}} {{between the white}} and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as {{it comes from a}} colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. (Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E
25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E

500|$|In {{accordance}} with his mother's wishes, the infant Spiro was baptized an Episcopalian, rather than into the Greek Orthodox Church of his father. Nevertheless, Agnew senior was the dominant figure within the family, {{and a strong}} influence on his son. When in 1969 Baltimore's Greek community endowed a scholarship in Theodore Agnew's name, Spiro Agnew, by then vice president, told the gathering: [...] "I am proud to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{grew up in the}} light of my father.

500|$|Dicen Que Soy (They <b>Say</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Am) is {{the third}} studio album by Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India released on September 20, 1994 by RMM Records. The album was produced by American musician Sergio George, who chose the songs for India to record {{with an emphasis on}} feminism to suit with her voice. The production mixes salsa music with other rhythms such as funk and timba. Five singles were released from the record with [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] and [...] "Ese Hombre" [...] topping the Billboard Tropical Songs chart.|$|E

Severely injured {{in an accident}} {{a week before the}} executions, Owen reportedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed by saying, [...] "I was at the Haymarket riot and am an anarchist and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> threw a bomb in that riot." [...] He was an anarchist and apparently had been in Chicago at the time but other accounts note that long before his accident he had said he was at the Haymarket and saw the bomb thrower. Owen may have been trying to save the condemned men.|$|E
