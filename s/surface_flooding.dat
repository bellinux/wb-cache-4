The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{technical}} options for warning of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> in England andWales and {{presents the results}} of an Environment Agency funded project. Following the extensive <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> experienced in summer 2007 a rainfall threshold-based Extreme Rainfall Alert (ERA) was piloted by the Met Office and Environment Agency providing initial steps towards the establishment of a warning for some types of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> The findings of this paper are based primarily on feedback on technical options from a range of professionals involved in flood forecasting and warning and flood risk management, about the current alerts and about the potential options for developing a more targeted <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service. Providing <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> warnings presents a set of technical, forecasting and warning challenges related to the rapid onset of flooding, the localised nature of the flooding, and the linking of rainfall and flood forecasts to flood likelihood and impact on the ground. Some examples of rainfall alerting and <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning services from other countries are evaluated, as well as a small number of recently implemented local services in England and Wales. Various potential options for implementation of a service are then explored and assessed. The paper concludes that development of a <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service for England and Wales is feasible and is likely to be useful to emergency responders and operational agencies, although developing such a service for the pluvial components of this type of flooding is likely to be feasible sooner than for other components of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> such as that caused by sewers. A targeted <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service could be developed for professional emergency responders in the first instance rather than for the public for whom such a service without further operational testing and piloting would be premature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> occurs {{regularly}} across England and Wales, {{especially during}} the summer months. It is widely acknowledged that <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> presents a particular challenge to forecasters because of the difficulties inherent in forecasting intense localised rainfall and the highly complex runoff and drainage processes which operate at the surface, particularly in urban areas. The Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) {{has a responsibility to}} provide guidance on the risk of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> to Category 1 and 2 responders across England and Wales. Consequently, there is the requirement for improved methods for forecasting <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk and the FFC is currently involved in developing and trialling a novel <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> forecasting system, the <b>Surface</b> Water <b>Flooding</b> Hazard Impact Model (SWF HIM). The SWF HIM offers significant advances over existing <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> forecasting methods used by the FFC, including provision of a risk-based approach. The SWF HIM links probabilistic runoff forecasts from the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Grid-to-Grid model with a library of pre-calculated surface water impact information compiled by the Health and Safety Laboratory. These probabilistic runoff forecasts are combined with impact information to provide a forecast of <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk at a 1 km 2 resolution across England and Wales. This presentation outlines the methodology together with some initial results from the trial. The work has been undertaken as part of the UK’s Natural Hazards Partnership (NHP) and also benefits from the close working relationship between the Environment Agency and the Met Office through the FFC...|$|R

40|$|Flooding {{in urban}} areas during heavy rainfall, often {{characterized}} by short duration and high-intensity events, is known as “surface water <b>flooding.</b> ” Analyzing <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk is complex as it requires understanding of biophysical and human factors, such as the localized scale and nature of heavy precipitation events, characteristics of the urban area affected (including detailed topography and drainage networks), and the spatial distribution {{of economic and social}} vulnerability.

40|$|Key {{findings}} and recommendations: • This research has addressed {{the challenge of}} <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> forecasting by producing the UK’s first operational <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk forecast with a 24 -hour lead time. This was successfully used in Glasgow at the Commonwealth Games in 2014. • The methodology of the Glasgow Pilot has been developed to use nationally available datasets and a transferrable approach which will help urban areas in Scotland improve their resilience to and preparedness for future flooding. • It also delivered a novel method for forecasting the impacts of flooding in real-time and increased knowledge on communicating uncertainties in flood risk. • A real-time forecasting system for <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> from intense rainfall needs to use models that represent surface runoff production, surface water inundation and movement, and how water travels via surface and sub-surface pathways, including urban sewerage and drainage networks. Ensemble rainfall prediction models are key to quantifying uncertainty in forecasting the rainfall that causes <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> • Detailed <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> inundation models exist and are widely used in design and research activities, but none {{were found to be}} ready for real-time use. The Grid-to-Grid (G 2 G) distributed hydrological model was chosen for used in the Glasgow Pilot as it can provide ensemble forecasts of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding,</b> and takes account of the intensity and pattern of rainfall, land cover and slope, and antecedent conditions. • The research developed a novel methodology for impact assessment that links surface runoff to the severity of flooding impacts on people, property and transport. Use is made of a library of information based on SEPA’s Regional Pluvial (rainfall-related) Flood Hazard maps. • For the Glasgow Pilot, G 2 G was operated over a 10 km by 10 km area encompassing Glasgow’s East End and the main areas of activity for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The research team developed an operational application, called FEWS Glasgow, to support running the model in real-time and reporting on the likely impacts of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> A new Daily Glasgow Daily <b>Surface</b> Water <b>Flood</b> Forecast was designed and produced based on operational requirements and emergency responder feedback...|$|R

40|$|Concern {{has arisen}} {{as to whether}} the lack of {{appropriate}} consideration to surface water in urban spatial planning is reducing our capacity to manage <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk. Appropriate tools are required that allow spatial planners to explore opportunities and solutions for <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> at large spatial scales. An urban surface water balance model has been developed that screens large urban areas to identify flooded areas and which allows solutions to be explored. The model hypothesis is that key hydrological characteristics; storage volume and location, flow paths and surface water generation capture the key processes responsible for <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> The model uses a LiDAR DEM (Light Detection and Ranging Digital Elevation Model) as the basis for determining surface water accumulation in a catchment and has been developed so that it requires minimal inputs and computational resources. The urban surface water balance approach is applied to Keighley in West Yorkshire where several instances of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> have been reported. Data for validating <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk models is sparse because such flooding events are of short duration, very localized and distributed across the catchment. This research used a postal questionnaire, followed up with site visits to collect data on <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> locations in Keighley. The validation exercise confirmed that the major processes responsible for flooding are largely well represented in the model for situations where interaction with the urban sewer network is well represented by the assumptions made in the model. A qualitative analysis based on field visits revealed that the degree of interaction with the sewer network varies spatially, and as the importance of the interaction of the sewer system increases, the accuracy of the model results are lowered. It also highlighted that local detail not present in the DEM, the presence of urban drainage assets and the performance of the sewer system, which are not be represented in the model, can determine the accuracy of model results. Model results were used as a basis to develop solutions to <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> A least cost path methodology was developed to identify managed flood routes as a solution. These were translated into model inputs in the form a modified DEM. It was shown that the simple and fast representation of <b>flood</b> routes and <b>surface</b> storage is of considerable benefit for scenario analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|During a {{flood event}} over a karst watershed, the {{connections}} between surface and ground waters appear to be complex ones. The karst may attenuate <b>surface</b> <b>floods</b> by absorbing water or contribute to the <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> by direct contribution of karst waters in the rivers (perennial and overflowing springs) and by diffuse resurgence along the hillslopes. If {{it is possible to}} monitor each known outlet of a karst system, the diffuse contribution is yet difficult to assess. Furthermore, all these connections vary over time according to several factors such as the water content of the soil and underground, the rainfall characteristics, the runoff pathways. Therefore, the contribution of each compartment is generally difficult to assess, and flood dynamics are not fully understood. To face these misunderstandings and difficulties, we analysed surface waters during six recent flood events in the Lirou watershed (a karst tributary of the Lez, in South of France). Because of the specific chemical signature of karst waters, chemical analyses can supply information about water pathways and flood dynamics. Then, we used the dilution law to combine chemical results, flow data and field observations to assess the dynamics of the karst component of the flood. To end, we discussed the surface or karst origin of the waters responsible for the apparent runoff coefficient rise during flash karst flood...|$|R
