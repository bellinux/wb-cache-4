Unlike modern machines, fixed-point numbers were treated as fractions (notional decimal point just to right of the sign bit), <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> produce garbage if the divisor was not larger than the dividend; there was no protection against that situation. In the Block II AGC, a double-precision dividend started in A and L (the Block II LP), and the correctly signed remainder was delivered in L. That considerably simplified the subroutine for double precision division.|$|E

500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?'

[...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child.

500|$|Unlike {{the test}} audience, {{television}} critics generally reacted positively to the pilot, viewing it as original and innovative, USA Today critic Tom Green summarized {{the show as}} a [...] "crisply funny blend of stand-up routines interwoven with more traditional sitcom stuff". Eric Mink of St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote he thought the show was unusual and intriguing, yet [...] "quite funny". Joe Stein of the San Diego Evening Tribune commented [...] "Not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format, but Seinfeld does". A more negative response came from a The Fresno Bee critic, that stated [...] "I liked the concept, but Seinfeld 's jokes were so dull that you hoped the standup stuff would fly by <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{get back to the}} story".

500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had to actually go underneath the shark <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see his teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

[...] Mike Nelson of Game Informer agreed and noted the game's excellent dialogue, stating [...] "the script has all the overwrought melodrama you’d expect from giant talking robots." [...] Several critics also gave high marks for War for Cybertrons multiplayer. [...] IGN's Arthur Gies noted the influences from Unreal Championship, Tribes, Team Fortress 2, and [...] adding that [...] "War for Cybertron leverages its transformation mechanic to create something that feels shockingly new." [...] Tom McShea of GameSpot noted that the game's Escalation mode provided a Transformers twist on Gears of Wars Horde mode. [...] GamePros Kat Bailey noted that the multiplayer was [...] "probably the most appealing part of the package", adding it had a [...] "strong suite [...] options." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller lauded the ability to play through the game's campaign with up to three players online, as did G4TV's Matt Kell. [...] Both reviewers also praised the new character designs, with Kell calling them [...] "inventive." [...] Wired.com's John Mix Meyer gave praise to the game's campaign length, stating [...] "The game’s 10-hour single-player campaign means there’s plenty of time for the crazy transformations to strut their stuff." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer praised the transformation animations. [...] He stated players will [...] "occasionally wish there was a Max Payne slow-mo option <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> appreciate the nuance of these feats a little more." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
