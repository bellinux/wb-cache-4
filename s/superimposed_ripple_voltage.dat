2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] <b>Ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|R
2500|$|In {{cases where}} <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> is insignificant, like battery chargers, the input filter {{may be a}} single series {{resistor}} to adjust the output voltage to that required by the circuit. [...] A resistor reduces both output <b>voltage</b> and <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> proportionately. [...] A disadvantage of a resistor input filter is that it consumes power {{in the form of}} waste heat that is not available to the load, so it is employed only in low current circuits.|$|R
50|$|Ripple factor (γ) may {{be defined}} as the ratio of the root mean square (rms) value of the <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> to the {{absolute}} value of the DC component of the output voltage, usually expressed as a percentage. However, <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> is also commonly expressed as the peak-to-peak value. This is largely because peak-to-peak is both easier to measure on an oscilloscope and is simpler to calculate theoretically. Filter circuits intended for the reduction of ripple are usually called smoothing circuits.|$|R

5000|$|For the {{rms value}} of the <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage,</b> the {{calculation}} is more involved as {{the shape of the}} ripple waveform has a bearing on the result. Assuming a sawtooth waveform is a similar assumption to the ones above and yields the result: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{scenario in}} AC to DC conversion is a rectifier without any smoothing circuitry at all. The <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> is very large in this situation; the peak-to-peak <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is equal to}} the peak AC voltage. A more common arrangement is to allow the rectifier to work into a large smoothing capacitor which acts as a reservoir. After a peak in output voltage the capacitor (C) supplies the current to the load (R) and continues to do so until the capacitor voltage has fallen to the value of the now rising next half-cycle of rectified voltage. At that point the rectifiers turn on again and deliver current to the reservoir until peak voltage is again reached. If the time constant, CR, is large in comparison to the period of the AC waveform, then a reasonably accurate approximation can be made by assuming that the capacitor voltage falls linearly. A further useful assumption can be made if the ripple is small compared to the DC voltage. In this case the phase angle through which the rectifiers conduct will be small and it can be assumed that the capacitor is discharging all the way from one peak to the next with little loss of accuracy.With the above assumptions the peak-to-peak <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> can be calculated as: ...|$|R
