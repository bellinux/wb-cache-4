What a {{beautiful}} night to {{sit in front of}} a nice warm fire. The wind blows through these barracks like a seive [sic]. We had a fire going {{in the middle of the}} floor a while ago, but for some strange reason, Major Troop (commandant) didn’t appreciate its warmth. Odd fellow that. I just got back from a gruesome hour in the Link Trainer. I had a different teacher this time. This one was blonde, but engaged, so we had a lot to talk about. She’s getting married in March too. All we talked about was you and her husband-to-be. I didn’t get much Link Time in I guess. Well honey, I got paid today at last. Right after I’d smoked my last cigarette and spent my last dime, in fact I had had to borrow a nickel to do that; fine thing. I didn’t have the Cross-Country today,—the weather was bad. If it’s clear tomorrow I might have it then, but I’ll tell you all that tonight of [sic] the phone. Steve seems to be quite interested in Woody, he’s sorry he won’t be able to see her this weekend. Maybe she can come up for the air show on the 9 th. He’d like her to. Do you think you could come up, darling? I think Bobby 2 ̆ 6 Mom are, so you two could come up with them. We’re not going to fly in it, but there’s going to be about 70 B- 17 ’s, 2 ̆ 6 a mess of 24 ’s. In fact every ship the army has including the A- 26 2 ̆ 6 the J. P. ’s (Jet Propulsion). I want you to see the A- 26, honey. It’s the sweetest ship we have, in my opinion. Gosh if I could only fly one of those—oh well. I’m going to the P. X. to call you now, angel. See you later—I love you. It’s 9 : 30 now. Just got back from the P. X. Gosh it was swell to hear your voice darling, even if you did have a sore throat, and a sprained ankle. Everything happens to me. Steve is very aggravated now, he wants to know what the story is with Woody. I’ll find out for him this weekend. (I hope you don’t get this until Monday). Oh darling, I love you so much. It’s too good to be true, we’re going to have one whole day together, for a change. I’ll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> It seems good to think that this time tomorrow I’ll be with you. I love you, darling, with all my heart. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E

A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn. 5, Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart Field, New York Thursday Dearest Judson— Honey, I’m {{so sorry}} {{that the last}} letter was so short. I was so tired last night. What a dream I had. All about Jackie 2 ̆ 6 the fellow {{she was married to}} {{and the rest of the}} models. There was so much {{confusion}} about getting to that wedding. Jackie really looked lovely she was so happy. It was a queer wedding though—Jackie was so nonchant [sicsic] 2 ̆ 6 laughing. That’s something I don’t think I’ll do. Golly, honey, I kept wishing you were there. Wonder what our wedding will be like, hon. Golly, March seems so far away. It’s awful. March is so far or have I said that a few thousand times. It seems even farther because there isn’t any definite date—I can’t count the weeks or day—just months. Tonight the fellow’s going to take the pictures again. Hope they’re better this time. Golly, honey, it seems as though everyone should know by now that we’re getting engaged. Corinne is saying how wonderful Dick is. She thinks he’s a perfect husband 2 ̆ 6 I think you’ll be much better than he. We have long discussions on how good a husband our various friend[s] would be. You’ll be better than any of them. I hope that I’ll be home when you call tonight. It’s going to be very confusing because I’m not sure what time he’ll be through taking those pictures. Well, honey, please call me Friday if you get home, don’t forget. That would be wonderful. Well, honey, time out for lunch now. I’ll write more when I get home—I mean back here from lunch—I love you…. Hi, honey, well, I’m back from lunch. What an hour that was. Just after I had finished my shopping 2 ̆ 6 was going back to work I passed some perfume in Macy’s that mother loves. Well, I got her a large bottle of the stuff, personally I think it’s awful but she likes it. Just as I was leaving the counter the bag broke or something and the bottle of perfume crashed to the floor. I thought that maybe it hadn’t broken but when I picked it up, it poured out of the box. What a mess. Anyway, I couldn’t find any wastebasket to throw it in so it got all over my clothes 2 ̆ 6 umbrella and my boots 2 ̆ 6 hands. Now I can still smell the stuff 2 ̆ 6 it’s awful. No one will come near me. I washed 2 ̆ 6 washed but the water just makes the perfume come out more. Well, honey, maybe I’ll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> It would be so nice to have you come home for a whole day for a change. I love you so, darling. You’re so sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful all the time. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Well, honey, I can’t write any more now. I’ll try to write when I get home but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. I have a sore throat now 2 ̆ 6 a terrific headache from that blasted perfume. Please write soon, darling. I love you so. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

The second volume, Attack From All Sides, {{has also been}} published in Norwegian, {{and it is just}} as good ... The penmanship, the personification and the abundantly idiomatic dialogue make <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Attack From All Sides brilliantly realistic prose, not just within Scandinavia, but among the international elite.” Expressen (Sweden) wrote “Tore Renberg is one of this year's most brightly shining stars ... It is an incredibly good novel … <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is an achievement of technical power. In vital, maximalist prose, the characters' perspectives change in a weaving movement, slowly taking us to an amazing crescendo. The tone feels new, fresh and heartfelt.” Stephanie Boland (The Quietus) wrote of <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Tomorrow: “aspects of the novel seem utterly ordinary, but taken in its behemoth whole, it dazzles ... <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is as boundary crossing as its author: defying easy genre designations, it centres around a crime story, but tempers its grit with romance, humour and a generous dose of pop culture.” In Denmark, Kristeligt Dagblad called <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>tomorrow</b> a “wonderful novel” - and you devour it in huge, greedy gulps.”, and The Danish Information wrote “It is wild, but also wildly funny... It is fantastic! ... Realistic? Probably not, but insanely fun, and insanely well executed”. Jyllands-Posten awarded the novel five out of six stars and wrote “Renberg takes charge on the continent with <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> A book that involves both bursts of laughter and compassion… a joyful display of literary expression.” ...|$|R

50|$|Sandra (born 1997). This {{young girl}} {{was the start}} of the whole novel, {{according}} to Renberg. He began writing about Sandra in 2007, as a single portrait of a naîve and desperate young girl madly in love with a no-good super-hot foster home kid, {{not knowing what to do}} with this text. A couple of years later it became the start of what became <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Sandra is a Christian, she is upper middle-class, and she has never in her life told a lie or dared to break any rules, let alone laws. She is in the same class as Malene, who also becomes her best friend as the plot of <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> thickens. She will turn sixteen in a few weeks. She wears a silver cross around her neck and has a dangerous secret. She is in love with Daniel William Moi and she will not live till the end of <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Sandra holds 14 chapters in <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b>|$|R

Veronika is {{the most}} wicked and {{dangerous}} of the four young girls in <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> She is a politically uncorrect portrait from Renberg´s hand, a character {{with a penchant for}} evil. Veronika is the daughter of Inger, and Daniel’s foster-sister. She is also desperately in love with him and equally jealous of Sandra. Veronika is gravely hearing impaired. Veronika holds 5 chapters in <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is told in {{the present}} tense, and chronologically. It spans over 6 days the autumn of 2012, and {{consists}} of four parts, the first called ”Tuesday 25 September”, the second ”Wednesday 26 September”, the third ”Thirsday 27 September”, and the fourth ”Sunday 30 September”. Like many books by Renberg, it uses epigraphs, this time one for every part: A quotation from Nick Cave, Motörhead and the Proverbs. [...] The most important narrative trait {{of the novel is}} its multivocality. Renberg has named William Faulkner´s As I Lay Dying (1930) one of the key influences to the literary style and technique of <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Faulkner’s novel {{tells the story of a}} collective, namely the Bundren family and their associates, as they fulfil the late Addie Bundren´s wish to be buried in the town of Jefferson. In this eponymous novel Faulkner uses multiple narrators, varying chapter lengths and modes. As I Lay Dying presents itself through 15 different points of view over 59 chapters, titled by their narrators´names. The major difference between As I Lay Dying and <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> in terms of narration and style, lies in the fact that Renberg does not use first person narration, monologue or strict stream of consciousness. <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is told through 11 narrators, in the third person, but using a very intimate narrative tone, to the extent that the reader almost feels like it is a first person in disguise. The chapters are named with titles, blending a feel of the classic 19th century novel of Dickens or Balzac, with the modern rock album and American grit/pulp. Tore Renberg has several times stated music as a significant influence for his work, and more than ever with <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> (Significance of music in <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow).</b> Among the 11 voices in <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> there is no clear protagonist, but it could be argued that the centre of the novel is the petty criminal gang-leader Jan Inge Haraldsen, who stands as a sort of baroque chief in this universe, both literary and in terms of content.|$|R
