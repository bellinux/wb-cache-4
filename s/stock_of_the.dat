5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E

5|$|From 1937 {{new steel}} O stock trains, with doors {{remotely}} {{operated by the}} guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot.

5|$|An army {{commanded}} by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The allies decided to divide their forces into two armies: a multinational force {{that included a}} single Brazilian division, and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. Against the wishes of Honório Hermeto, Caxias chose Manuel Marques de Sousa (later Count of Porto Alegre) to lead the former force. Caxias met and befriended Marques de Sousa, who had served under his command in the War of the Ragamuffins, during his trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839. The Brazilian division, led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom, thus ending the war. Caxias spent 17 January aboard the frigate Dom Afonso alongside John Pascoe Grenfell, taking <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port area of Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, selecting {{the best place to}} launch an amphibious attack. His plan was aborted once the news of the victory at Caseros arrived.

5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E

40|$|In Australian markets, authors seek {{to clarify}} <b>the</b> {{relationship}} <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> return performances with their beta, firm market capitalization and trading activity. This study {{leads us to}} consider the possibility that asset pricing studies can be dominated by <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very small companies to <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> having little relevance to institutional share management. For example, the paper observes how <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> returns for <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very small firms leads to generalizations that are reversed in respect to <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> larger firms. Additionally, the study reveals how outcomes may be compromised by "reversals <b>of</b> causality" in <b>the</b> data, so that, for example, beta estimates may be the outcome, rather than <b>the</b> explanation <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> price performances.
