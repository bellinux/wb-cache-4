Specifically, the contact angle of water on the surface is an important characteristic that helps determine the {{ability of a}} surface to <b>self-clean.</b> This angle is affected by the roughness of the surface and the following models have been developed to describe the [...] "stickiness" [...] or wettability of a self-cleaning surface.|$|E

Tapered optical silica fibres, coated (or not) with metallic and dielectric layers (Al or Cu and TiO_ 2) are employed.

It is shown that the artificial surfaces obtained by femtosecond-laser processing of Si in reactive gas atmosphere exhibit roughness at both micro- and nanoscales that mimics the hierarchical morphology of natural surfaces. Along with the spatial control of the topology, defining surface chemistry provides materials exhibiting notable wetting characteristics which are potentially useful for open microfluidic applications. Depending on the functional coating deposited on the laser patterned 3 D structures, we can achieve artificial surfaces that are (a) of extremely low surface energy, thus water-repellent and <b>self-cleaned,</b> and (b) responsive, i. e., showing the ability to change their surface energy in response to different external stimuli such as light, electric field, and pH. Moreover, the behavior {{of different kinds of}} cells cultured on laser engineered substrates of various wettabilities was investigated. Experiments showed {{that it is possible to}} preferentially tune cell adhesion and growth through choosing proper combinations of surface topography and chemistry. It is concluded that the laser textured 3 D micro∕nano-Si surfaces with controllability of roughness ratio and surface chemistry can advantageously serve as a novel means to elucidate the 3 D cell-scaffold interactions for tissue engineering applications...|$|R

30|$|However, the {{difficulty}} in developing new antibiotic compounds {{stems from the fact}} that most new antibiotic compounds are found from another, competing microbe [12, 86]. nAbts circumvent that system by using a completely different mechanism of action; moreover, they are also highly versatile and tunable. This allows for the ubiquitous use of nAbts. Antimicrobials are used in a multitude of industries such as livestock and agriculture, water treatment, military, and clinics; however, sr-nAbts will most likely thrive in industries that require the precise release of certain antibiotic effect after certain conditions are met. One possible application is to apply it to on-site or field-based medical devices, where autoclave or sterilization is not easily accessible. This will allow for situations where temperature, light, or pH responsive nAbts coated materials can react to sterilize an environment. The same system can also be used in the design of a water treatment system where the filter <b>self-cleans</b> and sterilizes itself. Another possible direction would be a theranostic system for antimicrobial infections. This is a relatively direct venture if the nAbts system is stimuli-responsive. The timing of such a system would be most useful in topical applications, or applications where an infection status may be uncertain. These types of nAbts theranostic system could also be very useful in curbing the spread of sexually transmitted infections, such as Neisseria gonorrhea, by applying them to contraceptives. Bacteriophages, though excluded can be classified as bio-active nanoantibiotics. These phages are virus-like particles that selectively kill bacteria when they infect them, without any damage to the eukaryotic cell [87]. Furthermore, phages can be modified with stimuli-responsive functionalities that allow for added efficacy and capabilities [88]. Additionally, non-lytic phages can be engineered to permit use as vaccines or diagnostic tools against specific bacterial infections [89].|$|R

The lotus leaf's surface was then replicated by allowing a copper sheet to flow into the negative mold with the assistance of ferric chloride and pressure. The result was a lotus leaf-like surface inherent on the copper sheet. Static water contact angle measurements of the biomimetic surface were taken to be 132° after etching the copper and 153° after a stearic acid surface treatment to mimic the lotus leaf's waxy coating. A surface that mimics the lotus leaf could have numerous applications by providing water repellent outdoor gear.|$|E

40|$|Self-cleaning {{surfaces}} {{found in}} nature show great potential for application in many fields, ranging from industry to medicine. The ability for a surface to <b>self-clean</b> is intimately related to the wetting properties of the surface; for a surface to possess self-cleaning ability it must exhibit extremely high water contact angles and low water adhesion. While investigating the self-cleaning properties of damselfly wings, significant spatial variations in surface wettability were observed. Within an area of 100 &# 0956;m &# 0215; 100 &# 0956;m of the wing surface the water contact angle was found to vary up to 17. 8 &# 0176;, while remaining consistently superhydrophobic. The contributions of both surface chemistry and topography to the hydrophobicity of the wings were assessed {{in an effort to}} explain these variations. Synchrotron-sourced Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy revealed that some of the major components of the wing were aliphatic hydrocarbons and esters, which are attributable to epicuticular lipids. The wing topography, as determined by optical profilometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), also showed only minor levels of heterogeneity arising from irregular ordering of surface nanostructures. The measured contact angle of a single droplet of water was also found to decrease over time as it evaporated, reaching a minimum of 107 &# 0176;. This is well below the threshold value for superhydrophobicity (i. e., 150 &# 0176;), demonstrating that when the surface is in contact with water for a prolonged period, the damselfly wings lose their superhydrophobicity and subsequently their ability to <b>self-clean.</b> This decrease in hydrophobicity over time {{can be attributed to the}} surface undergoing a transition from the Cassie&# 8211;Baxter wettability state toward the Wenzel wettability state...|$|E

Recent {{advances}} in materials chemistry and micro- and nanoscale fabrication techniques have enabled biologically inspired materials systems that mimic many of these remarkable functions. This issue of MRS Bulletin highlights two promising classes of bioinspired materials systems: surfaces that can <b>self-clean</b> and polymers that can self-heal.

Design of these surfaces is inspired by the hydrophobic micro- and nanostructures of a lotus leaf. Self-healing materials are motivated by biological systems in which damage triggers a site-specific, autonomic healing response. Self-healing has been achieved using several different approaches for storing and triggering healing functionality in the polymer.

In this study, three fabrication techniques, using silicon dioxide particles to create surface roughness followed by a surface modification with a film of polydimethylsiloxane, were applied on a transparent glass substrate. The fabrication techniques differed mainly on the deposition of silicon dioxide particles, which included organic, inorganic, and physical methods. Each technique was used to coat three samples of varying particle load. The surface of each sample was evaluated with contact angle goniometer and optical spectrometer. Results confirmed the inverse relationships between contact angle and optical transmissivity independent of fabrication techniques. Microstructural morphologies also suggested the advantage of physical deposition over chemical methods.

40|$|Insects possess {{adhesive}} organs {{that allow}} attachment to diverse surfaces. Efficient adhesion must be retained throughout their lifetime even when pads {{are exposed to}} contamination. Many insects groom their adhesive structures, {{but it is possible}} that selfcleaning properties also play an important role. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with microspheres and found that both smooth pads (stick insects: Carausius morosus) and hairy pads (dock beetles: Gastrophysa viridula) exhibit self-cleaning. Contaminated pads recovered high levels of adhesion after only eight simulated steps; this was accompanied by the deposition of spheres. Self-cleaning was strongly enhanced by shear movements, and only beetle pads showed the ability to <b>self-clean</b> during purely perpendicular pull-offs. Hairy pads also self-cleaned more efficiently than smooth pads for both large (45 μm) and small (1 μm) particle sizes. However, the beetles' self-cleaning was not superior to smooth pads when contaminated with 10 -μm beads. This limitation of self-cleaning is explained by the coincidence of bead diameter and interseta distance, which caused beads to remain trapped in between setae. © 2010.

40|$|A {{tokay gecko}} can cling to {{virtually}} any surface and support its body mass {{with a single}} toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads. Each seta branches into hundreds of 200 -nm spatulae that make intimate contact {{with a variety of}} surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces, no adhesive has been shown to <b>self-clean.</b> In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future...|$|E
40|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesives}} such as tapes become easily {{contaminated by}} dust particles. By contrast, animal adhesive pads {{are able to}} <b>self-clean</b> and can be reused millions of times over a lifetime with little reduction in adhesion. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this ability are still unclear. Here we test in adhesive pads of stick insects (Carausius morosus) (1) whether self-cleaning is enhanced by the liquid pad secretion, and (2) whether alternating push-pull movements aid the removal of particles. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with 10 m polystyrene beads. While the amount of fluid present on the pad showed {{no effect on the}} pads' susceptibility to contamination, the recovery of adhesive forces after contamination was faster when higher fluid levels were present. However, this effect {{does not appear to be}} based on a faster rate of self-cleaning since the number of spheres deposited with each step did not increase with fluid level. Instead, the fluid may aid the recovery of adhesive forces by filling in the gaps between contaminating particles, similar to the fluid's function on rough surfaces. Further, we found no evidence that an alternation of pushing and pulling movements, as found in natural steps, leads to a more efficient recovery of adhesion than repeated pulling slides. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

The combination of the surface roughness and the hydrophobic wax coating produces a superhydrophobic wetting state on the leaves allowing them to <b>self-clean</b> and easily shed water. Here a simple scale-up carbon nanoparticle spray coating is presented that mimics the surface of the Sacred Lotus leaves and can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} materials, complex structures, and flexible substrates, rendering them superhydrophobic, with contact angles above 160 °. The sprayable mixture is produced by combining toluene, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inherently hydrophobic rapeseed soot. The ability to spray the superhydrophobic coating allows for the hydrophobisation of complex structures such a metallic meshes, which allows for the production of flexible porous superhydrophobic materials that when formed into U-shape channels, can be used to direct flows. The porous meshes, whilst being superhydrophobic, are also oleophilic. Being both superhydrophobic and oleophilic allows oil to pass through the mesh, whilst water remains on the surface. The meshes were tested for their ability to separate mixtures of oil and water in a flow situation.

Potential costs-saving factors are associated with online-processing capability and increase throughput due to high deposition rates. Capital cost savings for both equipment and line space (foot print), and relative ease of integration, are further benefits in comparison to low-pressure-technology approaches. Three types of APPlasmas are considered for coating: microwave chemical vapor deposition (CVD), dc Arcjet-CVD based on a linearly extended plasma source, and dielectric barrier glow discharge plasma CVD. Spectroscopic plasma characterization has shown that high fluxes of activated species {{are available in the}} plasma downstream region and can be used for deep fragmentation of even stable molecules. After precursor injection, a range of atomic and molecular intermediates, precursor fragments, and reaction products were identified leading to a conclusion that a complete conversion of the element-organic precursors into an inorganic materials take place. Alternatively, the dc ArcJet source is used for plasma chemical etching. All AP-plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), reactors are designed for continuous air-to-air processing on flat or slightly shaped substrates and allow deposition of nonoxide films. Reactor design is supported by fluid-dynamic modeling. Typical thin-film growth rates for PECVD are in the range of 5 - 100 nm/s (static) and up to 2 nm*m/s (dynamic).
