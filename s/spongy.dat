5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not joined together at the base, and the <b>spongy</b> structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be <b>spongy</b> and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized <b>spongy</b> pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|The single {{leafless}} stem or scape, appearing {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at {{the centre of the}} leaves. In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a <b>spongy</b> material.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spongy</b> {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|The wood of B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is <b>spongy</b> and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It is a useful firewood.|$|E
5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. Malawach is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a <b>spongy,</b> pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft <b>spongy</b> layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{he acted}} {{on the ground}} of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and {{on the basis of}} meager {{information}} and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, <b>spongy</b> ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; of course, he could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the <b>spongy</b> urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the <b>spongy</b> nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown <b>spongy</b> tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E
5|$|Pycnoporellus alboluteus, {{commonly}} known as the orange sponge polypore, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. Distributed throughout the boreal conifer zone, the fungus is found in mountainous regions of western North America, and in Europe. It causes a brown cubical rot of conifer wood, especially spruce, but also fir and poplar. The soft, <b>spongy</b> orange fruit bodies grow spread out on the surface of fallen logs. Mature specimens have tooth-like or jagged pore edges. A snowbank mushroom, P.alboluteus can often be found growing on logs or stumps protruding through melting snow. Although the edibility of the fungus and its usage for human culinary purposes are unknown, several species of beetles use the fungus as a food source.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized <b>spongy</b> tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially <b>spongy</b> and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are <b>spongy</b> and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, <b>spongy</b> stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is <b>spongy,</b> with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, an {{histological}} {{study concluded}} that these osteoderms, skin ossifications, of Hesperosaurus are essentially identical in structure to those of Stegosaurus. CAT-scans showed that the plates have thin but dense outer walls, filled with thick <b>spongy</b> bone. The bone shows signs of having been remodelled during a metaplastic growth process. Extensive long and wide arterial canals were visible. The spikes have thicker walls and the hollows in the <b>spongy</b> interior are smaller. A single large blood vessel ran along the longitudinal axis of the spike.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya: ጣይታ) is a sourdough-risen flatbread with a unique, {{slightly}} <b>spongy</b> texture. Traditionally {{made out}} of teff flour, it is a national dish in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia.|$|E
25|$|Stage 2 (spontaneously irreversible): The tissue {{now has a}} <b>spongy</b> {{consistency}} and is considered non-pitting: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area bounces back without indentation. Fibrosis found in stage 2 lymphedema {{marks the beginning of}} the hardening of the limbs and increasing size.|$|E
25|$|The southeastern U.S. {{state of}} South Carolina is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the sabal {{palmetto}} (cabbage palmetto), logs from which {{were used to}} build the fort at Fort Moultrie. During the American Revolutionary War, they were invaluable to those defending the fort, because their <b>spongy</b> wood absorbed or deflected the British cannonballs.|$|E
25|$|Some South American {{tropical}} {{species are}} epiphytes, {{and can be}} found growing in wet moss and <b>spongy</b> bark on trees in rainforests, or even in the watery leaf-rosettes of other epiphytes such as various Tillandsia (a type of bromeliad) species. Rosette-forming epiphytes such as U.nelumbifolia put out runners, searching for other nearby bromeliads to colonise.|$|E
25|$|Woodhall Spa {{came about}} by {{accident}} in 1811 after John Parkinson of Old Bolingbroke made several {{attempts to find}} coal. After spending several thousand pounds and sinking a shaft over 1,000 feet deep, the enterprise was abandoned {{on account of the}} now rising spring. The spring flows daily through soft <b>spongy</b> rock at a depth of 520 feet.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} five {{principal}} vegetation formations: grassland, herbfield, fen, bog and feldmark. Bog communities include 'featherbed', {{a deep and}} <b>spongy</b> peat bog vegetated by grasses and low herbs, with patches of free water. Endemic flora include the cushion plant Azorella macquariensis, the grass Puccinellia macquariensis, {{as well as two}} orchids– Nematoceras dienemum and Nematoceras sulcatum.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Tufts {{developed}} scaffolds made of <b>spongy</b> silk {{that feel}} and look similar to human tissue. They are implanted during reconstructive surgery to support or restructure damaged ligaments, tendons, and other tissue. They also created implants made of silk and drug compounds {{which can be}} implanted under the skin for steady and gradual time release of medications.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} double-layer {{as well as}} pseudocapacitance stored per unit voltage in a {{supercapacitor}} is predominantly {{a function of the}} electrode surface area. Therefore, supercapacitor electrodes are typically made of porous, <b>spongy</b> material with an extraordinarily high specific surface area, such as activated carbon. Additionally, the ability of the electrode material to perform faradaic charge transfers enhances the total capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Pitches in Zimbabwe closely {{resemble}} those in South Africa. The only difference {{being in the}} nature of the bounce. The pitches in South Africa provide fast bounce while the pitches in Zimbabwe tend to have a <b>spongy,</b> tennis ball type of bounce, which makes hitting on the up a risky proposition. Most pitches have slower bounce, hence batting is more favourable in Zimbabwe.|$|E
25|$|The gland {{alveolus}} is a sac that {{is divided}} into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the <b>spongy</b> intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} assumed that iron {{deficiency}} anemia has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed porotic hyperostosis) and/or the orbits (termed cribia orbitalia). This bone is <b>spongy</b> and soft.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} Mexican cheese is queso fresco, from which other cheeses such as panela, adobera and Oaxaca have been derived. This cheese {{is made with}} whole milk, but has {{relatively}} low fat and cholesterol. This is a white <b>spongy</b> cheese whose origins {{can be traced back}} to Burgos, Spain and used primarily to crumble over dishes. This cheese is made in just about all parts of Mexico with little variation.|$|E
25|$|The pitch {{was made}} of a matted couch grass and was very <b>spongy</b> and soft. It was a slow pitch that favoured the bowlers. The ground was {{the home of the}} Albert Club, one of the most {{powerful}} in Sydney, which could boast three teams of 11. The club’s players wore white caps and pants and blue shirts and counted amongst their number the greatest bowler of the day ‘The Demon’ Fred Spofforth.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an aril, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus), (as in yew and nutmeg) or an oily appendage, an elaiosome (as in Corydalis), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs {{are the source of}} the textile crop cotton. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, caruncles (a soft <b>spongy</b> outgrowth from the outer integument {{in the vicinity of the}} micropyle), spines, or tubercles.|$|E
25|$|The {{saturated}} sediment {{may appear}} quite solid until {{a change in}} pressure or shock initiates the liquefaction, causing the sand to form a suspension with each grain surrounded by a thin film of water. This cushioning gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a <b>spongy,</b> fluidlike texture. Objects in the liquefied sand sink to {{the level at which}} the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced sand/water mix and the object floats due to its buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Descending {{would have}} been helped by a {{negative}} Archimedes Force, i.e. being heavier than water. Of course, this {{would have had the}} disadvantage of hampering coming up again. Young plesiosaurs show pachyostosis, an extreme density of the bone tissue, which might have increased relative weight. Adult individuals have more <b>spongy</b> bone. Gastroliths have been suggested as a method to increase weight or even as means to attain neutral buoyancy, swallowing or spitting them out again as needed. They might also have been used to increase stability.|$|E
