25|$|To reduce losses due to {{mechanical}} failure, in February 1945 Tunner {{introduced a}} maintenance program termed Production Line Maintenance. PLM consisted of having each aircraft due for 50- or 200-hour maintenance towed through {{five to seven}} maintenance stations, depending {{on whether or not}} an engine change was required. Each station had a fresh maintenance crew trained for a <b>specific</b> <b>service</b> task, including engine run up, inspections, cleaning, technical repair, and servicing, a process that took nearly a full 24-hour day per aircraft to complete. Each base specialized in only one type of aircraft to simplify the process. Despite initial resistance, PLM was successfully implemented throughout the division.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a <b>specific</b> <b>service</b> or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
500|$|From a legal perspective, Hungarian {{society was}} divided into freemen and serfs, but {{intermediate}} groups also existed. All freemen had the legal capacity to own property, to sue and to be sued. Most of them were bound to the monarch or to a wealthier landlord, and only [...] "guests" [...] could freely move. Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the [...] "castle warriors" [...] served in the army, and the [...] "castle folk" [...] cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the [...] "pennies of freemen" [...] to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked the legal status available to freemen, but in practice {{they had their own}} property: they cultivated their masters' land with their own tools, and kept 50–66percent of the harvest for themselves. StephenI's laws and charters suggest that most commoners lived in sedentary communities which formed villages. An average village was made up of no more than 40 semi-sunken timber huts with a corner hearth. Many of the villages were named after a profession, implying that the villagers were required to render a <b>specific</b> <b>service</b> to their lords.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, {{the first}} {{director}} of the Bundeswehr Militärmusikdienst, Friedrich Deisenroth, provided [...] a „Fachdienstliche Anweisung“ (<b>specific</b> <b>service</b> directive) for the German Bundeswehr orchestra, to avoid playing the march except in concerts {{with reference to the}} historical background. [...] The official title is still Badonviller-Marsch, using the Alsatian and French form of the name. The march is seldom played today in Germany. Its connection with the Third Reich damaged the reputation of Georg Fürst as a composer in post-war Germany. A revival of his other compositions took place in the 1990s, however. Orchestras of the Communist National People's Army started to adapt a broader range of traditional marches as early as in the 1960s, but Badonviller was left out, as were similarly the Fridericus-Rex-Grenadiermarsch and Preußens Gloria.|$|E
2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each <b>specific</b> <b>service</b> is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E

6000|$|The {{other object}} of this brief apology was to clear himself of corrupt influence. Of all ostentation he stands {{completely}} acquitted {{in the month}} of November, however he might have been faulty in that respect {{in the month of}} June; but with regard to {{the other part of the}} apprehended charge, namely, corrupt influence, he gives no satisfactory solution. A great sum of money [...] "not his own,"--money to which [...] "he had no right,"--money which came into his possession [...] "by whatever means":--if this be not money obtained by corrupt influence, or by something worse, that is, by violence or terror, it will be difficult to fix upon circumstances which can furnish a presumption of unjustifiable use of power and influence in the acquisition of profit. The last part of the apology, that he had converted this money ("which he had no right to receive") to the Company's use, so far as your Committee can discover, does nowhere appear. He speaks, in the Minute of the 26th of June, as having then actually deposited it for the Company's service; in the letter of November he says that he converted it to the Company's property: but there is no trace in the Company's books of its being ever brought to their credit in the expenditure for any <b>specific</b> <b>service,</b> even if any such entry and expenditure could justify him in taking money which he had by his own confession, [...] "no right to receive." ...|$|E
