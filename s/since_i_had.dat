500|$|On 10 June as {{a member}} of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jagielski offered to other members of that group to {{terminate}} his position within the Politburo, and his position as Deputy Prime Minister, stating [...] "I submit my resignation {{as a member}} of the PB (Politburo), especially <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a certain incident in my life. I also submit my resignation as vice premier (Deputy Prime Minister)." [...] It seems his offer was rebuffed, and the incident in his life that he spoke of may have been a heart attack he had recently suffered. On 31 July 1981, Jagielski was fired from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, reportedly because he failed to produce a recovery program for the economic crisis Poland was experiencing at the time.|$|E
500|$|Having {{attracted}} the attention of scouts from several clubs whilst playing for local youth team Scole Lads, O'Keefe was invited to train with Norwich City's under-nine team. However, he later signed a youth deal with their East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, joining the club at the age of nine, playing alongside Jordan Rhodes and Ed Upson in the academy during his time at the club. However, he failed to make an appearance for the first team and was released {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season after Ipswich decided against offering him a scholarship, believing that he would be unable to compete physically at under-18 level. O'Keefe later commented on his release [...] "It was disappointing to be released by Ipswich, especially <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there from such a young age, but I always kept believing in myself".|$|E
500|$|Prokofiev's {{task was}} not straightforward; the film's 15 minutes of musical {{material}} was fragmentary, and scored {{for a small}} chamber orchestra. According to Prokofiev's own account, producing the suite was [...] "a devilish job", which, he said, [...] "gave me much more trouble than the music for the film itself, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to find the proper form, re-orchestrate the whole thing, polish it up and even combine some of the themes." [...] He wanted the suite to appeal to Soviet audiences hearing concert music for the first time. In an article in Izvestia in 1934 he wrote of such music: [...] "Above all, it must be melodious; moreover the melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial... The simplicity should not be an old-fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity". He worked quickly, and had finished the piece by 8 July 1934. Because it was published (Op. 60) by his regular music publisher in Paris, the French form of [...] "Kijé" [...] rather than the Russian [...] "Kizhe" [...] was adopted in the work's title.|$|E

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Browning {{responded to}} Irving's claim that because Browning had done {{work for the}} Yad Vashem center in Jerusalem that made him an [...] "Israeli agent" [...] and thereby {{compromised}} his scholarly abilities by stating: [...] "If that was the case, then <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been at the [...] Holocaust Museum, I would also have been {{an agent of the}} American government, and since I have received scholarships in Germany, I would be an agent of the German government, so I must be a very duplicitous fellow to be able to follow these regimes." [...] Irving seemed anxious for Browning's approval, and Browning later recalled that Irving behaved as if {{the two of them were}} on [...] "a joint journey of exploration and discovery." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lilburne {{spent his}} exile in the Netherlands at Bruges and elsewhere, where he {{published}} a vindication of himself, and {{an attack on}} the government. In his hostility to the army leaders Lilburne had often contrasted the present governors unfavourably with Charles I. Now he frequented the society of cavaliers of note, such Lords Hopton, Colepeper, and Percy. If he were furnished with ten thousand pounds, he undertook to overthrow Cromwell, the Parliament, and the Council of State, within six months. [...] "I know not," [...] he was heard to say, [...] "why I should not vye with Cromwell, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> once as great a power as he had, and greater too, and am as good a gentleman". But {{with the exception of the}} Duke of Buckingham, none of the royalists placed any confidence in him.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, {{after her}} split from Elvis, Presley {{set up a}} joint venture with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us." [...] The shop was a successful venture, with celebrity clients including Cher, Lana Turner, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood shopping there regularly. The shop closed in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{hoped to}} keep his {{anonymity}} and release the recordings in a limited run under the title [...] "Foo Fighters", taken from the World War II term [...] "foo fighter", {{used to refer to}} unidentified flying objects. [...] "Around the time that I recorded the first FF tape, I was reading a lot of books on UFO's. Not only is it a fascinating subject, but there's a treasure trove of band names in those UFO books!" [...] he said. [...] "So, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> recorded the first record by myself, playing all the instruments, but I wanted people to think that it was a group, I figured that FOO FIGHTERS might lead people to believe that it was more than just one guy. Silly, huh?" [...] Continuing, Dave Grohl insisted that a more appropriate name could have been chosen.

2500|$|Sony Pictures {{spokesman}} Steve Elzer said {{a weekend}} take of about $30 {{million in the}} United States and Canada would be a solid number for a movie {{that is not a}} branded sequel. Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer said [...] "Certainly we {{would have liked to have}} done more, but this was always going to be a worldwide play." [...] The Hollywood Reporter reported Sony insiders estimate a potential loss at about $20 million if the film does not gross high overseas, though estimates of top executives at several rival studios are much higher. On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Will Smith admitted he was also disappointed with the box office performance and joked [...] "Here's how I think about it, Jimmy, let's be honest. Three is the new one.

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on 20 July 2017 that Benjamin had reprised the role for a [...] "surprise" [...] appearance {{and is expected}} to be onscreen until August. Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, [...] "When that hospital door starts to open, [...] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise. When {{it turns out to be}} Lisa, rather than Phil, there will be gasps of shock. It’s such a brilliant surprise." [...] The show released no official confirmation on the reports, although Lisa returned in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017. It was subsequently confirmed that Lisa would be returning for a [...] "brief stint" [...] and would share scenes with Phil following his return. On her return, Benjamin commented, [...] "It was great to be back at EastEnders as it has been such a long time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there.

2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, The Kolkata Telegraph {{reported}} that director Rituparno Ghosh wanted to cast Chakraverti {{in a film}} based on a case the Wiccan had encountered while practicing the craft. Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evil– A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, she came down to Delhi and lived with me for a while. I showed her how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E
