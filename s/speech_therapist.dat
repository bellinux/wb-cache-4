5|$|The King's Speech is a 2010 British {{historical}} drama film {{directed by}} Tom Hooper, from a script by David Seidler. The film stars Colin Firth as George (both Duke of York and later king), Helena Bonham Carter {{as his wife}} Queen Elizabeth, and Geoffrey Rush as the <b>speech</b> <b>therapist</b> Lionel Logue.

5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born <b>speech</b> <b>therapist.</b> The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired <b>speech</b> <b>therapist</b> Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E

40|$|Head {{and neck}} cancer {{patients}} suffer from {{high levels of}} psychological comorbidity and often do not receive adequate psychological assistance. Therefore, <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> are frequently confronted with specific psychosocial challenges {{beyond the scope of}} their standard professional education. The following aspects were examined via a mixed-methods approach to explore their own perceptions of these challenges and their skills to deal with them: 1) The experiences and problems of <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> working with head and neck cancer patients; 2) the self-assessment of speech therapists' skills in cancer patient care; 3) the experiences and observations of psychologists supervising case discussions in oncology with speech therapists; 4) the communication skills of <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> working with emotionally distressed patients in oncology Our results show that therapists are acutely aware of their patients' distress. They agree {{that there is a need}} for patients to receive psychosocial counseling and that a significant portion of their speech therapy sessions is often dedicated to talking about personal problems. This difficult situation leads to: 1) deficiencies in speech therapists' ability to address patients' demands and deficiencies in distancing themselves from their patients; 2) <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> feeling overwhelmed with excessive demands and experiencing mental distress themselves. The psycho-oncological knowledge and communication skills among <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> were often deficient in light of such demands. There is a need for further training in psychological and social skills for <b>speech</b> <b>therapists</b> working with head and neck cancer patients. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 100122...|$|R

Andrew Roberts, an English historian, states that the severity of the King's stammer was exaggerated and the characters of Edward VIII, Wallis Simpson, and George V made more antagonistic than they really were, to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E

Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010.

Her character was inspired by Malini Chib, Bose's cousin. Bose first approached Koechlin, who she said was her [...] "first and only choice", for the role when the latter was shooting for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewaani. Due to the clashing schedule Bose went on to audition other actresses to substitute Koechlin, but felt that [...] "something was missing" [...] in each one, and she eventually decided to push the filming for three months to accommodate her. In an interview with the Times of India, Koechlin acknowledged that the role was the most challenging of her film career, and she took six months off her filming schedule to prepare for it. She underwent a six-week training workshop with actor Adil Hussain. The workshop aimed at making her [...] "body language seem natural", while also focusing on the speech pattern of patients with cerebral palsy. Koechlin spent considerable time with Chib and her physiotherapist and <b>speech</b> <b>therapist.</b> She also attended a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she worked on the movement of the body parts. Although the film covers aspects of physical disability, Koechlin dubbed it [...] "a romcom with some hurdles".|$|E
