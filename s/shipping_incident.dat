5|$|Due to {{fears of}} a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the {{previous}} year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people actually used these shelters. On Oahu, a power outage was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. Jellyfish also stung 50 people. Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage {{on the north side}} of the island. On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage was minimal. Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. In a separate <b>shipping</b> <b>incident,</b> three crewmen were slightly injured. The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. Throughout the state, damage was minimal.|$|E
40|$|In 2009, MV Pacific Adventurer lost {{containers}} {{over the}} side in a severe storm off the southern Queensland coast. Some containers punctured the ship 2 ̆ 7 s hull thereby releasing a considerable quantity of oil that washed on to the nearby Australian coastline. The court and other proceedings that followed continued until 2012 and are the only recent example of a significant maritime oil spill from a ship in Australia that went through the full legal procedures. These provide a suitable precedent for courts and practitioners who {{may be involved in}} a similar incident in the future. This article traces the <b>shipping</b> <b>incident</b> and the court proceedings and sets out the law as it then was and now is. It concludes by making some suggestions for future handling of similar incidents. The legislation discussed here was particular to this incident but it is similar to that in all of the States and the Northern Territory and to the Commonwealth legislation so it has parallels Australia-wide...|$|E

Review objectives and criteria were developed from the DOE/NNSA and LLNL requirements. These were provided in the Implementation Plan for the Biosafety Level III (BSL- 3) Facility Management Pre-Start Review (BSL- 3 MPR) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that was reviewed and approved by DOE/NNSA-LSO. The formal part of the LLNL MPR for the BSL- 3 Facility was begun in August of 2005 but work on the MPR was stopped in October of 2005 due {{to the need for}} LLNL to reassess organizational and operational controls and respond to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention inquiries related to a <b>shipping</b> <b>incident</b> involving select agents. The MPR was restarted in mid-June of 2006. Preliminary facility tours and familiarization with project documents took place in June of 2005. The Independent Management Review Team consists of seven members led by a Team Leader with expertise in management, operations, and safety basis experience with biosafety laboratories. Other team members have expertise in electrical engineering, security, environmental/waste management/regulatory compliance, biosafety/industrial hygiene/medical, structural engineering, and mechanical engineering. The MPR Team reviewed various documents, including authorization basis, safety, emergency preparedness, and various operations, configuration, and management plans. They also reviewed building plans, equipment repair/maintenance documents, training records, and many standard operating procedures. The MPR resulted in three Pre-Start Findings, one Post-Start/Critical Finding, and four observations which are shown on Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Based upon this review the Team feels that the B 368 Facility can be operated safely provided the Pre-Start Findings are satisfactorily closed. The Team therefore seen no reason not to expeditiously proceed towards the startup of this facility in accordance with the processes defined in DOE Order 425. 1 C, and the LLNL ES&H Manual. Details of the MPR Team evaluations of the various Subject (functional) Areas of the review are contained in the completed MPR Assessment Forms in Appendix A. Findings are described in completed MPR Deficiency Forms in Appendix B. The format of these forms is consistent with DOE-STD- 3006...|$|E

40|$|This report {{looks at}} the {{significant}} issues posed by increasing shipping within the Arctic regions. In doing this it elucidates potential relationships between increasing Arctic shipping activity and ice regression; specifically seeking out trends in <b>shipping</b> <b>incidents</b> within the region by utilising historical shipping data between 1995 and 2014 as gathered by Lloyds Maritime Intelligence Unit. These relationships are analysed spatially and temporally. Trends are shown throughout the entire dataset to indicate that <b>shipping</b> <b>incidents</b> are becoming more frequent and at higher latitudes. Synthesis of ice data and <b>shipping</b> <b>incidents</b> builds on these trends.

While active, {{there were no}} deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Overall, Amelia caused 33 fatalities with an estimated $110 million in damages.|$|R

5|$|As a {{developing}} typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000. Even before Saomai made landfall on Okinawa, the typhoon caused rough seas {{off the coast}} of Japan that resulted in several <b>shipping</b> <b>incidents.</b> Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. Despite making landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides and strong winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP¥24.8billion (US$223million) and eleven fatalities were reported. As Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands and strong waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000people and caused record high stream heights.|$|R

5|$|Most of the hurricane's damage {{occurred}} in Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall early on September17. As {{was the case}} off the United States East Coast, rough seas generated by the hurricane caused various <b>ship</b> <b>incidents.</b> Tides were 4ft (1.3m) above average. The abnormally high sea level inundated areas of Lockeport, isolating it {{from the rest of}} Nova Scotia and creating a temporary island in the process. One home in the city was flooded by the waves. Off Shelburne, a breakwater was destroyed by rough seas. In Halifax, two yachts were damaged. Another boat in East Ferry was destroyed. The strong waves grounded a schooner in Bridgewater, damaging a wharf. In Jordan Bay, two boat houses and a barn were toppled, while a wharf was washed away. Further north near Anticosti Island, the British steamer Incemore became stranded. Though not directly a result of the storm surge, ten boats in Lake Milo near Yarmouth were severely damaged.|$|R
5|$|While off the United States East Coast, the {{hurricane}} caused numerous <b>shipping</b> <b>incidents,</b> {{most notably the}} stranding of the Swedish freighter Laponia off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September 16. Two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths. The hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm-force and snow over areas of New England. In Atlantic Canada, a strong storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.3 m) above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities. In New Brunswick, the waves hurt the lobster fishing industry. In Nova Scotia, strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services. The winds also severely damaged crops. Roughly half of apple production in Annapolis Valley was lost during the storm, resulting in around $1.49 million in economic losses. Strong winds in New Brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage, and additional damages to crops occurred there. Overall, {{the hurricane}} caused three fatalities, with two off the United States and one in New Brunswick.|$|R
