5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by {{the example of the}} British postal system, which issued its first stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840, the Belgian government supported the inauguration of a Belgian equivalent. Under the existing system, postage costs were paid by the receiver rather than the <b>sender,</b> which discouraged people from receiving, and therefore sending, letters. The idea of postage stamps, which would allow the <b>sender</b> to pay in advance, was officially sanctioned by Leopold I on the Loi apportant des modifications au régime des postes ("Law bringing modifications to the postal system") on 24 December 1847 while the radical liberal and future Prime Minister, Walthère Frère-Orban, served as Minister of Public Works. The debate on the reform of the postage in Belgium occurred {{at the same time as}} widespread postage reform, {{influenced by}} the British example, in France, Bavaria and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|A {{separating}} equilibrium is an equilibrium where <b>senders</b> {{with different}} types always choose different messages. This {{means that the}} <b>sender's</b> message always reveals the <b>sender's</b> type, so the receiver's beliefs become deterministic after seeing the message.|$|R

In a game where some <b>senders</b> always truthfully report object’s quality and some are biased <b>senders</b> who communicate strategically, we find that an equilibrium always exists in this game and it is unique. If all <b>senders</b> are strategic and there exist some neutral <b>senders</b> whose objectives are aligned with the receiver’s, then many equilibria exist. These equilibria include {{one in which the}} neutral <b>senders</b> always tell the truth and a class of equilibria in which the neutral <b>senders</b> exaggerate when the observed quality is high enough.

5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith.

The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account.

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a <b>sender</b> through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} simple {{models of}} editorial control. Starting from the framework developed by Krishna and Morgan (2001 a), we analyze 2 -sender models of cheap talk where {{one or more}} of the <b>senders</b> has the power to veto messages before they reach the receiver. A characterization of the most informative equilibria of such models is given. It is shown that editorial control never aids communication and that for small biases in the senders’ preferences relative to those of the receiver, necessary and sufficient conditions for information transmission to be adversely affected are (i) that the <b>senders</b> have opposed preferences relative to the receiver, and (ii) that both <b>senders</b> have powers of editorial control. It is shown that the addition of further <b>senders</b> beyond two weakly decreases information transmission when <b>senders</b> exercising editorial control are anonymous, and weakly increases information transmission when <b>senders</b> exercising editorial control are observed...|$|R

She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on New Phoenix. While studying the artifact, Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous <b>sender.</b> The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him {{to work on a}} Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing 'Mdama's troops, Crimson Squad recovers another artifact. When Halsey examines the device, it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching the artifact looking for answers, Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E
5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their <b>sender</b> with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the <b>sender</b> could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged <b>sender</b> could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the <b>sender</b> himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve the <b>sender</b> of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, the <b>sender</b> may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).|$|E

50|$|One {{of these}} is by Feltovich, Harbaugh and To. They {{developed}} a formal model in which receivers of signals judge the <b>senders</b> of signals based not only on what can be inferred from the signal sent, but also on additional information, which {{is assumed to be}} helpful but not perfect. For example, <b>senders</b> might be of low, medium, or high quality, and the additional information might be adequate for distinguishing low from high but not necessarily from distinguishing medium from low or high. Under certain circumstances, medium-quality <b>senders</b> will have an incentive to signal (to ensure that they can be distinguished from low-quality ones), but high-quality <b>senders</b> may not—they {{are not likely to be}} mistaken for low-quality <b>senders</b> in any case, and signaling behavior may mark them as medium.|$|R
25|$|A SYN flood {{occurs when}} a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged <b>sender</b> address. Each of these packets are handled like a {{connection}} request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection, by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the <b>sender</b> address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the <b>sender</b> address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} multi-way {{channels}} was initiated by Shannon in his basic paper “Two-way communication channels” (Shannon, 1961). Ahlswede (1971 b) has defined and classified multi-way channels {{of various kinds}} and proved simple characterizations for the capacity regions of channels with (a) two <b>senders</b> and one receiver, and (b) three <b>senders</b> and one receiver. Subsequently, Ahlswede (1974) found {{a new approach to}} the coding problem for a channel with two <b>senders</b> and one receiver which led to an alternative characterization of the capacity region of this channel. This approach seems to be more canonical than the earlier one, and was used successfully in determining the capacity region of a channel with two <b>senders</b> and two receivers in case both <b>senders</b> send messages simultaneously to both receivers (Ahlswede, 1974). In the earlier paper, Ahlswede conjectured that the results of that paper would hold for any channel with s ⩾ 2 <b>senders</b> and one receiver. A conjecture of the later paper was that its results would hold for any channel with s ⩾ 2 <b>senders</b> and r ⩾ 1 receivers in case all <b>senders</b> send independent messages simultaneously to all receivers. In this paper, we have proved the latter conjecture to be true. The characterization we get for the special case s = 3 and r = 1 is different from that of Ahlswede's (1971 b) earlier paper. All of our results are obtained under the assumption of independent sources...|$|R

We propose two new algorithms to solve this problem: ISPfriendly and network-based.
