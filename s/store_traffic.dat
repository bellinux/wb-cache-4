40|$|Abstract—Attack {{signature}} validation plays a {{key role}} in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P 2 P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and <b>store</b> recent network <b>traffic</b> at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over <b>stored</b> <b>traffic</b> data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{approach}} to dimensioning DiffServ/MPLS networks taking into account per-class bandwidth reservation and fault tolerance cushion weights is proposed. Our dimensioning algorithm is based on Lagrange relaxation and it uses a bandwidth constraint model in order to provide per-class bandwidth reservation, and link costs which translate to backup LSP cushion weights. We propose an optimization formulation for our policy and also a polynomial time heuristic capable of approximating the optimal results. Besides a-priori dimensioning, a modified version of our dimensioning policy can also be run weekly/monthly in order to redimension LSPs according to the <b>stored</b> <b>traffic</b> history. Both proposed heuristics have polynomial complexity and provide bounds on the value of the optimal objective function, which can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the results. I...|$|R

A television ad campaign to introduce the store featured Allen Ludden of Password fame (most store openings were promoted by Hollywood stars).

40|$|Abstract—The use {{of closed}} {{solutions}} from most known vendors {{to carry out}} network-monitoring tasks {{has turned out to}} be a questionable option given their lack of flexibility and extensibility, which has typically been translated into higher costs. Consequently, we study whether high-performance monitoring tasks can be carried out using off-the-shelf systems, the alternative to these pitfalls from the research community, consisting in the combination of open-source software and commodity hardware. We focus on sniffing and <b>storing</b> network <b>traffic</b> as one of the major tasks in any monitoring architecture. Specifically, we first review the keys to sniff traffic at multi-gigabit rates, and then present an experimental evaluation of commodity hard drives. Finally, the lessons learned from such studies and the performed experiments have conducted us to the development of an open solution, namely HPCAP, which sniffs and <b>stores</b> multi-gigabit <b>traffic</b> using commodity hardware without packet losses in very demanding scenarios...|$|R

Foote focused on raising profits, even if that meant losing market share and reducing <b>store</b> <b>traffic,</b> by ramping up inventory levels of higher-margin goods over loss leaders (such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent), and slashing costs. Foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on Facebook.

40|$|Abstract — We {{proposes a}} battery {{lifetime}} extension method through the background traffic synchronization on smartphones. Battery lifetime {{is very important}} factor due to the restrictive battery lifetime on smartphone. In proposed method, smartphone stacks the received background traffic in the buffer during the threshold time. The <b>stored</b> background <b>traffic</b> processes at data packet processing time. If there is no data packet to process for the threshold time, the <b>stored</b> background <b>traffic</b> is dropped. By applying this method to DRX, the idle mode cycle of smartphone can be extended. Therefore, the battery sleep time is increased through {{reducing the number of}} background packet transmission over wireless. For performance analysis, we use M/M/ 1 queueing model and compare the sleep time between existing and proposed method. As a result, we can prove that the power consumption of the proposed method is lower than the existing method. That is, the battery lifetime of the proposed method is more extended than existing method. Keywords—LTE, DRX, Background traffic, Battery lifetim...|$|R
25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all <b>stores</b> <b>trafficked</b> from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized <b>stores</b> involved in <b>trafficking</b> in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of <b>trafficking.</b> Although large <b>stores</b> accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|R
