5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. <b>She</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E

[...] Second, Iranians tend to view the era depicted in the film as [...] "a particularly noble page in their history".

500|$|Blum {{suggests}} that van der Weyden sought to juxtapose the otherworldly {{realm of the}} Madonna and Child with the earthly setting and contemporary dress of the saints. <b>She</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> couplings as serving to position each saint [...] "as a 'living witness' to the static, eternal presence of the Virgin and Child". She writes that [...] "Only in such early works do we find this kind of obvious solution. By {{the time of the}} Descent from the Cross and Durán Madonna, van der Weyden has already worked out a far more complex and effective means of mixing temporal and non-temporal effects".|$|E
