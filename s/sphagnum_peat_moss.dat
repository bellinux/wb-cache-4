30|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is an important}} source of bioavailable nitrogen in Sphagnum dominated peatlands. Sphagnum mosses harbor a diverse microbiome including nitrogen-fixing and methane (CH 4) oxidizing bacteria. The inhibitory effect of oxygen on microbial {{nitrogen fixation}} is documented for many bacteria. However, the role of nitrogen-fixing methanotrophs in nitrogen supply to <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> is not well explored. Here, we investigated the role of both oxygen and methane on nitrogen fixation in subarctic <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>peat</b> <b>mosses.</b> Five species of Sphagnum mosses were sampled from two mesotrophic and three oligotrophic sites within the Lakkasuo peatland in Orivesi, central Finland. Mosses were incubated under either ambient or low oxygen conditions in {{the presence or absence of}} methane. Stable isotope activity assays revealed considerable nitrogen-fixing and methane-assimilating rates at all sites (1.4 [*]±[*] 0.2  µmol 15 N–N 2  g− 1  DW day− 1 and 12.0 [*]±[*] 1.1  µmol 13 C–CH 4  g− 1  DW day− 1, respectively). Addition of methane did not stimulate incorporation of 15 N-nitrogen into biomass, whereas oxygen depletion increased the activity of the nitrogen-fixing community. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA genes at the bacterial community level showed a very diverse microbiome that was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria in all sites. Bona fide methane-oxidizing taxa were not very abundant (relative abundance less than 0.1 %). Based on our results we conclude that methanotrophs did not contribute significantly to nitrogen fixation in the investigated peatlands.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> <b>peat</b> <b>mosses</b> play an {{important}} role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon as biomass thorough photosynthesis. Biodegradation in the northern peatlands is slow in part due to acidic and nutrient-poor soil conditions, so biomass accumulates over time as <b>peat.</b> <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>mosses</b> partner with bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen to supplement their nitrogen intake in these nutrient-poor soils. Climate change is altering temperatures, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition rates in the northern peatlands. These changes are accompanied by an increased release of greenhouse gases and a decline in Sphagnum ground coverage. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with Sphagnum mosses need to be studied in order to understand how their relationship will be impacted by climate change.

40|$|Premise of {{the study}} : The Sphagnopsida, an early-diverging lineage of mosses (phylum Bryophyta), are morphologically and ecologically unique and have {{profound}} impacts on global climate. The Sphagnopsida are currently classifi ed in two genera, <b>Sphagnum</b> (<b>peat</b> <b>mosses)</b> with some 350 – 500 species and Ambuchanania with one species. An analysis of phylogenetic relationships among species and genera in the Sphagnopsida were conducted to resolve major lineages and relationships among species within the Sphagnopsida. Methods : Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences from the nuclear, plastid, and mitochondrial genomes (11 704 nucleotides total) were conducted and analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference employing seven different substitution models of varying complexity. Key results : Phylogenetic analyses resolved three lineages within the Sphagnopsida: (1) Sphagnum sericeum, (2) S. inretortum plus Ambuchanania leucobryoides, and (3) all remaining species of Sphagnum. Sister group relationships among these three clades could not be resolved, but the phylogenetic {{results indicate that the}} highly divergent morphology of A. leucobryoides is derived within the Sphagnopsida rather than plesiomorphic.
