Despite this lack of correspondence, we show that histograms derived from a chaotic time series can be accurately predicted by an escape-time weighting of UPO histograms.

25|$|The {{phase curve}} of Mercury is very steep, which is {{characteristic}} of a body on which bare regolith (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° (crescent phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope {{on the surface of}} Mercury of about 16°, which is slightly smoother than that of the Moon. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a <b>sharp</b> <b>peak.</b> This surge in brightness is called the opposition effect because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.|$|E

40|$|The {{electron}} {{dynamics and}} {{the density of}} states of both single and periodic Si delta-doped GaAs subject to an applied electric field are studied theoretically. The space charge potential due to delta-doping is obtained {{by means of the}} semiclassical Thomas-Fermi model. Analysing the change in the density of states introduced by the delta-doping plus the electric field, we observe a set of <b>sharp</b> <b>peaks,</b> corresponding to field-induced localized states, and subsidiary peaks associated with more extended states. Furthermore, we use the inverse participation ratio to evaluate the spatial extent of electron wavefunctions. The number of <b>sharp</b> <b>peaks</b> equals the number of delta-doped layers.

2500|$|Theile {{arrived in}} Rome as an outsider, despite being the {{defending}} champion as he had not regained his form of four years prior, with Robert Bennett and Frank McKinney of the United States posting faster times. This {{appeared to be the}} case in the heats, with Theile posting the third fastest time behind the American duo. In the semifinals, Bennett was unable to repeat his earlier performance and Theile won, while McKinney won the other semifinal, also in a time slower than Theile. Theile was confident approaching the final, recounting [...] "I had great faith in myself and my abilities. I had a short, <b>sharp</b> <b>peak,</b> which meant that I had to save everything for that burst and then exert everything I had for precisely that moment." [...] Theile attacked at the outset in the final, as was his style, and held a slender lead at the 50-metre mark over McKinney and Bennett. Theile made a good turn, lengthening his lead to half a body length, before holding off a late surge to claim consecutive gold medals, defeating McKinney by just 0.2 s, setting a new Olympic record in the event. For the first time, the 4×100-metre medley relay was contested at the Olympics, and combining with Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton, the Australians finished well behind the Americans to win the silver medal.|$|E
2500|$|Uncertainty exists {{regarding}} {{the duration of}} the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Some evidence suggests that there were multiple extinction pulses or that the extinction was spread out over a few million years, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>peak</b> in the last million years of the Permian. Statistical analyses of some highly fossiliferous strata in Meishan, Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, suggest that the main extinction was clustered around one peak. Recent research shows that different groups became extinct at different times; for example, while difficult to date absolutely, ostracod and brachiopod extinctions were separated by 670 to 1170 thousand years. In a well-preserved sequence in east Greenland, the decline of animals is concentrated in a period 10 to [...] long, with plants taking several hundred thousand additional years to show the full impact of the event. An older theory, still supported in some recent papers, is that there were two major extinction pulses 9.4 million years apart, separated by a period of extinctions well above the background level, and that the final extinction killed off only about 80% of marine species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses. According to this theory one of these extinction pulses occurred {{at the end of the}} Guadalupian epoch of the Permian.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked in}} the {{direction}} of their burning city, and beheld, on the <b>sharp</b> <b>peak</b> of the highest mountain (now visible in the grey morning light), an object like a gigantic pine-tree of fire. The blazing trunk rose, slim and straight, from the mountain crest, and, at a vast height, developed a wilderness of burning branches. Fearful hollow sounds came from the hill, its sides were seamed with racing cataracts of living lava, of coursing and leaping flames, which rolled down with incredible swiftness and speed towards the doomed city. Then the waters of the harbour were smitten and shaken, and the William Wilberforce rocked and heaved as in the most appalling storm, though all the winds were silent, while a mighty wave swept far inland towards the streams of fire. There was no room for doubt; a volcanic eruption was occurring, and a submarine earthquake, as not uncommonly happens, had also taken place. Our only hope was in immediate flight. Presently steam was got up, and we steamed away into the light of the glowing east, leaving behind us only a burning island, and a fire like an ugly dawn flaring in the western sky.|$|E
60|$|As we {{traveled}} {{on down the}} canyon its dimensions continued to grow. It finally turned to the left, and opened out wide into a valley running west. A low range of hills faced us, rising in a long sweeping slant of earth, like the incline of a glacier, to rounded spurs. Half way up this slope, where the brown earth lightened there showed an outcropping of clay-amber and cream and cinnamon and green, all exquisitely vivid and clear. This bright spot appeared to be isolated. Far above it rose other clay slopes of variegated hues, red and russet and mauve and gray, and colors indescribably merged, all running in veins through this range of hills. We faced the west again, and descending this valley were soon greeted by a region of clay hills, bare, cone-shaped, fantastic in shade, slope, and ridge, with a high <b>sharp</b> <b>peak</b> dominating all. The colors were mauve, taupe, pearl-gray, all stained by a descending band of crimson, as if a higher slope had been stabbed to let its life blood flow down. The softness, the richness and beauty of this texture of earth amazed and delighted my eyes.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} linear and third-order nonlinear {{optical properties}} of metallic colloidal crystal {{immersed in a}} graded-index host fluid are investigated theoretically. The local electric fields are extracted self-consistently based on the layer-to-layer interactions, which are readily given by the Lekner summation method. The resultant optical absorption and nonlinearity enhancement show a series of <b>sharp</b> <b>peaks,</b> which merge in a broadened resonant band. The <b>sharp</b> <b>peaks</b> become a continuous band for increasing packing density and number of layers. We believe that the <b>sharp</b> <b>peaks</b> arise from the in-plane dipolar interactions and the surface plasmon resonance, whereas the continuous band {{is due to the}} presence of the gradient in the host refractive index.

6000|$|I {{repeatedly}} {{ascended the}} north flank of Tukcham along a watercourse, {{by the side}} of which were immense slips of rocks and snow-beds; the mountain-side being excessively steep. Some of the masses of gneiss thus brought down were dangerously poised on slopes of soft shingle, and daily moved a little downwards. All the rocks were gneiss and granite, with radiating crystals of tourmaline as thick as the thumb. Below 12,000 to 13,000 feet the mountain-sides were covered with a dense scrub of rhododendron bushes, except where broken by rocks, landslips, and torrents: above this the winter's snow lay deep, and black rocks and small glaciers, over which avalanches were constantly falling with a sullen roar, forbade all attempts to proceed. My object in ascending was chiefly to obtain views and compass- bearings, in which I was generally disappointed: once only I had a magnificent prospect of Kinchinjunga, sweeping down in one unbroken mass of glacier and ice, fully 14,000 feet high, {{to the head of the}} Thlonok river, whose upper valley appeared a broad bay of ice; doubtless forming one of the largest glaciers in the Himalaya, and increased by lateral feeders that flow into it from either flank of the valley. The south side of this (the Thlonok) valley is formed by a range from Kinchinjunga, running east to Tukcham, where it terminates: from it rises the beautiful mountain Liklo,* [D2 of the peaks laid down in Colonel Waugh's [...] "Trigonometrical Survey from Dorjiling," [...] I believe to be the [...] "Liklo" [...] of Dr. Campbell's itineraries from Dorjiling to Lhassa, compiled from the information of the traders (See [...] "Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal" [...] for 1848); the routes in which proved of the utmost value to me.] 22,582 feet high, which, from Dorjiling, appears as a <b>sharp</b> <b>peak,</b> but is here seen to be a jagged crest running north and south. On the north flank of the valley the mountains are more sloping and black, with patches of snow above 15,000 feet, but little anywhere else, except on another beautiful peak (alt. 19,240 feet) marked D3 on the map. This flank is also continuous from Kinchin; it divides Sikkim from Tibet, and runs north-east to the great mountain Chomiomo (which was not visible), the streams from its north flank flowing into the Arun river (in Tibet). A beautiful blue arch of sky spanned all this range, indicating the dry Tibetan climate beyond.|$|E
