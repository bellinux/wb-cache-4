40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} ability of a {{computerized}} method of sperm morphology with the manually recorded method in predicting in vitro fertilization (IVF) results, to compare results obtained by both methods, and to determine the intraobservation variability. Design, Setting, Patients: Forty-three stained semen <b>slide</b> <b>preparations</b> from two large level-three academic institutions' reproductive endocrinology units (IVF programs) were blindly evaluated, and the sperm were classified into normal and amorphous forms. Results: Experiment 1 : Twenty-one <b>slide</b> <b>preparations</b> from the Tygerberg gamete intrafallopian transfer program were manually evaluated; the fertilization rates for the groups with 14 % normal sperm forms were 33. 3 % (15 / 45 oocytes) and 76. 6 % (46 / 60 oocytes), respectively. Corresponding fertilization rates with FERTECH were 46. 8 % (30 / 64) and 75. 6 % (31 / 41). Experiment 2 : Twenty-two <b>slide</b> <b>preparations</b> from the Norfolk IVF program were evaluated. The manual method reported a fertilization rate in the group with 14 % normal forms. Corresponding figures for the FERTECH method were 33. 9 % (18 / 53) and 88. 4 % (123 / 139), respectively. Experiment 3 : When the 43 <b>slide</b> <b>preparations</b> were blindly evaluated using both methods, 84 % of the FERTECH evaluations correlated well with the manual method and FERTECH ability to diagnose the subfertile male (14 % as classified by the manual method. In the first group (14 %) 95 % (38 / 40) of the cases were correctly identified. Conclusion: Using strict criteria for morphology evaluation, there is a positive and significant correlation between FERTECH evaluation and manual assessment. The reproducibility of the computerized method and the ability to distinguish between fertile and subfertile groups using those criteria are good. Articl...|$|R
50|$|Fungal {{culture medium}} {{is used for}} {{positive}} identification of the species. Usually fungal growth is noted in 5 to 14 days. Microscopic morphology of the micro- and macroconidia is the most reliable identification character, but a good <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> is needed, and also needed is the stimulation of sporulation in some strains. Culture characteristics such as surface texture, topography and pigmentation are variable so they are the least reliable criteria for identification. Clinical information such as {{the appearance of the}} lesion, site, geographic location, travel history, animal contacts and race is also important, especially in identifying rare non-sporulating species like Trichophyton concentricum, Microsporum audouinii and Trichophyton schoenleinii.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} of metaphase chromosomes {{is one of}} the main tools of classical cytogenetics and cancer studies. Chromosomes are condensed (thickened) and highly coiled in metaphase, which makes them most suitable for visual analysis. Metaphase chromosomes make the classical picture of chromosomes (karyotype). For classical cytogenetic analyses, cells are grown in short term culture and arrested in metaphase using mitotic inhibitor. Further they are used for <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> and banding (staining) of chromosomes to be visualised under microscope to study structure and number of chromosomes (karyotype). Staining of the slides, often with Giemsa (G banding) or Quinacrine, produces a pattern of in total up to several hundred bands. Normal metaphase spreads are used in methods like FISH and as a hybridization matrix for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments.|$|E
30|$|The {{hypotonic}} solution step {{is further}} followed up by fixing the samples using Carnoy’s fixative solution, and preparing a cell suspension. Furthermore, during <b>slide</b> <b>preparation,</b> {{factors such as}} fixative evaporation rate and preheating of slides affect {{the quality and quantity}} of mitotic chromosomal spread (Moore and Best 2001). Therefore, the approach to <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> is another important step as employing improper spreading techniques would cause the chromosomes to be washed out during the staining process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Slide {{making is}} the most {{critical}} aspect of good banding <b>preparations.</b> <b>Slide</b> making is best done after the cells have been in fixative at 4 ºC overnight. Variables affecting preparation includes relative humidity, room temperature, drying time and number of cells per slide. Increased height {{is often used to}} increase spreading. We have designed a simple Dropper device for our <b>slide</b> <b>preparations.</b> This facilitates easy operation and well spread chromosomes are obtained. This device is made of stainless steel with a broad base where a main rod is fixed. Two side rods are fixed with clamps, attached to the main rod. Both can be raised or lowered according to the requirement. The upper one is provided with a pipette-holder where the pipette with the material can be inserted. The lower one is provided with a grooved plate with a ball and a socket to adjust the angle. The slide is pushed gently from the plate lengthwise as the material is dropped from the pipette. We have been using this for our lymphocyte culture <b>slide</b> <b>preparations</b> and we are quite satisfied of its use...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{integrated}} device for preparing metaphase chromosomes spread slides (FISHprep). The quality of cytogenetic analysis from patient samples greatly {{relies on the}} efficiency of sample pre-treatment and/or <b>slide</b> <b>preparation.</b> In cytogenetic <b>slide</b> <b>preparation,</b> cell cultures are routinely used to process samples (for culture, arrest and fixation of cells) and/or to expand limited amount of samples (in case of prenatal diagnostics). Arguably, this expansion and other sample pretreatments form the longest part of the entire diagnostic protocols spanning over 3 – 4 days. We present here a novel device with an integrated expansion chamber to culture, arrest and fix metaphase cells followed by a subsequent splashing protocol leading to ample metaphase chromosome spreads on a glass slide for metaphase FISH analysis. The device provides an easy, disposable, low cost, integrated solution with minimal handling for metaphase FISH <b>slide</b> <b>preparation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} factors involved in cell culturing and <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> of amniotic fluid (AF) and chorionic villus biopsies (CVB) for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. Methods The effect {{on the outcome of}} our standard AF cell culture procedure of volume and appearance of the submitted AF specimen, gynaccologist performing the amniocentesis, week of gestation in which the specimen was taken and culture medium was retrospectively investigated. In a prospective study controlled experimental variation was introduced in composition of fixative, relative humidity, temperature and airflow during <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> from primary CVB and AF in situ cultures. For evaluation, analysis of regression or variance was used. Results Provided that at least 0. 8 mL AF per culture dish was admitted, none of the investigated factors appeared as critical resulting in unacceptable variation in outcome. Variation in appearance of the AF had a relatively major impact: bloody or brown AF resulted in a 3 days longer culture time. To a limited degree, metaphase quality of AF and CVB cells was affected by composition of fixative, relative humidity, ambient temperature and airflow during <b>slide</b> <b>preparation.</b> Conclusion Current prenatal cytogenetic practice as described here appears in general to be robust and reliable. The investigated conditions are not critical within the investigated range. Expensive measures for fine control of these conditions are, therefore, not required.

40|$|Laser microdissection is an {{invaluable}} tool in medical research that facilitates collecting specific cell populations for molecular analysis. Diversity of research targets (e. g., cancerous and precancerous lesions in clinical and animal research, cell pellets, rodent embryos, etc.) and varied scientific objectives, however, present challenges toward establishing standard laser microdissection protocols. Sample preparation {{is crucial for}} quality RNA, DNA and protein retrieval, where it often determines the feasibility of a laser microdissection project. The majority of microdissection studies in clinical and animal model research are conducted on frozen tissues containing native nucleic acids, unmodified by fixation. However, the variable morphological quality of frozen sections from tissues containing fat, collagen or delicate cell structures can limit or prevent successful harvest of the desired cell population via laser dissection. The CryoJane Tape-Transfer System®, a commercial device that improves cryosectioning outcomes on glass slides has been reported superior for <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> and isolation of high quality osteocyte RNA (frozen bone) during laser dissection. Considering the reported advantages of CryoJane for laser dissection on glass slides, we asked whether the system could also work with the plastic membrane slides used by UV laser based microdissection instruments, as these are better suited for collection of larger target areas. In an attempt to optimize laser microdissection <b>slide</b> <b>preparation</b> for tissues of different RNA stability and cryosectioning difficulty, we evaluated the CryoJane system for use with both glass (laser capture microdissection) and membrane (laser cutting microdissection) slides.
