5000|$|Monitoring of the {{landfill}} gas {{itself can be}} used diagnostically. When there is concern regarding {{the possibility of an}} ongoing <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> event, or landfill fire, the presence in {{the landfill}} gas of compounds that are more stable at the high temperatures of such an event ( [...] above 500 deg C [...] ) can be evidence for such a process occurring. The presence of propene, which can be formed from propane at temperatures above several hundred degrees C, supports high temperatures. The presence of elevated concentrations of dihydrogen (H2) in the landfill gas is also consistent with elevated temperatures at remote locations some distance from the gas-extraction well. The presence of H2 is consistent with thermal inactivation of -reducing microbes, which normally combine all H2 produced by fermentation of organic acids with [...] to form methane (CH4). H2-producing microbes are less temperature-sensitive than -reducing microbes so that elevated temperatures can inactivate them and their recovery can be delayed over the H2-producers. This can result in H2 production without the (usually [...] )corresponding consumption, resulting in elevated concentrations of H2 in the landfill gas (up to >25%v:v at some sites). Thermal deactivation of CO2-reducing microbes has been used to produce CO2 (rather than methane) from municipal solid waste (Yu, et al., 2002).|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of hydrogen-terminated Si(111) and oxide-terminated silicon surfaces with neat anhydrous liquid methanol (CH 3 OH) {{has been studied}} with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) {{as a function of}} solution temperature and immersion time. At 65 °C, {{reaction of}} atomically smooth H-Si(111) surfaces with CH 3 OH (l) results in partially methoxylated silicon surfaces that are free of any detectable <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> (Si-O-Si bonds); this is in contrast to observable oxidation found after similar reactions on H-Si(100) surfaces. At long reaction times (t> 3 h), the Si(111) surface saturates with Si-OCH 3 sites at a coverage of approximately 30 % of a monolayer, with the residual ∼ 70 % comprised of unreacted Si-H sites. The lack of any detectable silicon oxide makes it possible to conclude the following: (i) Reaction mechanisms involving insertion of oxygen atoms from the CH 3 OH molecule into the subsurface Si-Si back bonds cannot be dominant for (111) -oriented silicon under these conditions. (ii) The vibrational modes of the oxide-free surface are very sharp and can be clearly distinguished from blue-shifted modes observed for methoxyl groups chemisorbed on oxidized surfaces. For surfaces that display <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation,</b> no evidence for oxygen atoms directly below atop Si-H sites has been observed. Instead, FTIR analysis demonstrates that <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> selectively exists underneath atop Si-OCH 3 sites. Finally, H-terminated oxide surfaces, prepared by reacting trichlorosilanes on OH-terminated SiO 2 surfaces, react with methanol to form a methoxy-terminated oxide surface. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Flake and {{spheroidal}} graphite cast irons with similar composition {{were subjected to}} high temperature oxidation to investigate graphite morphology and distribution effects on the oxidation behavior. High temperature oxidation tests were conducted between 400 and 750 C in air. For comparison low carbon steel was also tested. Graphite morphology obviously affected high-temperature oxidation resis-tance. The {{flake graphite cast iron}} exhibited the worst high-temperature oxidation resistance compared with {{spheroidal graphite}} cast iron. Since graphite flakes provide suitable sites for the iron oxide growth and are almost interconnected, the iron oxide grows faster and penetrates along the graphite flakes boundaries resulting in the <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Due to the severe <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> flake graphite cast iron parabolic rate constants are five times higher than that of the spheroidal graphite cast iron.

The concretions, including calcitic, dolomitic and mixed mineralogies, have varied morphologies {{in many cases}} suggestive of conduits or pipes that channelled the escape of subsurface fluids and/or hydrocarbon gases. The extracted lipids include water column and/or diagenetically-derived alkanes, fatty acids and alcohols as well as specific marker compounds (including archaeal pentamethylicosane (PMI) and archaeol) associated with <b>subsurface</b> anaerobic <b>oxidation</b> of upwardly seeping methane gas (AOM). Strong carbon- 13 isotopic depletions (δ 13 C – 75 to – 120 ‰) measured for PMI, archaeol and other AOM-specific marker compounds on three concretion samples support involvement of AOM in generating bicarbonate-rich fluid that was at least partly responsible for cementing the pipe-like concretions and central conduits. Other morphological types appear not to be AOM-related. Sterane and n-alkane parameters indicate low thermal maturity of the extracted organic matter.

A specimen design simulating a maxillary central incisor coping was employed to conserve metal, while providing thin and thick sections to yield a range of solidification rates. The alloys were centrifugally cast in air, following standard dental laboratory techniques; three castings were prepared for each alloy.

It is clear from FIB preparations that features previously interpreted as networks of voids have been demonstrated to be internal oxides by varying the sample tilt angles and imaging signal using either secondary electrons (SEs) or secondary ions (SIs). Conventional preparation methods illustrate the presence of subsurface alumina intrusions and the absence of voids, supporting previous evidence. The positive identification of voids and oxides by FIB can be complex and prone to misinterpretation and thus, the use of several imaging conditions and tilt angles must be used, along with conventional preparation methods, to confirm or refute the presence of ‘voids’ underneath oxides...|$|R

Substitutional P and B defects are energetically unstable within the native oxide layer, and are preferentially located at or beneath the Si/SiOx interface. Consistently, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of native oxide formation on doped surfaces reveal that dopants avoid the formation of P-O and B-O bonds, suggesting a surface oxidation mechanism whereby impurities remain trapped at the Si/SiOx interface.

High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) with Focused Ion Beam (FIB) sample preparation and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) was {{used to analyze the}} composition, crystal structure, morphology, size, spatial distribution and interfacial structure of the oxides on the steel surface and in the subsurface.

SiO 2 (x 1) particles were formed in the Mn-depleted ferritic subsurface. MnO oxide layer was formed at the surface and no c-xMnO. SiO 2 (x> 2) or amorphous a-xMnO. SiO 2 (x< 0. 9) particles were formed at the MnO/steel interface. For Al-added TWIP steel, after austenitic annealing in external oxidation atmosphere, three kinds of oxide layers were formed on the surface: an outer MnO layer, an intermediate amorphous a-xMnO. SiO 2 (x< 0. 9) and a thin inner crystalline c-CxMnO. Al 2 O 3 (0. 8 <x< 1. 2). Smaller voids were formed between the a-xMnO. SiO 2 (x< 0. 9) and the c-CxMnO.

Alloys such as RR 1000 are being trialled as they perform better at higher temperatures than current nickel-based superalloys. To achieve weight savings, inertia welding is being trialled for turbine discs but current post weld heat treatments reduce fatigue life. In this investigation, a number of novel post weld heat treatments were trialled aimed at improving post weld microstructure and fatigue properties. Extensive microstructural characterisation and mechanical testing {{were used to assess}} the effect of these treatments on both parent and weld materials. Post weld heat treatment (PWHT) was found to have a great effect on the size and distribution of γ' and carbides, particularly when a PWHT temperature of 980 ºC or above was used. The effect of this microstructural change on the hardness of the weld and parent material has also been characterised. Extensive total life fatigue testing was carried out at 650 ºC. It was found that failure can occur in both the parent and weld material, although it is deduced that the yield stress of the weld needs to be surpassed to see weld failure (plasticity in the weld). Increasing dwell time at peak load reduced the life of these components. Two mechanisms for crack growth were observed with initiation either at the surface or at a large Hf rich particle <b>subsurface.</b> <b>Oxidation</b> was found to have a large effect on both initiation and growth of fatigue cracks.

40|$|The {{principle}} of subsurface iron removal for drinking water supply is that aerated water is periodically {{injected into the}} aquifer through a tube well. On {{its way into the}} aquifer, the injected O 2 -rich water oxidizes adsorbed Fe 2 +, creating a <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone. When groundwater abstraction is resumed, the soluble Fe 2 + is adsorbed and water with reduced Fe concentrations is abstracted for multiple volumes of the injection water. In this article, Fe accumulation deposits in the aquifer near subsurface treatment wells were identified and characterized to assess the sustainability of subsurface iron removal regarding clogging of the aquifer and the potential co-accumulation of other groundwater constituents, such as As. Chemical extraction of soil samples, with Acid-Oxalate and HNO 3, showed that Fe had accumulated at specific depths near subsurface iron removal wells after 12 years of operation. Whether it was due to preferred flow paths or geochemical mineralogy conditions; subsurface iron removal clearly favoured certain soil layers. The total Fe content increased between 11. 5 and 390. 8 mmol/kg ds in the affected soil layers, and the accumulated Fe was found to be 56 - 100 % crystalline. These results suggest that precipitated amorphous Fe hydroxides have transformed to Fe hydroxides of higher crystallinity. These crystalline, compact Fe hydroxides have not noticeably clogged the investigated well and/or aquifer between 1996 and 2008. The subsurface iron removal wells even need less frequent rehabilitation, as drawdown increases more slowly than in normal production wells. Other groundwater constituents, such as Mn, As and Sr were found to co-accumulate with Fe. Acid extraction and ESEM-EDX showed that Ca occurred together with Fe and by X-ray Powder Diffraction it was identified as calcite. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{variation}} of the surface ultraviolet (UV) environment on Mars was investigated with particular emphasis being placed on the interpretation of data in a biological context. A UV model has been developed to yield the surface UV irradiance {{at any time and}} place over the Martian year. Seasonal and diurnal variations were calculated and dose rates evaluated. Biological interpretation of UV doses is performed through the calculation of DNA damage effects upon phage T 7 and Uracil, used as examples for biological dosimeters. A solar UV 'hotspot' was revealed towards perihelion in the southern hemisphere, with a significant damaging effect upon these species. Diurnal profiles of UV irradiance are also seen to vary markedly between aphelion and perihelion. The effect of UV dose is also discussed in terms of the chemical environment of the Martian regolith, since UV irradiance can reach high enough levels so as to have a significant effect upon the soil chemistry. We show, by assuming that H 2 O is the main source of hydrogen in the Martian atmosphere, that the stoichiometrically desirable ratio of 2 : 1 for atmospheric H and O loss rates to space are not maintained and at present the ratio is about 20 : 1. A large planetary oxygen surface sink is therefore necessary, in contrast with escape to space. This surface oxygen sink has important implications for the oxidation potential and the toxicology of the Martian soil. UV-induced adsorption of O_ 2 ^- super-radicals {{plays an important role in}} the oxidative environment of the Martian surface, and the biologically damaging areas found in this study are also shown to be regions of high <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Furthermore, we briefly cover the astrobiological implications for landing sites that are planned for future Mars missions...|$|E

This paper presents a case study that involved bench-scale testing and field demonstration of ISCO via Mechanical Auger Mixing (MAM) that resulted in over 95 % removal of chlorinated and non-chlorinated chemicals identified as recalcitrant. Also presented are ISCO’s effects on dissolved oxygen levels in the underlying aquifer. Mechanical mixing of soils with an oxidant solution is an improved remedial strategy that facilitates more effective mixing of reagants with affected soils and hence in more effective treatment than from injection of oxidant. Based on the apparent effectiveness of persulfate in bench-scale tests, ISCO utilizing persulfate {{and a source of}} alkalinity was then applied to the demonstration site. The site is a 1970 s era waste disposal area where a multitude of different types of wastes were disposed. Six chemical constituents comprised the most abundant COCs at the subject site. These compounds are: 1, 1 -dichloroethane, vinyl chloride, acetone, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, benzene, and tertiary butyl alcohol. Solutions of 20 % sodium persulfate and 2 % of different alkaline sources were found to be most effective in bench scale tests. After the successful field demonstration, it was noted that dissolved oxygen levels increased in the underlying aquifer within about one month and persisted for about nine months.

40|$|The Gulf of Mexico {{hydrocarbon}} seeps {{are often}} populated by dense mussel beds and tubeworm aggregations, {{as well as}} exposed authigenic carbonate outcrops. Previous studies suggest the activity of mussels and tubeworms could influence the sediment geochemistry of their habitats, resulting in variations in the stable carbon isotopes of the associated carbonates. However, this conclusion {{was based on the}} analyses of samples from a single site. To better understand whether there are consistent differences in the geochemical environments of mussels and tubeworms, mineralogical and stable isotopic compositions of authigenic carbonates from mussel and tubeworm environments from four seep sites were analyzed. The studied sites span a depth range of 1200 m to 2800 m on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental slope. We found that carbonate samples from tubeworm environments were more prone to contain aragonite whereas carbonates from mussel environments {{were more likely to have}} calcite. This finding supports the hypothesis that vestimentiferans release sulfate across their roots into the pore waters of the surrounding sediments, a process that could generate a locally sulfate-enriched environment that favors the precipitation of aragonite instead of calcite. Moreover, the delta C- 13 values of tubeworm carbonates are generally lighter than that of mussel carbonates from the same site, which is consistent with the fact that tubeworms are fueling extra <b>subsurface</b> methane <b>oxidation</b> through the release of sulfate into the sediment. Such a process, consequently, enriches the subsurface dissolved inorganic carbon pool with light carbon derived from the seeping hydrocarbons. Taken together, our data suggest that tubeworms could produce a carbon isotope shift that is sufficient to influence the sediment geochemistry of their immediate area, and that this impact is reflected in the associated authigenic carbonates.

The shallowest samples of carbonate nodules and dissolved inorganic carbon of pore water samples beneath the sulfate reduction zone (0 - 160 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) at Site 1165 have extremely negative d 13 C values (- 50 per mil and - 62 per mil, respectively). These negative d 13 C values indicate nodule formation in association with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction. The 34 S of residual sulfate at Site 1165 shows only minor 34 S enrichment (+ 6 per mil), even with complete sulfate reduction. This small degree of apparent 34 S enrichment is due to extreme "open-system" sulfate reduction, with sulfate abundantly resupplied by diffusion from overlying seawater. Ten calcite nodules from Site 1165 contain minor quartz and feldspar and have d 13 C values ranging from - 49. 7 per mil to - 8. 2 per mil.

40|$|A {{sequential}} extraction {{scheme was}} used to isolate organic P and inorganic P associated with various forms of Fe, Mn and major cations in two low-carbonate cores from the outer Texas shelf, in which sulfate reduction is minor. Although total extractable P does not change significantly with depth, {{there is a strong}} shift in the phase associations. At the surface and the <b>subsurface</b> <b>oxidation</b> maximum of both cores, inorganic P is associated mainly with oxidized Fe. Oxidation of organic matter by reduction of the hydrous Fe-oxides causes a rapid decrease in both the hydrous-Fe-oxide-related P and organic P in the more reducing parts of the cores. The P released during these reactions becomes associated with Mg, Al, K and reduced Fe in one or more highly reactive [1 M acetic acid (HOAc) -soluble] phases with an average Mg:K:Fe:P molar ratio of ~ 16 : 6 : 6 : 1. Although the exact nature of the HOAc-soluble P phase is unknown, it appears to control pore-water concentrations of P, precluding formation of struvite or vivianite. (C/P) org ratios in both cores tend to increase with depth in the sediment column, which suggests preferential breakdown of organic P. The shallower station 19 (32 m) has an average molar (C/P) org ratio of 190, whereas station 9 (112 m) has an average ratio of 253. Accumulation rates of hydrogenous P at station 19 are between 40 and 140 [mu]g P cm- 2 yr. - 1, while rates at station 9 are 20 [mu]g P cm- 2 yr. - 1. These rates are 5 - 35 times greater than average accumulation rates of P along ridge crests, where high concentrations of P are associated with hydrogenous Fe. Flux calculations indicate ~ 0. 2 [mu]g P cm- 2 yr. - 1 of dissolved reactive P is released from sediments at the deeper station, while 6 - 55 [mu]g P cm- 2 yr. - 1 is released from the sediments at the shallower station...|$|E

Mechanical properties, oxidation, and wear properties of UHMWPE materials subjected to various thermal treatments have been investigated immediately after irradiation as well as after several years of aging. Nevertheless, the relationship between all these parameters is not yet fully understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the thermal treatments that could be applied to irradiated UHMWPE [lower (60) or higher (150) than 140 °C, the melting temperature of the polymer] and the mechanical properties, the oxidation and the fracture behavior of the material. The effect of artificial aging on these properties was also investigated. This study concludes that immediately after the annealing, the mechanical properties (UTS and) of the irradiated and annealed material are improved compared with those of nonirradiated material. Although nonirradiated material has higher fracture toughness than irradiated and annealed materials, the materials break according to the same mechanism of fracture. After aging, no changes could be observed in any of the measured properties for nonirradiated material. On the other hand, important changes could be seen in both irradiated and annealed material after aging. Both UTS and decreased, much more so in the case of 60. Furthermore, the aging induced a <b>subsurface</b> peak of <b>oxidation</b> in both irradiated and annealed materials, twice as intense for 60 than for 150. The mechanism of fracture of these materials changed drastically after aging, probably due to the presence of the oxidation peak, which seems to occur at a location where cracks initiate easily compared with the nonoxidized bulk of the material. In the case of 60, it seems clear that a correlation between mechanical property, oxidation, and fracture mechanism exists. Such a relationship could not be found for 150. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

This laboratory-scale investigation utilized geochemical and physical characterization data collected on 0. 5 to 1 foot intervals from four borehole locations. Results of this laboratory study did not provide definitive support any of the proposed hypotheses for explaining chromate breakthrough at the Hanford 100 -D Area ISRM barrier. While site characterization data indicate a significant degree of vertical variability in both physical and geochemical properties in the four boreholes investigated, lateral continuity of high conductivity/low reductive capacity zones was not observed. The one exception was at the water table, where low reductive capacity and high-K zones were observed in 3 of four boreholes. Laterally continuous high permeability zones that contain oxic sediment near the water table is the most likely explanation for high concentration chromium breakthrough responses observed at various locations along the barrier. A mechanism that could explain partial chromate breakthrough in the ISRM barrier is the relationship between the field reductive capacity and the rate of chromate <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Subsurface</b> zones with low reductive capacity still have sufficient ferrous iron mass to reduce considerable chromate, but the rate of chromate reduction slows by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude relative to sediments with moderate to high reductive capacity. The original barrier longevity estimate of 160 pore volumes for homogeneous reduced sediment, or approximately 20 years, (with 5 mg/L dissolved oxygen and 2 ppm chromate) is reduced to 85 pore volumes (10 years) when the wide spread 60 ppm nitrate plume is included in the calculation. However, this reduction in barrier lifetime is not as great for high permeability channels, as there is insufficient time to reduce nitrate (and consume ferrous iron). If the cause of laterally discontinuous breakthrough of chromate along the ISRM barrier is due to oxic transport of chromate near the water table, additional dithionite treatment in these zones will not be effective. Treatment near the water table with a technology that emplaces considerable reductive capacity is needed, such as injectable zero valent iron...|$|R
