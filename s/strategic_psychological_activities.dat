These are Piaget's model of social exchange, sociology, concept of egocentrism, response to Wallon, psycho-social parallelism, distinction between the concrete and the abstract. In the second part, we challenge two central theses invoked in Harré's review, namely (A) all <b>psychological</b> <b>activity</b> is a joint activity, and (B) any society is based on irreducible differences in <b>psychological</b> <b>activity.</b> We have tried {{to set the record straight}} as far as Piaget's social account is concerned.

40|$|Theorising <b>psychological</b> <b>activity</b> as {{a spatial}} product appears a logical {{extension}} of moves in social theory to emphasise {{the role of}} space {{and place in the}} consideration of experience. Catalysed by turns in social and human geographies to highlight the role of space and location in constituting <b>psychological</b> <b>activity,</b> various forms of the ‘spatialisation of experience’ have emerged. In this paper I will follow this theoretical direction in relation to the underlying destabilisation of everyday life that emerges as a product of theoretical formations that emphasise the fluidity of space. More specifically, I will take the example of the home as a central space in the ongoing activity of people with enduring mental distress. Forging a theoretical line that takes in geographies of mental health, the home, and finally, Gilles Deleuze’s work on ‘repetition’ and ‘habit’, I will analyse the role of home spaces in everyday life. Key here is a concern regarding the impact of theoretical emphases on continuity, mobility, and instability on understandings of the everyday lives of mental health service users. This includes addressing conceptualisations of the home space alongside the activities of the people who occupy, and hence co-make, such spaces. The article concludes by framing ‘spatial habituation’ of the everyday as central to creating a perceivable stability, analysis of which can aid understanding of the challenges facing people suffering with mental distress...|$|R
