EEG was followed up {{in the course of this}} experiment. 1) Local application of penicillin into cortex or <b>subcortical</b> <b>nucleus</b> or thalamus considerably elicited epileptogenic discharges. 2) In case of focal cortical epileptogenic discharge, the first spike appearing at the neighbouring area of the focus was followed to be associated with the synchronous spike discharge at the opposite side and then the focal seizure discharge was built. The discharge was occaionally interrupted by the interictal state, building, in some of the cases, the final stage of generalized seizure discharge. 3) So was noted in its appearance and process in case of focal subcortical epileptogenic discharge. But there was a more tendency of transmission of its activity to the opposite side in comparison with the cortical epileptogenic discharge. 4) The epileptogenic discharge originated from unilateral cortical focus was abolished or inhibited by means of ipsilateral intracarotid injection of 5 to 10 mg sodium amobarbital, but was not affected by the contralateral administration. However, either side of the injection could not inhibit the discharge activity after it became a focal seigure discharge. 5) Subcortically elicited epileptogenic discharge, in contrast, could not be interfered by either side of the intracarotid administration. 6) In cases of both focal cortical and subcortical discharge, intracarotid injection of sodium amobarbital manifested a tendency of flattening and slowing of back ground activity at the injected side, but not at the opposide side. 7) The intracarotid administration could not activate the epileptogenic discharges either from cortex and subcortex...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that basic {{emotions}} are responsible for a significant enhancement of early visual processes and increased activation in visual processing brain regions. It may be possible that the cognitive uncertainty and repeated behavioral checking evident in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is due to the existence of abnormalities in basic survival circuits, particularly those associated with the visual processing of the physical characteristics of emotional-laden stimuli. The objective {{of the present study was}} to test if patients with OCD show evidence of altered basic survival circuits, particularly those associated with the visual processing of the physical characteristics of emotional stimuli. Fifteen patients with OCD and 12 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging acquisition while being exposed to emotional pictures, with different levels of arousal, intended to trigger the defensive and appetitive basic survival circuits. Overall, the present results seem to indicate dissociation in the activity of the defense and appetitive survival systems in OCD. Results suggest that the clinical group reacts to basic threat with a strong activation of the defensive system mobilizing widespread brain networks (i. e., frontal, temporal, occipital-parietal, and <b>subcortical</b> <b>nucleus)</b> and blocking the activation of the appetitive system when facing positive emotional triggers from the initial stages of visual processing (i. e., superior occipital gyrus) ...|$|E

However, it remains unclear how the AI modulates the sound information processing in the DCN. This study examined the impact of focal electrical stimulation of AI on the auditory responses of the DCN neurons in mice. We found that the electrical stimulation induced {{significant changes in the}} best frequency (BF) of DCN neurons. The changes in the BFs were highly specific to the BF differences between the stimulated AI neurons and the recorded DCN neurons. The DCN BFs shifted higher when the AI BFs were higher than the DCN BFs and the DCN BFs shifted lower when the AI BFs were lower than the DCN BFs. The DCN BFs showed no change when the AI and DCN BFs were similar. Moreover, the BF shifts were linearly correlated to the BF differences. Thus, our data suggest that corticofugal modulation of the DCN is also highly specific to frequency information, similar to the corticofugal modulation of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the volumes of <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{in patients with}} chronic epilepsy. BACKGROUND: Animal and human data suggest a crucial role for subcortical structures in the modulation of seizure activity, mostly as seizure-suppressing relays. Although cortical epileptogenic foci can vary in localization and extent, it nevertheless appears that these structures subsequently influence seizure propagation in a universal fashion. There is, however, little knowledge {{about the size of}} implicated subcortical structures in patients with epilepsy. METHOD: Using high-resolution MRI, the volumes of selected <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei,</b> such as the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and pallidum, were measured in both hemispheres of 27 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Fourteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Statistical analysis was done for both normalized volumes (by total brain volume) and unnormalized volumes. RESULTS: Overall, the patient group had smaller thalamic and striatal volumes in both hemispheres, mostly ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. No significant correlations were noted between volume measurements and age, age at onset, duration of epilepsy, or total seizure frequency, including frequency of generalized seizures. The putamen and thalamus seemed to be affected predominantly in patients with a history of febrile convulsions, whereas patients without febrile convulsions had smaller caudate nuclei bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric measurements of <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> reveal atrophy of distinct <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the patient group, predominantly ipsilateral to the focus. This finding probably reflects persistent abnormalities and not secondary change. In addition, the structural differences between patients with and patients without previous febrile convulsions suggest that these conditions may have different causes...|$|R
40|$|The {{claustrum}} is a <b>subcortical</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{present in}} all placental mammals. Many anatomical {{studies have shown that}} its inputs are predominantly from the cerebral cortex and its outputs are back to the cortex. This connectivity thus suggests that the claustrum serves to amplify or facilitate information processing in the cerebral cortex. The size and the complexity of the cerebral cortex change dramatically over evolution. Rodents are lissencephalic, with few cortical areas, while many primates have a greatly expanded cortex and many cortical areas. This evolutionary diversity in the cerebral cortex raises several questions about the claustrum. Does its volume expand in coordination with the expansion of cortex and does it acquire new functions related to the new cortical functions? We have examined the organization of the claustrum in animals with large brains, including great apes and cetaceans. Our data suggest that the claustrum is not always a continuous structure. In monkeys and gorillas there are a few isolated islands of cells near {{the main body of the}} nucleus. In cetaceans, however, there are many isolated cell islands. These data suggest constraints on the possible function of the claustrum. Some authors propose that the claustrum has a more global role in perception or consciousness that requires intraclaustral integration of information. These theories postulate mechanisms like gap junctions between claustral cells or a syncytium to mediate intraclaustral processing. The presence of discontinuities in the structure of the claustrum, present but minimal in primates, but dramatically clear in cetaceans, argues against the proposed mechanisms of intraclaustral processing of information. The best interpretation of function, then, is that each functional subdivision of the claustrum simply contributes to the function of its cortical partner...|$|E
40|$|Background: Thalamotomy {{has been}} {{reported}} to be successful in ameliorating the motor symptoms of tremor and/or rigidity in people with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD), emphasising the bona fide contribution of this <b>subcortical</b> <b>nucleus</b> to the neural circuitry subserving motor function. Despite evidence of parallel yet segregated associative and motor cortico-subcortical-cortical circuits, comparatively few studies have investigated the effects of this procedure on cognitive functions. In particular, research pertaining to the impact of thalamotomy on linguistic processes is fundamentally lacking. Aims: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of thalamotomy in the language dominant and non-dominant hemispheres on linguistic functioning, relative to operative theoretical models of subcortical participation in language. This paper compares the linguistic profiles of two males with PD, aged 75 years (10 years of formal education) and 62 years (22 years of formal education), subsequent to unilateral thalamotomy procedures within the language dominant and non-dominant hemispheres, respectively. Methods & Procedures: Comprehensive linguistic profiles comprising general and high-level linguistic abilities in addition to on-line semantic processing skills were compiled up to 1 month prior to surgery and 3 months post-operatively, within perceived on 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 periods (i. e., when optimally medicated). Pre- and post-operative language performances were compared within-subjects to a group of 16 non-surgical Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s controls (NSPD) and a group of 16 non-neurologically impaired adults (NC). Outcomes & Results: The findings of this research suggest a laterality effect with regard to the contribution of the thalamus to high-level linguistic abilities and, potentially, the temporal processing of semantic information. This outcome supports the application of high-level linguistic assessments and measures of semantic processing proficiency to the clinical management of individuals with dominant thalamic lesions. Conclusions: The results reported lend support to contemporary theories of dominant thalamic participation in language, serving to further elucidate our current understanding of the role of subcortical structures in mediating linguistic processes, relevant to cortical hemispheric dominance...|$|E

Methods: 1006 participants (50 - 66 years) from the third Nord-Trøndelag Health Survey, were randomly selected to undergo a brain MRI at 1. 5 T. Volume {{and shape of the}} <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen and thalamus) from T 1 weighted 3 D scans were obtained in FreeSurfer and FSL. The association with nine different questionnaire-based headache categories (e. g. migraine, tension-type headache) was evaluated using analysis of covariance corrected for age, sex, intracranial volume, blood pressure and alcohol consumption. Results: No effect of headache status on accumbens volume and shape was present, but small differences in volume of putamen and caudate, and in bilateral putaminal shape were found. A post hoc analysis showed that the larger caudate volume was strongly associated with increasing white matter hyperintensities. Conclusion: This population-based study did not confirm our hypothesis that headache sufferers have smaller volume and different shape of the accumbens compared to nonsufferers.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nicotine}} on {{the activity of}} different dehydrogenases in frontoparietal regions and <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the rat brain have been studied using histochemical methods. Nicotine sulphate was intraperitoneally administered in acute (4 mg/kg/day × 3 days) or chronic (ALZET osmotic pump providing 2 mg/kg/day × 15 days) doses. The enzymes analyzed were glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate, lactate, malate and succinate dehydrogenases (gly 3 PDH, LDH, MDH, and SDH, respectively). The results demonstrate that chronic as well as acute administration of nicotine produced strong increases in all these enzymatic activities in the superior layers (I, II and III) of the frontoparietal cortex (cingulate, motor and somatosensory regions); but high increases were not seen in the deeper layers of the cortex or in the <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> (substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens or nucleus basalis magnocellularis). These hyperactivities were produced in brain regions with normally low enzymatic activity (cortex), but not in those with great intensity (<b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei).</b> The results are in rough agreement with previous reports on nicotine-induced increases in glucose utilization, gly 3 PDH genic expression and neuronal hyperactivity in the brain cortex; but significant discrepancies between the cortical enzymatic maps and those obtained both in these studies and others on nicotine(N) -receptor localization have been appreciated. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} nicotinic cholinergic drugs can have metabolic, long-lasting stimulant effects on cortical neurons at specific points (probably layer III pyramidal cells and structures with α 7 -N-receptors) of the cortical circuits that could be of great interest in improving altered cognitive functions that are present in Alzheimer disease, as well as in other less severe mental disturbances.

The activity of 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase was the highest in the thalamus, hypothalamus and <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> and essentially the same level of sulfane sulfur was found in all the investigated brain regions. The investigations demonstrated that the level of sulfane sulfur in gliomas with the highest grades was high in comparison to various human brain regions, and was correlated with a decreased activity of γ-cystathionase, 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and rhodanese. This can suggest sulfane sulfur accumulation and points to its importance for malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In gliomas with the highest grades of malignancy, despite decreased levels of total free cysteine and total free glutathione, a high ratio of GSH/GSSG was maintained, which is important for the process of malignant cells proliferation. A high level of sulfane sulfur and high GSH/GSSG ratio could result in the elevated hydrogen sulfide levels.

Overall, 45 % of neurons exhibited an evoked increase in firing rate significantly selective to the direction of apparent motion of the global stimulus. Periods of suppression of firing rate were often observed, but were generally not selective. Global motion selectivity of VPM neurons could occur regardless of the extent and spatial organization of their receptive fields, and of their selectivity for the direction of motion of their principal whisker. To investigate whether the global selectivity could be due to corticothalamic feedback connections, we inactivated the barrel cortex while repeating the stimulation protocol.

30|$|Finally, we also {{removed the}} first 21.5  % of nodes using various {{targeted}} removal schemes {{according to the}} following well established connectome measures: (a) nodal strength (descending), (b) clustering (ascending), (c) nodal path length (ascending), and (d) betweenness centrality (descending) [22], as well as e) embeddedness, a recently proposed novel connectome metric [23]. Embeddedness computes a ratio between nodal efficiency {{and the rate of}} information transfer decay for this node, and thus probes the relative scale-invariant information exchange efficiency. Highly embedded brain regions are those that comprise the limbic system, the default mode network, and the <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei.</b> These regions are linked in the evolutionary role they play in memory, emotion and behavior.|$|R
40|$|Neocortical GABAergic interneurons are {{a highly}} {{heterogeneous}} cell population that forms complex functional networks and has key roles in information processing within the cerebral cortex. Mechanisms {{that control the}} output of these cells are therefore crucial in regulating excitability within the neocortex during normal and pathophysiological activities. In addition to subtypespecific modulation of GABAergic cells by neurotransmitters released by afferents from <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei,</b> interneurons belonging to different classes are controlled by distinct self-modulatory mechanisms, each unique and powerful. In this article, we review the diverse responses of neocortical interneurons to extrinsic and intrinsic neuromodulators. We discuss how specificity of responses might differentially influence inhibition in somatodendritic compartments of pyramidal neurons and affect the balance of activities in neocortical circuits...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the open}} issues in {{developing}} large-scale computational models of the brain is how the transfer of information between communicating cortical regions is controlled. Here, we present a model where the basal ganglia implement such a conditional information routing system. The basal ganglia are a set of <b>subcortical</b> <b>nuclei</b> that {{play a central role}} in cognition. Like a switchboard, the model basal ganglia direct the communication between cortical regions by alerting the destination regions to the presence of important signals coming from the source regions. This way, they can impose serial control on the massive parallel communication between cortical areas. The model also incorporates a possible mechanism by which subsequent transfers of information control the release o...|$|R
