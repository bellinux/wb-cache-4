Systematic reduced scale model experiments were carried out {{with the aim of}} relating the geometric configuration of grouped outdoor units to the resultant temperature rise of <b>suction</b> <b>air</b> under stagnant surrounding conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe use of unsedated {{transnasal}} esophagogastroduodenoscopy (UT-EGD) is {{a milestone}} in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Although the image quality, <b>suction,</b> <b>air</b> insufflation, and lens washing in UT-EGD {{have been reported to}} be inferior to those in conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD), the former procedure is associated with reduced gag reflex and is better tolerated than the latter. Several large studies have shown that transnasal endoscopy is safe, well tolerated, and less risky than P-EGD, which requires sedation in most western countries. Moreover, UT-EGD induces less sympathetic stimulation and less oxygen desaturation compared with P-EGD. Use of an ultrathin endoscopy, an alternative choice to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, is helpful in patients with gastrointestinal stenosis and is a convenient method for postpyloric feeding tube placement. However, nasal anesthetic methods, techniques of scope insertion and withdrawal from the delicate nasal cavity, and therapeutic applications may be difficult to learn without proper training, even for an experienced endoscopist...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{experimentally}} verified the partial-fill effect in a multi-cycle pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE). Intermittent thrust of a PDRE {{was measured by}} using a spring-damper mechanism that smoothes this intermittent thrust in the time direction. The intermittent mass flow rates were assessed by gas cylinder pressure or mass difference measurement. The maximum specific impulse was 305 Â± 9 seconds at an ethylene and oxygen propellant fill fraction of 0. 130 Â± 0. 004. When the fill fraction was greater than 0. 130, the specific impulse was increased as the partial fill fraction was decreased. When the fill fraction was less than 0. 130, the specific impulse was sharply decreased as the partial fill fraction was decreased. This decrease was due to diffusion between propellant and purge gases and for the short length of the transition from deflagration to detonation. The multi-cycle pulse detonation rocket engine has a partial-fill effect that may be mainly due to the <b>suctioned</b> <b>air</b> and {{is consistent with the}} single-cycle partial-fill model of Endo et al.
