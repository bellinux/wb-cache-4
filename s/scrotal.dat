5|$|After the marriage, Ramanujan {{developed}} a hydrocele testis. The condition could {{be treated with}} a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the <b>scrotal</b> sac, but his family {{did not have the}} money for the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from <b>scrotal</b> swelling.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, <b>scrotal</b> and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
25|$|The labioscrotal folds extend around {{between the}} pelvic portion and the anus, {{and form a}} <b>scrotal</b> area. During the changes {{associated}} with the descent of the testes this <b>scrotal</b> area is drawn out to form the <b>scrotal</b> sacs. The penis is developed from the phallus.|$|E
25|$|Bell-clapper {{deformity}} is a deformity {{in which}} the testicle is not attached to the <b>scrotal</b> walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis. It {{is the most common}} underlying cause of testicular torsion.|$|E
25|$|Males {{have two}} {{testicles}} of similar size {{contained within the}} scrotum, which {{is an extension of}} the abdominal wall. <b>Scrotal</b> asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends further down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy of the vascululature.|$|E
25|$|Seminal vesiculitis (also {{known as}} spermatocystitis) is an {{inflammation}} of the seminal vesicles, most often caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms of seminal vesiculitis can include vague back or lower abdominal pain; penile, <b>scrotal,</b> or perineal pain; painful ejaculation; hematospermia; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.|$|E
25|$|The {{first period}} occurs between 4 and 6 {{weeks of the}} gestation. Examples include genital {{virilisation}} such as midline fusion, phallic urethra, <b>scrotal</b> thinning and rugation, and phallic enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of dihydrotestosterone. There is also development of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} any palpated lump in the scrotum is often {{evaluated}} by <b>scrotal</b> ultrasound, which can determine exact location, size, and some {{characteristics of the}} lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by CT scans, which are used to locate metastases.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using percutaneous embolization). Possible complications {{of this procedure}} include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), hydrocele (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), infection, or injury to the <b>scrotal</b> tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur, resulting {{in a loss of}} a testicle.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{provides}} {{visualization of}} the thoracic and abdominal structures, and can sometimes rule out or narrow down a diagnosis. Information {{that may be}} gleaned from ultrasonographic findings include the presence of sand, distention, entrapment, strangulation, intussusception, and wall thickening of intestinal loops, as well as diagnose nephrosplenic entrapment, peritonitis, abdominal tumors, and inguinal or <b>scrotal</b> hernias. Abdominal ultrasound requires an experienced operator to accurately diagnose the cause of colic. It may be applied {{against the side of}} the horse, as well as transrectally.|$|E
25|$|In up to 25% of patients, no {{focus of}} {{infection}} is found and {{the diagnosis is}} usually made on blood cultures or throat swab. Melioidosis {{is said to be}} able to affect any organ in the body except the heart valves (endocarditis). Although meningitis has been described secondary to ruptured brain abscesses, primary meningitis has not been described. Less common manifestations include intravascular infection, lymph node abscesses (1.22.2%), pyopericardium and myocarditis, mediastinal infection, and thyroid and <b>scrotal</b> abscesses and ocular infection.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} 18th- {{and early}} 19th-century surgeons included Percival Pott (1713–1788) who described tuberculosis on the spine and first demonstrated that a {{cancer may be}} caused by an environmental carcinogen (he noticed a connection between chimney sweep's exposure to soot and their high incidence of <b>scrotal</b> cancer). Astley Paston Cooper (1768–1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and James Syme (1799–1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and {{one of the advantages of}} orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a <b>scrotal</b> testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} case of <b>scrotal</b> {{squamous}} cell carcinoma in a cotton worker in the Manchester Hospital records in 1887, shale oil {{had been used in}} the mills for 35 years. A heavier oil was used once a day on the carriage and wheels but a lighter oil was applied three to four times to the spindles. The heavier oil may come into contact with the minders’ hands, but it was the lighter oil that was sprayed from the spindles and saturated the spinners’ light cotton trousers {{at the level of the}} pubis and groins above the scrotum. Piecers would remove any heavy oil from their hands by wiping them on the trousers.|$|E
25|$|Historically, PAHs contributed {{substantially}} to {{our understanding}} of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including chemical carcinogenesis. In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, observed that <b>scrotal</b> cancer was unusually common in chimney sweepers and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot. A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the coal tar industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and coal tar was widely accepted. In 1915, Yamigawa and Ichicawa were the first to experimentally produce cancers, specifically of the skin, by topically applying coal tar to rabbit ears.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{abdominal}} skin, a slight skin slit {{was made to}} allow the future urethra to be passed through upon inversion of the neovaginal lining. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm distally from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to tightly and firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the posterior commissure and, finally, excess <b>scrotal</b> skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
25|$|According to Burou, the {{operation}} {{began with an}} incision from the anal area through the <b>scrotal</b> raphe. After dissecting of the bulbus urethrae and both corpora cavernosa, the rectum and the prostate were separated by cutting all the ligaments between the bulb and the rectum. Burou {{made a point of}} barring, but not damaging, the posterior aspect of the prostate so that the penile skin flap after invagination would immediately overlie this aspect, which he felt optimized the possibility of postoperative orgasm. The separation was extended digitally and was considered complete as soon as two fingers or a vaginal retractor could be admitted easily. Burou considered this first part of {{the operation}} to be the most important, but most risky, and stressed the importance of repeated intrarectal inspection to determine that there was no lesion to the rectal wall.|$|E
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of <b>scrotal</b> cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E

500|$|The pudendal nerve {{supplies}} sensation to {{the penis}} in males, {{and to the}} clitoris in females, which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The posterior scrotum in males and the labia in females are also supplied, via the posterior <b>scrotal</b> nerves (males) or posterior labial nerves (females). The pudendal nerve {{is one of several}} nerves supplying sensation to these areas. Branches also supply sensation to the anal canal. By providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris, the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection. [...] It is also responsible for ejaculation.|$|E
500|$|To {{communicate}} with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will scent mark with urine {{as well as}} scent glands located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck. The <b>scrotal</b> skin of most male lemurs has scent glands. Ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) and male sifakas have a gland {{at the base of}} their neck, while the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) and the ring-tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the axilla. Male ring-tailed lemurs also have scent glands on the inside of their forearms, adjacent to a thorn-like spur, which they use to gouge, and simultaneously, scent-mark tree branches. They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in [...] "stink fights" [...] by waving their tail at their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|... 1775. Percivall Pott {{discovered}} that soot caused <b>scrotal</b> cancer in chimneysweeps.|$|E
2500|$|This {{cancer was}} {{a manifestation of}} <b>scrotal</b> {{squamous}} cell carcinoma which had first been noted in 1775 by Sir Percival Pott in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It was the first industrially related cancer to be identified and was originally called Soot Wart, then chimney sweeps cancer. He describes it: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 4) Protection against DNA damage. [...] Mild, {{transient}} <b>scrotal</b> {{heat stress}} causes DNA damage, reduced fertility and abnormal embryonic development in mice. [...] DNA strand breaks {{were found in}} spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40°C or 42°C for 30 minutes. [...] These {{findings suggest that the}} external location of the testicles provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} the testes are {{identified}} preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. An incision is made over the inguinal canal. The testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues ("mobilized"), and brought into the scrotum. It is sutured to the <b>scrotal</b> tissue or enclosed in a [...] "subdartos pouch." [...] The associated passage back into the inguinal canal, an inguinal hernia, is closed to prevent re-ascent.|$|E

2500|$|Bonobo males {{occasionally}} {{engage in}} various forms of male–male genital behavior. The {{most common form of}} male–male mounting {{is similar to that of}} a heterosexual mounting: one of the males sits [...] "passively on his back [...] the other male thrusting on him", with the penises rubbing together due to both males' erections. In another, rarer form of genital rubbing, which is the non-human analogue of frotting, engaged in by human males, two bonobo males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while penis fencing. This also may occur when two males rub their penises together while in face-to-face position. Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their <b>scrotal</b> sacs together. Takayoshi Kano observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat. Tongue kissing, oral sex, and genital massaging have also been recorded among male bonobos.|$|E
2500|$|He {{considered}} {{the second part}} of the operation to be relatively easy. The initial incision was extended along the raphe of the scrotum to the root of the penis. The surgical field was widened by retracting the <b>scrotal</b> skin on both sides and widely exposing the corpus spongiosum, both corpora cavernosa, and the two testes. Once the testes and their [...] had been dissected, the spermatic cord was cut and ligated. Then, both corpora cavernosa were ligated and cut at a level just distally to their attachment to the inferior ramus of the pubic bone. The level of transection of the spongious bulb and urethra had to correspond with the length of the future urethra. Subsequently, all erectile bodies were pushed out and dissected from the penile skin. When available, the foreskin was kept and the distal, coronal edge of the penile skin was closed; this yielded the skin tube that was inserted as neovaginal lining.|$|E
2500|$|Reasons for {{treatment}} of bladder stones include recurring symptoms and risk of urinary tract obstruction. [...] Some stones can be dissolved using dietary modifications and/or medications. [...] Small stones in female dogs may possibly be removed by urohydropropulsion, a nonsurgical procedure. [...] Urohydropropulsion is performed under sedation by filling the bladder with saline through a catheter, holding the dog vertically, and squeezing the bladder to expel the stones through the urethra. [...] Bladder stones can be removed surgically by a cystotomy, opening of the bladder. [...] Stones lodged in the urethra can often be flushed into the bladder and removed, but sometimes a urethrotomy is necessary. [...] In male dogs with recurrent urinary tract obstruction a <b>scrotal</b> urethrostomy creates a permanent opening in the urethra proximal to the area where most stones lodge, behind the os penis. [...] In male cats, stones lodge where the urethra narrows in the penis. [...] Recurrent cases can be treated surgically with a perineal urethrostomy, which removes the penis and creates a new opening for the urethra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striped hyena}} has a fairly massive, but short torso set on long legs. The hind legs are {{significantly}} {{shorter than the}} forelimbs, thus causing the back to slope downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the carpal region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region. The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws. The tail is short and the terminal hairs do not descend below the achilles tendon. The striped hyena lacks the enlarged clitoris and false <b>scrotal</b> sack noted in the female genitalia of the spotted hyena. The female has 3 pairs of nipples. Adult weight can range from , averaging at about [...] Body length can range from , not counting a tail of , and shoulder height is between [...] The male has a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands open into it from above the anus. Several sebaceous glands are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them. The anus can be everted up to a length of 5cm, and is everted during social interaction and mating. When attacked, the striped hyena everts its rectum and sprays a pungent smelling liquid from its anal glands. Its eyesight is acute, though its senses of smell and hearing are weak.|$|E
60|$|In the Male ep., the epididymis. P., the penis. pp., the prepuce. scr., the <b>scrotal</b> sac, {{containing}} these; r.v.d., {{the right}} vas deferens. T., is the testis. u.m., the uterus masculinus.|$|E
60|$|Section 16. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the frog, and {{especially}} those of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white bodies usually dappled with black pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers, therefore, to the rabbit's epididymis. The hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into which a seminal vesicle, which is especially large in early spring, opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney, the epididymis, shift back into the <b>scrotal</b> sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder, carrying the genital ducts looped over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina {{as they do in}} the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store, and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male, fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad, black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex.|$|E
60|$|May {{be killed}} by chloroform, or {{potassium}} cyanide, or drowned. It may also be readily suffocated with house-hold gas. It should be killed immediately before use, as otherwise the gastric juice attacks {{the wall of the}} stomach, and the dissection is, in consequence, rendered extremely disagreeable. A very young rabbit is unsatisfactory as regards the genitalia, but otherwise there is no objection to a little one, and it has this advantage-- that it may be immersed more conveniently under water, in a large pie dish, for purposes of fine dissection. The external features of the animal should be examined: eyelids, whiskers and teeth, toes, anus, perineal space {{on either side of the}} same, urogenital opening, and position of the ribs, vertebral column, and limb girdles beneath the skin should be made out. Then the animal should be pinned out through the legs, the ventral surface uppermost, the skin opened up along the middle line from pelvic girdle to symphyses of jaw; separated from the body wall below by means of the handle of a scalpel, and turned back; and then the abdominal wall should be cut into and two flaps pinned back to expose its contents. Note the xiphisternum. The caecum and colon will be recognised (Section 16); the stomach, the right and left central, and left lateral lobes of the liver will probably be apparent; and the urinary bladder (especially if distended) in the middle line behind. Without any further dissection, but simply by turning the parts over, all the structures of the abdomen in Figure 1, Sheet 1, will be identified. Seek especially for and note particularly, the gall bladder, bile duct, and portal vein, pancreatic duct, sacculus rotundus, vermiform appendix, ureters (by pulling urinary bladder forward), genital ducts (looping over ureters), spleen, kidneys, and adrenals. The vena cava inferior is seen dorsally. The genital duct guides the student to the genital gland; if the subject is a male, the testes may be exposed by dissection, or by pulling the vas deferens gently the <b>scrotal</b> sac will be turned inside out, and the testes brought into view. The ovary lies exposed without dissection posterior to the kidney. Examine all this carefully, and make small sketches of points of interest-- the duodenal loop and the pyloric end of the stomach, for instance; the meeting of colon, caecum, and sacculus rotundus again; or the urinary bladder and adjacent parts. Note the dorsal aorta and vena cava and their connexions behind. (Compare figure of circulation.) Cut through pelvic girdle, and remove one hind leg, to see bladder and genital ducts better (compare Sheet 10). Wash away any blood that may flow. Turn all the intestines over to the animal's right, and see the dorsal aorta and vena cava inferior of the abdomen, the inferior mesenteric artery, and the spermatic (or ovarian) artery (compare, of course, with figure in book). In front, immediately dorsal to the spleen, is a variable quantity of lymphoidal tissue, which must be very carefully cleared to see the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. Separate Spigelian lobe from stomach, and look for vagus nerve descending by oesophagus, solar plexus around the superior mesenteric artery, and thrown up very distinctly by the purple vena cava inferior beneath, and the splanchnic nerve. To see the abdominal sympathetic behind, gently remove the peritoneum that lies on either side of the aorta; blood-vessels will be seen running in between the vertebral bodies, and the sympathetic chain, with its ganglia, made out very distinctly, as it runs across them longitudinally. Now cut oesophagus just in front of stomach, and cut the rectum, cut through the mesentery supporting the intestine, and remove and unravel alimentary canal; cut open, wash out, and examine caecum and stomach. Bleeding to a considerable extent is inevitable, chiefly from the portal vein. The liver had better remain if the same rabbit is to serve for the second dissection.|$|E
