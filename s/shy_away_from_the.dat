George commissioned him to illustrate Rosemary Sutcliff's historical children's novel The Silver Branch. He was unenthused by the ancient Roman subject matter, but experimented with double page spreads and drawings in the margins, and was quickly assigned more books by Sutcliff and others, including Henry Treece. This began a professional relationship with Oxford University Press, for whom he illustrated more books than for any other publisher. Keeping, along with Victor Ambrus, established a new, exuberant style of illustration for children's historical fiction, refusing to <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> violence of warfare.|$|E

500|$|ESPN {{president}} John Skipper said Scott's flair and style, {{which he}} {{used to talk about}} the athletes he was covering, [...] "changed everything." [...] Fellow ESPN Anchor, Stan Verrett, said he was a trailblazer: [...] "not only because he was black – obviously black – but because of his style, his demeanor, his presentation. He did not <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that he was a black man, and that allowed the rest of us who came along to just be ourselves."

( [...] of the KJV: [...] "Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye {{children}} of men.") [...] James refers to her story as a [...] "Christian fable" [...] while Cuarón describes it as [...] "almost like a look at Christianity": [...] "I didn't want to <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spiritual archetypes," [...] Cuarón told Filmmaker Magazine.

500|$|Perry's fashion often {{incorporates}} humor, bright colors, and food-related themes such as {{her trademark}} spinning peppermint swirl dress. Vogue described her as [...] "never exactly one to <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outrageous or the extreme in any realm", while Glamour named her the [...] "queen of quirk". In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was [...] "a {{bit of a}} concoction of different things" [...] and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing. She has also described herself as having [...] "multipersonality disorder" [...] for fashion. Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chloë Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.|$|E
500|$|Bethesda Softworks {{started working}} on Fallout 3 in July 2004, but {{principal}} development did not begin until after [...] and its related extras and plug ins were completed. Bethesda Softworks decided to make Fallout 3 similar to the previous two games, focusing upon non-linear gameplay, story, and black comedy. Bethesda also chose to pursue an ESRB rating of M (for mature) by including the adult themes, violence, and depravity characteristic of the Fallout series. They also decided to <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> self-referential gags of the game's predecessors that broke the illusion that the world of Fallout is real. Fallout 3 uses {{a version of the}} same Gamebryo engine as Oblivion, and was developed by the team responsible for that game. Liam Neeson was cast as the voice of the player's father.|$|E

Chopra is someone worth keeping an eye on." [...] Emily Canal of Forbes called Quantico [...] "One Of The Most Feminist Shows" [...] of the season, praising its female characters and writing, [...] "Quantico not only highlights a handful of diverse women, but gives them more than just love interests to drive the plot. They're forceful, have storylines that propel their narrative and dialog that doesn't <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> double standards and hardships women face in reality." [...] She also noted the fact that Alex takes control of her sexuality and decisions, saying, [...] "What was set up as an uncomfortable situation where Booth was in charge, swiveled into a scenario that gave Parish the reins." [...] TheWrap's Tim Grierson wrote, [...] "Chopra has a poise and sexual spark as Alex that suggests a formidable potential FBI agent whose mind and beauty are equally stunning." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator complemented the video {{by saying that}} the [...] "standout track from Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and it’s given an extra sheen thanks to a quirky, unconventional video that doesn’t <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dark tone of the song’s lyrics". Brian Zacher from AXS.com said that the video shares the [...] "greatness" [...] with the previous one, [...] "Just the Way You Are". James Montgomery of MTV News gave a mixed review on the video, in which he said [...] "after all, it would’ve been easy — and expected — to make something slick, sexy and/or saccharine, a glossy thing where he croons from a rooftop somewhere, removes his shirt, and somehow ends up with the girl. None of that happens here. Rather, we see Mars struggling and sweating, being taunted and tempted, falling and rising again... He ends up alone, unloved. He probably gets flattened by a train". On another review by Montgomery, the singer redemption is refereed because Mars [...] "distances himself from his smoove-crooning contemporaries, and he does it simply by being real. Really dramatic, really emotional, really clever. This one’s a winner, even if, at the end of it, Mars has lost everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Pols of Time {{praised the}} film's fantasy {{sequences}} {{for being able}} to show the audience a [...] "joyous Wizard of Oz energy" [...] that is able to [...] "open the door into Precious's mind in a way even [...] Sapphire couldn't." [...] Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has [...] "a lack of compelling emotional material" [...] but that the film's [...] "few weak moments" [...] are the [...] "ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories." [...] Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being [...] "a film that doesn't <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments." [...] Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when you put the [...] "glaring issues aside," [...] the film [...] "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America." [...] But while the film [...] "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece." [...] Mendelson described the film as being [...] "an acting powerhouse" [...] based on its many emotional themes.|$|E

500|$|The 32X was {{released}} in November 1994, {{in time for the}} holiday season. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system. More than 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch. [...] Notwithstanding the lower priced console's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. After an early run on the peripheral, news soon spread to the public of the upcoming release of the Sega Saturn, which would not support the 32X's games. The Saturn {{was released}} on May 11, 1995, four months earlier than its originally intended release date of September 2, 1995. The Saturn, in turn, caused developers to further <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> console and created doubt about the library for the 32X, even with Sega's assurances {{that there would be a}} large number of games developed for the system. In early 1996, Sega conceded that it had promised too much out of the 32X and decided to stop producing the system in order to focus on the Saturn. Prices for the 32X dropped to $99 and cleared out of stores at $19.95.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric Watson {{said that}} [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics to remind me why I love Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything it can {{to ensure that the}} real world still matters and that the audience understands the negative consequences of a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E

Riley cited that because the speculation exists it is something that should be honoured. His possible sexual interest in men is addressed in detail in episode five of season one when he is tried for sodomy.

2500|$|As a preacher, Doehring {{combined}} eloquence {{with education}} and populism, {{and was not}} afraid of [...] "kitsch sentimentalism".

Beginning in 1923, Doehring took on the additional position of official lecturer in practical theology at the University of Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Taylor was {{primarily}} a goal poacher. His goals were often unspectacular, and he lacked the pace necessary to chase long balls. Instead he relied heavily on his sense of timing; {{of being in the}} right place at the right time. He was also adept at holding the ball up to bring other players into the game. Taylor was [...] "all effort" [...] and did not <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> physical side of football.

[...] In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents, {{in the way that}} they used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, [...] "Seeing The Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it, too, because look, they're doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's {{temperament}} and masculinity {{have been a}} focal point of critical commentary. Teddy Jamieson of The Herald observed, [...] "He's big, he's black and he's all man", and predicted that Malick's tenure would be [...] "testosterone-tastic." [...] A Sunday Mercury review deemed him [...] "a {{force to be reckoned}} with", and What's on TV described him as a [...] "misunderstood macho man" [...] with [...] "a dark, volatile side". Anthony D. Langford of gay media website AfterElton.com characterised Malick as an arrogant and egotistical [...] "bad boy", who nevertheless is an excellent physician.

Malick often uses illeism, referring to himself in the third person as [...] "The Malick".

2500|$|In {{the climax}} of his praise of Athens, Pericles declares: [...] "In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas; while I doubt if the world can produce a man, who where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a {{versatility}} as the Athenian." [...] Finally, Pericles links his praise {{of the city to}} the dead Athenians for whom he is speaking, [...] "...for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her...none of these men allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour..." [...] The conclusion seems inevitable: [...] "Therefore, having judged that to be happy means to be free, and to be free means to be brave, do not <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risks of war". With the linkage of Athens' greatness complete, Pericles moves to addressing his audience.|$|E
