5|$|In <b>Spain</b> from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence {{took place}} amidst a multi-cultural <b>Spain.</b> <b>Spain,</b> at the time, {{was under the}} control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother.

5|$|Napoleon invaded <b>Spain</b> in 1807, {{starting}} the Peninsular War. King Charles IV of <b>Spain</b> abdicated {{in favor of}} his son Ferdinand VII, but Napoleon captured him and appointed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king of <b>Spain</b> instead, {{in a series of}} transfers of the Spanish crown known as the abdications of Bayonne. The Spanish people organized Government Juntas to resist against the French occupation, and within months the Junta Central of Seville claimed supreme authority over <b>Spain</b> and the colonies. This situation encouraged the Princess Charlotte of <b>Spain</b> to claim the regency of the Spanish American colonies.|$|E

The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in <b>Spain</b> and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E
