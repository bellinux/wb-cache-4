CCM relies on automatic procedures, presuming that both the controls themselves and the monitoring procedures are formal or able to be formalized.

2500|$|The Operator Function Model (OFM) is {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional task analysis techniques used by human factors engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and <b>system</b> <b>configurations</b> so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure {{can be thought of as}} a possible representation of an operator's internal model of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise operator control functions.> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of <b>systems</b> <b>configuration</b> issues has been increased in many applied domains (e. g., software, hardware, manufacturing systems, supply chain systems, solving strategies). In the paper several <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> problems are investigated: (i) search for (selection of) a set (structure) of system components, (ii) {{search for a}} set of compatible system components, (iii) reconfiguration of a system as redesign of the system structure, (iv) multi-stage design and redesign of <b>system</b> <b>configuration,</b> and (v) design or redesign of the <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> for multi-product <b>systems.</b> Several combinatorial models (including multicriteria ones) are under examination: problem of representatives, multiple choice problem, morphological clique problem (with compatibility of system components), and their modifications. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for separating configuration privilege from traditional root privilege. We limit this new configuration privilege to a single (new) system daemon, configd. This daemon reads requests for changes in <b>system</b> <b>configuration,</b> either allowing or denying each request based on various criteria (possibly including user input). We do not allow any other application to run with configuration permission, forcing all requests {{for a change in}} <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> to be processed by configd. We discuss the basic functionality required for configd to protect <b>system</b> <b>configuration,</b> and some preliminary improvements to a basic prototype design. We concentrate on only those <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> changes performed through the modification of a file on disk. ...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service {{completed}} a conceptual design study that defined an integrated forest fire detection and mapping {{system that will}} be based upon technology available in the 1990 s. Potential <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> options in emerging and advanced technologies related to the conceptual design were identified and recommended for inclusion as preferred system components. System component technologies identified for an end-to-end system include airborne mounted, thermal infrared (IR) linear array detectors, automatic onboard georeferencing and signal processing, geosynchronous satellite communications links, and advanced data integration and display. Potential <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> options were developed and examined for possible inclusion in the preferred <b>system</b> <b>configuration.</b> The preferred <b>system</b> <b>configuration</b> will provide increased performance and be cost effective over the system currently in use.
