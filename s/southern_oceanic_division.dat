I will argue that the loss of the articles, or the marginalizing of an erstwhile productive system of prefixes, may have been a quite recent phenomenon, and may thus represent parallel developments rather than shared innovations...|$|R

While Anejom̃ is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom̃ might have consisted of two very distinct dialects. [...] Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.|$|R

It is named after the Indian subcontinent.

25|$|In 1926, the Santa Ana River dam failed, and flash-flooded {{its entire}} delta. The <b>southern</b> <b>oceanic</b> {{terminus}} of this delta {{is now a}} settled area of Huntington Beach. The distant dam is still functional, but silting up, {{which is expected to}} reduce its storage volume, and therefore its effectiveness at flood-prevention. The flood and dam-endangered areas are protected by a levee, but lenders require expensive flood insurance in the delta. There have been serious discussions to eliminate the need for flood insurance and this requirement has already been waived in some areas and may one day no longer be considered a credible threat.|$|R

50|$|Anthropologically, New Caledonia is {{considered}} the southernmost archipelago of Melanesia, grouping it with the more close-by islands to its north, rather than its geologically associated neighbour, New Zealand, to the south. The New Caledonian languages, whose speakers are called Kanaks, and the dialects of the Loyalty Islands find their closest relatives in the languages of Vanuatu to the east. Together, these comprise the <b>Southern</b> <b>Oceanic</b> language family, {{a member of the}} Oceanic language branch of the Austronesian language family. The Fijian languages, the Maori language of New Zealand, and other Polynesian languages such as Tahitian, Samoan and Hawaiian are cousins of the New Caledonian languages within the Oceanic language family.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The paper briefly {{summarizes}} what {{is known}} about long-term changes (facts, causes, consequences) in the macrozoobenthos of intertidal and subtidal hardbottom communities around the island of Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). There is increasing observational evidence that these communities (spectrum and abundances of species) are changing on a long-term temporal scale. The reasons are diverse and mainly anthropogenic. A shift in North Sea climate towards more oceanic conditions may be among the most important factors driving the recent changes in species spectrum. Many of the species which have been recorded as new to the Helgoland area during the past decade are <b>southern</b> (<b>oceanic)</b> species which may be considered a...|$|R
5000|$|Legends of Terra Australis Incognita—an [...] "unknown {{land of the}} South"—date back to Roman {{times and}} before, and were commonplace in medieval geography, {{although}} not based on any documented knowledge of the continent. Ptolemy's maps, which became well known in Europe during the Renaissance, did not actually depict such a continent, but they did show an Africa which had no <b>southern</b> <b>oceanic</b> boundary (and which therefore might extend {{all the way to}} the South Pole), and also raised the possibility that the Indian Ocean was entirely enclosed by land. Christian thinkers did not discount the idea that there might be land beyond the southern seas, but the issue of whether it could be inhabited was controversial.|$|R
500|$|A sea is a {{large body}} of salt water that is {{surrounded}} {{in whole or in part}} by land. More broadly, [...] "the sea" [...] is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal <b>oceanic</b> <b>divisions.</b> The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.|$|R
