40|$|Conventional {{thought in}} idea {{generation}} {{suggests that there}} is no <b>such</b> thing as <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> This paper challenges this assumption, arguing that task-irrelevant comments (electronic junk) can significantly influence the performance of computer-mediated idea generation groups. While the results of a controlled laboratory experiment using a group simulator show that electronic junk can create a downward spiral, leading to the creation of even more task-irrelevant comments, the results also support the hypothesis of an inverted-u-shaped relationship between the amount of junk comments and ideation performance, suggesting that moderate amounts of junk comments can aid performance, whereas large amounts of junk comments can be detrimental to performance. Further, the results show that members of groups producing no junk comments perceive their individual performances to be lower than members of groups with moderate or high amounts of junk comments. The implications of these results on the design of human-computer interfaces are discussed and avenues for future research are suggested...|$|R

This backfires on him when Mary decides she is in love with him and even stops stripping and drops her punk image to impress him. Andy is forced to reject her advances, and an angst-ridden Mary spitefully informs him that she won't be attending any more of his reading lessons. The following day her punk image is back. However, without her stripping job, she is now penniless again. Nick Cotton (John Altman), seeing her in a desperate state, tries to coax her into becoming a prostitute. Mary declines, but her desperation for money makes her question whether it would be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> after all.

Ed then tells her that his daughter Mindy could come but {{that they would have}} to ask his wife Fran if that would be all right. When Lynette meets with Fran, she tells her straight the criteria of the day care and that Mindy would not be required to stay the entire day. Fran tells Lynette that she objects since she [...] "loves spending time with Mindy". Ed plans to go to desperate measures to ensure that they receive the quota. The following morning, Ed brings Mindy to work without Fran's consent which leads Fran to show up and ask what is going on. As the two quarrel, Lynette takes Mindy into her office and locks the door behind her. Lynette tells Ed that what he did was stupid and advises them that they need better ways of communication in order to get what they want.

40|$|Crimes {{are often}} {{observed}} by multiple witnesses. Research shows that witnesses can contaminate each other's memory, but {{potential benefits of}} co-witness discussion {{have not yet been}} investigated. We examined whether witnesses can help each other remember, or prune each other's errors. In a research design with high ecological validity, attendees of a theatre play were interviewed approximately one week later about a violent scene in the play. The couples that signed up for our study had known each other for 31 years on average. Participants were first interviewed individually and then took part in a collaborative interview. We also included a control condition in which participants took part in two individual interviews. Collaboration did not help witnesses to remember more about the scene, but collaborative pairs made significantly fewer errors than nominal pairs. Further, quantitative and qualitative analyses of retrieval strategies during the discussion revealed that couples who actively acknowledged, repeated, rephrased, and elaborated upon each other's statements remembered significantly more information overall. Taken together, our findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, discussion between witnesses is not <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> after all...|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{contemporary}} leading international and regional organizations are defined by the geographical factor. European Union, African Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization {{are some of the}} prominent examples. The Russian-envisioned supranational organization will be called the Eurasian Union. Therefore, defining the organization through the regional characteristic cannot be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> The term Global South does not only denote a region but also a socioeconomic condition. Most of the states of the Global South are economically challenged states. All states of the Global South could be members of the organization, except power-centers such as China. This should not be a problem because China is not a member state currently, but enjoys an observer status. The status quo could continue. The term “solidarity” means that the primary objective of the organization is promoting unity and collaboration among the states of the South. The change of nomenclature, in this manner, will further reinforce the already operating notion of South–South collaboration. Moreover, the solidarity of the Global South could continue unchallenged regardless of the changes that will take place within the international system in the long term.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of talk in science {{education}} about the problem of constantly reinventing the wheel, that is, individual teachers or curricu-lum development projects often seem to be doing the same thing over and over again, coming up with new ideas that aren’t very new at all, that are just slight variations on ideas that have been around for a long time. This seems to be a waste of time, just as the project of reinventing the wheel would be. If a solution to a problem has already been found by one teacher or one project, why not just make use of it, instead of starting from scratch yet again. Thinking about Evolution & Teaching Better communication among teach-ers and more effective dissemination of curriculum designs is often seen as the solution to the reinvention of the wheel problem. But I had an experi-ence last summer that made me think that reinventing the wheel may not be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> after all, and that it may even be an essential part of curriculum design and of an individu-al’s development as a teacher.
