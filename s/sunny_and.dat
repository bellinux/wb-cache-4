He worked in South Africa and coached the Pakistan cricket team upon request. In 2001, as resentment towards him in the British media following the court case died down, he was reinstated as a writer for British newspapers, and there was speculation that he would lead Lancashire Cricket Club following the departure of Bobby Simpson, though Mike Watkinson eventually took the role.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind and fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind and fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are <b>sunny</b> <b>and</b> dry.|$|E
5|$|Sunny {{offers to}} help out Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) with his love letters to Donna.

5|$|The stacks {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing {{the way the}} light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for <b>sunny</b> <b>and</b> one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E
50|$|In Ireland, May 2006 was {{the warmest}} for 20 years <b>and</b> <b>sunniest</b> since 2000; June 2006 was the sunniest on record, driest since 1995 and {{also one of}} the warmest; July 2006 was the warmest on record, sunniest in 15 years and also driest since 1989; August 2006 was average; September 2006 was the warmest on record; October 2006 was the warmest in many places since 2001 <b>and</b> <b>sunniest</b> since 2000; <b>and</b> November 2006 was warmer <b>and</b> <b>sunnier</b> than usual. Overall, Summer 2006 (June, July and August) was the <b>sunniest,</b> driest <b>and</b> warmest summer since 1995; and one of the <b>sunniest,</b> driest <b>and</b> warmest on record.

50|$|The {{climate in}} Písek {{is known to}} have a milder and drier {{microclimate}} because it is well protected from all sides against winds. Písek enjoys a cool inland version of temperate Oceanic climate (Cfb) with rather balanced temperatures year round and rare deep negative extremes. Lying in a rainshadow causes relatively low precipitations, vastly in form of rain (539 mm/annum). There are four distinctive seasons with cold and wet winter starting in late November and ending abruptly {{in the first half of}} March, changing into much <b>sunnier</b> <b>and</b> warmer spring which ends during May. Local summer, <b>sunny,</b> warm <b>and</b> wet, then continues up to its end in the first half of September. Autumn, rapidly cooling and much drier lasts into the end of November. Weather can be highly changeable with year-round rotation of two main patterns - continental fronts, <b>sunnier</b> <b>and</b> more extreme-prone, and oceanic fronts, bringing in murkier, wetter yet equable conditions.|$|R
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in <b>sunny</b> <b>and</b> hot weather conditions Michael Schumacher clinched the first pole position of the season and the 24th of his career, with a time of 1:20.974 on his second run. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who set a lap 0.076 seconds slower in the closing seconds of qualifying. Barrichello qualified third, and felt that his car did not feel good having not made any changes. Coulthard secured fourth position, despite losing time early in qualifying because of a fuel pressure problem. He decided against taking his team's spare car set up for Häkkinen because he believed it would take up time and had to run more fuel throughout the remainder of the session. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and he was suffering from excessive oversteer which prevented him from setting a quicker lap time but was delighted with his starting position. Villeneuve secured sixth position and said he achieved the best from his car. Both Jordan drivers lined up the fourth row of the grid (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen) and believed they could have a better starting position because of windy conditions. de la Rosa and Irvine rounded out the top ten fastest drivers, with de la Rosa confident of finishing in a higher position in his home country. Later on Saturday afternoon, a fuel sample from de la Rosa's car was analysed and declared illegal by the FIA and Arrows announced that it would appeal the decision, allowing de la Rosa to retain his starting position. Button, eleventh, reported his car felt unstable due to the windy conditions. He was ahead of Verstappen in the slower of the two Arrows, Salo in the faster Sauber, and Fisichella. Herbert, fifteenth, lost his front wing mounted camera after hitting a kerb {{in the early part of}} qualifying and made a minor mistake which prevented him from starting higher up the field. Diniz had excessive oversteer and managed sixteenth place. Ricardo Zonta managed seventeenth after he was unable to find a set-up which suited him and his fastest time was nine-tenths of a second slower than teammate Villeneuve. Alesi qualified eighteenth, ahead of Wurz in nineteenth. Heidfeld had engine problems and had to use the spare Prost monocoque and took 20th position. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the rear of the field in positions 21 and 22.|$|E
