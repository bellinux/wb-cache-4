25|$|At the Second Battle of Bull Run, McLean's brigade {{was placed}} at the extreme left of the Union line on Chinn Ridge. McDowell and Pope had placed him there to <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> Confederate flank attack, which could have {{potentially}} overrun {{the rest of the}} Army of Virginia. McLean's troops took many casualties, but they were able to hold off the Confederates for a half-hour, which allowed Pope to establish a second line of defense further north of Chinn Ridge. This line of defense allowed the Army of Virginia to withdraw from the field without being destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 {{made its}} first hover on 11 June 1959, and made its famed {{successful}} crossing of the English Channel on 25 July 1959. In December 1959, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Saunders-Roe at East Cowes and persuaded the chief test-pilot, Commander Peter Lamb, {{to allow him to}} take over the SR.N1's controls. He flew the SR.N1 so fast that he was asked to <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> little. On examination of the craft afterwards, it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed, damage that was never allowed to be repaired, and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'Royal Dent'.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a {{specific}} rule of hockey – which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop {{to their knees}} to block shots – to compliment his superb accuracy. Coming off the right wing or down the centre, he would unleash a “wicked knee-high shot” which would catch the opposing goalie between the glove – or stick – and pad. This shot placement was deliberately done in order to <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> goalie’s reaction time; they were often unable to decide between using their glove hand or blocker hand to deflect or catch the puck, and shuffling to {{one side or the}} other to use their pads. Lalonde’s snapper was so lethal that opposing coaches would often assign three to four of their own players just to shadow him, and – in one of the earliest iterations of the trap – attempt to pin him into a corner in order to prevent his being able to get into a scoring position.|$|E

But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner.

As in other contexts, positive and negative do not imply that the feedback causes good or bad effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it.

2500|$|Players {{are able}} to <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> song in Practice Mode as well. [...] Practice Mode also allows {{choosing}} a song from the player's Music Library {{for the purpose of}} selecting specific sections of a song to focus on, such as a guitar solo, or bridge section. [...] The selected sections can then be made to loop in order to help refine the player's handling of a particular part of a song which they might be having trouble handling note-for-note. [...] There is also a free-form play for pro drums where a drummer can play whatever they wish and utilize effects to change the sound of the drum set.|$|E
2500|$|Questing {{is a tool}} used in {{role-playing}} {{games to}} avoid putting players {{in a position where}} they only perform a repetitive action, such as killing creatures. Players may be performing this activity in order to gain new skills and progress to new areas, or to gain in-game money in order to buy new items, such as armor and equipment. This process, commonly known as [...] "grinding", can <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> character's progression in the game and ultimately limit the player's enjoyment. Having a number of quests for characters to tackle is seen as a way to provide variety, and to counter the need to grind in these types of games.|$|E

2500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{film critic}} Lisa Schwarzbaum gave Knight and Day a grade of [...] "C+", and {{compared}} it to the 2010 film Killers starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, [...] "The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters. The conclusion is overdetermined, since Roy and June are such flimsy constructions. ... At least they're not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers." [...] Colin Covert of Star Tribune made a similar comparison, [...] "The film looks unambitious, like a remake of 'Killers,' the Ashton Kutcher-Katherine Heigl guns-and-giggles toss-off everyone has already forgotten, but with bigger stunts and more star wattage." [...] The film received a rating of two stars out of four from critic Peter Howell in the Toronto Star; the reviewer commented, [...] "There {{is supposed to be}} romance in Knight and Day — and Diaz is up for it — but Cruise still looks as if he’s taken charisma lessons from Al Gore." [...] In a review for The Huffington Post, critic Marshall Fine observed, [...] "the movie bubbles happily for almost an hour before it flags". Robert Bell of Exclaim! wrote of the script, [...] "Sure, things <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> bit around the midway point, making it clear that there is very little going on here aside from cheesy escapist fantasy, but things quickly pick up again, engaging us in the moment of a movie that knows exactly what mainstream trash cinema should be." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, critic Roger Moore commented, [...] "The blase plot devices (a gadget, the nerdy guy who invented it), the bland villains, the too-fast dash through exotic locales, don't matter so long as Cruise and Diaz click and spark their scenes – chases and embraces – to life. And Cruise, hurling himself at this as if his Mission: Impossible future and indeed his whole career depended on it, makes sure they do." ...|$|E
