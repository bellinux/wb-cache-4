Loosely speaking, the Bilateral Energy Transfer is the straightforward transfer of energy between the two opposite sides of a teleoperation network, the master and <b>slave</b> <b>robots.</b> In an ideal telepresence scenario master and <b>slave</b> <b>robots</b> behave as rigid connected masses [1], and their power exchange is lossless; conversely, realistic scenarios include sources of energy leaks, i. e. elements that modify the power flows in the network. Moreover, if energy leaks have an active nature, they become source of instability for the system. This work isolates two sources of instability normally present in a teleoperation system, i. e. the delayed communication channel and robot velocity estimation based on digital position acquisition. These energy leaks are counterbalanced by two independent controllers, whose design is based on energetic consideration, and whose employment allows to achieve the Bi-lateral Energy Transfer. The presented arguments are sustained by simulations and experiments. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Kinematic {{parameters}} of a robotic manipulator {{are hard to}} measure precisely and the varying {{size and shape of}} tools held by the robot end-effector introduce further kinematic uncertainties. Moreover, the exact knowledge of the robot nonlinear dynamics may be unavailable due to model uncertainties. While adaptive master-slave teleoperation control strategies in the literature consider the dynamic uncertainties in the master and the <b>slave</b> <b>robots,</b> they stop short of accounting for the robots’ kinematic uncertainties, which can undermine the transparency of the teleoperation system. In this paper, for a teleoperation system that is both dynamically and kinematically uncertain, we propose novel nonlinear adaptive controllers that require neither the exact knowledge of the kinematics of the master and the slave nor the dynamics of the master, the slave, the human operator, and the environment. Therefore, the proposed controllers can provide the master and <b>slave</b> <b>robots</b> {{with a high degree of}} flexibility in dealing with unforeseen changes and uncertainties in their kinematics and dynamics. A Lyapunov function analysis is conducted to mathematically prove the stability and master-slave asymptotic position tracking.
