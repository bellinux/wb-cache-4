40|$|A {{method for}} {{displaying}} the electron Thomson scattering intensity {{in the inner}} heliosphere as observed by the zodiacal light photometers on board the Helios spacecraft {{in the form of}} <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> is presented. The method {{is based on the assumption}} that the bulk of the scattering electrons along the line of sight is located near the point closest to the sun. Inner-heliospheric structures will generally be represented properly in these <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> only if they are sufficiently long-lived (that is, a significant fraction of a solar rotation period). The examples of Helios <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> discussed (from data in April 1976 and November 1978), indicate that it is possible to identify large-scale, long-lived density enhancements in the inner heliosphere. It is expected that the Helios <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> will be particularly useful in the study of corotating structures (e. g., streamers), and the maps will be most reliable during periods when few transient featurs are present in the corona, i. e., during solar minimum...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} {{we have used}} {{electron}} Thomson scattering brightness observations, obtained with the zodiacal-light photometers on board the spacecraft Helios 1 and Helios 2, to study the global density structure of the quiet corona and inner heliosphere (greater than 17 solar radii). This was done {{by means of a}} comparison of <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> based on these Thomson scattering observations and <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> based on other solar/heliospheric data, such as IPS velocity, K-coronameter brightness and magnetic source surface data. In this paper we continue this approach by combining the Helios Thomson scattering maps (which provide density information) with IPS solar wind velocity maps to map out variations in mass and momentum flux of the solar wind as a function of latitude and phase of the solar cycle. The method used to construct the Helios and IPS <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> emphasizes the global, persistent (as opposed to transient) structures, and thus can be viewed as approximating conditions in the quiet corona and inner heliosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} temperature {{structure of}} the low corona is investigated using <b>synoptic</b> temperature <b>maps,</b> derived from the intensity ratio of the green (Fe XIV) and red (Fe X) coronal lines as observed at the National Solar Observatory/Sacramento Peak. This intensity ratio is sensitive to coronal plasma with temperatures {{in the range of}} 1 - 2 MK. The <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> indicate an association between high coronal temperature and the large-scale magnetic field. A comparison with WSO 'source surface' <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> shows that especially when the heliospheric current sheet is stable over several rotations, the large-scale high-temperature features follow the current sheet remarkably well. For recent Carrington rotations temperature maps have been constructed for various heights between 1. 15 and 1. 45 solar radii. For these maps the correspondence with the current sheet (calculated at 2. 5 solar radii) improves with height. Deviations between temperature structure and magnetic structure appears to be largest when the magnetic structure changes rapidly from rotation to rotation...|$|R
50|$|In 1823, Adolphe Quetelet obtains {{from the}} Minister of Public Education the {{creation}} of an astronomical Observatory in Brussels. Meanwhile, are the first meteorological observations done with rudimentary instruments.In 1876, Jean-Charles Houzeau de Lehaie becomes the new director of the Observatory. Quickly, he plans to move the Observatory from the site of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode to Uccle, as well as making from astronomy and meteorology two separate departments. On September 1, 1876, the first Belgian weather forecast was edited, based on the analysis of a <b>synoptic</b> <b>map.</b> In April 1903, the first weather balloon was launched, in order to obtain meteorological observations at a higher altitude. On July 31, 1913, the meteorological service of the Observatory becomes an autonomous institute under the name of Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI). Jean Vincent is its first director. From 1914 until 1918, during the German occupation, the RMI stops all activities. It was bombed on August 20, 1914 and rebuilt at the beginning of 1919.In 1919, Jules Jaumotte, astronomer, aviator from World War I and pioneer in the aerial photography, becomes director of the RMI and focuses on the possibility to realize atmospheric soundings in real time. Those new approaches in the study of atmosphere lead to a new science, the synoptic Aerology. In this context, during Belgium’s participation to the International Polar Year in 1932-1933, Jules Jaumotte performs automatic cloud photographs at high altitude by balloons, with a method that links the functioning of instruments to their altitude level.During World War II, the Institute was used by the Nazis as a military observatory and was destroyed by the English troops in 1944.In 1956, the RMI inaugurates the Geophysical Center of Dourbes, which studies magnetism and atmospheric electricity among other fields of research.|$|E

A survey of these data is in progress, presenting these scattering intensities in the form of <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> for successive Carrington rotations. The Thomson scattering maps reflect conditions at typically several tenths of an astronomical unit from the sun. Some representative examples from the survey in comparison with other solar/heliospheric data, such as in situ observations of the Helios plasma experiment and <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> constructed from magnetic field, H alpha and K-coronameter data are presented.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{creating}} <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> from asynoptically gathered trace gas data has prompted {{the development of}} a number of schemes. Most notable among these schemes are the Kalman filter, the Salby-Fourier technique, and constituent reconstruction. This paper explores a new technique called 2 ̆ 2 trajectory mapping. 2 ̆ 2 Trajectory <b>mapping</b> creates <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> from asynoptically gathered data by advecting measurements backward or forward in time using analyzed wind fields. A significant portion of this work is devoted to an analysis of errors in <b>synoptic</b> trajectory <b>maps</b> associated with the calculation of individual parcel trajectories. In particular, we have considered (1) calculational errors; (2) uncertainties in the values and locations of constituent measurements, (3) errors incurred by neglecting diabatic effects, and (4) sensitivity to differences in wind field analyses. These studies reveal that the global fields derived from the advection of large numbers of measurements are relatively insensitive to the errors in the individual trajectories. The trajectory mapping technique has been successfully applied to a variety of problems. In this paper, the following two applications demonstrate the usefulness of the technique: an analysis of dynamical wave-breaking events and an examination of Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite data accuracy...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the information content of asynoptic data taken {{in the form of}} nadir sonde and limb scan observations is presented, and a one-to-one correspondence is established between the alias-free data and twice-daily <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps.</b> Attention is given to space and time limitations of sampling and the orbital geometry is discussed. The sampling pattern is demonstrated to determine unique space-time spectra at all wavenumbers and frequencies. Spectral resolution and aliasing are explored, while restrictions on sampling and information content are defined. It is noted that irregular sampling at high latitudes produces spurious contamination effects. An Asynoptic Sampling Theorem is thereby formulated, as is a Synoptic Retrieval Theorem, {{in the second part of}} the article. In the latter, a procedure is developed for retrieving the unique correspondence between the asymptotic data and the <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps.</b> Applications examples are provided using data from the Nimbus- 6 satellite...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal {{wind and}} {{temperature}} data are employed {{to investigate the}} dynamics of the 4 -day wave in the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere. They were derived from <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> of satellite-measured brightness temperatures, which were generated using the fast Fourier <b>synoptic</b> <b>mapping</b> technique of Salby (1982). Circulation statistics from these data are compared to those from the NMC operational stratospheric analyses, demonstrating improvements afforded by detailed treatment of asynoptic sampling effects. The 40 -day wave is isolated using temporally filtered data. Several events of wave growth and decay are observed in the upper stratosphere during August 1980. Derived zonal-mean and eddy statistics suggest that the 4 -day wave results from an instability of the zonal-mean flow near 55 - 60 S, at and above 1 mb. It is inferred from climatological data that the source of the instability is the 'double-jet' structure in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere...|$|R

This area was mapped as a lightly cratered plain with thin or discontinuous eolian sediment. Analysis of lander images indicates that this interpretation is very close to actual surface conditions.

The ve blocking events comprise two categories, respectively dominated by zonal-wavenumber sets f 1 g and f 1; 2 g.

40|$|International audienceThe ARTEMIS-I {{catalog of}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs) was {{initially}} developed {{on a first}} generation of low-resolution <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> constructed from the SOHO/LASCO-C 2 images of the K-corona and resulted in an online database listing all events detected since January 1996 (Boursier et al., Solar Phys. 257, 125, 2009). A new generation of <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> with higher temporal (a factor of 1. 5) and angular (a factor of 2. 5) resolutions allowed us to reconsider the question of CME detection and resulted {{in the production of}} a new catalog: ARTEMIS-II. The parameters estimated for each detected CME are still the date and time of appearance, the position angle, the angular width, and (when detected at several solar distances) the global and median velocities. The new <b>synoptic</b> <b>maps</b> correct for the limited number of velocity determinations reported in the ARTEMIS-I catalog. We now determine the propagation velocity of 79 % of detected CMEs instead of 30 % in the previous version. A final major improvement is the estimation of the mass and kinetic energy of all CMEs for which we could determine the velocity, that is a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 13 000 CMEs until December 2010. Individual comparisons of velocity determination of 23 CMEs for which a full three-dimensional kinematical solution has been published indicate that ARTEMIS-II performs extremely well except at the highest velocities, an intrinsic limitation of our method. Finally, individual comparisons of mass determination of seven CMEs for which a robust solution has been obtained from stereographic observations demonstrate the quality of the ARTEMIS-II results...|$|R

The analysis reveals ensembles of coronal holes (ECHs) which appear within unipolar magnetic regions associated with decaying activity complexes (ACs). The cause-effect relations between them explain asynchronous PCH formation observed at {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres of the Sun. Thus, the decay of large ACs, that were observed in 2014, led to formation of an extensive ECH, which then became the south PCH in mid- 2015. Intricate structure of magnetic fields in the northern polar zone has impeded the north PCH formation, {{despite the fact that the}} dominant polarity at the North Pole reversed two years earlier than at the South Pole.

The spatial extent of bright, co-rotating heliospheric structures is readily observed in the data north and south of the ecliptic plane where the Helios photometer coverage is most complete.
