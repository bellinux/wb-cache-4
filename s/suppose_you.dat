25|$|As a {{concrete}} example, <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> ran a cruise ship. You {{have to decide}} how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle {{no more than one}} ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example you have multiple objectives. You want, of course, to maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, you want to have as many entertainers as possible.|$|E
25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|In the film, {{the line}} was an ad-lib by Grant and not in any version of the {{original}} script. According to Vito Russo in The Celluloid Closet (1981, revised 1987), the script originally had Grant's character say [...] "I...I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> think it's odd, my wearing this. I realize it looks odd...I don't usually...I mean, I don't own one of these". Russo suggests that this indicates that people in Hollywood (at least in Grant's circles) {{were familiar with the}} slang connotations of the word; however, neither Grant nor anyone involved in the film suggested this.|$|E
500|$|A plot {{to kidnap}} Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing {{students}} from the University of Aberdeen {{followed him to the}} house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. He was alone at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300." [...] He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could say they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together." [...] She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, [...] "We have no reason to believe they did , but we don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
