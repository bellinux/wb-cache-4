2500|$|In {{addition}} to being hot and cramped the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, {{making it difficult for}} operators to hear the director's commands or studio dialogue. John Scott Martin, a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: [...] "You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the <b>sink</b> <b>plunger.</b> If you were related to an octopus then it helped." ...|$|E

50|$|The Schiotz {{tonometer}} {{consists of}} a curved footplate which {{is placed on the}} cornea of a supine patient. A weighted plunger attached to the footplate sinks into the cornea. A scale then gives a reading depending on how much the <b>plunger</b> <b>sinks</b> into the cornea, and a conversion table converts the scale reading into IOP measured in mmHg.|$|R
5000|$|Plunger mutes {{are simply}} rubber <b>sink</b> or toilet <b>plungers</b> with the wooden handle removed (but can be {{purchased}} from certain mute companies). Some musicians cut holes in the rubber to alter the sound produced. Plungers are often used {{in a manner similar}} to the hat mute, where the musician manipulates the plunger in front of the bell while playing with their other hand. A [...] "closed" [...] plunger gives a tone similar to a tightly inserted cup mute, and a skilled plunger technician can often produce sounds similar to the human voice.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variety of}} mutes {{can be used}} with the {{trombone}} to alter its timbre. [...] Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. [...] Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a wah-wah effect. Mutes used in this way include the [...] "hat" [...] (a metal mute shaped like a bowler) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a <b>sink</b> or toilet <b>plunger),</b> a sound featured as the voices of adults in the Peanuts cartoons.|$|R
50|$|Externally Daleks {{have the}} {{appearance}} of a truncated cone varying between approximately 1.5 metres (5 feet) and 2 metres (6 feet 6 inches) tall depending on the variant. They are equipped with a single mechanical rod-mounted eye which protrudes from a rotating dome, a directed energy weapon and a telescopic arm. Usually the arm is fitted with a manipulating device resembling a <b>sink</b> <b>plunger.</b> This item is shown in various episodes to be capable of holding people and objects, seemingly using a powerful vacuum. The weapon is depicted as having a variable output which can paralyse, stun or kill most life forms, disintegrate other Daleks and destroy buildings and spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|The scene {{revealed}} by a London policeman???s torch in the low-key opening moments {{of a new}} television series {{on the evening of}} Saturday 23 rd November 1963 now seems emblematic. Doctor Who began in a junkyard and the secret of its success ??? in particular, the subtle, complex, distinctive essence of its relationship with its fans across half a century ??? is perhaps symbolized in the clutter of cultural fragments within which the TARDIS and its owner were first discovered. The BBC???s cancellation of the series in 1989 has often been blamed on its increasing orientation towards a diminishing hardcore of fans during the preceding decade. A perception that the show had become self-parodying and excessively reliant its own history is not without justification. The proposed paper argues, however, that this particular aspect of the decline was more intricate: the power of the Doctor Who format was, from the start, contingent on a singular sense of nostalgia, but under John Nathan-Turner this had become a narrow, self-referential nostalgia rather than a general, culturally alert one. Doctor Who???s intertextual, genre-crossing format allowed eccentric fantasy to co-exist with a unique accessibility and imitability of characters, costumes, props and monsters: children could make a TARDIS out of a cardboard box, they could be a Dalek with an egg whisk and a <b>sink</b> <b>plunger,</b> they could knit a long scarf, they could offer jelly babies from a paper bag??? Encouraging cosplay before cosplay existed, embodying steampunk before the term was coined, Doctor Who made nostalgia futuristic. Tellingly, its triumphant revival since 2005, for all its bigger budgets and digital effects, has rejoiced in the ???wobbly set??? legacy. Adult viewers feel a continuation of childhood obsessions, thrills and reassurances, while their children have an enthusiasm that they feel ownership of but can also share with parents. In this sense, new Who, like old Who, taps into the richly nostalgic ideals of family television...|$|E
