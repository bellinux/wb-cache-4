50|$|The {{cantilever}} <b>snap-fit</b> is {{the most}} commonly used <b>snap-fit</b> of the three. A cantilever design can be multiple use or permanent. A multiple use <b>snap-fit</b> usually has a lever or pin to be pushed, in order to undo the <b>snap-fit.</b> However, on a permanent <b>snap-fit</b> there is no lever or pin. Attempting to undo a permanent <b>snap-fit</b> can result in the piece breaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the <b>Snap-fit</b> determines what {{it can be used}} for. There are three main types of snap-fits: annular, cantilever, and torsional. Most <b>snap-fit</b> joints have a common design of a {{protruding}} edge and a snap-in area. The specific name of the <b>snap-fit</b> is usually named after the type of stress or strain it utilizes; the torsional <b>snap-fit</b> uses torque to hold parts in place.|$|R
50|$|Some {{potential}} problems with {{being able to}} undo the <b>snap-fit</b> is hyper-extending it past its breaking point. As a solution, some parts have a stopper {{in order to stop}} the <b>snap-fit</b> from breaking. One very popular example is a battery compartment lid.|$|R
50|$|Building a <b>snap-fit</b> design {{requires}} more precise engineering than a screw or nail assembly, {{and is often}} more expensive. When <b>snap-fits</b> are being made, the producer needs to determine where the stresses of the parts will be applied to when assembled, or they break during assembly. The high production costs are due {{to the amount of}} calculation and precision that must be done {{in order to create a}} strong <b>snap-fit.</b> Another reason is the creation of molds; they are more time consuming from the integration of parts in the product.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{prototype}} automated disassembly system {{was developed for}} the disposal of end-of-life electronics. The system was designed to handle a family of electronic devices whose plastic, cantilever <b>snap-fit</b> covers house AA or AAA batteries. Examples of these devices {{included in the study}} were a TV remote control and a TI- 84 scientific calculator. The main focus of the prototype system was the design of an automated disassembly tool with the ability to remove the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and the batteries contained within. The design concept conceived to release the <b>snap-fit</b> and the batteries was a force sensing tool tip utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs). The sensor feedback from the FSRs was used to control the movement of the tool during disassembly operations. A pneumatically actuated vacuum gripper and electromagnet system was developed for recovering the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries once they were released by the disassembly tool. The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot. A Visual Basic GUI was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller. The Visual Basic application was used to program an automated disassembly routine for the removal of the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries. A model-based computer vision application was also developed in Visual C++ using a Kinect sensor and the OpenCV library to identify and localize the electronic device placed on the disassembly robot. The information gathered by the model-based computer vision application was used by the robot to load the necessary device parameters and compute the <b>snap-fit</b> and battery coordinates. The robot was then able to use the disassembly tool module to perform the necessary disassembly operations to remove the device 2 Ì† 7 s <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries. Thus, a force-based disassembly tool was successfully designed and integrated with a vision system and a robot to create an automated system for the removal of <b>snap-fit</b> covers and batteries. ...|$|R

The 1987 Gundam Sentinel model line introduced the concept of <b>snap-fit</b> models, reducing the need to use glue. And starting from the 1988 Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack line, all Gunpla kits feature <b>snap-fit</b> assembly.|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{issues related}} to {{modeling}} and analysis of insertion and retention phenomena in <b>snap-fit</b> features. An analytical methodology for developing detailed mod-els of <b>snap-fits</b> is proposed and formulated. The strategy involves idealizing the feature as a rigid body supported on a flexible structure. A set of equations that comprehensively describes the system in its deformed configuration is formulated. The equation system is it-eratively solved for several such configurations to obtain a model of insertion and retention processes for <b>snap-fits.</b> It has been implemented for the cantilever hook in this research. The model shows good agreement with experimental results for most <b>snap-fit</b> geometries. However, it {{still needs to be}} refined to provide better predictions for high-angle retention. Suggestions for possible improvements and future research directions are provided. An experimental study of high-angle retention has been undertaken with a view to establishing a fundamental understanding of governing phenomena. Force-displacement curves are correlated to still frames from high speed video of the experiment, to identify the location of peaks in the insertion and retention force curves.

40|$|AbstractSnap-fit joints {{are one of}} the {{cheapest}} and fastest connectors available. However, due to geometrical complexity of the joints and the limitations of injection molding, they are used almost exclusively in large-scale manufactured products. Additive manufacturing offers the possibility to create end-user products in small and medium numbers with almost unlimited design complexity. This clears the way for new solutions using <b>snap-fit</b> joints to be explored. In this contribution, the existing design guidelines for <b>snap-fit</b> joints are challenged with the design potentials of additive manufacturing. The general working principles of <b>snap-fit</b> joints prove to be simple, clear, and safe independent of the manufacturing process. While the principles remain unchanged, the advantages of additive manufacturing are utilized to improve the integration in the product and the user handling. By applying the design restrictions of the additive manufacturing processes Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) the existing guidelines are extended for new manufacturing processes. To demonstrate the new concepts and the capabilities of additive manufactured <b>snap-fit</b> joints a showcase is conceptualized, designed in detail and produced using Fused Deposition Modeling and Selective Laser Sintering. A lid of a container, similar to a jar, is designed as an integrated single component. Aspects of haptics and usability are integrated, resulting in a lid that can easily be assembled and disassembled using one hand only. The design features springs and <b>snap-fit</b> joints adapted to the advantages and limitations of additive manufacturing...|$|R
50|$|The annular <b>snap-fit</b> {{utilizes}} hoop-strain to hold into place. Hoop-strain is {{the expansion}} of the circumference of the more elastic piece as it is pushed onto the more rigid piece. In most cases the design is circular. Some popular examples are pen caps, ball and socket joints, Snap fasteners, and some water bottle caps. This kind of <b>snap-fit</b> can be used multiple times. However, permanent strain may develop, loosening the joint when it is used too often.|$|R
50|$|In a {{torsional}} snap fit, {{one must}} deflect, or force the protruding edges of piece B {{away from the}} insertion area. Piece A then slides in between the protruding edges until the desired distance is reached. The edges of piece B is then released and piece A is held in place. The <b>snap-fits</b> in this description are the protruding edges of piece B. These types of <b>snap-fits</b> may have a spring in place; so that when activated, the locked in piece is released and put into action.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of new flexible yet springy materials, such as molded plastic, and new manufacturing processes, many new variations in these types of connectors have been invented, and are commonly called <b>snap-fits.</b> They can be found in on our phones, laptops, keys, and other household devices. Engineers have studied and developed these <b>snap-fits,</b> creating formulae concerning the amount of deflection allowed on the components, amount of torque one can take, and the amount of space one can allow in order to be detached.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} potential applications of CNC fabricated <b>snap-fit</b> joints for cross-laminated veneer lumber panels (LVL). These joints are new to the building construction sector, but commonly used in other domains such as the automotive or consumer electronics industry. We explain our application of existing knowledge about the de-sign and dimensioning of such joints, {{as well as several}} adaptations that we have made in order to optimize the connectors for the jointing of struc-tural wood panels. This was necessary due to the materials and fabrication processes in timber construction, which are different from those in the sec-tors of origin of the <b>snap-fit</b> joints. We propose applications, including two case studies with physical prototypes: 1. a box girder prototype on which we introduce the combination of <b>snap-fit</b> joints with shear-resistant tab-and-slot joints and test the mechanical performance of the joints. 2 : A double-layer arch prototype with non-orthogonal, 5 -axis CNC-fabricated joints. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to create a}} {{solution}} that converts a permanent <b>snap-fit</b> into a non-permanent one by using shape memory alloys (SMA). Permanent <b>snap-fits</b> often can be found on connector clips. Thus, they are the basis for the integration of the memory material. Due to the high performance of SMA wires under tensile stress they are the preferred components for insertion into a connector clip to act as an active releasing element. After fabrication of a <b>snap-fit</b> carrying connector prototype by 3 D printing its gauging in carried out and the desired movement can be observed. However, it does not achieve the anticipated operating displacement. Subsequent analysis of this observation leads to identification of problems during the moulding process. This results in the rejection of the original concept. Finally a new prototype gets created using a SMA wire under bending load that is a promising starting point for subsequent research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} novel active fasteners developed to significantly lower disassembly costs during reconditioning, remanufacturing, and recycling of products. In the initial stage of the fastener development process, the applicability of distinct trigger signals for active disassembly (AD) is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the high robustness of using a pressure increase or decrease as a nondestructive trigger for AD is demonstrated. Since previously proposed pressure-sensitive fasteners face considerable drawbacks upon implementation in electronic products due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization, a second generation of pressure-based active fasteners is developed. Evaluation of these fasteners by means of axiomatic design techniques and prototyping demonstrates that the presented <b>snap-fits,</b> which make use of a closed-cell elastomer foam, are most robust. Subsequently, the contraction forces that closed-celled foams can exert {{as a function of}} an increase in ambient air pressure are experimentally determined. Furthermore, the implementation of pressure-sensitive foam-based <b>snap-fits</b> in both a modem and a payment terminal is described. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the contraction force of a cross-linked metallocene polyethylene closed-cell foams can reach up to 6 N/cm 2 at an overpressure of 2 bar and that the foam-based <b>snap-fits</b> can be released at a pressure increase of 2 bar. status: publishe...|$|R
