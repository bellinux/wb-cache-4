50|$|A <b>side</b> <b>dump</b> truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the <b>side</b> <b>dump</b> are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a <b>side</b> <b>dump</b> trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the <b>side</b> <b>dump</b> can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their loads further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.|$|E

Lake Murray, impounded by the Dam, has a storage capacity {{of more than}} 2, 100, 000 ac-ft of water. Lake Murray supplies water to a hydroelectric power plant (Saluda Hydro) and a coal-fired plant (McMeekin Station), provides drinking water for Columbia and adjacent towns, and offers many recreational opportunities for the community. The Saluda Dam is a 200 ft high and 7, 800 ft long earth Dam built in 1930. An on-site borrow source of silty and clayey sand was used for construction. The Dam was built by hauling fill to the embankment in rail cars then <b>side</b> <b>dumped</b> into piles on the upstream and downstream portions of the embankment (the two outer shells). The piles were watered by monitors, sluicing the fine material into a central sedimentation pool, where it settled to form a core for the Dam. This method of placement has little control over the quality and consistency of the final product. The trestles and railroad tracks were left in place and buried in the Dam, further increasing its heterogeneity. The geotechnical investigations indicate that density of the fill varies from very loose to medium dense. The Dam is founded on residual soil with no provisions for seepage cut-off.

Combustor characteristics were obtained from water tunnel simulation and direct-connect combustion tests. A perspex, one third scale, model of the ramjet combustor was tested in a water rig. Flow field visualisation was accomplished by employing the hydrogen bubble streak technique. The best placement of the cruciform flameholder relative to the air inlet plane was determined.

Very rich propane air mixtures were injected {{at the head}} to simulate a gas generator ramjet. Swirl was introduced by canting the inlets at the dump station. The inlet angle, swirl angle, and {{the distance of the}} head from the dump station were varied over a wide range to determine the importance of the vortices located at the dump stations and at the head. It is shown that with proper design, the vortex at the head can be made to perform as a pilot burner allowing a great deal of versatility of operation and it appears to provide all the criteria of pollution free operation...|$|E
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} is presented for calculating the longitudinal acoustic modes of idealized "dump-type" ramjet engines. The geometry considered is the coaxial flow type with {{the inlet flow}} opening to the combustor at a simple dump plane. Since the frequencies are very low, the dominant modes are the one-dimensional longitudinal modes and allow the predictions to be extended to more complicated geometries (such as <b>side</b> <b>dump</b> combustors) with good success. A plane flame has been studied and incorporated into the combustor model where the flame is allowed to move or oscillate in the combustor. This provides three mechanisms of interaction at the flame sheet: change in mean temperature in the combustor, energy conversion at the sheet due to upstream fluctuations, and fluctuating heat release. A supersonic inlet upstream contains a shock wave in its diffuser section while the downstream exit is terminated by a choked nozzle. The linear coupling of the acoustic and entropy waves at the inlet shock, flame sheet, and exit nozzle along with acoustic admittances at the inlet and exit are combined to determine {{the stability of the}} system as well as the acoustic modes. Since the acoustic and entropy waves travel at different velocities, the geometry is a critical factor in determining stability. Typical values of the admittances will produce damped solutions when the entropy is neglected, but, as the ratio of the entropy to acoustic fluctuations is increased, the coupling can either feed acoustic energy into or out of different modes independently. This transfer of energy has a destabilizing or stabilizing effect on the acoustic modes of the system depending on the relative phases between the acoustic and entropy waves. In the linear case, the entropy and acoustics are decoupled in the flow field. All linear coupling occurs at the boundary conditions. For cases where the entropy fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the pressure oscillations and the coupling is of comparable order, the linear stability of the acoustic field is strongly dependent upon the entropy fluctuations. The linear acoustics are predominantly governed by the boundary conditions; thus it is imperative that the entire system of inlet, combustor, and exit be considered together to determine the characteristic eigenvalues (resonant frequencies) and eigenfunctions (mode shapes). In addition, there are two modes of acoustic pressure oscillations: the classical acoustic mode and the entropy-induced mode of pressure oscillation. The nonlinear case treats the quadratic nonlinear fluid mechanic interactions in the coupling of two acoustic modes. The result is that the nonlinear acoustic-entropy interactions are much smaller than the acoustic-acoustic interactions for this case. Hence, the nonlinear acoustic field is influenced by the nonuniform entropy only by its dependence upon the linear solution which can be strongly dependent upon the entropy. The energy in the acoustics of this model is controlled by the energy loss (gain) at the boundaries balanced with the energy gain (loss) at the flame front. Acoustic energy is typically lost at both the inlet and exit, but fluctuating entropy waves convecting with the mean flow velocity that impinge upon a choked nozzle generate acoustic waves that can, under the proper conditions, feed acoustic energy into the system. In addition, the Rayleigh condition for driving the system with a fluctuating heat release can also contribute to the stability of the system. The plane flame mechanism also contributes to the acoustic energy from the interaction of entropy and acoustic waves at a flame sheet. This allows a systematic study of the influence of entropy-acoustic wave interactions on the linear stability and modes of this combustor system...|$|E

5000|$|Early {{development}} of hydraulic systems {{for what would}} become the backhoe loader proceeded in parallel in the US and the UK. The invention of the first backhoe swing frame was developed in July 1947 by Vaino J. Holopainen (pronounced [...] "Waino") and Roy E.
