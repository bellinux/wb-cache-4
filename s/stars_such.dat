5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude.

5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of <b>stars.</b> <b>Such</b> systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
50|$|Exoplanets {{that are}} {{extremely}} {{close to their}} <b>star,</b> <b>such</b> as hot Jupiters can experience significant hydrodynamic escape {{to the point that}} they cease to be gas giants and are left with just the core, at which point they would be called Chthonian planets.|$|R

500|$|The {{variant of}} the Dyson sphere most often {{depicted}} in fiction is the [...] "Dyson shell": a uniform solid shell of matter around the <b>star.</b> <b>Such</b> a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star, and would intercept 100% of the <b>star's</b> energy output. <b>Such</b> a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision {{would be used for}} habitation, if the surface could be made habitable.|$|R
5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E
5|$|Storhamar Ishall is {{the regular}} {{training}} venue for Storhamar IL's figure skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian Figure Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic figure skating event. Although featuring <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as Nancy Kerrigan, it only attracted 150 spectators. The venue has hosted the ISU Junior Grand Prix in 1999–2000 and 2000–01 and the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the first}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Omar Bradley, was {{eventually}} awarded a fifth <b>star,</b> <b>such</b> a promotion {{does not come}} with the office; Bradley's elevation was a political move {{so that he would}} not be outranked by his subordinate, Douglas MacArthur.|$|R

5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as Sirius to the Sun, they found {{differences in the}} strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{the company}} {{continued}} to widen its range. Its first Wagner production, Lohengrin, and its first Mozart, The Marriage of Figaro, were both performed in 1962, conducted by Charles Groves. Another Welsh opera, Hughes's Serch yw'r Doctor ("Love, the Doctor") was staged in 1960. The popular Italian repertoire remained {{the core of}} the annual seasons, mostly directed by the head of production, John Moody. Leading roles were taken by rising <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> as John Shirley-Quirk, Gwyneth Jones, Thomas Allen, Josephine Barstow and Margaret Price, the last of whom made her operatic debut with the company in 1962. Established singers guesting with the company included Geraint Evans who played the title role in Don Pasquale in 1966, and Ian Wallace in the same part the following year. Evans was also seen as Leporello in Don Giovanni in 1966 and as Falstaff in 1969.|$|E

50|$|In March 1975, Marvel UK {{launched}} a new weekly title called The Super-Heroes (simultaneously with SSOC).
