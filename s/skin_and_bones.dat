5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
5|$|Now often also {{considered}} a distinct species, Homo neanderthalensis (otherwise known as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) {{lived in the}} southern half of Poland during the Middle Paleolithic period, that is between 300,000 and 40,000 BCE. Various relics were found and different Neanderthal cultures are distinguished. Acheulean handaxes from Silesia dated 200,000-180,000 years ago are among the older tools. Gatherer-hunter sporadic groups of Neanderthals penetrated southern Poland also during the Eemian interglacial, 128,000-115,000 BCE. Examination of the Micoquien-Prądnik culture (East Micoquien complex) sites in the Prądnik River Valley north of Kraków and in Zwoleń near Radom from about 85,000 to 70,000 BCE (early phase of the Vistula River glaciation period) shows that some Neanderthals were skilled collective hunters, able to kill numerous large mammals characteristic of the cold Pleistocene climate and process the meat, <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> using specialized tools.|$|E

5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones,</b> blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to produce collagen hydrolysate from pangasius catfish <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> using bromelain enzyme. The resulted collagen peptides were expected to have antioxidative activity. Five different enzyme concentration ranged from 1 - 5 % and different hydrolysis time (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 160 min) {{were used in the}} experiment. The parameters observed were yields of both <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> collagen, degree of hydrolysis and antioxidative activity (DPPH and reducing power). The result showed that collagen hydrolysate prepared by bromelain enzyme has antioxidative activity. The yield for both <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> collagen hydrolysate was 45. 84 % and 12. 86 % respectively. The highest degree of hydrolysis skin collagen hydrolysate was 2. 58 % at 160 minutes whereas the bone collagen hydrolysate had the highest degree of hydrolysis was 2. 97 % at 160 minutes. Based on the DPPH method <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> collagen hydrolysate had the antioxidative activity of 61. 67 % and 71. 83 %.

25|$|Medical imaging is the {{technique}} and {{process of creating}} visual representations of {{the interior of a}} body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues (physiology). Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones,</b> as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.|$|E
25|$|Since clerids are predaceous in nature, {{they have}} been found feeding on fly larvae {{as well as the}} <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> of carrion. Most clerids are not useful in {{forensics}} because of their food choice, but some species such as the Necrobia rufipes can be useful. Necrobia rufipes is attracted towards carrion in the later stages of decomposition, so its arrival on carrion can help provide an estimate for the post-mortem interval or PMI. Although the checkered beetle is not the most significant insect on carrion, the beetles predaceous nature and its ability to reproduce in carrion that is exposed to the environment provides some forensic importance.|$|E

500|$|Brazil played Italy in {{the final}} at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pelé scored the opening goal with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth {{finished}} by Carlos Alberto. The last goal {{of the game is}} often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pelé made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying [...] "I told myself before the game, he's made of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> just like everyone else— but I was wrong".|$|E
500|$|Several of Saruman’s other {{appearances}} in the book emerged {{in the process of}} writing. Christopher Tolkien believes that the old man seen by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli at the edge of Fangorn forest near the beginning of The Two Towers is in the original drafts intended to be Gandalf. In the finished version he is Saruman. Similarly, in the first drafts of the chapter The Scouring of the Shire, Sharkey is successively a ruffian met by the hobbits and then that man’s unseen boss. It is only in the second draft of the chapter that, as Christopher Tolkien puts it, his father “perceive” that Sharkey was in fact Saruman. The name used by Saruman's henchmen for their diminished leader [...] is said in a footnote to the final text to be derived from an Orkish term meaning [...] "old man". Saruman's death scene, in which his body shrivels away to <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> revealing [...] "long years of death" [...] and [...] "a pale shrouded figure" [...] rises over the corpse, was not added until the page proofs of the completed book were being reviewed by Tolkien. John D. Rateliff and Jared Lobdell are among those to write that the scene shows similarities to the death of the 2000-year-old sorceress Ayesha in H. Rider Haggard's 1887 novel [...]|$|E
500|$|Ahalya's defence plea is {{also found}} in some of the Puranas. In the Brahma Purana, Ahalya is cursed to become a dried up stream, but pleads her innocence and {{produces}} servants, who were also deceived by Indra's disguise, as witnesses. Gautama reduces the curse on his [...] "faithful wife" [...] and she is redeemed when she joins the Gautami (Godavari) river as a stream. Indra is cursed to carry his shame {{in the form of a}} thousand vulvae on his body, but the vulvae turn into eyes as he bathes in the Gautami. The Brahma Purana is a rare exception where Rama is dropped from the narrative. Instead, the greatness of the Gautami river is illustrated. The Padma Purana tells that as Indra attempts to flee in the form of a cat, Gautama curses him to lose his genitals and to bear a thousand vulvae on his body. The beguiled Ahalya declares herself blameless, but Gautama considers her impure and curses her to be reduced to a mere skeleton of <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones.</b> He decrees that she will regain her beautiful form when Rama laughs at seeing her so afflicted, dried out (a reminder of the dried stream motif), without a body (the Ramayana curse) and lying on the path (an attribute often used to describe a stone). When Rama comes, he proclaims her innocence and Indra's guilt, whereupon Ahalya returns to her heavenly abode and dwells with Gautama.|$|E

40|$|The meat {{industry}} is consistently requiring innovations for sustainable production {{of high quality}} packed raw meat in which the amount of undesirable components or ‘contaminants’ from slaughtering house such as fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> should be minimized or even eliminated. This would not only aim to produce pure packed lean meat but also help to re-use other components (fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone)</b> for particular purposes in the most efficient way. As manual selection by human visual inspection of these components from their mixtures {{coming out of the}} slaughtering house would not be suitable for automatic operations, more advanced technologies would be necessary for automatic classifications and subsequent selection processes in the factory. Therefore, in this research, hyperspectral imaging in the VNIR wavelength range 400 - 1000 nm was employed in combination with multivariate statistical analysis and image processing for classification of raw meat, fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> from their mixtures. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) was used to create a calibration model from acquired hyperspectral images of these pure individual components. This model was then applied to classify mixtures created from new meat, fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> samples which were not used in building the calibration model. The obtained results indicated that each individual component could be classified in the mixtures with chemometrics and image processing approach. From the classified images, percentages of each component (meat, fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone)</b> could also potentially be evaluated. Our research outcomes indicated that hyperspectral imaging in combination with chemometrics and image processing has high potential for applications in the meat industry for the production of packed lean meat products and also for more sustainable meat production through the more efficient recovery of fat, <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone.</b> status: accepte...|$|R

2500|$|Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz {{were part}} of the Far Eastern Party, a three-man {{sledging}} team with Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis, to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their [...] return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition hypervitaminosis A because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.|$|E
