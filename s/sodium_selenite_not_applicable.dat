40|$|Administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> (Na 2 SeO 3) 1 hr before cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (referred to herein as cisplatin) {{can protect}} against the {{nephrotoxicity}} of cisplatin. The pharmacokinetic aspects of this interaction were studied in rodents with radiolabeled selenite and cisplatin. Total [75 Se]selenium in plasma consisted of [75 Se] selenium in plasma proteins and [75 Se]selenite in plasma ultrafiltrate. After a short distribution phase, the elimination of [75 Se]selenite and total [75 Se]selenium proceeded biphasically in the rat, with an initial plasma elimination half-life of [75 Se]selenite of 22 +/- 2 min.

Mutation frequency following exposure to 8 Gy was evaluated by quantitation of the mutations detected at the hprt locus of these cells.

40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} trace element that occurs in nature, in both inorganic and organic forms. This element participates in numerous biochemical processes, including antioxidant potential, but the mechanism of its anti-cancer action is still not well known. It {{should be noted that}} the anti-cancer properties of selenium depends on its chemical form, therapeutic doses, and the tumor type. Higher nutritional doses of selenium can stimulate human immune system. There are several hypotheses concerning the anticancer activity of selenium, including oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in proteins causing their conformational alterations. Conformational changes in proteins have the ability to weaken the activity of enzymes involved in the metabolism of cancer cells. In case of human fibrinogen <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite,</b> but <b>not</b> selenate, it inhibits protein disulfide exchange reactions, thus preventing formation of a hydrophobic polymer termed parafibrin, circulatory accumulation, of which is associated with numerous degenerative diseases.

In this way, cancer cells become protected against destruction by the organism’s immune system. Other possible mechanisms of anticancer action of selenium are being still investigated...|$|R
40|$|Selenium {{treatment}} in supranutritional but subtoxic doses {{has previously been}} shown to inhibit cell proliferation in preneoplastic lesions in a rat liver carcinogenesis model. The mechanisms are not known, but thioredoxin reductase (TrxR 1), a seleno-enzyme essential for maintaining intracellular redox status and cellular defence against oxidative stress might be involved. The aim of this work was to study whether selenium affected regenerative liver growth after partial hepatectomy as it did neoplastic growth and to study the effect of selenium on TrxR 1 expression and regulation in regenerative and normal rat liver. To address these questions, we have compared the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> on tumour growth in an experimental rat liver model {{for the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma with the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> on regeneration of liver mass after 2 / 3 partial hepatectomy and the effect of 10 weeks <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> treatment on normal rats. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> administered in the drinking water (5 μg/ml) reduced the rate of tumour growth during progression up to 12 months after initiation, but it did not affect gain of liver mass or rate of cell proliferation up to three weeks after 2 / 3 partial hepatectomy. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> supplementation at dose levels of 1 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml showed an initial dose dependent increase of blood and liver levels of selenium. At 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, the selenium concentrations equilibrated regardless of dose and with no further accumulation. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> did <b>not</b> affect body weight or relative liver mass at given doses. We also explored whether TrxR 1 was a marker of the liver tumour phenotype or if the TrxR 1 over expression found in liver preneoplasia and neoplasia could be explained only by TrxR 1 induction in growing cells. We found that from 6 months after initiation in the tumour model TrxR 1 was only expressed in neoplastic liver lesions that showed signs of cell proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation), while remodelling preneoplastic liver nodules that were BrdU negative were immunohistochemically negative for TrxR 1. Both types of lesions were, however, expressing the classical marker of preneoplastic and neoplastic nodules, glutathione S-transferase π (GST-π). During liver cell regeneration TrxR 1 was induced at the time of cell proliferation, but was back to background activity 72 hours after partial hepatectomy. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> potentiated this increase in enzyme activity. When <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> was given to normal rats over long time TrxR 1 activity was induced in the liver to an extent reflecting the liver selenium levels. TrxR 1 mRNA was, however, only increased over background at the time when the selenium level was increasing. We found that, although TrxR 1 did increase to a certain extent during cell proliferation, the neoplastic over expression of TrxR 1 was not correlated to the rate of cell growth in the tumours. Our interpretation of the finding that TrxR 1 was selectively over expressed in the growing preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions is that TrxR 1 is a tumour marker with a higher specificity to neoplasia with an increased risk for malignant transformation. Based on the facts that long-term treatment of <b>selenite</b> did <b>not</b> cause accumulation of selenium or selenium toxicity and the fact that selenium inhibited only neoplastic growth but not regenerative growth we suggest that selenium is a suitable candidate for tumour prevention in patients with chronic liver disease dependent on sustained ability of liver regeneration. Furthermore TrxR 1 is a histological marker in chronic liver disease for liver cancer and liver cancer prestages with a potential to be a marker for liver cancer risk...|$|R

The first group was served as the control, the second group was given <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> (0. 25 mg/kg b. w), while the third group was given mercuric chloride (0. 25 mg/kg), finally, the fourth group was given combined treatment of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> and mercuric chloride for 3 weeks. Results: The effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> on mercuric chloride induced oxidative and renal stress were evaluated by serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, billirubin levels and LDH activity, kidney tissue lipid peroxidation, GSH levels, GSH-Px, GST and catalase activities and hematological parameters. Administration of mercuric chloride induced significant increase in serum: creatinine, urea, uric acid and billirubin concentration showing renal stress. Mercuric chloride also induced oxidative stress, as indicate by decreased kidney tissue of GSH level, GSH-Px, GST, and catalase activities along with increase the level of lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, treatment with mercuric chloride caused a marked elevation of kidney weight and decreased body weight and erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit levels. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> treatment markedly reduced elevated serum: creatinine, urea, uric acid and billirubin levels, and LDH activity and conteracted the deterious effects of mercuric chloride on oxidative stress markers and hematological parameters and atteneuated histopathological changes caused by HgCl 2 in kidney.

METHODS: Cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles (60 mg/kg per day) and <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> (5 &#x 3 BC;mol/kg per day) {{alone or in}} combination, or the metal form of CeO 2 (60 mg/kg) were administered for 2 wk by intraperitoneal injection to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. At the end of treatment blood was collected, liver tissue dissected and then oxidative stress markers, extent of energy depletion and lipid profile were evaluated. RESULTS: Antioxidant enzymes and high density lipoprotein decreased whereas oxidative stress, adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphospahte levels, cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein increased on induction of diabetes. All were improved {{by a combination of}} nanocerium and <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite.</b> There was a relative amelioration by CeO 2 nanoparticles or <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> alone, but the metal form of CeO 2 showed no significant improvement.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible protective effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> on serum, liver, and kidney antioxidant enzymes activities in alloxan-induced type 1 diabetic rats. Methods: Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into four groups; Group one as control, Group two as sham-treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> by 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections daily, Group three as diabetic untreated, and Group four as diabetic treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> by 1 mg/kg i. p. injections daily. Diabetes was induced in the third and fourth groups by subcutaneous alloxan injections. After eight weeks the animals were euthanized and livers and kidneys were immediately removed and used fresh or kept frozen until analysis. Before the rats were killed blood samples were also collected to measure glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) activities in sera. Results: Glutathione peroxidase and CAT activities serum, liver, and kidney were all significantly less in the diabetic rats than in the controls. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> treatment of the diabetic rats resulted in significant increases in GPX activity in the kidneys and livers, and CAT activity in the sera and livers. Conclusions: Our results indicate that <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> might be a potent antioxidant that exerts beneficial effects on both GPX and CAT activities in alloxan-induced type 1 diabetic rats...|$|R

The present investigation reveals the rational of the beneficial effects of the natural compound C-phycocyanin (C-PC) is beneficial when administered to rat pups to protect against the secondary effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> induced cataractogenesis. A single subcutaneous dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> (19 lmol/kg body weight) on the 10 th day of postpartum is adequate to induce cataract in rat pups. Serum biochemical parameters, such as the level of electrolytes, mean activities of anti-oxidant enzymes i. e. superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione were observed to be significantly altered during selenite induced cataractogenic process. Histopathological examination revealed signs of degradation of normal cell architecture in the liver, kidney and eye lens. Interestingly, the deleterious effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> toxicity were restored with the simultaneous treatment with C-PC. The results suggest that an administration of 200 mg/kg body weight of C-PC has the ability to prevent/alter the secondary changes reflected in the serum biochemical and histological modifications in rats exposed to <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite.</b> These results complement the beneficial role of C-PC of cyanobacterial origin as a efficacious anti-cataractogenic agent against <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> toxicity...|$|R

The aim of this present investigation is to study the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated activation of unfolded protein response (UPR), overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppression of Nrf 2 /Keap 1 -dependent antioxidant protection through endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and Keap 1 promoter DNA demethylation in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite.</b> Lenses enucleated from <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> injected rats generated overproduction of ROS in lens epithelial cells and newly formed lens fiber cells resulting in massive lens epithelial cells death after 1 – 5 days. All these lenses developed nuclear cataracts after 4 – 5 days. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> treated HLECs induced ER stress and activated the UPR leading to release of Ca 2 + from ER, ROS overproduction and finally HLECs death. <b>Sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> also activated the mRNA expressions of passive DNA demethylation pathway enzymes such as Dnmt 1, Dnmt 3 a, and Dnmt 3 b, and active DNA demethylation pathway enzyme, Tet 1 leading to DNA demethylation in the Keap 1 promoter of HLECs. This demethylated Keap 1 promoter results in overexpression of Keap 1 mRNA and protein. Overexpression Keap 1 protein suppresses the Nrf 2 protein through ERAD leading to suppression of Nrf 2 /Keap 1 dependent antioxidant protection in the HLECs treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite.</b> As an outcome, the cellular redox status is altered towards lens oxidation and results in cataract formation...|$|R

To investigate the effect of sources and different rates of selenium on physiological traits, yield and yield components of wheat and barley in dry lands a factorial experiment based on complete randomized block design with three replicates was carried out at the Research Station of Islamic Azad University, Arak Branch, in 2014 - 2015. Experimental factors were selenium sources with two levels, (sodium selenate and <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite),</b> selenium rates with three levels, (0, 18 and 36 g. ha- 1) and two crop plant (wheat and barley). The result showed that, foliar application of wheat with 18 g. ha- 1 <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> increased the grains per spike by 9. 4 % as compared to control and foliar application of barley with 18 and 36 g. ha- 1 of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> increased the grains per spike by 8 and 12 %, as compared to control, respectively. Two times foliar applications of these two plants with sodium selenate and <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> increased their relative water content. Foliar application by 18 g/ha of selenium increased the grain yield from 1776. 31 kg. ha- 1 in control to 1889. 92 kg. ha- 1, while grain yield was decreased (about 1539. 62 kg. ha- 1) as compared to control when 36 g. ha- 1 of selenium was used.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> on neomycin ototoxicity in wild-type and transgenic zebrafish (Brn 3 C: EGFP). Five or six days post-fertilization, zebrafish larvae were co-exposed to 125 μM neomycin and various concentrations (10 μM, 100 μM, 250 μM, and 500 μM) of <b>sodium</b> <b>selenite</b> for 1 h.
