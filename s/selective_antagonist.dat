25|$|Ketamine {{acts as a}} <b>selective</b> <b>antagonist</b> of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptor. It binds {{specifically to}} the dizocilpine (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor, near the channel pore, and is an uncompetitive antagonist. Ketamine may also interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another allosteric site on the receptor. Its full mechanism of action is not well-understood as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a <b>selective</b> <b>antagonist</b> of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E

2500|$|Doxepin is {{a highly}} potent antihistamine, with this being its strongest activity. In fact, doxepin has been {{said to be the}} most or one of the most potent H1 {{receptor}} antagonists available, with one study finding an in vitro Ki of 0.17nM. It is the most potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist of the TCAs (although the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) mirtazapine is slightly more potent), and other sedating antihistamines, for instance the over-the-counter diphenhydramine (Ki = 16nM) and doxylamine (Ki = 42nM), show far lower affinities for this receptor in comparison. The affinity of doxepin for the H1 receptor is far greater than its affinity for other sites, and 10- to 100-fold higher doses are needed for antidepressant effects. In accordance, although it is often described as a [...] "dirty drug" [...] due to its highly promiscuous binding profile, doxepin acts as a highly <b>selective</b> <b>antagonist</b> of the H1 receptor at very low doses (less than 10mg; typically 3 to 6mg). At these doses, it notably has no clinically relevant anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth or cognitive/memory impairment, unlike most other sedating antihistamines, and similarly has no effect on other receptors such as adrenergic and serotonin receptors.|$|E
