5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit <b>stop</b> (<b>for</b> new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo.

Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E
5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station). It also served local trains from Fort Washington, Chestnut Hill, Bustleton, and Trenton, {{as well as a}} variety of {{services}} from the PRR-owned West Jersey and Seashore Railroad system. Within a decade of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design.|$|E

5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by a Porsche LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke bellowed {{out of the back of}} Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned slowly to the pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from co-driver Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
5|$|Gil de Ferran won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his lead throughout the race's first half.

5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5000|$|Choking is {{the number}} one reason for accidents, but {{chemicals}} such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness.

5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} {{most of the}} funds needed to construct the hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters {{had never seen the}} temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, very different from the red and white of the Great East Hall. This painting indicates that Foguang Temple was an important <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E

5|$|Cummings {{was among}} the first people {{accepted}} into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939. She completed an advanced aerobatics course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor. Having been recruited by Jacqueline Cochran, Cummings joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron in 1942, which soon became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). After graduating from training in Houston in May 1943, she served in World War II until the organization's deactivation in December 1944. During this time, {{she was a member of}} the 6th Ferrying Group out of Long Beach, California, eventually reaching the rank of First Lieutenant, and flew 18 different types of military aircraft.

Vettel made a pit <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> a second time on lap 33, prompting Rosberg to follow suit one lap later. Hamilton briefly held the lead, but made a pit stop as well soon after, emerging to set a new fastest lap of the race albeit emerging behind both Ferrari cars. Lap 36 saw a collision between Pastor Maldonado and Marcus Ericsson, but both drivers were able to continue the race. Two laps later, Maldonado was in another fight for position with the other Sauber of Felipe Nasr, moving ahead.
