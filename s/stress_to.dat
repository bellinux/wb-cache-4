5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E

5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Life on Earth {{seemed to}} recover quickly after the Permian extinctions, {{though this was}} mostly {{in the form of}} {{disaster}} taxa such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. Specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. Current research indicates that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction, which inhibited recovery, and to prolonged environmental <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> organisms that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> the casing.

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional <b>stress</b> <b>to</b> the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} how smoking and <b>stress</b> interact <b>to</b> affect the reactivity of the cardiovascular system. Findings revealed that subjects who smoked first {{and who were}} then exposed <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> showed less cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> compared <b>to</b> non-smoking subjects exposed only <b>to</b> <b>stress.</b> However, the combination of smoking and <b>stress</b> led <b>to</b> higher absolute levels and greater reactivity for all cardiovascular measures compared <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> alone. The ability for trait hostility, state angry affect and state anxious-affect to predict CVR <b>to</b> smoking and <b>stress</b> was also examined. State anxious-affect was the only affect-related variable that predicted CVR across experimental phases for both smokers and non-smokers. None of the affect-related variables were able to predict CVR during smoking. Trait hostility and state anxious-affect predicted CVR <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> for smokers and non-smokers. Trait hostility was negatively associated with CVR <b>to</b> <b>stress,</b> while state anxious-affect was positively associated with CVR <b>to</b> <b>stress.</b> State angry affect did not predict CVR <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> after accounting for the effects due to trait hostility...|$|R
