40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracks (SCC) {{had been}} found in a natural gas transmission pipeline during a dig-up and inspection program. The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a laboratory sample. If the crack tip of the active laboratory sample {{is similar to that of}} the <b>service</b> <b>pipe,</b> it means the crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> and the laboratory samples, it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.

40|$|Serious {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} {{in recent years in}} the Oil & Gas Industry about the reliability of Dissimilar Metal Welds (DMWs) in <b>sour</b> <b>service.</b> The primary reason for these concerns is because DMW joints exhibit small-localized hard zones that are susceptible to Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC). In the open literature some methods such as preheating have been suggested to overcome the problem of hard zone formation. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC) on the reliability (mechanical integrity) of DMWs specimens fabricated with different preheat temperatures and electrodes exposed to <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> environment. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Standard Tensile Test TM 01 - 77 - 96 Method A was used to determine the influence of SSC on DMWs in a systematic manner. Test results show considerable improvement in the Time-To- Failure as a result of the preheating methods used. However, it does not appear that the hard zones can be reliably eliminated for manual welding methods, even with the nickel-base electrode, and the optimum preheat temperature.

40|$|The amount, {{type and}} {{distribution}} of non-metallic inclusions {{as well as the}} solidification segregation, which influences inclusion type and distribution, have great influence on the performance of High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steels used in <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> in the oil industry. The effects of manganese, both on segregation and on steel cleanness have been studied through experiments and, to a lesser extent, through mathematical modeling of solidification. However, the effect of some other relevant elements added to these steels, in special those effects caused by solidification segregation, have not been extensively studied. In the present work, the extent of segregation and the probable effect on inclusion distribution of the main elements in HSLA steels used in <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> are evaluated through different computational thermodynamic models. In particular, two limiting cases bound the comparison: equilibrium solidification and the Scheil model, in which no homogenization in the solid phase is assumed. Special attention is given to silicon. For relevant compositions, models considering solid and liquid state diffusion are used. The results are compared with experimental data available for some steel compositions and serve as basis for a first evaluation of the alloy design strategy currently applied to these steels, {{from the point of view}} of segregation and internal cleanness...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} to sulfide {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SSC) of modified ASTM A 694 F 60 low alloy steel, produced by two different manufacturers, was studied by four-point bend-testing. The two materials are named material A and material B in this report. Both materials were tested in two different environments with different severity, one ?sweet-transition region? test and one ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test. The test conditions were controlled by the H 2 S partial pressure (pH 2 S) and pH. These parameters were varied in the two tests. Resistance to SSC was investigated on the base materials and on the thermal weld-simulated and notched materials. The thermal weld simulation was performed to provide the intercritically reheated CGHAZ, leading to a microstructure containing hard constituents. The tests were performed in autoclaves at room temperature with a pressure of 10 bars. The microstructure and Vickers hardness (HV) of both base materials and the heat affected zones were studied as these parameters affect the SSC susceptibility. The hardness of material B is higher than for material A and are respectively 249 &# 177; 2 HV and 214 &# 177; 5 HV. The hardness of the heat affected zone of the two materials are similar, both peaking at the center at about 400 HV. The microstructure of base material A mainly consists of bainite and ferrite/pearlite while material B mainly consists of acicular ferrite and bainite. The microstructure of the intercritically reheated CGHAZ is characterized by bainite laths among large prior austenite grain boundaries. At the grain boundaries, M-A constituents have crown in a ?necklace? formation. The base materials did not reveal cracking in the sweet-transition test, however, localized corrosion caused by CO 2 and H 2 S was found along the stressed side of the specimen. Base material B was more severely attacked than material A, based on the length and density of the corrosion pits. In the ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test, severe general and localized corrosion and cracking was observed in both base materials. The materials are therefore considered unsuitable for ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> applications. In the HAZ specimens, of both material A and B, severe cracking was observed in both tests. The specimens were fully separated by cracking in the ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test. The welded materials are therefore considered highly susceptible to SSC when a notch exists in the intercritically reheated CGHAZ. The HAZ hardness {{is higher than the}} maximum hardness requirement for SSC resistance at 248 HV. It would therefore be beneficial to perform additional testing of the HAZ, with a hardness level within the requirements. The cracking appeared as transgranular and was often initiated at the prior austenite grain boundaries, near the M-A constituents in the HAZ. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Socket welds are {{commonly}} used to assemble small-bore carbon steel process piping systems {{because they can be}} fabricated fairly quickly and are somewhat tolerant of field fit-up issues. In the most simplistic terms, these welds are made by inserting the pipe into a socket and then seal welding using gas tungsten arc welding around the gap between the outside pipe wall {{and the end of the}} fitting. This leaves a notch in the root of the seal weld that is open to the process fluid. This notch can act both as a stress riser and a crevice capable of concentrating chemical species. In many process applications, these socket weld notches do not cause any in-service problems. However, in the case of <b>sour</b> <b>service,</b> these notches can become problematic because of the potential for sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC). For SSCC to occur, the right combination of stress, environment, and material susceptibility must be present. Therefore, for socket welds to be used in <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> without the risk of failure, these parameters need to be controlled by proper design and fabrication of the welded joint. Since a crevice is created as a natural by-product of a socket weld geometry, where the SSCC environment will be present, the parameter most readily controlled to minimize susceptibility to SSCC is the microstructure and residual stress of the weld filler metal. As will be shown, this resistance to SSCC can b...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is a {{key issue}} for {{operators}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry since production fluids contain some water and both CO 2 and H 2 S acid gases. In this context, this paper illustrates the development of a reactive barrier polymer against corrosion by H 2 S of offshore flexible pipes. The role of this reactive material, called anti-H 2 S material, is to avoid H 2 S reaching the structural steel layers of the flexible pipe during the whole service life of the structure, usually 20  years, and hence to place the steel layers in a sweet service environment. Placed between the existing pressure sheath and the steel layers, the anti-H 2 S material has the ability to neutralize H 2 S during its diffusion within the material. The neutralization is ensured by an irreversible chemical reaction on reactive components that are dispersed in the material. The raw material selection is based on both accurate requirements for their use in a flexible pipe and expected performances in a <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> environment over a long period of time. Some laboratory qualifications and experimental techniques are used to qualify the behavior of the material and build the material database. A dedicated multiphysics model is developed based on the coupling of permeation mechanisms and gas-solid reactions.
