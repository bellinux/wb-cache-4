40|$|The fifth North American Intercomparison of Ultraviolet Monitoring <b>Spectroradiometers</b> {{was held}} June 13 to 21, 2003 at Table Mountain outside of Boulder, Colorado, USA. The {{main purpose of}} the Intercomparison {{was to assess the}} ability of <b>spectroradiometers</b> to {{accurately}} measure solar ultraviolet irradiance, and to compare the results between instruments of different monitoring networks. This Intercomparison was coordinated by NOAA and included participants from six national and international agencies. The UV measuring instruments included scanning <b>spectroradiometers,</b> spectrographs, and multi-filter radiometers. Synchronized spectral scans of the solar irradiance were performed between June 16 and 20, 2003. The spectral responsivities were determined for each instrument using the participants' lamps and calibration procedures and with NOAA/CUCF standard lamps. This paper covers the scanning <b>spectroradiometers</b> and the one spectrograph. The solar irradiance measurements from the different instruments were deconvolved using a high resolution extraterrestrial solar irradiance and reconvolved with a 1 -nm triangular band-pass to account for differences in the bandwidths of the instruments. The measured solar irradiance from the <b>spectroradiometers</b> using the rivmSHIC algorithm on a clear-sky day on DOY 172 at 17. 0 UTC (SZA = 30 o) had a relative 1 - standard deviation of +/- 2. 6 to 3. 4...|$|R

Three independent standards of spectral irradiance were scanned by both instruments under a range of bench conditions. The results were consistent to within about 3 %, most of the uncertainty being due to scattered light in the laboratory. An UV laser was used to determine the slit function of each spectrometer and the influence of internal stray light.

25|$|A {{comparison}} of GOES-12 satellite images shows {{the distribution of}} atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging <b>Spectroradiometer</b> (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles {{north and south of}} the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{have studied}} the {{characteristics}} of cirrus using several different methods. One, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried hygrometers give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure {{the depth of the}} cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) MODerate resolution Imaging <b>Spectroradiometer</b> (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth's infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the [...] "shadow" [...] it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.|$|E

Lightweight portable <b>spectroradiometers</b> offer an appropriate means of collecting MVA spectral reflectance factor data because they are more easily manoeuvrable than other <b>spectroradiometers,</b> but their physical capabilities have not yet been explored in this context. This letter presents the results of a focused experiment aimed at evaluating the field capabilities of a miniaturized Ocean Optics instrument in MVA settings for soil surface roughness applications. MVA hemispherical-conical reflectance factors were collected in situ from soil surfaces whose roughness was determined using a laser profiling survey.

Several commercially available <b>spectroradiometers</b> are currently used to retrieve SIF in the field. This study presents a comparison exercise for evaluating the capability of four <b>spectroradiometers</b> to retrieve SIF.
