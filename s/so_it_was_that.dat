5|$|Because of the {{condition}} of the northerly pass it was decided to leave divisional artillery to follow in the morning, guarded by the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades of the 5th Cavalry Division which entered the Esdraelon Plain on the morning of 20 September. Despite orders to the contrary, the 14th Cavalry Brigade advanced directly towards Afulah, the objective of the 4th Cavalry Division. Only the 13th Cavalry Brigade was therefore available to attack 5th Cavalry Division's objective at Nazareth. This brigade was not sufficiently strong to capture the town and the Yildirim Army Group headquarters and Liman von Sanders escaped. The next day, after the German and Ottoman garrison had retreated, Nazareth was occupied by the 13th Cavalry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E

25|$|Fighting was {{not limited}} to clan against clan. Because of his youth, Allan was {{vulnerable}} to being usurped by a Cameron cadet branch (distant family). Ewen Cameron of Erracht, uncle of the 14th chief of Clan Cameron, became suspect and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the 1580s, Donald's men, Cameron of Lochiel, murdered Ewan Cameron of Erracht in battle at Inverlochy Castle on behalf of young Allen, and retaining the line of hereditary succession for Camerons of Lochiel.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 19th {{century the}} five entrances had {{disappeared}} from the city, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> during this time the Wall of Trujillo was torn down and allowed {{the growth of the}} city. This urban expansion allowed the establishment of the neighborhoods of Chicago, La Unión and Pedro Muñiz. During the administration of Don Víctor Larco Herrera as mayor, the city began upgrading works such as the construction of City Hall, the arrangement and embellishment of the Plaza de Armas and the atrium of the Cathedral. It also built the road to the resort of Buenos Aires, which expanded the city urban planning perspective. Another project was the renovation of the Municipal Theater.|$|E
25|$|<b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> on 2 August 1907 the Act was passed, {{empowering}} the North British Railway to construct Methil no 3 Dock and associated railway connections; the NBR {{was required to}} complete {{it as soon as}} possible. Wemyss withdrew his Bill, and in 1908 the NBR let a contract to Robert McAlpine for the no 3 Dock. It was to be located east of the earlier docks and was undoubtedly very large. The single track crossing of the River Leven was to be widened to four tracks, and considerable additional sidings accommodation was to be provided. The railway facilities alone were to cost £50,000. As part of the scheme, Leven Harbour, already badly silted up, was closed.|$|E

25|$|The {{previous}} year, Caroline's daughter, Princess Charlotte, {{had married}} Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{and the future}} of the British monarchy looked bright. Then tragedy struck: in November 1817, Charlotte died after giving birth to her only child, a stillborn son. For the most part, Charlotte had been immensely popular with the public, and her death was a blow to the country. George refused to write to Caroline to inform her, leaving it for their son-in-law Leopold to do, but Leopold was deep in grief and delayed writing. George did, however, write to the pope of the tragedy, and by chance the courier carrying the letter passed by Pesaro, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Caroline heard the devastating news. Caroline had lost her daughter, but she had also lost any chance of regaining position through the succession of her daughter to the throne.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Laos {{moved toward}} {{independence}} from the French following World War II. Having {{paid little attention to}} fostering local government during their colonization of Laos, the French left a nation woefully short of expertise and leadership. Nor were the French successfully coping with a Lao communist insurrection sponsored by the Vietnamese communists at the time they left Laos. However, the United States, which had assumed an ever greater burden of funding the Royal Lao Government, assumed the counter-insurgency effort against the communists. The resultant Laotian Civil War predated the Vietnam War; unlike in Vietnam, the Laotian war had to be fought under an assumption of secrecy because of the existence of an international treaty, the Geneva Conference (1954). <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Central Intelligence Agency came to support and wage the Lao counter-insurgency.|$|E
25|$|Gandhiji {{stayed in}} the Ashram {{and spoke to the}} volunteers. He tried to boost up their morale, by {{explaining}} to them the principle of Satyagraha and the role of scarifies and suffering in it, and the need for extreme patience. He tried to reach a compromise with the orthodoxy and for this; he had to meet the Savarna leaders. His secretary sent a note of invitation to the Savarna leader Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri to come over to the camp. The haughty Namboothiri not only refused to accept the invitation, but also said that those who wanted to see him must go over to his house. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Gandhiji and his party reached the Indanthuruthil Mana (a Namboothiri household) on the next day noon. They were made to sit in the portico of the house, while the Namboothiri and his Savarna comrades occupied the inner room. The Namboothiri believed that Gandhi and his followers were polluted by the touch of untouchables, and could not be admitted into the pure interior of an orthodox Mana.|$|E

25|$|The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who {{saw that}} he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a {{prisoner}} to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-Pharazôn, urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on Ilúvatar for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.|$|E
