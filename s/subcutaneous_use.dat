40|$|AbstractMassive {{subcutaneous}} emphysema is {{a relatively}} common complication in invasive techniques, surgical practice and some medical conditions. Subcutaneous emphysema is usually treated conservatively and may only cause minimal symptoms. Even when it is severe, subcutaneous emphysema rarely has pathophysiologic consequences, but it is extremely uncomfortable for the patient. The authors report a case of massive and rapid developing subcutaneous emphysema following chest tube displacement in a patient with spontaneous secondary pneumothorax and large air leak. The emphysema was treated with two <b>subcutaneous</b> drains, inserted <b>using</b> local anesthesia, {{on both sides of}} the chest (antero-superior thoracic wall), connected to drainage bags. The drains produced a dramatic clinical improvement and provided effective decompression of the subcutaneous emphysema.

Evaluation of license status (CH, F, D and UK) and systematic literature review of 34 drugs used in the geriatric setting. Results: Subcutaneous route is used daily with drugs and fluids mostly for patients in palliative care (83 %) or who are dehydrated (54 %) when oral or IV administration is impossible (73 %, 68 % respectively). Morphine (98 %), haloperidol (90 %), furosemide (69 %) and hydromorphone (56 %) by bolus (36 %) or slow injection over 5 min (82 %) are the main drugs used and NaCI 0. 9 % (95 %), and glucose 5 %/NaCI 0. 9 % (31 %) are commonly used for rehydration.

Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of a 16 % immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparation intended for <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>use</b> were investigated in patients with common variable immunodeficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinaemia. SCIG infusions (200 mg/kg body weight) were administered to 12 adult patients every 14 days for 24 weeks (total of 144 infusions). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on serum IgG trough levels and antibody levels against tetanus. The median half-life of the total serum IgG and for the tetanus antibodies was 40 · 6 and 23 · 3 days respectively. Median in vivo recovery of serum IgG and tetanus immunoglobulins were 36 % and 46 % respectively.

40|$|Objective To obtain {{information}} on tick paralysis in dogs, including {{the nature of}} disease, host signalment, tick-host relationship, treatment, disease progression and recovery, and preventive measures. Design A prospective survey of 577 dogs affected by tick paralysis was conducted during 1998. Forty-two veterinary clinics along the eastern coast of Australia were instructed to complete survey forms for the first 15 dogs that presented with tick paralysis during September to November. Results Five percent of dogs died from tick paralysis. Younger dogs {{were more likely to}} survive. Long coat length was associated with a greater tick burden but not greater tick size, whereas coat thickness had no bearing on either. Dogs with mild disease recovered more quickly from tick paralysis. Respiratory and gait scores reflected disease severity and were good prognostic indicators. The size of the tick did not reflect the severity of the clinical condition it induced in the host. No method of tick removal or in situ treatment improved recovery time or reduced mortality. However, the time spent in hospital was significantly less for dogs from which the live tick was manually removed. Inspiratory strider. evident in some dogs with tick paralysis, was not related to tick attachment on the neck. The use of acepromazine maleate or dexamethasone did not reduce recovery time or mortality. Increasing the dose of tick antitoxin serum (TAS) above 0. 1 mL/kg had no effect on mortality or recovery time. Dogs with severe disease that received an additional dose of TAS were significantly less likely to survive. <b>Subcutaneous</b> <b>use</b> of TAS at the site of tick attachment was of no benefit in reducing mortality or time to initial clinical improvement.

40|$|Twenty-two adult {{patients}} with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia {{were treated with}} a regimen consisting of an initial priming dose of hydroxyurea for the first induction course, followed by intermittent courses of cytosine arabinoside, given subcutaneously, and thioguanine. Fifteen of these patients achieved a remission; 9 were complete and 6 partial. The median survival time from diagnosis for all patients was 21. 5 weeks, the median remission time was 15 weeks, and the median survival time for those patients who responded to therapy was 34 weeks. Toxic effects were generally not severe, the most disturbing being nausea and vomiting. The <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>use</b> of cytosine arabinoside was well tolerated by the patients and gave results comparable to those reported in series where it was given intravenously. This study confirms the experience of others that cytosine arabinoside in combination with another drug gives better results than when used alone. T H E FIRST significant advance {{in the treatment of}} adult acute leukemia occurred when 6 -mercapto-purine was introduced in 1953 (1). Since then a number of new agents with proved effectiveness in some patients has become available. One of the more successful of these is cytosine arabinoside. This agent, given singly, is capable of inducing remissions in both childhood and adult acute leukemia, with a median remission rate of approximately 25 % to 30 % (2, 3). In a further attempt to improve re-sponses in adults more recent studies have been directed at the use of cytosine arabinoside in com-bination with other agents (4, 5). Burchenal and Dollinger (6) showed that the therapeutic effects of cytosine arabinoside and purine analogs were additive in mice with L 1210 leukemia, and Gee, Yu, and Clarkson (7) published a series of cases of adult acute leukemia in which a remission rate of 55 % was achieved with the combination of cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine.

40|$|Nine rabbits were immunized {{with type}} A {{influenza}} virions and the epitope specificities {{of the secondary}} serum haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody response were analysed with a panel of neutralizing monoclonal (MAb) antibody double escape mutants. Each of the latter was made by sequential selection using a MAb directed to an epitope of a discrete antigenic site, site A, site B or site D, of the haemagglutinin (HA). Thus the epitope reactivity of the escape mutants was represented as A(+) B(-) D(-), A(-) B(+) D(-) and A(-) B(-) D(+). The HI antibody response of all antisera was biased to the site B epitope. In 9 / 12 antisera, obtained from seven rabbits immunized with whole virions, the site B epitope was predominant, representing 65 - 82 % of the total HI antibody. The restriction of HI antibody was unaffected by strain of rabbit, route of inoculation (intravenous or <b>subcutaneous),</b> <b>use</b> of Freund's adjuvant, and up to four immunizing injections. In 3 / 7 rabbits immunized with whole virus, there was a HI antibody response to the HC 2 (site A) or HC 10 (site D) epitope, but not both, of equal magnitude to the site B epitope. The HI antibody response {{in one of the}} rabbits (# 40) became more biased to the site B epitope between the third and fourth immunizing doses. Two further rabbits were immunized with virions which had been partially digested with bromelain and then purified from free HA. Both of these made equal HI antibody responses to the site B epitope and the site D epitope, possibly because their remaining HA spikes were better exposed. Overall, these data demonstrate an unexpected degree of restriction in the production of biologically relevant antibody, such that some rabbits (e. g. # 45) mount an HI antibody response which is essentially epitope-specific. Implications for epitope specificity of HI antibody stimulated by human influenza vaccines, and also for the generation of antigenic drift variants are discussed. The reason for the non-responsiveness of the immune system to the many other HI epitopes of the HA is not known...|$|E

Methods: One hundred and seven RA patients treated with biological agents for intravenous or <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>use,</b> 35 biologic-naïve RA patients treated with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and 30 rheumatology HPs (physicians and nurses) were recruited from two outpatient clinics in Copenhagen, Denmark. All subjects filled out a questionnaire interrogating their choice of preferred route and frequency of administration of a biologic corresponding to current available options, given that effects, adverse effects, and financial costs were identical for the different choices. The subjects {{were also asked to}} justify their preferences. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to examine the distributions over different preferences. Proportions were compared using Fisher&# 39;s exact test. Results: Forty-one patients were currently treated with subcutaneous self-injections at home (SCH) and 66 intravenously at the clinic (IVC). IVC was preferred by 85 % of patients currently treated with IVC (P< 0. 0001). SCH was preferred by 71 % of patients currently treated with SCH (P< 0. 001), by 77 % of the biologic-naïve patients (P< 0. 01), and by 87 % of HPs (P< 0. 0001). The proportion of patients favoring SCH was significantly higher for patients currently receiving SCH and for biologic-naïve RA patients than for those currently on IVC (P< 0. 0001). SCH once a month and IVC every 8 weeks were the most appealing treatment frequencies (P< 0. 01). The most frequent reason among patients for choosing IVC or SCH was a wish for safety, and a wish to minimize the time of transportation and treatment, respectively. Conclusion: The majority of RA patients treated with biologics preferred their current route of administration. Most patients, those inexperienced with biologics, and HPs favored SCH.

Methods: In order to analyze the impact of subcutaneous administrations for rituximab or trastuzumab {{in comparison to the}} respective intravenous mode a primary research in Italy was executed. The study’s primary objectives were to analyze the resource and cost implications from different perspectives (patient, medical staff) in the real world. The route of administration was discussed and aligned with the participating centers in order to capture all relevant therapy parts. After the successful execution of a pilot study 19 centers in six regions in Italy were recruited to participate. Results: Significant time savings might be achieved with the subcutaneous mode through significantly lower patient preparation time including less time preparing the actual dosing for each individual patient. The total time difference is 3. 3 hours with rituximab in hematology (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), which adds up to 23. 55 hours for a full course of treatment per patient (overall preparation time: 40. 1 hours intravenous [95 % confidence interval (CI) : ± 0. 47] vs 16. 6 hours subcutaneous [95 % CI: ± 0. 2]). In early breast cancer (trastuzumab), the time saving might be 3. 3 hours for the first cycle and the total time saving for patient preparation might be 17. 2 hours (overall preparation time: 38. 8 hours intravenous [95 % CI: ± 9. 42] vs 21. 6 hours subcutaneous [95 % CI: ± 9. 9]). Furthermore, in both settings, the time of medical staff was reduced and could hence be used elsewhere. Finally, in case wastage was experienced with intravenous therapies, there were potential significant reductions in wastage through the subcutaneous administration (93 %– 100 %) with cost savings of € 6, 057 with rituximab subcutaneous and € 28, 399 with trastuzumab subcutaneous administration for the full treatment course.

40|$|Background Asthma is a {{respiratory}} (airway) {{condition that}} affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and {{is associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is called an 'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add-on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids. Objectives To assess the effects of omalizumab versus placebo or conventional therapy for asthma in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials for potentially relevant studies. The most recent search was performed in June 2013. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and searched online trial registries and drug company websites. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials examining anti-IgE administered in any manner for any duration. Trials with co-interventions were included, {{as long as they}} were the same in each arm. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data. Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous and subcutaneous injection. The main focus of the updated review is subcutaneous administration, as this route is currently used in clinical practice. Subgroup analysis was performed by asthma severity. Data were extracted from published and unpublished sources. Main results In all, 25 trials were included in the review, including 11 new studies since the last update, for a total of 19 that considered the efficacy of subcutaneous anti-IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids. For participants with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) therapy, a significant advantage favoured subcutaneous omalizumab with regard to experiencing an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 42 to 0. 60; ten studies, 3261 participants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26 % for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16 % on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo with regard to reducing hospitalisations (OR 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 42; four studies, 1824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3 % with placebo to 0. 5 % with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. No separate data on hospitalisations were available for the severe asthma subgroup, and all of these data were reported for participants with the diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab were also significantly more likely to be able to withdraw their ICS completely than those treated with placebo (OR 2. 50, 95 % CI 2. 00 to 3. 13), and a small but statistically significant reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose was reported for omalizumab-treated participants compared with those given placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) - 118 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent per day, 95 % CI - 154 to - 84). However, no significant difference between omalizumab and placebo treatment groups was seen in the number of participants who were able to withdraw from oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (OR 1. 18, 95 % CI 0. 53 to 2. 63). Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids required a small but significant reduction in rescue beta 2 -agonist medication compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) - 0. 39 puffs per day, 95 % CI - 0. 55 to - 0. 24; nine studies, 3524 participants). This benefit was observed in both the moderate to severe (MD - 0. 58, 95 % CI - 0. 84 to - 0. 31) and severe (MD - 0. 30, 95 % CI - 0. 49 to - 0. 10) asthma subgroups on a background therapy of inhaled corticosteroids; however, no significant difference between subcutaneous omalizumab and placebo was noted for this outcome in participants with severe asthma who were receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer serious adverse events were reported in participants assigned to subcutaneous omalizumab than in those receiving placebo (OR 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 57 to 0. 91; 15 studies, 5713 participants), but more injection site reactions were observed (from 5. 6 % with placebo to 9. 1 % with omalizumab). To reflect current clinical practice, discussion of the results is limited to <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>use,</b> and trials involving intravenous and inhaled routes have been archived. Authors' conclusions Omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalisations as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled steroids and during steroid tapering phases of clinical trials. Omalizumab was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their inhaled steroids. Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, although more injection site reactions were seen with omalizumab. Further assessment in paediatric populations is necessary, as is direct double-dummy comparison with ICS. Although subgroup analyses suggest that participants receiving prednisolone had better asthma control when they received omalizumab, it remains to be tested prospectively whether the addition of omalizumab has a prednisolone-sparing effect. It is also not clear whether there is a threshold level of baseline serum IgE for optimum efficacy of omalizumab. Given the high cost of the drug, identification of biomarkers predictive of response is of major importance for future research...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The {{alarming}} {{report by}} Hamilton and colleagues of 12 deaths associated with rapid opioid detoxification (ROD) <b>using</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> naltrexone implants contrasts dramatically with our experience in Perth, Western Australia, and may exaggerate {{the risks associated}} with this procedure. However, the report does raise important questions about the ancillary care provided to opiate-dependent individuals undergoing such therapy...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} the antiangiogenic drug TNP- 470 on rat urinary bladder carcinogenesis were investigated in F 344 male rats initiated with 0. 05 % BBN in the drinking water for 8 weeks. Group 1 was then continuously treated with TNP- 470 by <b>subcutaneous</b> injection <b>using</b> osmotic minipump {{until the end of}} the experiment; group 2 served as the control with only initiation. The incidences and multiplicities of papillomas and carcinomas in the TNP- 470 -treated group were significantly decreased compared to the control group values along with the tumor vascular density. In conclusion, TNP- 470 can inhibit rat urinary bladder carcinogenesis, presumably through its effects on angiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Vesicostomy {{prolapse}} is {{a frequent}} complication of an unusual surgical technique in adult patients. We have described a surgical technique to repair a vesicostomy prolapse <b>using</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> tubulisation of thick cutaneous flap taken off the abdominal wall. This technique could help surgeons to cure prolapse of vesicostomy in case of impossible intraperitoneal approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Male {{circumcision}} {{is among}} the most frequent surgical interventions throughout history. Although considered as a minor intervention, it may have complications ranging from insignificant to catastrophic. These complications {{can be attributed to the}} surgical procedure and anesthesia. In this report we present two cases of scrotal skin necrosis after lidocaine with epinephrine injection <b>using</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> ring block technique prior to circumcision...|$|R
50|$|The first {{parenteral}} administration {{was given by}} the Egyptian doctor Tortoulis Bey, personal physician to the Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt. He had been <b>using</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> injections of creosote for tuberculosis. In 1894 he administered subcutaneous injection of chaulmoogra oil to a 36-year-old Egyptian Copt who {{had been unable to}} tolerate oral treatment. After 6 years and 584 injections, the patient was declared cured.|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} presented a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based viscometric sensor for continuous glucose monitoring using protein Concanavalin A (Con A). To address its drawbacks, including immunotoxicity and instability issues, we have synthesized stable, biocompatible copolymers poly(acrylamide-ran- 3 -acrylami-dophenylboronic acid) (PAA-ran-PAAPBA) for viscosity based glucose sensing. We found that PAA-ran-PAAPBA showed very high binding specificity to glucose. Several key {{factors such as}} polymer compositions, polymer molecular weights and polymer concentrations have been investigated to optimize viscometric responses. This polymer is able to detect glucose under physiological pH conditions in a reversible manner. Therefore, {{it has the potential}} to enable a highly reliable, continuous monitoring of glucose in <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue <b>using</b> the MEMS device...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{most common}} skin lesions in small animals result from trauma, burns, or {{surgical}} resection of large tumors. Given the high importance of reconstructive surgery associated with tumors in small animals, this study reports four cases of reconstructive surgery <b>using</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> and axial tubular flaps in animals with neoplastic lesions. Subdermal and axial tubular flaps are healthy alternatives for reconstructing wounds caused by large tumor resection {{in areas with}} poor tissue elasticity...|$|R
