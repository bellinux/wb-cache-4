(Porter, Trust in Numbers, 1995, p. 152) Science as I {{have known it}} and practiced it {{over the years has}} {{had little to do with}} Washington D. C. I learned early in my academic career that the Reagan administration was not interested in funding my feminist critical qualitative research. I have stayed away from grants and grant culture ever since, doing what might be termed “little science ” with little money and getting by just fine. But over the last year or so, I have found myself sucked into an alphabet soup of OERI, NRC, DOE, NSF, Senate Subcommittees on this or that, even something dubbed “web <b>scubbing</b> ” where the U. S. Department of Education is deleting research, including ERIC digests, that it deems unsupportive of Bush administrative agendas. 1 This paper is an effort to make sense of the Federal government’s incursion into legislating scientific method in the realm of educational research via the “evidence-based ” movement of the last few years.

5000|$|Eureka Seven {{takes place}} in the year 12005 and it's now been 10,000 years after {{humanity}} has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the <b>Scub</b> Coral (Sukabu Kōraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the <b>Scub</b> Coral. The <b>Scub</b> Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the <b>Scub</b> Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the <b>Scub</b> is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the <b>Scub</b> Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the <b>Scub</b> Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (Kōrarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are: ...|$|R
40|$|Synonymous codon usage bias (<b>SCUB)</b> is {{a common}} event that a {{non-uniform}} usage of codons often occurs in nearly all organisms. We previously found that <b>SCUB</b> is correlated with both intron number and exon position in the plant nuclear genome {{but not in the}} plastid genome; <b>SCUB</b> in both nuclear and plastid genome can mirror the evolutionary specialization. However, how about the rules in the mitochondrial genome has not been addressed. Here, we present an analysis of <b>SCUB</b> in the mitochondrial genome, based on 24 plant species ranging from algae to land plants. The frequencies of NNA and NNT (A- and T-ending codons) are higher than those of NNG and NNC, with the strongest preference in bryophytes and the weakest in land plants, suggesting an association between <b>SCUB</b> and plant evolution. The preference for NNA and NNT is more evident in genes harboring a greater number of introns in land plants, but the bias to NNA and NNT exhibits even among exons. The pattern of <b>SCUB</b> in the mitochondrial genome differs in some respects to that present in both the nuclear and plastid genomes...|$|R
40|$|Most {{amino acids}} are encoded by {{multiple}} triplets of nucleotides (i. e., synonymous codons) that {{differ in the}} third codon position (1) or rarely in the second codon position (2). Usage of synonymous codons for a given amino acid is not at equal frequencies both with-in and between genomes (2 - 5). Different organisms exhibit species specific preference towards a subset of synonymous codons for coding particular amino acids (3, 6). This non random usage of synonymous codons is referred as <b>SCUB</b> and is an essential characteristic of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes (2). Though synonymous mutations are generally neu-tral or silent due to no change in amino acid sequence, <b>SCUB</b> are reported to have profound effects on gene expression and function (7 - 10). Population genetic studies suggested that mutational biases due to nucleotide compositional constraints or weak selection on specific codons might be contributing to <b>SCUB</b> (10 - 12). Many studies confirmed that <b>SCUB</b> is higher in genomic regions on which substantial purifying selection acts at amino acid level (10 - 13). Highly expressed genes experience stronger <b>SCUB</b> than genes with low expression (4). Moreover, evolutionarily con-served protein coding regions show stronger <b>SCUB</b> (14).

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{has been}} {{assembled}} to suggest synonymous codon usage bias (<b>SCUB)</b> has {{close relationship with}} intron. However, the relationship (if any) between <b>SCUB</b> and intron number as well as exon position is at present rather unclear. Results To explore this relationship, the sequences {{of a set of}} genes containing between zero and nine introns was extracted from the published genome sequences of three algal species, one moss, one fern and six angiosperms (three monocotyledonous species and three dicotyledonous species). In the algal genomes, the frequency of synonymous codons of the form NNG/NNC (codons with G and C at the third position) was positively related to intron number, but that of NNA/NNT was inversely correlated; the opposite {{was the case in the}} land plant genomes. The frequency of NNC/NNG was higher and that of NNA/NNT lower in two terminal exons than in the interstitial exons in the land plant genes, but the rule showed to be opposite in the algal genes. <b>SCUB</b> patterns in the interstitial and two terminal exons mirror the different evolutionary relationships between these plant species, while the first exon shows the highest level of conservation is therefore concluded to be the one which experiences the heaviest selection pressure. The phenomenon of <b>SCUB</b> may also be related to DNA methylation induced conversion of CG to AT. Conclusions These data provide some evidence of linkage between <b>SCUB,</b> the evolution of introns and DNA methylation, which brings about a new perspective for understanding how genomic variation is created during plant evolution. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In Eureka Seven, as {{a result}} of the <b>Scub</b> Coral {{covering}} the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (Toransaparansu Raito Pātikuru), dubbed Trapar (Torapā) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the <b>Scub</b> Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.|$|R

30|$|Dhanani et al. [20] compare utility-based {{information}} management policies in sensor networks. Here, the considered resource is information or data, and two models are distinguished: the sensor-centric utility-based model (<b>SCUB)</b> and the resource manager (RM) model. <b>SCUB</b> follows a distributed approach that instructs individual sensors {{to make their}} own decisions about what sensor information should be reported based on a utility model for data. RM is a consolidated approach that takes into account knowledge from all sensors before making decisions. They evaluate these policies through simulation in the context of dynamically deployed sensor networks in military scenarios. Both <b>SCUB</b> and RM can extend the lifetime of a network as compared to a network without maintaining any policy. Peng et al. [21] propose a reliable multi-cast protocol, called CodePipe, with energy efficiency, high throughput and fairness in lossy wireless networks. Building upon opportunistic routing and random linear network coding, CodePipe can not only eliminate coordination between nodes but also improve the multi-cast throughput significantly by exploiting both intra-batch and inter-batch coding opportunities.|$|R

5000|$|Antibody Coralians are, as {{the name}} suggests, creatures created by the <b>Scub</b> Coral to destroy {{anything}} nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the <b>Scub</b> Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can {{range in size from}} as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it(unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the <b>Scub</b> Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z.|$|R

As a result, energetically efficient modes of locomotion provide an advantage during periods of submergence and will presumably increase in importance as the animals perform progressively longer dives. To {{determine the effect of}} a limited oxygen supply on locomotor performance, we compared the kinematics and behavior of swimming and diving bottlenose dolphins. Adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were trained to swim horizontally near the water surface or submerged at 5 m and to dive to depths ranging from 12 to 112 m. Swimming kinematics (preferred swimming mode, stroke frequency and duration of glides) were monitored using submersible video cameras (Sony Hi- 8) held by <b>SCUB...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{results from}} sensitive, wide-field imaging of the {{millimeter}} extragalactic background using the Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer array (MAMBO) at the IRAM 30 m telescope. The detection of a far-infrared and sub-millimeter wavelength background by COBE, {{and the first}} sensitive, high-resolution SCUBA images of the sub-mm background have caused significant revisions of our picture of the star-formation history of the universe. SCUBA at 850 µm discovered a population of {{what appear to be}} star forming galaxies at high redshifts, most of which are invisible at optical and near-IR wavelengths (Smail et al. 1997; Hughes et al. 1998; Barger et al. 1999; Eales et al. 1999; Bertoldi et al. 2000). The infrared luminosities of these objects are comparable to the bolometric luminosities of QSOs, but their optical faintness shows that, unlike for QSOs, nearly all of the bolometric luminosity arises from thermal emission of dust grains. The emitting dust is probably heated in massive, optically obscured star forming regions, with star formation rates ∼ 10 3 M⊙yr − 1. The objects discovered with <b>SCUB...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} {{is a collection}} of abstract classes that provides an infrastructure common to a family of applications. The design of the framework fixes certain roles and responsibilities amongst the classes, as well as standard protocols for their collaboration. The variability within the family of applications is factored into so-called "hotspots", and the framework provides simple mechanisms to customize each hotspot. Customizing is typically done by subclassing an existing class of the framework and overriding a small number of methods. Sometimes, however, the framework insists that the customization preserves a protocol of collaboration between several subclasses, so customization requires the parallel development of these subclasses and certain of their methods. A framework exists to support the development of a family of applications. Typically a {{framework is}} developed by expert designers who have a deep knowledge of the application domain and long experience of software design. On the other hand, a typical application developer who reuses the framework is less experienced and less knowledgeable of the domain. However, a framework is not an easy thing to understand when one first uses it: the design is very abstract, to factor out commonality; the design is incomplete, requiring additional subclasses to create an application; the design provides flexibility for several hotspots, not all of which are needed in the application at hand; and the collaborations and the resulting dependencies between classes can be indirect and obscure. The large learning curve faced by the first-time user of a framework is a serious impediment to successfully reaping the benefits of reuse. How can an organization address this problem? This thesis presents a simple game framework, called S <b>scUB,</b> as a case study for the documentation of frameworks and for the development of frameworks in C++...|$|R
