A <b>spittoon</b> of 15th century vintage and also hand drawn plan of the palaces are seen in the museum.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{considered}} rude to spit out wine at a winery, even {{in the presence of}} the wine maker or owner. Generally, a <b>spittoon</b> will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.|$|E
50|$|Brass was {{the most}} common {{material}} for spitoons. Other materials used for mass production of <b>spittoons</b> ranged from basic functional iron to elaborately crafted cut glass and fine porcelain. At higher class places like expensive hotels, <b>spittoons</b> could be elaborately decorated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spittoons</b> {{were also}} useful for people {{suffering}} from tuberculosis who would cough up phlegm. Public <b>spittoons</b> would sometimes contain a solution of an antiseptic such as carbolic acid {{with the aim of}} limiting transmission of disease. With the start of the 20th century medical doctors urged tuberculosis sufferers to use personal pocket <b>spittoons</b> instead of public ones; these were jars with tight lids which people could carry with them to spit into. Similar devices are still used by some with tuberculosis.|$|R

25|$|Chewing {{tobacco is}} the oldest way of {{consuming}} tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, {{which led to the}} development of the <b>spittoon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Royal Utensils (เครื่องราชูปโภค) is a {{separate}} category of items. The four items are made of gold: the Betel Nut Set (พานพระขันหมาก), the Water Urn (พระมณฑปรัตนกรัณฑ์), the Libation vessel (พระสุพรรณราช), and the <b>Spittoon</b> (พระสุพรรณศรี). By possessing such mundane items, which were all made from precious materials, the king can show off his wealth and status to his subjects. The utensils are always placed at {{either side of the}} king's throne during royal ceremonies. These items are of a personal natur, and are regarded as insignia of rank, not just for the king, but for his officials as well. Once an individual is given high rank by the king, a replica set of these items would be given to him on the occasion of his promotion.|$|E

500|$|She {{developed}} a contentious relationship with Queen Emma of Hawaii, {{the widow of}} Kamehameha IV and {{a close friend of}} Lunalilo. According to one of Emma's letters, an elderly palace attendant Waiaha and several other older women had given Lunalilo a [...] "piece of bananannah [...] stalk pressed to drink, medicated with love potions, to produce intense affections for Eliza Meek". Along with a group of Lunalilo's personal attendants and relatives (including his chamberlain and Eliza's brother-in-law Horace Crabbe), Eliza was present during the king's final months of illness. During this period, Eliza was notoriously hostile to Emma, who occasionally visited the ailing King to help nurse him. According to Dr. Georges Phillipe Trousseau, the King's personal physician, Lunalilo would have married Emma {{had it not been for}} Eliza's interference. Eliza would refuse to leave Emma alone with Lunalilo even at the king's command. One night, in a fit of rage, Lunalilo threw a chair and a <b>spittoon</b> at Eliza's head after an argument with between the two. Emma recounted the instance in a letter to her cousin Peter Kaʻeo: ...|$|E

Olive dances to Popeye. Popeye gives Olive her [...] "bouquet" [...] (which consists of only one flower) and Olive dances away with a leap. Olive's feet gets stuck into two <b>spittoons.</b> While Olive struggles {{to get out of}} the <b>spittoons,</b> Popeye is laughing. Olive, determined to get even, performs a fancy dance. Afterwards, the people in the tavern applaud to Olive's act.|$|R
2500|$|Following this, Blanc {{became a}} very {{prominent}} vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing {{a wide variety}} of the [...] "Looney Tunes" [...] characters. Bugs Bunny, whom Blanc made his debut as in A Wild Hare (1940), was known for eating carrots frequently (especially while saying his catchphrase [...] "Eh, what's up, doc?"). To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a <b>spittoon.</b> One oft-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots, which Blanc denied.|$|E
2500|$|Many other {{countries}} were blockaded from trading with the American colonies during the American Revolution and, as such, turned to other resources for their tobacco. [...] Many of these {{other countries}} never resumed trade with the newly formed United States so this portion of trade was permanently lost. [...] What did grow, however, was the consumption of tobacco in the United States and a new desire for tobacco grew in Germany and Russia post Revolution. American tobacco customs began to switch from the earlier pipe smoke to the cigar as mentioned earlier, {{as well as the}} great American western icon of the <b>spittoon,</b> which was linked to chewing tobacco. [...] These latter two were considered a more coarse form of taking tobacco and, as such, were deemed very [...] "American" [...] in nature by Europeans as spitting was a trait attributed to their usage. [...] Americans also enjoyed the flavor of island tobacco more, but since many smokers in the USA were not wealthy, working farmers took to smoking tobacco grown from their own land. [...] This may also have come more from the American desire to be independent, not only in a legal sense by being a free-nation, but economically as well.|$|E

60|$|In a vast marble-paved hall, {{under the}} glare of an {{electric}} light, sat forty or fifty men, and for their use and amusement were provided <b>spittoons</b> of infinite capacity and generous gape. Most of the men wore frock-coats and top-hats--the things that we in India put on at a wedding-breakfast, if we possess them--but they all spat. They spat on principle. The <b>spittoons</b> were on the staircases, in each bedroom--yea, and in chambers even more sacred than these. They chased one into retirement, but they blossomed in chiefest splendor round the bar, {{and they were all}} used, every reeking one of them.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century United States and Australia <b>spittoons</b> became {{a very common}} feature of pubs, brothels, saloons, hotels, stores, banks, railway carriages, and other places where people (especially adult men) gathered.|$|R
50|$|Resembling an old eatery (’kopi tiam’), this setup comes {{complete}} with a cashier’s counter, stools, tables, mirrors, ashtrays, matchboxes, chopsticks, <b>spittoons,</b> coffee cups {{and a collection of}} soft drinks. The drinks here are not for sale.|$|R
60|$|Entering {{one of the}} stores, {{they found}} {{a group of men}} sitting about the stove, smoking, chatting, and {{spitting}} aimlessly into a huge <b>spittoon</b> made of boards and filled with sawdust. Each man suspended smoking and talking as the strangers entered.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} {{for some time}} in the smoking-room, broken only by the crisp rattle of the cards, as the man Muller shuffled them up before {{replacing}} them in his pocket. He still seemed to be somewhat flushed and irritable. Throwing the end of his cigar into the <b>spittoon,</b> he glanced defiantly at his companion and turned towards me.|$|E
60|$|The {{smile of}} {{satisfaction}} that went around his audience--an audience quick {{to seize the}} weakness of any performance--might have startled a vanity less oblivious than Hooker's; but it only aroused Brant's indignation and pity, and made his position still more intolerable. But Hooker, scornfully expectorating a thin stream of tobacco juice against the <b>spittoon,</b> remained for an instant gloomily silent.|$|E
50|$|A {{large public}} {{collection}} of <b>spittoons</b> {{can be found}} at Duke Homestead State Historic Site, Durham, North Carolina. In 2008, the site's tobacco museum added 282 spittoons—claimed to be the world's largest collection—to its holdings of over 100.|$|R
50|$|The 1954 makeover {{was also}} used to {{eliminate}} some 20 brass <b>spittoons</b> which had adorned the courthouse's hallways and offices since its original construction. These were replaced with four modern sand urns for the disposal of cigarette butts.|$|R
60|$|They {{went down}} to the rotunda floor together. The {{electric}} lights flooded the brilliant marbles with a dazzling light. Groups of men were gathered around <b>spittoons,</b> talking earnestly, gesticulating with fists and elaborate broad-hand, free-arm movements--political gestures, as Bradley recognized.|$|R
60|$|The colonel led the {{way into}} {{a room at the}} back of the house upon the ground-floor, light, and of fair dimensions, but exquisitely uncomfortable; having nothing in it but the four cold white walls and ceiling, a mean carpet, a dreary waste of dining-table {{reaching}} from end to end, and a bewildering collection of cane-bottomed chairs. In the further region of this banqueting-hall was a stove, garnished on either side with a great brass <b>spittoon,</b> and shaped in itself like three little iron barrels set up on end in a fender, and joined together on the principle of the Siamese Twins. Before it, swinging himself in a rocking-chair, lounged a large gentleman with his hat on, who amused himself by spitting alternately into the <b>spittoon</b> on the right hand of the stove, and the <b>spittoon</b> on the left, and then working his way back again in the same order. A negro lad in a soiled white jacket was busily engaged in placing on the table two long rows of knives and forks, relieved at intervals by jugs of water; and as he travelled down one side of this festive board, he straightened with his dirty hands the dirtier cloth, which was all askew, and had not been removed since breakfast. The atmosphere of this room was rendered intensely hot and stifling by the stove; but being further flavoured by a sickly gush of soup from the kitchen, and by such remote suggestions of tobacco as lingered within the brazen receptacles already mentioned, it became, to a stranger's senses, almost insupportable.|$|E
60|$|The young officer {{leans against}} the bar, and listens to stories by Mr. Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear. He smokes Mr. Hopper's cigar and drinks his whiskey. And Eliphalet understands that the good Lord put some fools into the world {{in order to give}} the smart people a chance to {{practise}} their talents. Mr. Hopper neither drinks nor smokes, but he uses the <b>spittoon</b> with more freedom in this atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|After a full {{enjoyment}} of this joke, Mr Hannibal Chollop sat smoking {{and improving the}} circle, without making any attempts either to converse or to take leave; apparently labouring under the not uncommon delusion that for a free and enlightened citizen of the United States to convert another man's house into a <b>spittoon</b> {{for two or three}} hours together, was a delicate attention, full of interest and politeness, of which nobody could ever tire. At last he rose.|$|E

50|$|Today a {{large number}} of {{original}} items of furniture belonging to the Habsburgs may be seen in the museum, from commodes to imperial thrones. Even exhibits that appear strange today can be seen, such as the <b>spittoons</b> that were de rigueur a hundred years ago.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spittoons</b> are flat-bottomed, often {{weighted}} {{to minimize}} tipping over, and often with an interior [...] "lip" [...] to make spilling less likely if they tip. Some have lids, {{but this is}} rare. Some have holes, sometimes with a plug, to aid in draining and cleaning.|$|R
