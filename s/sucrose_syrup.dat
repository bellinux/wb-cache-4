5000|$|Refiners' syrup {{begins as}} a high brix, pale <b>sucrose</b> <b>syrup</b> made from white sugar and water {{designed}} to loosen the dried molasses found on raw sugar crystals. The sucrose saturated content of the initial [...] "green" [...] syrup impedes sugar crystals from dissolving {{during the process of}} washing. The purpose is to mix the green syrup with raw sugar crystals to form a [...] "magma" [...] of 8-10% moisture content at around 60-65 degrees C that is then washed with water in a centrifuge. After the first washing (often termed affination) the [...] "washed off" [...] molasses combines with the <b>sucrose</b> <b>syrup</b> to generate refiners' return syrup, which is generally re-used several times until deemed spent. The spent refiners' return syrup is sold off to manufacturers for golden syrup production or is sent to a recovery section of the refinery often called the remelt house or boil-out section. Here it is reheated to crystallize and recover the sucrose it contains and that is returned to the affination stage. The final spent syrup left after the recovery process is sold as treacle (often called refiners' molasses in older texts).|$|E

5000|$|The {{rotation}} of the orientation of linearly polarized light was first observed in 1811 in quartz by French physicist François Jean Dominique Arago. In 1820, the English astronomer Sir John F.W. Herschel discovered that different individual quartz crystals, whose crystalline structures are mirror images of each other (see illustration), rotate linear polarization by equal amounts but in opposite directions. Jean Baptiste Biot also observed the {{rotation of}} the axis of polarization in certain liquids and vapors of organic substances such as turpentine. [...] Simple polarimeters have been used since this time to measure the concentrations of simple sugars, such as glucose, in solution. In fact one name for D-glucose (the biological isomer), is dextrose, referring {{to the fact that it}} causes linearly polarized light to rotate to the right or dexter side. In a similar manner, levulose, more commonly known as fructose, causes the plane of polarization to rotate to the left. Fructose is even more strongly levorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory. Invert sugar syrup, commercially formed by the hydrolysis of <b>sucrose</b> <b>syrup</b> to a mixture of the component simple sugars, fructose, and glucose, gets its name from the fact that the conversion causes the direction of rotation to [...] "invert" [...] from right to left.|$|E

The Gmodel satisfactory described the relationship between the water activity (aw) and water content (X) of osmo-dehydrated fruits (r(2) >= 0. 994). Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure Tg of osmo-dehydrated fruits conditioned at various water activities.

Solid gain and water loss increased during process time but no significant difference was observed until 80 min.
