5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, {{suggests}} frying the <b>skewered</b> oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, <b>skewered</b> the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

50|$|Locking <b>skewers</b> {{replace the}} {{existing}} quick release <b>skewers</b> on a bicycle's wheels and Seatpost clamp (quick release <b>skewers</b> enable removal without tools). This reduces {{the need to}} lock these parts of the bike since now their removal requires tools. One type of locking <b>skewer</b> uses the same design as a normal Quick release <b>skewer,</b> except after clamping the <b>skewer</b> the (keyed) handle may be removed.|$|R

5|$|Cooking styles vary {{by region}} and {{each type of}} cooking style and the {{ingredients}} used are generally based on the climate and location of the particular region and on traditions. Rice and variations of kibbee are common in the Galilee. The West Bank engages primarily in heavier meals involving the use of taboon bread, rice and meat and coastal plain inhabitants frequent fish, other seafood, and lentils. The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and <b>skewered</b> meats are served.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard <b>skewered</b> by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E
25|$|Scorpions are <b>skewered</b> {{alive and}} fried in oil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skewers</b> can {{be broken}} down into two types: {{absolute}} and relative. In an absolute <b>skewer,</b> the king is in check, therefore the check must be handled (under the rules of chess), whereas in a relative <b>skewer,</b> the pieces involved don't necessarily need to be addressed.|$|R

50|$|Metal <b>skewers</b> are {{typically}} stainless steel rods with a pointed tip {{on one end}} and a grip of some kind {{on the other end}} for ease of removing the food. Non-metallic <b>skewers</b> are often made from bamboo; however, any suitable wood may be used. Prior to grilling, wooden <b>skewers</b> must be soaked in water to avoid burning.|$|R
50|$|In the old bazaar tradition, {{the rice}} and accompaniments are served first, {{immediately}} followed by the kebabs, which are threaded on <b>skewers,</b> {{as well as a}} piece of flat bread (typically lavash). A <b>skewer</b> is placed directly on {{the rice and}} while holding the kabab down on the rice with the bread, the <b>skewer</b> is quickly pulled out.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Skewer</b> (スキュアー) - The largest aerial {{predator}} of Darwin IV. It is a humungous flying animal, with a wingspan of 50 ft. Not {{even the}} largest known pterosaurs (like Quetzalcoatlus, with its 40 ft wingspan) from Earth have a wingspan even approaching that size. Its wings do not flap but squeeze, shifting shape to shift flight. It is actually propelled by combusting methane gas in four jet-pods on its wings. This allows the <b>Skewer</b> to travel at speeds of 200 miles/h km/h. Its killing tool is a hollow lance that impales its prey, injects digestive enzymes, and sucks the corpse dry. The <b>Skewer</b> also hunts in groups, each <b>Skewer</b> dropping the spoils and another swoops in to feast. No large animal on Darwin IV is {{safe from the}} <b>skewer.</b> Barlowe mentions an eyewittness attack on a sea strider by <b>skewers,</b> but the way this was done is never mentioned.|$|R
25|$|Although {{unusual in}} most {{cultures}} {{as a food}} item, certain large-sized centipedes are consumed in China, usually <b>skewered</b> and grilled or deep fried. They are often seen in street vendor's stalls in large cities, including Donghuamen and Wangfujing markets in Beijing.|$|E
25|$|For example, rituals {{are mainly}} {{performed}} {{on the anniversary of}} deceased ancestors, called jesa. Ritual food include rice, liquor, soup, vinegar and soy sauce (1st row); noodles, <b>skewered</b> meat, vegetable and fish dishes, and rice cake (2nd row); three types of hot soup, meat and vegetable dishes (3rd row); dried snacks, kimchi, and sweet rice drink (4th row); and variety of fruit (5th row).|$|E
25|$|O'Connor's own {{politics}} were liberal. He understood the Bunker character and played him {{not only with}} bombast and humor, but also with touches of vulnerability. The writing on the show was consistently left of center, but O'Connor often deftly <b>skewered</b> the liberal pieties of the day. Although Bunker was famous for his malapropisms of the English language, O'Connor was highly educated and cultured and was an English professor before he turned to acting.|$|E

50|$|Less {{expensive}} {{options include}} replacing standard quick release <b>skewers</b> with <b>skewers</b> that need a standard Hex key to be opened. Despite hex keys not being very rare, this method still guards the bicycle from casual opportunists, needing the less common tool {{and more time}} to be removed. Pentagonal key <b>skewers</b> exist which bring some of {{the benefit of a}} locking <b>skewer</b> at a lower cost. Quicker and cheaper yet, and only effective against thieves unequipped with even a screwdriver, quick-release levers can be tied down by a common Hose clamp.|$|R
25|$|Northern Cyprus is {{also well}} known for several dishes; among them are kebabs made of <b>skewered</b> lamb Şiş Kebab or ground with herbs and spices and made into a Kofte or Şeftali Kebab. Other dishes are based on meat wrapped in flat bread such as Lahmacun. Vegetarians can find stuffed {{vegetables}} based dishes Yalancı Dolma or many other dishes made with a bean or pulse such as Börülce which consists of Swiss chard cooked with black-eyed peas. There are also plant based foods such as Molohiya or root based stews such as Kolokas.|$|E
25|$|As a dry rice farmer, {{the male}} {{head of a}} {{household}} annually clears a fresh section of tropical forest where his wife will plant and harvest their rice. Isneg women also cook the meals, gather wild vegetables and weave bamboo mats and baskets, while the men cut timber, build houses and take extended hunting and fishing trips. Often when a wild pig or deer is killed, its meat is <b>skewered</b> on bamboo and distributed to neighbors and relatives. Nearly all Isneg households also harvest a small grove of coffee trees since the main cash crop of the area is coffee.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the enemy}} was deemed {{sufficiently}} weakened, the noyans would give the order. The drums would beat and the signal flags wave, telling the lancers to begin their charge. Often, the devastation of the arrows was enough to rout an enemy, so the lancers were only needed to help pursue and mop up the remnants. At the Battle of Mohi, the Mongols left open a gap in their ranks, luring the Hungarians into retreating through it. This resulted in the Hungarians being strung out over all the countryside and easy pickings for mounted archers who simply galloped along and picked them off, while the lancers <b>skewered</b> them as they fled.|$|E
5000|$|In chess, a <b>skewer</b> is {{an attack}} upon two pieces in a line and {{is similar to a}} pin. A <b>skewer</b> is {{sometimes}} described as a [...] "reverse pin"; the difference is that in a <b>skewer,</b> the more valuable piece is in front of the piece of lesser value. The opponent is compelled to move the more valuable piece to avoid its capture, thereby exposing the less valuable piece which can then be captured (see chess piece relative value). The long-range pieces (queen, rook, and bishop) can <b>skewer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{reaching}} homogeneity, {{the mixture}} is placed on iron <b>skewers</b> that are 0.5 cm thick, 3 cm wide and anywhere from 90 to 120 cm long. One portion of Adana kebabı is typically 180 grams of meat on one <b>skewer.</b> A [...] "portion-and-half", impaled on slightly wider <b>skewers</b> can not include less than 270 grams, as per the designation label.|$|R

25|$|After another arrest, Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital again {{found him}} to have diminished responsibility. He stayed in a mental {{hospital}} for treatment lasting about one year. Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with a screwdriver in Çorlu. Late at night, he went first to the Çorluspor facility, and murdered nightman Hüseyin Yumruk with a screwdriver. Then, he <b>skewered</b> Özcan Karagözoğlu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed Şakir Temüriçi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, he went in Tonguçlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Baş, in his neck with a screwdriver, and escaped.|$|E
25|$|Spam is used {{in local}} dishes {{in a variety of}} ways, most {{commonly}} fried and served with rice. For breakfast, fried eggs are often served with spam. Spam can also be wrapped in ti and roasted, <b>skewered</b> and deep fried, or stir-fried with cabbage. It is added to saimin and fried rice, mashed with tofu, or served with cold sōmen or baked macaroni and cheese. It is also used in chutney for pupus, in sandwiches with mayonnaise, or baked with guava jelly. Spam musubi, a slice of fried Spam upon a bed of rice wrapped with a strip of nori, is a popular snack in Hawaii which found its way onto island sushi menus in the 1980s.|$|E

Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the French revolution looming {{in the minds of many}} members of Parliament, few were swayed by Charles James Fox's arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, <b>skewered</b> the Dissenters and Priestley specifically. In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>skewer</b> is {{a direct}} attack upon the more {{valuable}} piece, it is generally a much more powerful and effective tactic than the pin. The victim of a <b>skewer</b> often cannot avoid losing material (though {{it may be possible}} if, for example, either piece can give check, thereby forcing the <b>skewering</b> side to move out of check instead of being able to capture either piece, or if it is possible to move a less valuable piece in the way); the only question is which material will be lost. The <b>skewer</b> occurs less often than the pin in actual play. When it does occur, however, it is often decisive.|$|R
