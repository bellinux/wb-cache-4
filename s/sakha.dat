25|$|<b>Sakha</b> can {{be divided}} into three great {{vegetation}} belts. About 40% of <b>Sakha</b> lies above the Arctic circle and all of it is covered by permafrost which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic tundra define the middle region, where lichen and moss grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for reindeer. In {{the southern part of the}} tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf Siberian pine and larch grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast taiga forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of fir and pine begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of <b>Sakha</b> and almost 90% of the cover is larch.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union, Yakutia was {{recognized}} in Moscow as the <b>Sakha</b> (Yakutia) Republic under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{languages are}} both Russian and <b>Sakha,</b> {{also known as}} Yakut, which is spoken by approximately 40% of the population. The Yakut language {{is a member of}} the Turkic language family.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Sakha</b> Republic is {{the site}} of Pleistocene Park, a project {{directed}} at recreating pleistocene tundra grasslands by stimulating the growth of grass with the introduction of animals which thrived in the region during the late Pleistocene— early Holocene period.|$|E
25|$|The republics {{include a}} wide variety of peoples, {{including}} northern Europeans, Tatars, Caucasus peoples, and indigenous Siberians. The largest federal subjects are in Siberia. Located in east-central Siberia, the <b>Sakha</b> Republic (Yakutia) is the largest federal subject in the country (and the largest country subdivision in the world), twice the size of Alaska. Second in size is Krasnoyarsk Krai, located west of <b>Sakha</b> in Siberia. Kaliningrad Oblast, which is a noncontiguous constituent entity of Russia, is the smallest oblast. The Republic of Ingushetia is both the smallest republic and the smallest federal subject of Russia except for the three federal cities. The two most populous federal subjects, Moscow Oblast (with Moscow) and Krasnodar Krai, are in European Russia.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{seven years}} {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union, the District as it is today was formed by the {{amalgamation}} of the previous Siberian and Transbaikal Military Districts, and on their merger gave up the vast <b>Sakha</b> Republic (or Yakutia) to the expanded Far Eastern Military District.|$|E
25|$|The Turkic <b>Sakha</b> {{people or}} Yakuts {{probably}} {{settled in the}} area in the 13th and 14th centuries, migrating north from the Lake Baikal area to the middle Lena. From their new center along the middle Lena they gradually expanded northeast and west beyond the Lena basin towards the Arctic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{antipodes}} of the South Orkney Islands {{are on the}} Aldan River on {{the other}} side of Yakutsk, between Ust-Maya and Eldikan, in southwestern <b>Sakha.</b> The southern two South Sandwich Islands are antipodal to the Pyagin Peninsula east of Magadan. Western South Georgia Island is antipodal to the northern tip of Sakhalin.|$|E
25|$|The Tsardom of Russia {{began its}} {{conquest of the}} region in the 17th century, moving east after the defeat of the Khanate of Sibir. Tygyn, a king of the Khangalassky Yakuts, granted {{territory}} for Russian settlement in return for a military pact that included war against indigenous rebels of all North Eastern Asia (Magadan, Chukotka, Kamchatka and Sakhalin). Kull, a king of the Megino-Khangalassky Yakuts, began a <b>Sakha</b> conspiracy by allowing the first stockade construction.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{northern}} Ellsworth Land and {{the base}} of the Antarctic Peninsula are largely antipodal to the Taymyr Peninsula, while Alexander Island is antipodal to eastern Taymyria south of the Khatanga Gulf. The free part of the Antarctic Peninsula is antipodal to the western <b>Sakha</b> Republic, from its northwestern coast southward, running east of the Lena River, with the northern end of the peninsula covering the towns of Vilyuysk and Kysyl-Syr and stopping about 300km short of Yakutsk.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{established}} {{agriculture in}} the Lena River basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to <b>Sakha</b> {{in the second half}} of the 19th century began to grow wheat, oats, and potatoes. The fur trade established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the Soviet period. This was also the beginning of geological prospecting, mining, and local lead production. The first steam-powered ships and barges arrived.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Sanyal wrote a {{significant}} number of popular science articles in his mother tongue of Bengali in the children's magazines of <b>Sakha</b> (18 articles in the period 1887 - 1890) and Mukul (18 articles in the period 1895 - 1900). He further followed this up with a second book Hours with Nature, published in 1896 for a target audience of schoolchildren. Sanyal also published notes based on observations at the zoo in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, 8 of Russia's federal {{subjects}} had a TFR above 2.1 children per woman (the approximate minimum required to ensure population replacement), These federal subjects are Chechnya (3.38), Tuva (2.81), Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (2.73), Agin-Buryat Okrug (2.63), Komi-Permyak (2.16), Evenk Okrug (2.58), Altai Republic (2.36), Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.1). Of these federal subjects, four have an ethnic Russian majority (Altai, Evenk, Ust-Orda and Nenets). In 2011, the highest TFR {{were recorded in}} Chechnya (3.362), Tyva (3.249), Ingushetia (2.94), Altai Republic (2.836), <b>Sakha</b> Republic (2.057), Buryatia (2.027), and Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.007).|$|E
25|$|Eastern {{and central}} <b>Sakha</b> {{comprises}} numerous north-south mountain ranges of various ages. These mountains {{extend up to}} almost , but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation. The Verkhoyansk Range was extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations. At these low elevations are numerous valleys, many of them deep and covered with larch forest, except in the extreme north where the tundra dominates. Soils are mainly turbels (a type of gelisol). The active layer tends {{to be less than}} one metre deep, except near rivers.|$|E
25|$|Elk Island National Park also {{remains a}} seed herd for {{repopulation}} efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and {{the foothills of}} the Rockies. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 wood bison were relocated to the Republic of <b>Sakha</b> (Yakutia) to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison.|$|E
25|$|Western Australia (abbreviated as WA) {{is a state}} {{occupying the}} entire western third of Australia. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean {{to the north and}} west, the Great Australian Bight and Southern Ocean to the south, the Northern Territory to the {{north-east}} and South Australia to the south-east. Western Australia is Australia's largest state with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres (976,790 sq mi), and the second-largest country subdivision in the world, surpassed only by Russia's <b>Sakha</b> Republic – however, a significant part of it is sparsely populated. The state has about 2.6million inhabitants, around 11% of the national total. Ninety-two per cent of the population lives in the south-west corner of the state.|$|E
25|$|Soviet-era sources (Great Soviet Encyclopedia and others) {{and modern}} Russian ones usually define Siberia as a region {{extending}} eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean {{to the hills}} of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of both Mongolia and China. By this definition, Siberia includes the federal subjects of the Siberian Federal District, {{and some of the}} Ural Federal District, as well as <b>Sakha</b> (Yakutia) Republic, which {{is a part of the}} Far Eastern Federal District. Geographically, this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of Urals and Far Eastern federal districts, but they are not included administratively. This definition excludes Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast, both of which are included in some wider definitions of Siberia.|$|E
25|$|The various Rigveda manuscripts {{discovered}} so far {{show some}} differences. Broadly, the most studied Śākala recension has 1017 hymns, includes an appendix of eleven valakhīlya hymns {{which are often}} counted with the 8th mandala, {{for a total of}} 1,028 metrical hymns. The Bāṣakala version of Rigveda includes eight of these vālakhilya hymns among its regular hymns, making a total of 1025 hymns in the main text for this <b>śākhā.</b> The Bāṣakala text also has an appendix of 98 hymns, called the Khilani, bringing the total to 1,123 hymns. The manuscripts of Śākala recension of the Rigveda have about 10,600 verses, organized into ten Books (Mandalas). Books 2 through 7 are internally homogeneous in style, while Books 1, 8 and 10 are compilation of verses of internally different styles suggesting that these books are likely a collection of compositions by many authors.|$|E
25|$|Wherever {{indigenous}} {{cultural identity}} is asserted, common societal issues and concerns {{arise from the}} indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues {{in dealing with the}} prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out {{by the fact that the}} lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the <b>Sakha</b> and Komi peoples (two of the northern indigenous peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). In Australia, a landmark case, Mabo v Queensland (No 2), saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of terra nullius. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.|$|E
500|$|Bovista pila {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in North America (including Hawaii). [...] There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. Hanns Kreisel recorded it from Russia, {{in what is}} now known as the <b>Sakha</b> Republic. The puffball has been tentatively identified from the Galápagos Islands, and has been collected from Pernambuco and São Paulo, Brazil. The South American material, however, has grayish-yellow coloration in the gleba, which may be indicative of not yet fully matured specimens. This renders identification of this material tentative, as unripe material may have different microscopic characteristics from mature material. Although the puffball has been reported from both the European part of Turkey as well as Anatolia, and from Morocco, reports without supporting microscopic or macroscopic information are viewed with skepticism.|$|E
