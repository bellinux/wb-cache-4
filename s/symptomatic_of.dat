5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin {{to sleep in the}} church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church, viewing the medieval painting as <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneity of the {{cardiovascular}} response to hemofiltration. Twenty–one stable maintenance hemodialysis patients were studied in a crossover format with hemofiltration {{to determine whether}} the lower incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension noted with hemofiltration could be correlated with changes in baroreflex function as tested using the cold pressor test and amyl nitrite inhalation study. Baroreflex function remained abnormal and unchanged in all patients {{in the face of a}} reduced incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension. Subdivision <b>of</b> the patients into frequent (> 1 episode/treatment) and infrequent (< 1 episode/treatment) reactors during the hemodialysis control period resulted in the infrequent reactors, showing a significant increase in episodes <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension/hemofiltration treatment where a significant reduction was noted with the frequent reactors. No clear correlation could be made between the incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension and the pre- to post-treatment change in body temperature. The presence of pretreatment hypertension, another previously identified correlate <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension with hemodialysis, also could not be corroborated. Further, changes from baseline predialysis values in mean arterial pressure noted with hemofiltration could not be correlated with a changed incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension. We conclude that previously identified correlates <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension noted in the hemodialysis setting may be dissociated during treatment with hemofiltration and that there is a heterogeneous patient response to this treatment. These data suggest that there are additional, as yet undetermined, pathophysiologic events that underly the <b>symptomatic</b> hypotension <b>of</b> artificial kidney treatment...|$|R

This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age, but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The college {{remained}} {{associated with}} Lancashire and Cheshire, {{with a particular}} preference for those from Prestbury and Prescot, the founders' birthplaces. This was also reflected in early benefactors. These included the donation of John Port, serjeant-at-law, for two fellowships for natives of Chester in 1522; that of William Clyfton, the sub-dean of York, for residents of York, Lincoln and Nottingham in 1538; and for the Brian Higden, Dean of York, who sponsored a fellowship for those in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire in 1549. Another notable benefactor during this period was John Claymond, the first President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who in 1538 gave funds to maintain six scholars at Brasenose, provided that their lectures on humanity and Greek take place at his own college. Only in 1572 was a Lectureship in Greek established at Brasenose, <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> a conservatism that attached Brasenose to a monastic teaching style that was increasingly problematic during the reformation. By {{the end of the}} sixteenth century, however, the college did boast lectureships ("public readerships") in the new disciplines of logic and natural philosophy. By 1547, the income of the college had increased to almost £200 yearly, with an endowment that placed it squarely in the midst of other colleges in size; it did, however, make a yearly loss.|$|E

25|$|Both in vivo {{study and}} {{modelling}} are necessary tools {{to understand this}} complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent to wound healing and proper integration of tissue grafts and organ donations.

However, {{prophylactic}} effect of antiplatelets against venous thromboembolism (VTE), in patients who undergo hip fracture surgery (HFS) is controversial. Our purpose was to determine the incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> VTE after HFS and to evaluate whether antiplatelets reduce the development <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> VTE following HFS. We retrospectively reviewed 858 HFS in 824 consecutive patients which were performed from May 2003 to April 2010 at an East Asian institute. We compared the incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> VTE in antiplatelet users and non-users using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Overall incidences <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> pulmonary embolism including fatal pulmonary embolism, and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis in this study were 2. 4 % (21 / 858), and 3. 5 % (30 / 858), respectively. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>symptomatic</b> VTE was 4. 8 % (12 / 250) in antiplatelet users and 4. 3 % (26 / 608) in non-users (P = 0. 718).
