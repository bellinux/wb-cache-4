40|$|The risk {{of effects}} to fishes and other aquatic life from {{impulsive}} sound produced by {{activities such as}} pile driving and seismic exploration is increasing throughout the world, particularly with the increased exploitation of oceans for energy production. At the same time, there are few data that {{provide insight into the}} effects of these sounds on fishes. The goal {{of this study was to}} provide quantitative data to define the levels of impulsive sound that could result in the onset of barotrauma to fish. A High Intensity Controlled Impedance Fluid filled wave Tube was developed that enabled laboratory simulation of high-energy impulsive sound that were characteristic of aquatic far-field, plane-wave acoustic conditions. The sounds used were based upon the impulsive sounds generated by an impact hammer striking a steel <b>shell</b> <b>pile.</b> Neutrally buoyant juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were exposed to impulsive sounds and subsequently evaluated for barotrauma injuries. Observed injuries ranged from mild hematomas at the lowest sound exposure levels to organ hemorrhage at the highest sound exposure levels. Frequency of observed injuries were used to compute a biological response weighted index (RWI) to evaluate the physiological impact of injuries at the different exposure levels. As single strike and cumulative sound exposure levels (SEL(ss), SEL(cum) respectively) increased, RWI values increased. Based on the results, tissue damage associated with adverse physiological costs occurred when the RWI was greater than 2. In terms of sound exposure levels a RWI of 2 was achieved for 1920 strikes by 177 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s SEL(ss) yielding a SEL(cum) of 210 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s, and for 960 strikes by 180 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s SEL(ss) yielding a SEL(cum) of 210 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s.

40|$|Oyster reefs {{provide an}} array of {{ecosystem}} services. Specifically, they provide structurally complex habitat for fish and invertebrate species such as the commercially important Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. This ecosystem service, once provided by the native oyster Ostrea lurida, is now provided by the commercially cultured oyster Crassostrea gigas in many estuaries on the U. S west coast. An economic investigation was conducted examining the ecosystem services provided by oyster habitat, common economic valuation theories and techniques, and tradeoffs between oyster restoration and aquaculture expansion. A scientific investigation, comprised of three studies, was also conducted to examine Dungeness crab production as an ecosystem service provided by oyster habitat. Because natural ecosystems, such as oyster reefs, provide beneficial goods and services through time, they should be valued as any other economic asset or capital. Until recently many of these beneficial services have not been accounted for within resource management plans, often resulting in the over-exploitation of those resources. Activities such as coastal development, dredging, aquaculture expansion, or even habitat restoration can affect estuarine ecosystems. While valuing the ecosystems themselves might be difficult, valuation of the services they provide can be {{a useful tool for}} identifying and protecting key ecosystem services while implementing plans with minimal negative impact. The oysters, O. lurida and C. gigas inhabit different regions of the tidal zone. O. lurida is predominantly found in subtidal and low intertidal regions whereas C. gigas is predominantly found in intertidal regions. The shift in the dominant species has resulted in a subsequent shift of available recruitment habitat for M. magister. We conducted an across-estuary study to examine settlement of M. magister in existing O. lurida, C. gigas, eelgrass, and open mud habitats in Willapa Bay, WA, Netarts Bay, OR, and Coos Bay, OR, to determine tradeoffs in crab production between habitat types. A second study using shell bags as settlement substrate at various tidal elevations was conducted in Yaquina Bay, OR, to obtain density data of M. magister by depth. We used these densities, in combination with pre-existing data from Willapa Bay, to compare the production of Dungeness crab as an ecosystem service historically provided by O. lurida habitat and production currently provided by C. gigas habitat in Willapa Bay, WA. A third study using shell piles was conducted in Yaquina Bay, OR to estimate survival of juvenile M. magister. The results of these three studies generally support prior research indicating that densities of juvenile M. magister are greater in oyster and eelgrass habitats than in open mud, and are generally greater in oyster habitat than in eelgrass. The Yaquina Bay shell bag study indicated greater densities of juvenile M. magister in subtidal regions, while the <b>shell</b> <b>pile</b> study indicated greater densities in higher intertidal regions...|$|E

50|$|The {{southwest}} {{coast of}} Florida has many large artificial structures known as shell works, made of <b>shells</b> <b>piled</b> up by human activity. Shell works are found from Charlotte Harbor southward through the Ten Thousand Islands. Many {{of the shell}} works are surrounded by water, forming artificial islands, often called keys. The shell works were the sites of villages, occupied by people who depended primarily on fishing, but also hunted and gathered wild foods. Shells works have complex structures, apparently designed to separate spaces by use; domestic, public and sacred. The {{northern part of the}} range in which shell works are found, from Charlotte Harbor through Estero Bay, was occupied by people of the Caloosahatchee culture. The southern part of the range, including Marco Island and the Ten Thousand Islands, was occupied by people of the Ten Thousand Islands region of the Glades culture. Both the Caloosahatchee culture area and the Ten Thousand Islands region of the Glades culture area were occupied by the Calusa people at the time of first contact with Europeans. Archaeological evidence indicates that artifacts in the Ten Thousand Islands region changed from resembling those of the Glades culture to resembling those of the Caloosahatchee culture around 1300, indicating absorption by or strong influence from the Calusa. Schwadron notes that many of the shell works sites in the Ten Thousand Islands appear to have been abandoned shortly before 1300, and suggests that the people of those sites may have migrated into Calusa territory.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a two-ring bubble curtain system in reducing underwater sound pressures during marine pile driving was assessed through underwater sound pressure measurements.

During the measurements, the bubble curtain system was turned ON and OFF. The restrike involved driving the piles at refusal with the hammer at maximum energy (1, 600 to 1, 740 kilojoules). This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in sound pressures provided by the bubble curtain system ranged considerably. The direct reduction in sound pressures, which is evaluated by comparing bubble curtain ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for RMS sound pressure levels. Piles 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak pressures and RMS sound pressure levels on the north side. However, the reductions on the south side for Pile 3 were much less. Close to Pile 3 on the south side, the reductions were on the order of 5 to 7 dB. Further away at about 450 m south, the reductions were only about 2 dB. Uneven bottom topography around Pile 3, which could have compromised the bubble curtain performance near the bay bottom, is suspected to have resulted in the lower reductions to the south.

40|$|Formation of {{interstellar}} clouds {{as a consequence}} of thermal instability is studied using twodimensional two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral medium in the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable gas in which clouds form. We found, as speculated in paper I, that in the shocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal instability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab that leads formation of HI clouds whose number density is typically n � 100 cm − 3, even if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. We also found that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution of the shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean magnetic field and converging flows. Thus, the direct formation of molecular clouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud formation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is biased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. However, when the angle is small, the HI shell generated as a result of converging flows is massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in the massive HI <b>shell</b> is <b>piled</b> up again along the magnetic field line. We expect that another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive shell and produce a larger cloud.
