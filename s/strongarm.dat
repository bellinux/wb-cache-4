5|$|The series {{focuses on}} Bumblebee who, {{following}} {{the events of}} Prime, has become a police officer on Cybertron. While on a mission, he sees a vision of Optimus Prime telling {{him to go to}} Earth as a terrible evil is coming. Joining him on the mission are his cadet partner <b>Strongarm</b> and the rebellious Sideswipe. Following their arrival on Earth, the three of them are tasked with capturing Decepticons who were released from their stasis pods when their prison ship, the Alchemor, crash landed. The trio is also aided by the humans Russell and Denny Clay, the Dinobot Grimlock, and the Minicon Fixit. Later, they are joined by the former Decepticon-turned-Autobot bounty hunter Drift, with his Minicon pupils Slipstream and Jetstorm, and the spiritual Windblade who is on a mission by the Transformers' god Primus. The first season, consisting of 26 episodes, concluded with the revival of Optimus.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{the brewery}} had a {{capacity}} of over 1.5 million hectolitres (over 1 million barrels) per annum. Production in 2012 was 900,000 hectolitres, with around 40,000 hl in own brand sales. The bulk of the brewery's own production is cask conditioned ale but it also sells bottled and keg ales. The company's most famous beer is <b>Strongarm,</b> a 4% abv bitter introduced in 1955, and other regular beers are IPA, Bullion Gold and Trophy Special. <b>Strongarm</b> is made with 18 per cent crystal malt, which contributes significantly to its distinctive ruby red colour and its roasted, malty flavour.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Acorn {{used the}} ARM610 {{as the main}} central {{processing}} unit (CPU) in their RiscPC computers. DEC licensed the ARM6 architecture and produced the <b>StrongARM.</b> At 233MHz, this CPU drew only one watt (newer versions draw far less). This work was later passed to Intel {{as part of a}} lawsuit settlement, and Intel took the opportunity to supplement their i960 line with the <b>StrongARM.</b> Intel later developed its own high performance implementation named XScale, which it has since sold to Marvell. Transistor count of the ARM core remained essentially the same throughout these changes; ARM2 had 30,000transistors, while ARM6 grew only to 35,000.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, John Watson Cameron's wife, Lillian, was {{appointed}} to the board, responsible for the furnishings and decoration of Cameron's licensed houses. In 1953, the Stranton bottling facility was opened. In March 1955, <b>Strongarm</b> bitter was introduced, as the industrial workers of West Hartlepool demanded a stronger pint.|$|E
25|$|Buchalter, who had {{provided}} services for some locals of the Amalgamated during the 1920s. also acquired influence within the ACWA. One of his allies within the ACWA was , a prominent {{member of the}} Socialist Party {{with close ties to}} The Forward, whom Hillman used to inflict <b>strongarm</b> tactics on his communist opponents within the union. Beckerman and Philip Orlofsky, another local officer in Cutters Local 4, made sweetheart deals with manufacturers that allowed them to subcontract to cut rate subcontractors out of town, using Buchalter's trucking companies to bring the goods back and forth.|$|E
25|$|The CP did {{not refuse}} {{to put up}} a fight when it broke with Hillman and the ACW leadership. The {{struggle}} was most acute in outlying areas, such as Montreal, Toronto and Rochester, where the CP and its Canadian counterpart were strongly entrenched. In New York City the fight was often physical, as Hillman brought in , a prominent member of the Socialist Party with close ties to The Forward, to use <b>strongarm</b> tactics on communist opponents within the union. By the end of the decade, the CP was no longer a significant force in the union.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911, France <b>strongarmed</b> {{itself into}} seizing {{more control over}} Morocco. German Foreign Minister Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter was not opposed to that if Germany had {{compensation}} elsewhere in Africa, in the French Congo. He sent a small warship, made saber-rattling threats and whipped up anger by German nationalists. France and Germany soon agreed on a compromise, with France gaining control of Morocco and Germany gaining some of the French Congo. The British cabinet, however, was angry and alarmed at Germany's aggressiveness. Lloyd George made a dramatic [...] "Mansion House" [...] speech that denounced the German move was an intolerable humiliation. There was talk of war until Germany backed down, and relations remained sour.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse {{domain name}} [...] "hijacking" [...] {{is a legal}} remedy to counter the {{practice}} of domain squatting, wherein individuals hold many registered domain names containing famous third party trademarks {{with the intent of}} profiting by selling the domain names back to trademark owners. [...] Trademark owners initially responded by filing cybersquatting lawsuits against registrants to enforce their trademark rights. [...] However, as the number of cybersquatting incidents grew, trademark owners noticed that registrants would often settle their cases rather than litigate. [...] Cybersquatting lawsuits are a defensive strategy to combat cybersquatting, however such lawsuits may also be used as a way of <b>strongarming</b> innocent domain name registrants into giving up domain names that the trademark owner is not, in fact, entitled to.|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{geographic}} {{dimensions of}} African voting {{to suggest that}} the salience of previous explanations of vote choice, including clientelism, performance evaluation, and local <b>strongarming</b> varies across different types of constituencies. Analysis of Government-to-Opposition Swing (GOS) voting in 7 countries and 28 elections reveals that GOS varies not only across the urban-rural divide, as expected, but also across different types of rural constituencies. While GOS is uncommon in rural parts of the president's home region, we discover significant variation across other types of rural constituencies: GOS is most likely in denselypopulated rural constituencies, and less likely in sparsely-populated rural constituencies that are often among the poorest in the country. We infer that political and economic geography shapes prospects for autonomous vote choice, performance voting, and the quality of democracy...|$|R
25|$|The Veneti were {{defeated}} by Julius Caesar's fleet in 56BC {{in front of}} Locmariaquer; many of the Veneti were then either slaughtered or sold into slavery. The Romans settled a town called Darioritum in a location previously belonging to the Veneti. From the 5th to the 7th century, the remaining Gauls were displaced or assimilated by waves of immigrant Britons fleeing the Saxon invasions of Britain. Under the Breton name Gwened (also derived from the Veneti), the town {{was the center of}} an independent principality or kingdom variously called Bro-Wened ("Vannes") or Bro-Ereg ("land of Gwereg"), the latter for a prominent member of its dynasty, which claimed descent from Caradog <b>Strongarm.</b> The diocese of Vannes was erected in the 5th century. The Council of Vannes was held there in 461. The realm annexed Cornouaille for a time in the early 6th century but was permanently joined with Domnonia under its king and saint Judicaël around 635.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the RiscPC in 1994 and its later <b>StrongARM</b> upgrade raised issues of incompatible code sequences and proprietary squeezing (compression). Patching of applications for the <b>StrongARM</b> was facilitated and Acorn's UnsqueezeAIF software unsqueezed images according to their AIF header. The incompatibilities prompted release by The ARM Club of its Game On! and StrongGuard software. They allowed some previously incompatible software to be run on new and upgraded systems. The version of the OS for the A9home prevented the running of software without an AIF header (in accordance with Application Note 295) to stop [...] "trashing the desktop".|$|E
50|$|Bremerton was {{incorporated}} on October 15, 1901 with Alvyn Croxton {{serving as the}} city's first mayor. Progress in the new city soon faced a major crisis, as Navy Secretary Charles Darling moved all repair work to the Mare Island Navy Yard in California in November 1902. Darling cited reports from commanders that the Bremerton waterfront was rife with prostitution, opium houses and frequent <b>strongarmed</b> robberies of sailors. Politics were probably also at play, as local newspapers reported that the city's incorporation left the shipyard essentially landlocked without room to expand. A dispute ensued between Mayor Croxton, who wanted to shutter all saloons in Bremerton, and {{three members of the}} city council, who attempted to block his efforts. Croxton eventually won out and the council voted to revoke all liquor licenses in June 1904. With the ban, Darling reestablished the navy yard as a port of call. Saloons had begun to return to business within two years, however.|$|R
5000|$|During a pro hockey lockout, Doug 'the Thug' Glatt's (Seann William Scott) team, the Halifax Highlanders, has {{to contend}} with an influx of new players. With pro hockey suspended, media focus has descended on the lower league, {{and the owner of}} the Highlanders, Hyrum Cain (Callum Keith Rennie), seeks to {{capitalize}} on the attention. Before the opening game, Doug is made captain and leads his team out onto the ice. In a close fought game, Doug is goaded into a fight with the rival team's enforcer, Anders Cain (Wyatt Russell), an up-and-coming player with a violent streak, and the son of the Highlander's owner. Anders wins the fight, and with Doug badly injured, the Highlanders lose the game. Dealing with rehab, Doug decides to retire and accept a more stable job as an insurance salesman. At home, Doug's wife Eva realizes that she is pregnant, and she and Doug make preparations for their new child. Without Doug, the Highlanders go on a long losing streak, prompting the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and pushes to add his own son to the team. Hyrum foresees Anders as the new captain of the Highlanders, and although the coach disagrees with the move, anticipating locker room dysfunction, Hyrum <b>strongarms</b> him into making Anders the new captain.|$|R
5000|$|The second such {{occasion}} {{was on a}} [...] "Super Sunday" [...] card in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1983. Hogan again pinned Bockwinkel, {{was awarded}} the belt and announced as the new champion. This time Blackburn came to the ring moments after the match and tried to have Hogan retroactively disqualified for throwing the champion over the top rope {{a few minutes before}} the pinfall occurred. However this match had been booked as a no disqualification match, which prevented this, so Blackburn simply stripped Hogan of the title and once again handed it back to Bockwinkel. The crowd (which had exploded in cheers when Hogan appeared to have won) almost rioted when learning that Hogan was once again cheated out of the title, and Bockwinkel later had to do damage control with the rabid crowd, telling the audience to calm down afterwards as well. Hogan attacked Bockwinkel and his manager Bobby Heenan. On the DVD The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA, it was revealed that Verne Gagne planned to have Hogan win the belt that night, but only if he would give Gagne the bulk of the revenues that Hogan was earning from merchandise and his periodic main-event performances in New Japan Pro Wrestling. Outraged at being <b>strongarmed,</b> Hogan refused, but nonetheless offered a 50/50 split instead. Gagne refused, and kept the belt from him. [...] However, Hogan did admit in his autobiography My Life Outside the Ring that he still intended to stay with AWA and that Verne Gagne had planned to book him in steel cage matches with Bockwinkel in an effort to expand the AWA to the New York market, but he decided to leave when Vincent K. McMahon offered him the World Wresting Federation Championship.|$|R

5000|$|The book {{opens with}} Spenser and Susan Silverman {{talking with the}} Kyles about their missing daughter, April. Mr. Kyle {{apparently}} saw her {{in the act of}} seducing a John, a man about his age. He's livid at the thought of his daughter working as a prostitute and voices his opinion loudly. Spenser is clearly not interested in working for Mr. Kyle at any price, but the pleadings of Susan Silverman and Mrs. Kyle persuade Spenser to take the job (which he does for the nominal fee of one dollar). Spenser talks to a Smithfield, Mass. cop ( [...] friend of Susan's named Cataldo) and gets a lead that some of April's old crowd might know something. Spenser literally <b>strongarms</b> a kid named Carl Hummel to find out where they think she might be: with a friend in Boston, Amy Gurwitz, who left town a few months before April did. Spenser goes to see Amy. She is living in a three-story home with a middle-aged man named Mitchell Poitras and tries to look the part of a sophisticated well-to-do woman even though she is no more than sixteen. He gets no information from her, but is convinced she knows something about April. (It turns out that Mitchell Poitras is a high-ranking figure in the Massachusetts school system and deals with a lot of troubled youths. He is using his position to funnel troubled females into prostitution). Next Spenser heads to a part of Boston called the Combat Zone (Boston's red-light district). He asks a hooker about April and shows a photo he has of her. Her pimp, a strong-looking man who goes by the name [...] "Trumps," [...] tries to stop Spenser. Spenser takes Trumps's sap away from him and roughs him up with it. Once Trumps steps away, he learns April has been working for a pimp named [...] "Red". The hooker warns Spenser to watch his back after roughing up Trumps because he hold grudges and that she will be beaten for what happened. Spenser offers to take her away and she laughs at him. Spenser enlists the help of Hawk and heads back to the Combat Zone to find Red. They find him in a strip bar, but Trumps and two thugs confront Spenser before he can question Red. Hawk arrives and takes out the two thugs by slamming their heads together. Once he informs Trumps that he has Spenser's back, Trumps backs off and leaves. Red refuses to answer questions, but after Hawk chops him across the throat, Red discloses April's last known address. Spenser and Hawk proceed to the address and find it in a filthy building with a hooker as a neighbor. April's room is dirty and small and empty except for a photo on the wall of her parents' home. Spenser decides to watch the house that Amy and Mitchell Poitras are living in. After they leave the house, Spenser breaks into their house shortly before Thanksgiving. While there, he finds a set of spare keys and has them copied at Sears. On the third floor, he finds a kiddie porn photo and movie studio and a huge stash of pornographic photos and films. He leaves the house leaving behind no evidence of his visit. Hawk finds out that Red works for Tony Marcus. Under the pretense of hiring Trumps's hooker, the one that warned him earlier, Spenser questions her and finds out that April was transferred to the [...] "Sheep Ranch" [...] (a brothel that specializes in kinky acts) in Providence, Rhode Island. Undercover in a garish red outfit, Spenser finds the Sheep Ranch {{with the help of a}} local cabby and busts April out of there going through the madam and bouncer to do it. On the road with April, Spenser discovers that she was moved there right after he talked to Amy. He tells April he won't force her to go back to her parents if she doesn't want to. Claiming to need an emergency bathroom break on the side of the road, April gets out of the car and disappears into the woods.|$|R

However, another article unrelated to the report published by the Asia Society reported that, [...] "fear that the P.R.C. government could <b>strongarm</b> private or unaffiliated Chinese groups into giving up cyber-secrets is reflected in the U.S. government's treatment of Chinese telecom company Huawei." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bjelke-Petersen was a {{divisive}} premier and earned himself {{a reputation as}} a [...] "law and order" [...] politician with his repeated use of police force against street demonstrators and <b>strongarm</b> tactics with trade unions, leading to frequent descriptions of Queensland under his leadership as a police state. From 1987 his administration came under the scrutiny of a royal commission into police corruption and its links with state government ministers. [...] Bjelke-Petersen was unable to recover from the series of damaging findings and after initially resisting a party vote that replaced him as leader, resigned from politics on 1 December 1987. Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke-Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial.|$|E
