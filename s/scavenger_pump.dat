500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Gulf's {{aviation}} manager, Maj. Alford J. Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned-up {{versions of the}} Grumman F3F Navy fighter, for promotional use by the company. Wearing Gulf Oil company colors and logos, the Grumman G-22 [...] "Gulfhawk II", registered NR1050, was delivered in December 1936, and in 1938 Maj. Williams flew it {{on a tour of}} Europe. A second <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump</b> and five drain lines were added to the engine installation that allowed the aircraft to be flown inverted for up to thirty minutes. This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A second airplane, the Grumman G-32 [...] "Gulfhawk III", registered NC1051, was delivered on May 6, 1938. Impressed by the Army Air Force in November 1942 for use as a VIP transport and designated a UC-103, it crashed in the southern Florida Everglades in early 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} fuel/air mixture in the CWT {{could have been}} ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, auto-ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump,</b> or static electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were [...] "very unlikely" [...] {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E
50|$|On Carb Day, Gordon Johncock led {{the speed}} chart with a lap of 192.555 mph. A total of 34 cars took laps, without any major incidents. Howdy Holmes blew an engine, Mike Mosley blew a transmission, and Salt Walther {{suffered}} a broken oil <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lubrication: dry sump, tank {{incorporated}} {{within the}} final drive housing, 3 <b>scavenger</b> <b>pumps</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Improved oil {{temperature}} control. This {{is due to}} increased oil volume providing resistance to heat saturation, the positioning of the oil reservoir away from the hot engine, {{and the ability to}} include cooling capabilities between the <b>scavenger</b> <b>pumps</b> and oil reservoir and also within the reservoir itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{cooldown}} will {{be immediately}} preceded by two trial pump downs; the insulating vacuum and the detector volume. The insulating vacuum {{must be established}} to a level below 10 {sup - 4 } MM Hg to minimize the conduction heat load. The detector, aka cryostat, vacuum pump down {{must be able to}} reproduce the ultimate and rate-of-rise (ROR) values demonstrated in the clean room. It is anticipated, barring newly generated problems, it will take a few days to accomplish both of these tasks once the construction is complete, even though there has been incidental <b>scavenger</b> vacuum <b>pumping.</b> When the leak detectors are put away, the real Pump and Purge (P&P) begins...|$|R
50|$|On lap 138, {{the green}} light came back on. Foyt came through traffic and passed Rutherford for the lead down the mainstretch. A lap later though, Foyt's car began smoking, and he was issued the black flag due to leaking oil. After two pits stops, Foyt dropped out with a broken {{turbocharger}} <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
50|$|Four {{positions}} remained open on {{the final}} day of time trials. Gordon Johncock was the first driver to complete an attempt, and took a run of 213.812 mph. A few minutes later, Willy T. Ribbs' car started smoking and spewing oil, and suffered a turbocharger failure. Yet another engine-related headache for the team. The team scrambled to replace the turbo, but then discovered a damaged <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump,</b> which delayed them further.|$|E
5000|$|The NTSB also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} fuel/air mixture in the CWT {{could have been}} ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, auto-ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump,</b> or static electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were [...] "very unlikely" [...] {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E
40|$|The 757 / 767 {{internal}} drive generator (IDG), which provides 400 Hz/ 120 volt ac {{power to the}} aircraft cabin experiences failures due to seizure of the <b>scavenger</b> drive <b>pump</b> and/or axial gears on the main drive shaft of the unit. These generators {{are an integral part}} of the aircraft`s engines sitting outboard, inside the engine cowling. The seizure of gears represents a significant loss with gear replacement estimated at $ 17, 000 and unit replacement costs at $ 250, 000. One of the U. S. commercial airline companies engaged Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a brief study to determine if a methodology could be developed to interrogate and diagnose gear wear with the ultimate goal of deploying an instrument for test stand and flight line use. Through a structured analysis it was determined that accelerometers mapped with higher order spectral analysis (HOSA) and/or wavelets could provide an analytic approach and basis for a diagnostic sensor/system capable of assessing IDG gear wear on the aircraft or the test stand...|$|R
5000|$|Increased engine {{horsepower}} due to reduced viscous and air friction. In a wet-sump engine the crank shaft and other moving parts splash through the oil at thousands of RPM causing a [...] "hurricane that whips {{the oil in}} a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender". Additionally, in a wet-sump, each revolution generates minute amounts of parasitic power loss caused by viscous drag and air drag (or 'windage') as the parts move rapidly through the oil and air in the lower engine. At high RPM these small sources of drag compound dramatically, resulting in significant power loss. In a dry-sump, the <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump</b> removes the oil and therefore the source of viscous friction, but also creates an air vacuum that significantly reduces air-friction, thus freeing the moving parts of much viscous and air friction and allowing engine power output to increase.|$|E

5000|$|The D.II {{was based}} on the Austro-Daimler to a large degree. Like the Austro-Daimler, it was built up from the crankcase, which was milled from two pieces of cast {{aluminum}} bolted together at their midline. The cylinders were separately milled from steel and bolted {{to the top of the}} crankcase. Steel sleeves were fitted over the cylinders and welded on to form a cooling jacket. Much of this complexity is due to the differential rates of expansion of steel and aluminum, which precluded screwing the cylinders into the crankcase, and the alloys of the era meant that an aluminum cylinder was not possible. Both engines also used a <b>scavenger</b> <b>pump</b> to pump oil out of the crankcase to a separate cylinder, where a second high-pressure pump supplied oil to the engine. This arrangement allowed for a much smaller [...] "sump" [...] on the bottom of the crankcase, reducing the overall size of the engine, although in the case of the D.II it was not nearly as much as the Austro-Daimler.|$|E
