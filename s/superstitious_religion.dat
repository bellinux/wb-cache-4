60|$|Having premised thus much, I shall now {{proceed to}} {{consider}} {{some of the}} Acts of Parliament themselves; the persons against whom they were made, {{and the necessity of}} making the same. And some of the first Acts we meet with, were those which were made against a sort of people called Egyptians; persons who, if in reality such, might, if any, be suspected of practising what we call the black art, the same having been for many ages encouraged in their country; nay, so much has it been by them favoured, that it was introduced into their <b>superstitious</b> <b>religion,</b> if I may without an absurdity call it so, and made an essential part thereof; and, I believe, Mahometanism has not much mended the matter, since it has imperiously reigned there, or in any respect reformed that idolatrous nation. Now the mischief these persons might do, being so much in the devil's power, among the unwary, was thought too considerable not to be provided against; and therefore our wise legislature, the more effectually to prevent the same, by striking at the very foundation, made an act in 22 Henry VIII. 8: That if any, calling themselves Egyptians, do come into this realm, they shall forfeit all their goods; and being demanded, shall depart the realm within fifteen days, upon pain of imprisonment; and the importers of them, by another act, were made liable to a heavy penalty. This act was continued by the 1 Philip and Mary. Conjuration, witchcraft, enchantment, and sorcery, to get money, or consume any person in his body, members, or goods, or to provoke any person to unlawful love, was by the 33 Henry VIII. 14. and the 5 Elizabeth 16. and the 1 James I. 12. made felony; and by the same 33 Henry VIII. 14. it was made felony to declare to another any false prophecies upon arms, &c., but this act was repealed by the 1 Edward VI. 12., but by another act of the 3 and 4 of Edward VI. 15. it was again enacted, That all such persons who should pretend to prophecies, &c., should, upon conviction, for the first offence forfeit ten pounds, and one year's imprisonment; and for the second offence, all his goods, and imprisonment for life. And by the 7 Edward VI. 11. the same was made to continue but till the then next sessions of parliament. And by the 5 Elizabeth 15. the same act was again renewed against fantastical prophesiers, &c., but both those acts were repealed by the 1 James I. 12.|$|E

5000|$|The People's Republic of China, {{established}} in 1949 {{under the leadership}} of Mao Zedong, established a policy of state atheism. Initially, the new government did not suppress religious practice, but, like its dynastic ancestors, viewed popular religious movements, especially in the countryside, as possibly seditious. The government condemned religious organisations, labeling them as <b>superstitious.</b> <b>Religions</b> that were deemed [...] "appropriate" [...] and given freedom were those that entailed the ancestral tradition of consolidated state rule. In addition, Marxism viewed religion as feudal. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement institutionalised Protestant Churches in official organizations that renounced foreign funding and foreign control as imperialist. Chinese Catholics resisted the new government's move toward state control and independence of the Vatican. The Cultural Revolution (1966 to 1976) included a systematic effort to destroy religion. The historian Arthur Waldron adds, however, that [...] "communism was, in effect, a religion for its early Chinese converts: more than a sociological analysis, it was a revelation and a prophecy that engaged their entire beings and was expounded in sacred texts, many imported from Moscow and often printed in English".|$|R

They also suppressed Buddhism and Taoism as <b>superstitious</b> <b>religions</b> by destroying the royal Taoist temple and confiscating properties of Buddhist temples. As Inspector General, he impeached many officials for corruption and bribery. According to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, {{it was said that}} no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because of such strict enforcement. [...] He also sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats and their wages. [...] Jo also believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. He was said to judge people by moral character and did not greet superior officials if he considered them of unworthy characters while he was courteous even to his servants. For instance, he formed a friendship with a butcher/tanner of lowest class (baekjeong) who did not even have a name and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a court official. But the tanner repeatedly refused Jo's offer and then disappeared without a trace according to Records of Yeonryeoshil (연려실기술), a collection of official and unofficial history books compiled by Yi Geung-ik in late Joseon Dynasty. (It is said that King Injong, Jungjong's successor who admired his tutor Jo Gwangjo, listed the [...] "tanner" [...] as Chief State Councillor for his future cabinet for he was greatly admired by Jo.) According to famous Korean philosopher Yi I, Jo was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, [...] "Our master is coming." ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose On the {{background}} of China’s turn {{to a market economy}} and a consumer driven society this case study recounts the fortunes of the age-old religion of the Naxi people and their farmer-priests, the dongba. Methodology Detailed ethnography, including participant observation, the collection of life histories and interviews. Findings The might of the tourist industry dominates the changes in the profession of the dongba priests, from a faith-based practice to a tourist-driven service; aided by a confluence of interests of relevant stakeholders: the Chinese state, the provincial governments, the Naxi elite. At the core is the transformation, in Chinese terms, from a <b>superstitious</b> <b>religion</b> to culture heritage. Practical implications Shedding light on a little known aspect of the world’s largest economy is of high relevance to business & management scholars. Social implications The transformation of the dongba demonstrates how major societal changes that happen within a couple of decades affect a society and its economy and a central career track within it. Originality The case study testifies to the encounter of a major modern industry: tourism, with an archaic religion in a remote corner of China, and the transformation of the latter as result...|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>superstitious</b> age, <b>religion</b> was {{a factor}} that may have helped to bridge the divide between Roman and Celtic ways of life to form a Romano-British culture. After the {{destruction}} of the Druids, there is evidence of a mixing of Roman mystery-cults with local Celtic deities, alongside formal Roman cults of the emperor and worship of the Olympian gods. For example, inscriptions to 'Mars Ocelus', a fusion of the Roman god of war with a local deity, have been found at Carlisle. An important collection of 'imperial cult' inscriptions survives at Maryport. A local deity, presumably of the Carvetii, wearing a gated crown, comes from Carlisle. A silver plaque, depicting the local deity Cocidius, has been found at Bewcastle, and the possibility that Brougham may have been linked with the god Belatucadrus has been suggested. There is some sketchy evidence of two non-Roman mystery cults, Mithraism and Christianity, in Roman Cumbria. A tombstone at Carlisle (of Flavius Antigonus Papias), and two others at Maryport and Brougham may have Christian significance. The local dialect word eglus, meaning a church, has survived from Roman times, having been incorporated into the Brythonic language from the Latin ecclesia, showing not only an acceptance of Roman culture among the locals, but also the introduction of Christianity to the region.|$|R
40|$|In early 21 st century, the {{question}} “Is Turkey becoming secularized {{contrary to popular}} belief?” {{was one of the}} discussions occupying Turkish public opinion. These discussions led to the encounter of two different concepts of secularization, “theological (Islamic) ” and "metaphysical", and to put forward different claims using the same concept. Hence, it became evidentwas understood that a discussion was necessary to understand what secularization is and what it is not before starting any debate on Turkey's secularization. That is because the metaphysical discussion that defines secularization as the decline in the social influence of metaphysical realm (religion, religion-like mechanisms, folk <b>religions,</b> <b>superstitious</b> beliefs, etc.) is overshadowed by the Islamic definition describing secularization as "irreligiousness" or "non-Islamism". Therefore, discussingTo understand the social transformation in Turkey, this article attempts to explain that metaphysical rather than theological definition of secularization is necessary for understanding the social implications of the process of modernization...|$|R
50|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that these moves went unnoticed by the English {{government}} and particularly by Thomas Cromwell, {{who had been}} employed by Wolsey in his monastic suppressions, and who was shortly to become Henry VIII's chief minister. However, Henry himself {{appears to have been}} much more influenced by the opinions on monasticism of the humanists Desiderius Erasmus and Thomas More, especially as found in Erasmus's work In Praise of Folly (1511) and More's Utopia (1516). Erasmus and More promoted ecclesiastical reform while remaining faithful Catholics, and had ridiculed such monastic practices as repetitive formal <b>religion,</b> <b>superstitious</b> pilgrimages for the veneration of relics and the accumulation of monastic wealth. Henry appears from the first to have shared these views, never having endowed a religious house and only once having undertaken a religious pilgrimage (to Walsingham in 1511). From 1518, Thomas More was increasingly influential as a royal servant and counsellor, in the course of which his correspondence included a series of strong condemnations of the idleness and vice in much monastic life, alongside his equally vituperative attacks on Luther. Henry himself corresponded continually with Erasmus, prompting him to be more explicit in his public rejection of the key tenets of Lutheranism and offering him church preferment should he wish to return to England.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{you here}} may not {{understand}} this text at all. Some of you, perhaps, may misunderstand it; for {{it is not an}} easy one. Let us, then, begin, by finding out the meaning of each word in it; and, let us first see what is the meaning of the spirit of bondage unto fear. Bondage means slavery; and the spirit of bondage means the spirit which makes men look up to God as slaves do to their taskmaster. Now, a slave obeys his master from fear only; not from love or gratitude. He knows that his master is stronger than he is, and he dreads being beaten and punished by him; and therefore, he obeys him only by compulsion, not of his own good will. This is the spirit of bondage; the slavish, <b>superstitious</b> spirit in <b>religion,</b> into which all men fall, in proportion as they are mean, and sinful, and carnal, fond of indulging themselves, and bearing no love to God or right things. They know that God is stronger than they; they are afraid that God will take away comforts from them if they offend Him; they have been taught that He will cast them into endless torment if they offend Him; and, therefore, they are afraid to do wrong. They love what is wrong, and would like to do it; but they dare not, for fear of God's punishment. They do not really fear God; they only fear punishment, misfortune, death, and hell. That is better, perhaps, than no religion at all. But it is not the faith which WE ought to have.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{both new}} historical research and revised perception of early PMism. It is {{set against the}} absence of any historical account of the coming of Methodism to northern Hampshire. Its aim and method are twofold: to research the events, personalities, beliefs, experience and ethos; and by comparing these findings with popular and academic eulogy and obloquy of PMs to correct them where they do not match the primary sources. This is not primarily an institutional or statistical study of the Connexion, nor of its national leadership, but is a local study of pioneers and ordinary believers {{and the extent to which}} they conform to what might be deemed hagiography or detraction. Having researched the history of the movement, and ascertained that it is homogeneous with the nationwide movement, the thesis argues that much literature, popular and scholarly, has given misleading depictions of the inner world of the movement. Some writers take their admiration too far, or construct a falsely admiring image of PMs in accord with their own priorities. This thesis looks honestly at phenomena omitted in such hagiography. Other writers, misinterpreting the phenomena or motivation, disapprove of certain aspects of the movement. Although the material studied is akin to that used by other scholars, the dissertation aims to contribute a different strand to academic study of the movement, applying its methodology both to a different geographical area, and to the Methodists' subjectivity, seeking thereby to add a component missing from other writings. It first reviews secondary writing which impinges upon the inquiries. The methodology is then explained, including the use of primary sources, and justifying the dissertation’s chronological and geographical parameters. After a summary of the social and religious situation in Hampshire, and an overview of the wider PM movement, there is an account of its spread and ethos in northern Hampshire and of the early stages of transition from the period of rapid expansion to a calmer modus operandi. In the ensuing critical discussion, the ethos of the movement, and the characters of its pioneers and members, are compared with admiring and derogatory depictions, both academic and popular, of Methodists from Victorian to modern times, which portray them as resplendent heroes, enlightened forerunners of feminism, or noble working-class political activists, or as obsessed with hell and judgement, hysterically emotional, clinging to survivals from <b>superstitious</b> folk <b>religion,</b> and gloomily repressive. This dissertation aims to demonstrate that the first generation of PMs in the four circuits of northern Hampshire do not wholly match those depictions, and, by correcting facts or perceptions, to construct a more rounded and faithful portrayal of the life-world, characters and achievements of the preachers and members...|$|R
60|$|All {{energy that}} comes from the whole man is as {{irregular}} as the lightning, for the communicable and forecastable and discoverable is a part only, a hungry chicken under the breast of the pelican, and the test of poetry is not in reason but in a delight not different from the delight that comes to a man at the first coming of love into the heart. I knew an old man who had spent his whole life cutting hazel and privet from the paths, and in some seventy years he had observed little but had many imaginations. He had never seen like a naturalist, never seen things as they are, for his habitual mood had been that of a man stirred in his affairs; and Shakespeare, Tintoretto, though the times were running out when Tintoretto painted, nearly all the great men of the Renaissance, looked at the world with eyes like his. Their minds were never quiescent, never as it were in a mood for scientific observations, always an exaltation, never--to use known words--founded upon an elimination of the personal factor; and their attention and the attention of those they worked for dwelt constantly with what is present to the mind in exaltation. I am too modern fully to enjoy Tintoretto's 'Creation of the Milky Way,' I cannot fix my thoughts upon that glowing and palpitating flesh intently enough to forget, as I can the make-believe of a fairy tale, that heavy drapery hanging from a cloud, though I find my pleasure in King Lear heightened by the make-believe that comes upon it all when the fool says: 'This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time';--and I always find it quite natural, so little does logic in the mere circumstance matter in the finest art, that Richard's and Richmond's tents should be side by side. I saw with delight The Knight of the Burning Pestle when Mr. Carr revived it, and found it none the worse because the apprentice acted a whole play upon {{the spur of the moment}} and without committing a line to heart. When Ben Jonson's Epicoene rammed a century of laughter into the two hours' traffic, I found with amazement that almost every journalist had put logic on the seat, where our lady imagination should pronounce that unjust and favouring sentence her woman's heart is ever plotting, and had felt bound to cherish none but reasonable sympathies and to resent the baiting of that grotesque old man. I have been looking over a book of engravings made in the eighteenth century from those wall-pictures of Herculaneum and Pompeii that were, it seems, the work of journeymen copying from finer paintings, for the composition is always too good for the execution. I find in great numbers an indifference to obvious logic, to all that the eye sees at common moments. Perseus shows Andromeda the death she lived by in a pool, and though the lovers are carefully drawn the reflection is upside down that we may see it the better. There is hardly an old master who has not made known to us in some like way how little he cares for what every fool can see and every knave can praise. The men who imagined the arts were not less <b>superstitious</b> in <b>religion,</b> understanding the spiritual relations, but not the mechanical, and finding nothing that need strain the throat in those gnats the floods of Noah and Deucalion, and in Joshua's moon at Ascalon.|$|R
40|$|Superstitious {{thoughts}} or behaviours {{have been demonstrated}} to occur frequently and persistently among students and athletes. One major limitation in the superstition in sports literature is that researchers attempt to measure only negative superstitious beliefs; however, to date, {{little is known about}} types of superstitions, how superstitions are developed and maintained, their psychological functions and malfunctions, or their behavioural consequences. Study 1 demonstrates the widespread prevalence of superstitions within the present population of undergraduate student athletes in British and Ghanaian universities, and explores several specific superstitions that appear to be particularly common. There were significant main effects of gender and nationality on both positive and negative superstitious beliefs. British student athletes tended to endorse both types of superstition {{to a greater extent than}} Ghanaian student athletes, whereas Ghanaian student athletes engaged in superstitious behaviour more than British student athletes. In Study 2, the results suggested that people may enact their positive <b>superstitious</b> beliefs and <b>religion</b> as coping mechanisms and as secondary control strategies to offer them the comfort of feeling in control under conditions of impending failure. Results from the two qualitative studies (Studies 3 and 4) demonstrated some support for elite footballers’ engaging in rituals which serve a functional outcome. These findings suggest that superstitious and religious behaviour can protect against debilitating interpretations of anxiety by increasing self-confidence or allowing athletes to perceive symptoms as controllable and facilitative. Interestingly, athletes who have acquired their superstition by means of conformity note that they experienced cognitive dissonance. Dissonance emerges when two beliefs are inconsistent. Apparent contraction between an athlete’s personal superstitious behaviour and their teams’ superstitious behaviour may give rise to self-doubt, which can erode the athlete’s confidence and create other negative psychological consequences to team process. Study 5 provided empirical evidence for the notion that activation of personal superstition improved performance more than conforming to other superstitions, and that performance was better than that of athletes in the control group. In this regard, the reported findings uniquely contribute to our understanding of superstitions and their effects on psychological as well as behavioural consequences. The present findings are in line with previous research on the psychological functional benefits of superstition. At the same time, these findings suggest fresh interrogations for future research on the subject of superstitions. Possible applications to the student athletes and professional athletes are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{relation}} between politics and ethics in Spinoza’s philosophy is investigated. Central to Spinoza’s politics is {{the search for the}} right power equilibrium. A good sovereign attempts to restrain the human passions, yet also to safeguard a reasonable amount of freedom. In fact, the purpose of the state is freedom. Now the first question that the thesis addresses, is what kind of freedom Spinoza has in mind here. Just a condition of peace and security, or also the moral freedom of Ethics parts 4 and 5 ? There seems a lot to say for the first answer, as Spinoza’s politics is chiefly occupied with matters of peace and security. However, he also speaks of life in the best state as characterized by ‘reason, the true virtue and life of the mind’. This passage in the Political Treatise echoes the moral ideal of the Ethics, namely that of a free life through an adequate understanding of Nature and our place in it. It is therefore argued in this thesis that Spinoza’s political notions of reason and freedom are ultimately identical with their moral counterparts; they cannot be reduced to (the seeking of) peace and security. The impossibility of such a reduction, it is suggested, becomes especially clear when we read Spinoza’s political writings in conjunction with his analysis of socio-political life in the Ethics. The ground has now been cleared for the second question of the thesis, namely how Spinoza’s ‘politics of freedom’ can be made to work. In the preface to the Political Treatise, Spinoza states that he seeks to develop a political theory that takes humans as they are. Is collective moral freedom not an illusory ideal, then, in the light of this demand of realism? Through a careful analysis of Spinoza´s view of socio-political development, this thesis aims to show that it isn’t. Rational development, it is argued, guides the Spinozist state from the outset. The transition from state of nature to political order is grounded on the passions of fear and hope, combined with a rudimentary kind of reasoning that shows the necessity of a life according to common rules of behaviour. Now the submission to state power starts a dynamics that leads to a mutual rational enhancement between state and citizens. The rationality of the law forces citizens to behave rationally, while rational discussion among them leads to new insights that may be incorporated into the law subsequently. However, this development is not infinite. Though a small philosophical elite may achieve the condition of blessedness that arises from a truly adequate understanding of God, most citizens will only be able to live in a basically rational way, strongly mitigated by their imagination and passions. Now this brings us to the crux of the answer to the thesis´s second question. If, for Spinoza, freedom would only arise insofar as a man has fully adequate ideas, then his politics would be unrealistic indeed – just a few wise men would be able {{to live up to its}} ideal of collective freedom. In this thesis it is argued, however, that a live lived largely in the sphere of the imagination does not exclude the possibility of all moral freedom. In addition to the law, Spinoza thinks, a people is united by a collective identity, which arises from e. g. a shared history and religion. Though these ‘social narratives’ may not represent reality adequately – and thus belong to the domain of the imagination – they are not necessarily devoid of rational components. For instance, if the <b>superstitious</b> elements of <b>religion</b> are removed, there remains a minimal credo. This credo still represents God as anthropomorphic – and thus remains accessible and acceptable for many people – but it is no longer wholly alien to the God of the philosophers. Thus, within narratives like the religious one – i. e. within imaginative frameworks – progress in adequacy can be made. This implies that a substantial realisation of collective moral freedom is not a political illusion, provided that we adopt a more inclusive approach towards Spinoza´s conception of freedom...|$|R
