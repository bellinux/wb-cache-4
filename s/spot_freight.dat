The empirical results suggest that the dynamics of the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate in the oil transportation market can best be described by a non-linear stochastic model. We show that the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate is mean reverting only in the extremes of the empirical range and that the volatility of the freight rate changes increases with the level of the freight rate. The former result, which implies that the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate process behaves like a Martingale over most of its empirical range, can explain why non-stationarity is difficult to reject over short samples, yet the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate process is globally mean reverting as implied by maritime economic theory.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{virtually}} any contract or asset in bulk shipping depends {{primarily on the}} stochastic dynamics of the forward freight rate curve. In {{the absence of a}} liquid and transparent market for forward freight agreements, the dynamics of the forward freight rate curve must be derived from the dynamics of the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate and the risk premium in the freight market. This thesis is an attempt to improve our understanding of the stochastic dynamics of freight rates and the nature and sources of risk in the freight markets. Two new <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate models are proposed and estimated, applying nonparametric estimation in an effort to avoid misspecification. It is found that while a one-factor Markovian model can capture the mean reversion and level effect in the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate very well, an extension to a multi-factor non-Markovian model is required in order to account for the observed lag effects in the conditional mean and variance. New theory governing the risk premium in the freight markets is proposed, which suggests that the theoretical risk premium should be time varying and, in general, depend {{on the state of the}} freight market and the duration of the period charter in a systematic fashion. Empirical tests suggest that the implied risk premium changes over time, but are not able to confirm the dependence on the state of the <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> market. by Road Os. Adland.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} literature, {{empirical}} tests of stationarity of freight rates often conclude that <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rates are non-stationary processes.

Furthermore, this raises an important question about the direction of their relationship. Despite the plethora of studies on micro and macro economic determinants of freight rates, there have been no studies addressing these issues. Hence, this paper undertakes such an investigation using Co-integration analysis, VAR based Granger Causality tests and Impulse Response analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relative risks involved in owning and operating tanker vessels of different sizes in world spot and time-charter (TC) markets. Cointegrating Error Correction ARCH models are used to model spot and TC rates for each ship size and the associated time varying risks involved. The advantage of using this class of models for analysis is that the error correction term can capture the short-run dynamic behaviour of rates, while the estimation of time varying volatilities allows for the explicit comparison of risks at each point in time. Indeed, levels and patterns of freight risk are shown to vary over time. Broadly, comparison of these risks across markets point to TC rates having lower volatilities in comparison to the <b>spot</b> rates, and <b>freight</b> rates of larger vessels having higher volatilities compared to the freight volatilities of smaller vessels. Thus, for risk averse owners, wishing to reduce risks, results suggest operating tanker ships in TC rather than spot markets, and using smaller size vessels to diversify the higher risks involved in owning and operating larger size vessels.

40|$|Analyzing the {{interactions}} between <b>spot</b> and forward <b>freight</b> agreement (FFA) prices in the dry bulk shipping is important as they {{play a significant role}} for shipping companies to secure their profits and avoid potential risks in the volatile market. By applying the vector autoregression (VAR) and the vector error correction model (VECM), this paper identifies the long-run and mutual causal relationship between the spot and FFA prices on the BPI T/C and BCI C 7 routes. Along with these cointegrating rates, exogenous factors such as the market demand and supply and some economic indices are also recognized as contributing variables for the dynamic movement of the spot and FFA prices. Importantly, the mean-reverting process is justified on both routes with different mechanisms. When the spot and FFA prices deviate from their equilibrium level in the short run, they will be adjusted to their long-run equilibrium more directly and clearly on the BPI T/C route than those on the BCI C 7 route. It also indicates that this adjusting power has direction and size asymmetries on both routes. In addition, the impulse analysis indicates that the spot rate is more volatile than its corresponding FFA prices confronting innovations. The results of this study provide a reference to the participants in the dry bulk shipping market on the causes of fluctuation in spot and FFA prices and their interactions, which can be used to promote the risk management in the market.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{realistic}} and flexible approach concerning the forecast of tanker freight rates in a pre-determined number of tanker routes. We aim to do this by using certain analytical techniques. In general, tanker freight rates can reflect the global socio-economical and environmental-oriented situation of various aspects of maritime transport market and practices. Moreover, {{the development of a}} realistic and event-driven way in order to achieve acceptable forecasts is in position to further analyze and promote the actual role of such parameters (e. g. tanker freight rates etc). By using the term event-driven we refer to possible maritime market (e. g. tanker rates) reaction to a (local) warfare, to an international embargo, to the enforcement of new regulations etc. Thus, the specific tanker routes were selected with regional, volume and cargo type criteria; this means that they can adequately cover some of the important oil maritime flows in a world-wide scale. We aim to accomplish the aforementioned task by implementing a detailed single-parameter time series model analysis and certain supportive explanatory models. In this way, we formulate an operational and practical framework capable to support a possible corresponding effort for decision making in this cognitive area. The key issue of this effort is to structure a logical-realistic approach to model the recorded fluctuations of tanker freight market. The proposed methodology is applied to forecasting the <b>spot</b> and period <b>freight</b> rates of tankers up to 30. 000, 130. 000, and 250. 000 tn dwt, using as input among others the supply, demand and the number of laid up ships (ranging from 10. 000 to 39. 999 tn dwt).

40|$|This thesis uses econometric {{modelling}} and forecasting {{to investigate a}} number of important topics associated with economic and financial aspects of the global shipping market. The thesis is made up of five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the structure of the shipping market; it covers a wide range of topics, including the shipping sub-markets, shipping stock and shipping market information. It introduces the different types of freight rates involved, and discusses the economics behind the formation of <b>spot</b> and time-charter <b>freight</b> rates. It also introduces the new-build ship market and explains some of the different shipbuilding models. In addition, it discusses the market for second-hand ships. Finally, it reports and discusses the correlations of different shipping variables {{with each other and with}} the S&P 500 stock market index. Chapter 2 focuses on forecasting the freight rate for ship operators. Since time-charter rates depend on market participants’ expectations about future spot rates, under market efficiency the ship operator should not be able to make abnormal profits by choosing a specific chartering strategy. The chapter investigates whether this is true by exploring the economic value of freight rate forecasts, using a regression-based recursive switching approach based on two sets of macroeconomic and commodity data. The ship operator is assumed to allocate the ship between a trip-charter and time-charter market according to forecasts of the quarterly excess freight rate. The Handymax and Capesize classes of ship are analysed, the analysis showing that this type of investment strategy does not generate significantly abnormal profits for the Handymax class, but does for the Capesize class. Forecasting with commodity variables is more profitable than forecasting with macroeconomic variables. Chapter 3 quantifies and discusses the volatility of index returns in the dry bulk freight rate market for freight traders and investors. The daily freight rate indexes of three ship classes, Baltic dry index (BDI), Baltic Panamax index (BPI) and Baltic Capesize index (BCI) from 14 January 2000 to 14 January 2010 are analysed. Some of the findings from applying variations of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models suggest that the volatility of shocks is very persistent and that a unit root might exist in the conditional variance. No evidence of any asymmetry in the conditional variance is found. Volatility forecasting for one day ahead and multiple days ahead is also performed using a variety of ARCH models. At the end of the chapter the risk exposure of the freight rate index is assessed using the Value at Risk (VaR) technique. In Chapter 4 it is argued that if risk premiums are time-varying and correlated with macroeconomic variables, macroeconomic variables might have forecasting power for shipping stock returns. This issue is investigated using the recursive regression-based approach of Pesaran and Timmermann (1995) and it is concluded that allowing for different combinations of macroeconomic variables generally does not help forecasting. This may be because the model selection criteria do not seem to work efficiently when there is a structural break in the data. The model which includes all variables (AV) is found to be the best performing model. A data set is employed which includes four shipping stocks and the S&P 500 index for comparison, and this shows that a trading strategy using the AV model generates 93 % to 500 % more wealth than a buy-and-hold strategy. When the explanatory variables are analysed individually, the US Treasury bill and NYMEX oil price are shown to have the most forecasting power. Chapter 5 concludes the thesis. It presents a review of the original findings and puts forward recommendations for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In general empirical maritime literature suggest, non-stationary of freight price-levels, contrast to maritime theory, which implies that in perfect competitive conditions, freight rates revert to a long-run mean. Working from the postulate that freight earnings switch between two distinct states, a high volatility state and a low volatility state, we propose a multi-state Markov-switching regime framework. The inclusion of addition states is to identify structure-breaks and shifts in tanker earnings and volatilities levels. Empirical findings are aligned with maritime economic theory, in regards to freights being mean reverting and stationary.

The {{purpose of this article}} is to investigate spillover effects and dynamic correlations between shipping spot and derivatives markets (tanker forward freight agreement, FFA) under the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity framework. Empirical results show that spillovers in returns are unilateral from one-month FFA to spot markets, while they are bilateral between one-month and two-month FFA markets. However, insignificant mean spillovers between spot and two-month FFA markets are found. Volatility spillover effects among one-month FFA, two-month FFA and <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> markets are bilateral. By analysing the correlation between different markets, highly persistent and significantly volatile correlations are found. Moreover, time-varying correlations between one-month and two-month FFA markets are much higher than those of between spot and each FFA market.

The PI can be seen as the interconnection of logistics networks via open PI-hubs.

Carriers can bid for these requests using short-term contracts. In a dynamic, stochastic environment like this, a major concern for carriers is how to propose prices for requests to maximise their revenue. The latter is determined by the proposed price and the probability of winning the request at that price. This paper proposes a dynamic pricing model based on an auction mechanism to optimise the carrier’s bid price. An experimental study is conducted in which two pricing strategies are proposed and assessed: a unique bidding price (one unique price for all requests at an auction), and a variable bidding price (price for each request at an auction). Three influencing factors are also investigated: quantity of requests, carrier capacity, and cost.

40|$|Investing in {{the tanker}} market, {{especially}} in the VLCC sector constitutes a risky undertaking due to the volatility of tanker freight rates. This paper attempts to uncover the benefits of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in forecasting VLCC <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rates. This is achieved by analysing the period from October 1979 to December 2002, in order to detect possible causes of fluctuations, thus determine the independent variables of the analysis, and then use them to construct reliable ANNs. The aim is to reduce error and, most important, allow the model to maintain a stable error variance during high volatility periods. Among the findings are: ANNs can, with the appropriate architecture and training, constitute valuable decision-making tools especially when the tanker market is volatile; the use of variables in differential form enhances the ANN performance in high volatility periods while variables in normal form demonstrated better performance in median periods; ANN demonstrated mean errors comparable to the naïve model for 1 -month forecasts but significantly outperformed it in the 3 -, 6 -, 9 - and 12 -month cases; finally, the use of informative variables such as the arbitrage between types of crude oil as well as Capesize rates can improve ANN performance.

By holding these hedge ratios through an out-of-sample period, we find that the hedge efficiency is not robust {{for the majority of the}} contracts. This is likely due to time varying covariance between freight rate returns and FFA returns, in addition to changing variance in FFA returns. Our findings suggests that the conventional method of calculating optimal hedge ratios does not outperform a naive hedge. Furthermore, we find that FFA prices are unbiased predictors of subsequent <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rates in 42 of 50 contracts across the four segments.

Our results suggest that the market rate proxy for a standardised vessel is dominant in terms of explanatory power, and our findings show no evidence for an efficiency premium after controlling for macro-, contract- and ship-specific variables. Secondly, seeking to circumvent the problems, which the market rate proxy presents, we construct a new market indicator from microdata. We control for contract- and ship-specific variables, as well as time, charter and owner fixed effects, and we find weak evidence for a two-tier market where energy-efficient vessels attract a premium in the freight rates. In a separate analysis, we examine whether fuel-inefficient vessels, which in theory should have a competitive disadvantage against more efficient ships, compensate by slowing down their speed. By estimating a multiple regression model with macro- and ship-specific variables, our findings suggest that energy-inefficient vessels tend to correspond to higher operational speed...|$|E
40|$|Trucking industry, the {{business}} of transporting products via trucks, {{is vital to the}} health of our economy for the sheer number of people it employs, the value of product it hauls, and the diversity of dispatching models it uses. One of these dispatching models is the spot dispatching. This form of dispatching went through a recent transformation {{as a result of the}} industry deregulation in the 80 s and the emergence of the internet. The deregulation allowed easier establishment of new trucking companies and their access to the entire market; the internet allowed for <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> to be posted on the on-line hosting sites where shippers, brokers and truckers can post their service. This change, however, brings with it challenges and opportunities which is the focus of this dissertation. In this dissertation, we give a broad introduction of the freight spot-market; we identify the challenges and the opportunities. Spot-market dispatching problem is formulated as a dynamic assignment problem, implemented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which has its objective as maximizing the operation profit at the end of the dispatching planning horizon. A freight spot-market loads generation platform is created to mimic the dynamics of trucks and loads in such markets. Platform allows generation of data representing different market settings. Approximate dynamic programming methods are proposed to solve the dispatching problem. To address the curse of MDP state-space dimensionality for real-world settings, Neural Networks were used to approximate the value function. We benchmark our methods with local and myopic policies typically used be dispatchers in {{the business}}. Load hosting sites offer information about available loads and trucks across the market. We also explore the use of such information into dispatching policies and study its effect on the overall performance...|$|E
40|$|Containerization {{has emerged}} as the {{favourable}} method in ocean transport as it is able to transport cargoes worldwide with low cost. Liner service is the concept which develops as the concept that provides scheduled transport service. At the latter development, it also provides intermodal service which combine ocean and inland transportation. Shippers and carriers, as two main stakeholders in container shipping commonly engage in service contract with agreed price and volume. However, this arrangement is vulnerable to contract default due to the fluctuation of <b>spot</b> <b>freight</b> rate which challenge the commitment of both parties and their ingenuity to avoid loss and/or gain profit from the situation. Index-Linked Contract (ILC) is concept that is introduced as one of alternatives in conducting service contract between shippers and carriers. With this concept, the contract price is adjusted by agreed indices and mechanism instead of fixed. This dissertation is focusing on the perception and future development of ILC form shippers and carriers point of view. The study objectives are met by conducting extensive literature review as well as gathering empirical data. Qualitative method is applied in this research by undertaking survey to companies which represents targeted group. The survey is conducted by interviewing key personnel in respective companies regarding the study objectives. Based on the findings, it is found that the concept is flexible and has diverse method to be applied based on the intended outcome, one of which is to be coupled with hedging tools to obtain predictable rates. However, as the concept is still considerably new, many shippers and liner operators are still hesitating in implementing the concept. Although it cannot solve current contractual problem completely, ILC can be perceived as alternative in contracting in liner container shipping. Finally, it is suggested to conduct more researches in the impact of commodity values specific commodities and trade routes with the implementation of ILC. Further investigation about the implication of regulation such as EU Commission in Competition and OSRA is equally important. CoMEMHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
