Die Bildung von unerwuenschten Reaktionsphasen an den Grenzflaechen der Brennstoffzelle kann zur Degradation der Zelle beitragen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde die chemische Kompatibilitaet an den Grenzflaechen zwischen Loten und den Werkstoffen der Komponenten der Hochtemperaturbrennstoffzelle untersucht. Zur Untersuchung der chemischen Wechselwirkungen wurden Pulvermischungen aus den pulverisierten Glasloten und den Komponenten der Brennstoffzelle (8 YSZ, Ni, Stahl, 1. 4742, oder Cr 5 Fe 1 Y 203) hergestellt. Die Pulvermischungen wurden bei 900 C- 1000 C in oxidierender oder reduzierender Atmosphaere ausgelagert und anschliessend die Reaktionsphasen bestimmt. Zur Bestimmung der Kinetik der Reaktion wurden Werkstoffverbunde hergestellt, ausgelagert und nachfolgend mit EDX/REM untersucht. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass Glaslote, die MgO enthalten, zu einer niedrigeren Reaktivitaet neigen als Glaslote, die CaO oder BaO enthalten. In einigen Glasloten kam es zur Bildung einer Reaktionsschicht, dessen Wachstumskonstante bestimmt wurde. Zusaetzlich wurden Werkstoffverbunde unter Einfluss eines elektrischen Feldes ausgelagert und nachfolgend untersucht. Die Unterschiede zwischen der Diffusionsrate von Kationen an der positiv- und der negativ geladenen Seite ist meistens vernachlaessigbar klein. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Aluminosilikatglaslote ein hohes Potential fuer die Entwicklung der Brennstoffzelle besitzen. (orig.) For the SOFC {{fuel cell}} of planar cell design, {{gas-tight}} materials are required as cell sealing materials. Formation of unwanted reaction phases at the interfaces {{of the fuel}} cell may lead to fuel cell degradation. The objective of the work reported {{was to examine the}} chemical compatibility of materials at the interfaces between the seals and the components of the SOFC. For examination of the chemical interactions, mixtures of powdered materials of the <b>solder</b> <b>glasses</b> and the fuel cell components (8 YSZ, Ni, steel, 1. 4742, or Cr 5 Fe 1 Y 2 O 3) were prepared. The powdered mixtures were hardened at 900 C - 1000 C in an oxidising or reducing atmosphere, and the reaction phases were analysed. For determination of the reaction kinetics, composite materials were fabricated, hardened, and examined by means of EDX/REM. It was found that <b>solder</b> <b>glasses</b> containing MgO shw a lower reactivity than those containing CaO or BaO. With some <b>solder</b> <b>glasses,</b> formation of reaction layers was observed, and their growth constants could be determined.

40|$|No {{solution}} for the problem of joining aluminium nitride ceramics by means of solder glass is known from the literature. In joining AlN ceramics by means of oxidic glasses, an oxidizing attack of the ceramic phase has to be expected leading {{to a reduction in}} strength of the joined parts due to bubble formation in the joining zone. The objective of the research project was to select a glass system with a minimal oxidizing attack and to optimize its composition in terms of its thermal expansion behavior. The oxygen partial pressure in the glass was to be reduced by adding reducing agents. It was shown that an addition of 2 to 5 wt% Si powder to glass powders of the system SiO_ 2 -Al_ 2 O_ 3 -RO decisively minimizes the bubble formation in the joining zone. By means of a computer program developed {{within the framework of the}} project, glass compositions can be calculated which are adapted to a relatively wide range of thermal expansion coefficients of AlN ceramics. First joining experiments carried out with such modified glass powders produced a strength of approx. 30 % of that of the AlN ceramics.

Vacuum glazing is a vital development in the move to more energy efficient buildings. In vacuum glazing, an evacuated cavity supresses gaseous conduction and convection to provide high thermal resistance.

Specimens of tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP) and aluminum toughened zirconia (ATZ) were modified with <b>glass</b> <b>solder</b> matrices in two configurations which mainly consisted of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, K 2 O, and Na 2 O.

Hence, we introduced a new technique to bond titanium and ceramic materials by means of a silica-based <b>glass</b> ceramic <b>solder.</b> Cylindrical compound samples (Ø 10 mm × 56 mm) made of alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ), as well as titanium grade 5, were bonded by <b>glass</b> <b>solder</b> on their end faces.

In contrast to the glued samples, the bending strength of the soldered samples remained unaltered by the storage and aging treatments.

40|$|Vacuum glazing {{is a form}} of low-conductance {{double glazing}} using in {{internal}} vacuum between the two glass sheets to eliminate heat transport by gas conduction and convection. An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused <b>solder</b> <b>glass</b> forms the edge seal. Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the bonded edge seal. Edge conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation. Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, recessed edges, and framing materials. Experimentally validated finite-element and finite-difference modeling tools were used for thermal analysis of prototype vacuum glazing units and complete windows.

50|$|Glass frit bonding, also {{referred}} to as <b>glass</b> <b>soldering</b> or seal <b>glass</b> bonding, describes a wafer bonding technique with an intermediate glass layer. It is a widely used encapsulation technology for surface micro-machined structures, e.g., accelerometers or gyroscopes. This technique utilizes low melting glass ("glass solder") and therefore provides various advantages including that viscosity of glass decreases with an increase of temperature. The viscous flow of glass has effects to compensate and planarize surface irregularities, convenient for bonding wafers with a high roughness due to plasma etching or deposition. A low viscosity promotes hermetically sealed encapsulation of structures based on a better adaption of the structured shapes. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass material is adapted to silicon. This results in low stress in the bonded wafer pair.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (1) a monitoring method for monitoring an operated or operable test piece for material defects at temperatures above 650 degrees Celsius; and (2) a manufacturing method for manufacturing a monitoring device. USE - Monitoring device for monitoring a test piece for material defects. ADVANTAGE - The ultrasonic transducer has a high temperature piezo material, which is durably applicable to temperatures above approximately 650 degrees Celsius, and the coupling device has a <b>glass</b> or <b>glass</b> <b>solder</b> joint, which serves as coupling medium and as mechanical fastener, and hence ensures continuous monitoring at high temperatures of the test pieces...|$|R
