40|$|RuO 2 electrocatalysts were {{synthesized}} and {{characterized for}} the oxygen evolution reaction in a Solid Polymer Electrolyte (<b>SPE)</b> <b>electrolyzer.</b> The catalysts were prepared by a colloidal preparation procedure and thermal treatment at different temperatures from 200 to 350 ºC. The material characterization {{was carried out}} by XRD, TG-DSC and TEM analyses. The RuO 2 catalysts were sprayed onto a Nafion 115 membrane with a loading of 3 mg cm- 2. A Pt catalyst was used at the cathode compartment with a loading of 0. 6 mg cm- 2. The electrochemical activity of MEAs was investigated in a single SPE cell and in a conventional three-electrode half-cell by using linear voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The maximum current density at high potential (1. 8 V) was obtained for RuO 2 calcined at 300 °C for 1 h. The chronoamperometric measurements shown that the most stable catalyst was the RuO 2 calcined at 300 °C for 3 h...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen-oxygen SPE {{fuel cells}} and SPE electrolyzers (products of Hamilton Standard) both use a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) {{as the sole}} electrolyte. The SPE cells have {{demonstrated}} a ten year life capability under load conditions. Ultimate life of PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers is primarily related to the chemical stability of the membrane. For perfluorocarbon proton-exchange membranes an accurate measure of the membrane stability is the fluoride loss rate. Millions of cell hours have contributed to establishing a relationship between fluroride loss rates and average expected ultimate cell life. Several features were introduced into SPE fuel cells and SPE electrolyzers such that applications requiring {{greater than or equal}} to 100, 000 hours of life can be considered. Equally important as the ultimate life is the voltage stability of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells and electrolyzers. Here again the features of SPE fuel cells and SPE electrolyzers have shown a cell voltage stability in the order of 1 microvolt per hour. That level of stability were demonstrated for tens of thousands of hours in SPE fuel cells at up to 500 amps per square foot (ASF) current density. The SPE electrolyzers have demonstrated the same at 1000 ASF. Many future extraterrestrial applications for fuel cells require that they be self recharged. To translate the proven SPE cell life and stability into a highly reliable extraterrestrial electrical energy storage system, a simplification of supporting equipment is required. Static phase separation, static fluid transport and static thermal control will be most useful in producting required system reliability. Although some 200, 000 SPE fuel cell hours were recorded in earth orbit with static fluid phase separation, no <b>SPE</b> <b>electrolyzer</b> has, as yet, operated in space...|$|E
40|$|During the 1970 's, the Solid Polymer Electrolyte (<b>SPE)</b> water <b>electrolyzer,</b> {{which uses}} ion {{exchange}} membranes as its sole electrolyte, {{was developed for}} nuclear submarine metabolic oxygen production. <b>SPE</b> water <b>electrolyzer</b> developments included operation at up to 3, 000 psia and at current densities in excess of 1, 000 amps per square foot.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define characteristics of a Regenerative Fuel Cell System (RFCS) for low earth orbit Space Station missions. The RFCS's were defined and characterized based on both an alkaline electrolyte fuel cell integrated with an alkaline electrolyte water electrolyzer and an alkaline electrolyte fuel cell integrated with an acid solid polymer electrolyte (<b>SPE)</b> water <b>electrolyzer.</b> The study defined the operating characteristics of the systems including system weight, volume, and efficiency. A maintenance philosophy was defined and the implications of system reliability requirements and modularization were determined. Finally, an Engineering Model System was defined and a program to develop and demonstrate the EMS and pacing technology items that should be developed in parallel with the EMS were identified. The specific weight of an optimized RFCS operating at 140 F was defined as a function of system efficiency for a range of module sizes.
