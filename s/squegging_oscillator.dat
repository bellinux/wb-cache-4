50|$|A {{solution}} was eventually provided by EMI who {{had developed a}} new type of transmitter that was not based on the common self exciting principle. Instead, a separate <b>squegging</b> <b>oscillator</b> was used to produce pulses of the carrier signal using a timer. This timer also muted down the receiver, solving the ringing issue. Minimum range was reduced to about 400 feet. The resulting AI Mk. IV went into production in July 1940 and all units were sent to newly arriving Bristol Beaufighters. The Beaufighter/AI Mk. IV achieved its first victory on the night of 15/16 November 1940, when an aircraft from No. 604 destroyed a Junkers Ju 88A-5 near Chichester.|$|E
50|$|Squegging is a radio {{engineering}} term. It is the abbreviation of self-quenching. A <b>squegging</b> or self-blocking <b>oscillator</b> produces an intermittent or changing output signal. Wildlife tags for birds and little mammals use <b>squegging</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The Armstrong super-regenerative radio receiver uses a self-blocking oscillator, too. The receiver sensitivity rises while the oscillation builds up. The oscillation stops when the operation point no longer fulfills the Barkhausen stability criterion. The blocking oscillator recovers {{to the initial}} state and the cycle starts again.The receive frequency of the Armstrong Super-Regenerative receiver was some hundred kilohertz. The self-quenching frequency was ten kilohertz, just above the highest audio frequency the headphone could reproduce.|$|R
