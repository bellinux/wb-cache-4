An example is a server chassis that has three power supplies; the system may be set to 2+1 redundancy so that the blades can enjoy the power of two PSUs and have one available to give redundancy if one fails. It is also common to mix live (hot) redundancy where PSUs are online, and cold <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> where they are offline until needed. The reason for this, in the case of PSUs, is that a common failure mode is component's end-of-life failure, and if PSUs are equally used, then they are highly likely to fail within a short space of time of each other when toward the end of service life.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two {{commonly}} used types of redundancies - <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> and active or parallel redundancy. In <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy,</b> a redundant component is attached {{in such a way}} that it starts functioning immediately after the failure of the component to which it is attached. Parallel redundancy is used when it is difficult or not possible to replace the failed components during operation of the system. The redundant components are connected in parallel with the components of the system, and they function simultaneously with the original components. In this paper, the active or parallel redundancy at component level is considered to increase the system life stochastically. It has been noted in Barlow and Proschan [1] that in the case of active redundancy, component-wise redundancy works much better than the system-wise redundancy.|$|E

Applying protection cycles (known as p-cycles) in meshed network has recently been shown to provide good protection against failures in both network links and nodes.

Increasing the density of meshing in such networks and applying p-cycle protection may prove more cost efficient than traditional protection by <b>standby</b> node <b>redundancy.</b> Swarm intelligence is a distributed system construction concept which has shown promising results when applied to problems within the area of network and operational management.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{interferometry}} in space {{depends on the}} development of lasers that can survive launch conditions and the challenging space environment during missions that could last five years or more. This paper describes the fabrication of a rugged, laser-welded package for a 200 mW, monolithic diode-pumped solid-state Nd:YAG laser operating at 13 19 nm. Environmental testing shows that the laser withstands non-operational thermal cycles over a temperature range from- 20 °C to 55 "C, and 22. 3 g-rms of random vibration, with little or no degradation of laser output power or performance. The novel packaging method employs a specially designed housing to which multi-mode or single-mode polarization-maintaining fiber pigtails can be aligned and laser-welded into place. To further enhance reliability, a redundant pumping system called the Multi-Fiber Pump Ferrule (MFPF) was developed and implemented. The MFPF allows multiple laser diode pump modules to be aligned to the laser crystal simultaneously, in order to accommodate either parallel or <b>standby</b> pump <b>redundancy.</b> This compact, lightweight design is well suited for space flight applications and the laser-welded technique can easily be adapted to a number of other fiber optic and electro-optic devices in which critical optical alignments must be maintained in a harsh environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an area-efficient {{register}} transfer level technique for gracefully degradable data path synthesis called phantom redundancy. In contrast to spare-based approaches, phantom redundancy is a recovery technique {{that does not}} use any <b>standby</b> spares. Phantom <b>redundancy</b> uses extra interconnect to make the resulting data path reconfigurable {{in the presence of}} any (single) functional unit failure. When phantom redundancy is combined with a concurrent error detection technique, concurrent error detection followed by reconfiguration is automatic. We developed a register transfer level synthesis algorithm that incorporates phantom redundancy constraints. There is a tight interdependence between reconfiguration of a (faulty) data path and scheduling and operation-to-operator binding tasks during register transfer level synthesis. We developed a genetic algorithm based register transfer level synthesis approach to incorporate phantom redundancy constraints. The algorithm minimizes the performance degradation of the synthesized data path in the presence of any single faulty functional unit. The effectiveness of the technique and the algorithm are illustrated using high level synthesis benchmarks...|$|R

Hence, when the main module fails, the spare module’s activation takes {{a certain amount of time}} to be activated. This time period is named mean time to activate (TACT). As the spare component is switched off, it is considered that it does not fail until becoming operational.|$|E
40|$|In most {{research}} on redundancy allocation problem (RAP), the redundancy strategy for each subsystem {{is assumed to}} be predetermined and fixed. This paper focuses on a specific RAP with multiple strategy choices (RAP-MSC), in which both active redundancy and cold <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> can be selected as an additional decision variable for individual subsystems. To do so, the component type, redundancy strategy and redundancy level for each subsystem should be chosen subject to the system constraints appropriately such that the system reliability is maximized. Meanwhile, imperfect switching for cold <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> is considered and a k-Erlang distribution is introduced to model the time-to-failure component as well. Given the importance and complexity of RAP-MSC, we propose a new efficient simplified version of particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to solve such NP-hard problems. In this method, a new position updating scheme without velocity is presented with stochastic disturbance and a low probability. Moreover, it is compared with several well-known PSO variants and other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature to evaluate its performance. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of SPSO as an alternative for solving the RAP-MSC...|$|E

As compared to segregated <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> and whole system <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy,</b> such method provides preservation of all unit functions {{in case of}} redundancy and gives the possibility for continuous monitoring of major and redundant elements. Example of that unit is given. Electric motor drive control channel block diagram contains two control units – the major and redundant; it also contains four power supply units. Control units programming was carried out using automata-based approach. Electric motor drive control channel model was developed; it provides complex simulation of control state-machine and power converter. Through visibility and hierarchy of finite state machines debug time was shortened as compared to traditional programming. Control state-machine description using hardware description language is required for its synthesis with FPGA-devices vendor design software.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{investigations}} undertaken into the reliability, availability {{and maintenance of}} offshore wind farms when considering different maintenance strategies, an understanding of which is fundamental when considering the technical and economical viability of existing and future offshore wind farms. A comprehensive literature review has been undertaken {{in the areas of}} offshore wind farm maintenance strategies, offshore wind turbine reliability and accessibility issues, and CO 2 emissions associated with maintenance expeditions for offshore wind farms. The limitations and disadvantages of current maintenance practices are identified and a planned intervention maintenance policy is proposed and examined in detail. To help design a planned intervention maintenance policy, the offshore wind farm parameters that affect its technical and economical viability have been identified, which become the foundation for developing computer based models using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the maintenance practices of the planned intervention maintenance policy. Different scenarios of the proposed solution are investigated to help quantify the technical and economical benefits over the current maintenance practises, in terms of wind farm availability, cumulative energy output, production cost of energy and CO 2 emissions. The research on the reliability of offshore wind turbines has shown that the power converter system is a critical item that suffers from high failure rates. This thesis reports upon the investigation of a hot <b>standby</b> <b>redundancy</b> on the wind turbine power converter system.

40|$|In {{this article}} we develop a {{bounding}} procedure which is applied in an algorithm for determining the number of back-up components to include in a series system. Operating only when original units fail, back-up components increase system reliability. They also add weight, take up space, and cost money. Maximizing the reliability of nuclear power plants, ships, aircraft, life support systems and electronic instruments leads to this class of resource allocation problem. Because the procedure requires only {{that the rate of}} failure of individual components remains constant or increases with time, the algorithm can accommodate a wide variety of failure probability distributions.
