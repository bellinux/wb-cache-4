30|$|Choi and Cardie (2009) integer linear {{programming}} approach is suggested {{to change the}} polarity of terms {{on the basis of}} word and expression level constraints.

50|$|In German service, a loader {{position}} {{was added to}} the turret by reducing the ammunition capacity by 18 rounds.

40|$|Summary. In {{order to}} {{integrate}} new security protocols, existing systems must <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly,</b> which often means interrupting system activity. We propose {{a solution to}} this problem by developing an ontology model which provides semantic to security protocol operations. The proposed model is based on a formal specification model and is integrated in existing Web service description technologies. ...|$|R
50|$|Leaves {{can also}} store food and water, and <b>are</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly</b> {{to meet these}} functions, for example in the leaves of {{succulent}} plants and in bulb scales. The concentration of photosynthetic structures in leaves requires that they be richer in protein, minerals, and sugars than, say, woody stem tissues. Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the diet of many animals.|$|R

50|$|The {{first four}} {{locomotives}} of this design, later to be designated Class 6Z by the South African Railways (SAR), {{were placed in}} service in 1901. They displayed {{a tendency to be}} unsteady at speed and the design <b>was</b> therefore <b>modified</b> to a 2-6-4 Adriatic type wheel arrangement. Another four locomotives which incorporated this improvement were ordered in 1902, while the first four locomotives <b>were</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1902, {{the first}} coins of King Edward VII's coinage was issued. The 1902 5¢ coin is of {{interest}} to collectors, as its design includes the outmoded St. Edward's Crown instead of the Imperial State Crown. These coins were hoarded upon being issued, as the public believed that an error had been made. In 1903, the design on the 5¢ <b>was</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly.</b>|$|R

The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment, on grounds that they violated freedom of speech, and the final form of the law <b>was</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly.</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, Eqs. (2), (3) and (4) can {{be applied}} to only one of Chang’s equations. The applicability of Chang’s equation depends on whether the pile is embedded in the ground or not.

As a result, the corresponding performance functions should <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> <b>accordingly.</b> In this case, the MPP-based approach is not suitable for reliability analysis.|$|R
