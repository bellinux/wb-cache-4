Moreover, the load currents are kept balanced even during the fault in order to demonstrate the potential application of the MMC as a power oscillation firewall of some sort; i. e., to simultaneously keep constant DC power and balanced load currents at all time...|$|E
40|$|As {{elsewhere}} in the world, also in the Netherlands utilities face {{an increase in the}} actual and future short-circuit current levels at all voltages. This development is provoked by the required increase in transmission capacity as well as the concentration of power generation capacity. Large electricity production sites are moved to peripheral locations, thus overstressing the local transmission networks with respect to both the transmission capacity and the short-circuit power withstand capability. Dispersed power generation facilities, like windmills and co-generation plants for greenhouses, tend to appear in the same (optimal) neighborhoods, thus overstressing the local distribution and subtransmission networks. In the paper the development of short-circuit currents in the Dutch 400 kV-grid is illustrated. In addition, some particular aspects of the short-circuit currents will be addressed: three-phase and <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>fault</b> currents, DC-time constants, peak values, contributions from transformers and distributed generators.

The model includes the modeling of input filter, sample and Fourier fundamental frequency detector, which process the input for mho distance relay model. A number of simulations of single line to ground faults (SLGF) with different fault locations were carried out to verify the correct operation of the relay based on the developed protection scheme. The results of the simulation show the operation of the relay based on its protection scheme and its response time related to the fault locations. The study is also extended to the double line to ground fault for the same purpose. The second part of the thesis discusses the model for an electromechanical mho distance relay, which includes the modeling of current transformer (CT) and capacitive voltage transformer (CVT). A validated ninth-order mathematical model of the electromechanical Mho distance relay is constructed in ATP - EMTP to observe the dynamic behavior of the relay during a critical fault.

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} {{developments}} in semiconductors and control equipment, Voltage Source Converter based High Voltage Direct Current (VSC-HVDC) becomes a promising technology for grid connection of large offshore wind farms. The VSC-HVDC provides a number of potential advantages over the conventional HVDC, such as rapid and independent control of reactive and active power, black-start capability and no restriction on multiple infeeds. Therefore, VSC-HVDC will likely to be widely used in the future transmission networks and for offshore wind power connections. Multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (VSC-MTDC) system, which consists {{of more than two}} voltage source converter stations connecting together through a DC link, is able to increase the flexibility and reliability of transmission systems. It allows connection of multiple offshore wind farms to the AC grid. In this thesis, a three-terminal MTDC system was investigated using simulations and experiments. MTDC system with its control was implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. The control strategy developed through simulation was verified using experiments. The results of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and laboratory demonstration were then compared. Additionally, a scenario of four-terminal MTDC transmission system for Modelling and Control of Multi-Terminal HVDC Networks for Offshore Wind Power Generation IV offshore wind power generation was investigated. A control system was designed considering the operating characteristics of VSCs and wind farms. An open loop control method was used for the wind farm side VSCs to establish a constant AC voltage and frequency. Droop control was used for the grid side VSCs to generate DC voltage reference by measuring the DC current. When the system was under fault operation condition, the output power of wind farm was reduced by reducing the DC voltage reference. Simulation results show that good coordination was achieved among VSCs for voltage control and power sharing.

40|$|Summary	Distribution {{power systems}} {{experience}} {{a lot of}} faults due to high network utilisation and reduced investment in the infrastructure. Single phase faults are the most common. The standard distribution systems are radial operated. Failure of any one component in the series path would result into service disruption to all customers located downstream. Current methods used to localise faults are manual and lengthy. For permanent faults, {{it is a common}} practice to sectionalise a feeder to reduce the fault investigation area. The exact location of the fault is obtained by visual inspection. However, with the introduction of the new marketing policy resulting from deregulation and liberalisation of the power industry, utility companies are required to compensate consumers for non delivery of service. Distribution networks also records high growth rates due to new customer connections arising from increased demand for electric energy. An increase in consumption introduces transmission constraints on the distribution network, demanding for reinforcement on the main circuits. The penetration of distributed production facilities intends to curtail such investment costs and provide continuity of supply to the affected customers while the fault is being resolved. The objective of the thesis was to investigate the impacts caused by different power system configurations and parameters on automatic <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>fault</b> localisation in power systems with distributed production using power frequency quantities. It was also required to reveal the present ground fault protection schemes and recommend requirements on a system with distributed generation. The approach used in the thesis included informal conversation, field research, literature review on similar topics, modelling and simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC software. A field research was conducted in Zambia on the pretext of understanding the problem from a practical perspective. The main focus was placed on power system configuration and layout, current methods used to localise faults and fault statistics. Secondary research on automated fault localisation methods for distribution systems based on fundamental power frequency quantities was done. Much of the literature available focuses on typical radial distribution feeders. In the thesis, two different methods were used in the simulation of distances to the fault location so that the findings could be consolidated. One of the methods is a standard approach used in numerical distance protection relays and the other, was derived, taking into account the presence of a distributed generator. The distribution system can be solidly grounded, ungrounded, grounded through an arc suppression coil or through a resistor. Each type of grounding configuration has its own impact on fault localisation. Different system grounding possibilities were used in the model when investigating the effect of parameter change, on fault localisation. Simulation results revealed that the distances to the fault locations are affected by all parameters selected for investigation. An increase in load with the same load angle was seen to have an impact of reducing the distance to the fault. An increase in the fault resistance had an effect of increasing the distance to the fault location. Moving the distributed generator away from the substation was seen to have had an effect of reducing the distance to the fault location. However, investigations were carried out without compensation for any of the parameters. This could have contributed to inaccuracies in the results obtained. While automatic localisation of ground faults is at the premium, it is required to minimise damages at the fault position and neighbouring equipment so that restoration of supply is prompt. This could be achieved with effective operation of the protection system. Integration of distributed production facilities can affect the dynamic behaviour of the distribution network and change the power flow. This affects operation of the conversional protection schemes deployed on the radial distribution systems. Therefore, protection schemes with a directional feature are recommended in order to improve selectivity. It can be deduced that precise ground fault localisation based on the use of power frequency quantities is a challenge due to many influencing parameters. However, automated fault localisation in power systems with distributed production is the future solution, especially from the operational perspective...|$|E

Moreover, a detection and location method for <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> to ground <b>faults</b> is tested in order to find any limitation in it and to be {{an important part of the}} validation of the model. The model was created from a variety of given information from SINTEF, a frequency line dependent model was used as a part of the overhead lines representation, in order to have a model as close as possible from the real distribution network behaviour. A deep study of resonant grounding was made in this document, due to its direct involvement in the <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> to ground <b>faults</b> measurements in the field test. The main focus of the model were related to the magnitude and the orientation of the zero sequence currents, the latest ones are considered as the most important variable of study throughout this work.

40|$|Line commutated HVDC {{systems are}} widely used due to their high power ratings. However, one of the {{disadvantages}} of such HVDC systems is the high risk of commutation failures when AC disturbances arise. These failures normally develop in the inverter station. When failed commutation occurs, the LCC HVDC system is greatly disturbed resulting in loss of power transmission. Moreover, the rapid increase in the direct current during unsuccessful commutation results in additional stresses on the thyristor valves. In an attempt to reduce the probability of unsuccessful commutation, a commutation failure prevention function {{is added to the}} HVDC system controls. When an AC system disturbance is detected, this function is activated with the aim of altering the firing order at the inverter station. Since the angle contribution from the function is independent of the minimum inverter extinction angle, this approach possesses limitations under certain AC faults. In this thesis, a commutation failure prevention function based on voltage-time area contribution was designed and implemented. Simulation results show that both the proposed and existing functions are equally ineffective in mitigating the first commutation failures when three <b>phase</b> <b>faults</b> are applied. However, the proposed function is more effective in mitigating the first commutation failure when <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>faults</b> are applied compared to the existing function.

40|$|This work {{takes place}} in the context of {{distribution}} power system protection and tries to improve the detection and location of earth faults. The protection problem is vast and many ideas emerge every year to enhance the reliability of the grid. The author has focused his energy into the compensated and isolated network protection in the specific case of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault.</b> This PhD thesis is divided in two main parts that might be considered as independent. The first part studies the detection of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault</b> and the second analyzes the fault location of such fault. Pragmatism was asked during these three years because a product development was necessary especially regarding the fault detection problem. The first part of the thesis took 18 months of research and development to obtain a prototype of transient protection able to detect <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault</b> in compensated and isolated network. The sensitivity of the algorithm has been emphasized regarding the fault impedance and to detect earth fault up to 5 kOhm depending on the network characteristic. The fault location problem has been much more theoretical although the problem links to the accuracy of the algorithm and its robustness regarding wrong fault location indication has been strongly considered. Compensated networks and in some conditions isolated networks are distribution from 12 kV up to 110 kV mostly used in East and North Europe but also in China. Others areas also work with such networks but they also have others systems and they do not use them on all the territory. These networks have the particularity to obtain very small fault current in case of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault.</b> Low current means the difference between a faulty and a sound feeder is not significant. Therefore classic overcurrent protection is completely useless to protect the network, forcing the development of more complex algorithm. A possibility to overcome the problem of the small fault current is to develop a transient protection. The transient occurring {{at the beginning of the}} fault has strong information to distinguish a faulty from a sound feeder. In this work I have chosen to use not only the transient but also the steady state to get the best sensitivity. Then the fault location has been investigated but the small information coming from the faulty feeder is not sufficient to have a precise enough position of the fault. Therefore, active system has been suggested to be implemented in the grid to increase the faulty current and have enough power for a precise location. Different existing algorithms based on the steady state at the nominal frequency are compared using a tool developed during this work. Recommendations are then made depending on the topology, the network parameters, the measurements precision, etc. Due to the complexities of the problem, a simulator has been coded in Matlab. The user of a possible fault location must then use this tool to understand and see the future fault location precision that he could obtain from different algorithm on his network.

Using the fast operation speed of digital signal processor can realized the fault line selection algorithm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and compares {{the impact of}} SSSC on measured impedance for <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> to ground <b>fault</b> condition. The presence of Static Synchronous SSSC on a transmission line has a great influence on the ZRelay in distance protection. The protection of the high voltage 220 kV single circuit transmission line in eastern Algerian electrical transmission networks is affected in the case with resistance fault RF. The paper investigate the effect of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) on the measured impedance (Relay) {{taking into account the}} distance fault point (n) and fault resistance (RF). The resultants simulation is performed in MATLAB software environment...|$|R
40|$|Two {{questions}} about zero-sequence-reactance relay {{to overcome the}} disadvantages of high <b>fault</b> resistance for <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> to earth <b>fault</b> of high voltage transmission lines are discussed in this paper. The first question is about the phase difference between the measured zero-sequence current and voltage at fault position for un-balanced transmission lines. The second question is about the “in-phase” problem in reactance relays (or fault component reactance relays). This paper analyzes the two questions theoretically and the reactance relay is improved by a new discriminative principle. The capability against the fault resistance is largely enhanced by the improved schemes.    </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{medium voltage}} {{distribution}} network, a coil might {{be placed in}} the transformer neutral to compensate the zero sequence capacitance of the network. This creates a zero sequence system with very high impedance fault. In case of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault,</b> the consequence is a very small faulty current which allows continuous operation even in faulty condition. Several protection devices exist to indicate the fault direction using the transient signal. A new method has been developed by computation of the zero sequence active energy signal to increase the sensitivity of the device regarding the fault impedance. The energy comes from the charging of the zero sequence capacitance of the sound feeder and the imperfection of the Petersen coil. This paper describes the phenomenon behind the algorithm of direction determination and followed by the explanation of the algorithm with simulation tests and recordings from a German DSO. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In case of <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> earth <b>fault</b> {{in medium}} voltage (MV) {{isolated}} neutral systems, the voltages {{of the remaining}} two phases to the earth raise from normal phase to neutral voltage to full line value, i. e., 3 times their normal value. This causes the stress, e. g., thermal stress on the inner insulation and also on the outer polyethylene (PE) jacket, which is the weakest point in the cable. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) monitors heat effects associated with phase transitions, e. g., crystallization, and chemical reactions {{as a function of}} temperature. The knowledge of the crystallization mechanisms of polymers presents a fundamental importance, since the degree of crystallinity influences the mechanical and thermal properties of these materials. In this paper the percentage of crystallinity of an underground cable outer PE jacket have been calculated from a peak of exothermic crystallization of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms...|$|R
