5|$|Several phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species {{relationship between the}} porbeagle and the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> (L.ditropis), which occurs in place {{of it in the}} North Pacific. The genus Lamna evolved 65–45 Ma. When its two extant species diverged from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific from those in the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} has {{an almost}} global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is {{absent from the}} tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark.</b> It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the Azores and Madeira, to Morocco. It {{is found in the}} Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the Gulf of Guinea, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the Antarctic Convergence, and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. It is speculated that the porbeagle colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning c. 2.6 Ma), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are thought}} to be capable of {{injuring}} humans, few, if any, attacks on humans have been reported, but reports of divers encountering <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> and <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> bumping fishing vessels have been given.

500|$|Fast and energetic, the {{porbeagle}} can {{be found}} singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, billfishes, and several other groups of active fishes. It and the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style: they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but {{at the cost of}} maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic [...] "red muscle" [...] along each side, which can contract independently of the regular [...] "white muscle" [...] at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} (Lamna nasus) is {{a species}} of mackerel shark in the family Lamnidae, distributed widely {{in the cold and}} temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere.

The porbeagle typically reaches [...] in length and a weight of North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow base of the tail. It has large pectoral and first dorsal fins, tiny pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins, and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> (Lamna ditropis) is {{a species}} of {{mackerel}} shark found in the northern Pacific ocean. As an apex predator, the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> feeds on salmon, squid, sablefish, and herring. Salmon sharks {{are known for their}} ability to maintain stomach temperature (homeothermy), which is unusual among fish. The <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> has not been demonstrated to maintain a constant body temperature. The <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> is also known for an unexplained variability in the sex ratio between eastern and western populations in the northern Pacific.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> {{generally}} grow {{to between}} 200 and 260 cm (6.6-8.6 ft) {{in length and}} weigh up to 220 kg (485 lb).

Unconfirmed reports exist of <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> reaching as much as 4.3 m (14.2 ft); however, the largest confirmed reports indicate a maximum total length of about 3.0 m (10 ft). The maximum reported weight of this heavily built shark is over 450 kg (992 lb).|$|R
40|$|Age {{and growth}} {{estimates}} for <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> (Lamna ditropis) {{in the eastern}} North Pacific were derived from 182 vertebral centra collected from sharks ranging in length from 62. 2 to 213. 4 cm pre-caudal length (PCL) and compared to previously published age and growth data for <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> in the western North Pacific. Eastern North Pacific female and male <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> were aged up to 20 and 17 years, respectively. Relative marginal increment (RMI) analysis showed that postnatal rings form annually between January and March. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived from vertebral length-at-age data are L∞ = 207. 4 cm PCL, k= 0. 17 /yr, and t 0 =− 2. 3 years for females (n= 166), and L∞ = 182. 8 cm PCL, k= 0. 23 /yr, and t 0 =− 1. 9 years for males (n= 16). Age at maturity was estimated to range from six to nine years for females (median pre-caudal length of 164. 7 cm PCL) and from {{three to five years}} old for males (median precaudal length of 124. 0 cm PCL). Weight-length relationships for females and males in the eastern North Pacific are W= 8. 2 × 10 _ 05 × L 2. 759 – 06 × L 3. 383 (r 2 = 0. 99) and W= 3. 2 × 10 (r 2 = 0. 99), respectively.

50|$|Lamna is a genus of {{mackerel}} sharks {{in the family}} Lamnidae, containing two extant species: the porbeagle (L. nasus) of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, and the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> (L. ditropis) of the North Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with only}} a few other species of fish, <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> have the ability to {{regulate}} their body temperature. This is accomplished by vascular counter-current heat exchangers, known as retia mirabilia, Latin for [...] "wonderful nets". Arteries and veins are in extremely close proximity to each other, resulting in heat exchange. Cold blood coming from the gills to the body is warmed by blood coming from the body. This results in blood coming from the body losing their heat so that by the time they interact with cold water from the gills, they're approximately the same temperature so no heat is lost from the body to the water. Whereas blood coming towards the body regain their heat, allowing the shark to maintain its body temperature. This minimizes heat lost to the environment, allowing <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> to thrive in cold waters.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{medium grey}} to black {{over most of}} the body, with a white {{underside}} with darker blotches. Juveniles are similar in appearance, but generally lack blotches. The snout is short and cone-shaped, and the overall appearance is similar to a small great white shark. The eyes are positioned well forward, enabling binocular vision to accurately locate prey.|$|R
50|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> {{occur in}} the North Pacific Ocean, in both coastal waters and the open ocean. They are {{believed}} to range {{as far south as}} the Sea of Japan and as far north as 65°N in Alaska and in particular in Prince William Sound during the annual salmon run. Individuals have been observed diving as deep as 668 m (2,192 ft), but they are believed to {{spend most of their time}} in epipelagic waters.|$|R
50|$|Sport {{fishermen}} {{fish for}} salmon sharks in Alaska. Alaskan fishing regulations limit the catch of salmon sharks to two {{per person per}} year. Sport fishermen are allowed one <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> per day from April 1 to March 31 in British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|Currently, no {{commercial}} fishery for <b>salmon</b> <b>shark</b> exists, {{but they are}} occasionally caught as bycatch in commercial salmon gillnet fisheries, where they are usually discarded. Commercial fisheries regard salmon sharks as nuisances since they can damage fishing gear and consume portions of the commercial catch. Fishermen deliberately injuring salmon sharks have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Most {{fish are}} {{completely}} cold-blooded. Some, such as tuna and lamnid sharks (particularly the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark),</b> have evolved regional endothermy, in which {{parts of the}} body core are kept at a warmer temperature. These fish have retia arranged to warm muscles used for propulsion, and some visceral organs, while other organs, such as the heart, remain cooler. Only L. guttatus is known to have retia within its gill arches (which are also insulated by fat), an arrangement that warms the entire body core including the heart.|$|E
50|$|Spot tags, or smart positioning, or {{temperature}} transmitting tags, {{are ideal}} tags for air-breathing marine animals (seals, whales and sea turtles) and animals that often swim {{close to the}} surface (<b>salmon</b> <b>sharks,</b> blue sharks and makos). When the antenna breaks the surface, it sends data to a satellite. The data include pressure, speed, and water temperature. Location is estimated by calculating the Doppler shift in the transmission signal in successive transmissions. When the animal goes beneath the surface, a saltwater switch turns off the tag. The tag, made by Wildlife Computers, lasts about two years.|$|R
50|$|Age and sex {{composition}} {{differences have}} been observed between populations in the eastern and western North Pacific. Eastern populations are dominated by females, while the western populations are predominantly male. It is not known if these distinctions stem from genetically distinct stocks, or if the segregation occurs {{as part of their}} growth and development. It has been widely speculated that the difference between population differences may be a result of the Japanese fishermen harvesting the male population. Japanese herbalists will use the fins of male <b>Salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> as ingredients in many traditional medicines said to treat various forms of cancer.|$|R
50|$|Halibut feed {{on almost}} any fish or animal they can fit into their mouths. Juvenile halibut feed on small {{crustaceans}} and other bottom-dwelling organisms. Animals {{found in their}} stomachs include sand lance, octopus, crab, salmon, hermit crabs, lamprey, sculpin, cod, pollock, herring, and flounder, {{as well as other}} halibut. Halibut live at depths ranging from a few meters to hundreds, and although they {{spend most of their time}} near the bottom, halibut may move up in the water column to feed. In most ecosystems, the halibut is near the top of the marine food chain. In the North Pacific, common predators are sea lions, killer whales, <b>salmon</b> <b>sharks</b> and humans.|$|R

50|$|Alaska {{has quite}} a variety of fish species. Its lakes, rivers, and oceans are home to fish such as trout, salmon, char, grayling, halibut, lampreys, lingcod, longnose sucker, pacific hake, pacific herring, pike, black rockfish, <b>salmon</b> <b>shark,</b> sculpin, walleye pollock, white sturgeon, and whitefish. Every year, the salmon {{participate}} in the great spawning migration up against the river currents. They do this in large numbers and are frequently seen jumping out of the water. This is a physical effort of them trying to go against the current. Bears, particularly brown bears, {{take advantage of this}} event by swarming to the rivers, and indulging in the salmon feast. Bear Lake, near Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, has been the site of salmon enhancement activities since 1962.|$|E

5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the <b>salmon</b> <b>shark's.</b> Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|R
