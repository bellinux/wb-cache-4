5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album.

In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke highly of the film, noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a <b>similar</b> <b>vein,</b> Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received with success.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but <b>similar</b> <b>vein,</b> applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a <b>similar</b> <b>vein,</b> the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a <b>similar</b> <b>vein,</b> with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E

Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country.

5|$|The {{international}} {{success of}} Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa {{to proceed with}} his next project, Ran, another epic in a <b>similar</b> <b>vein.</b> The script, partly based on William Shakespeare's King Lear, depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty daimyō (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer Serge Silberman, who had produced Luis Buñuel's final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{theory of}} {{designing}} block ciphers is mature, having seen significant progress {{since the early}} 1990 s for over two decades, especially during the AES devel-opment effort. Nevertheless, interesting directions exist, in particular {{in the study of}} the provable security of block ciphers along <b>similar</b> <b>veins</b> as public-key primitives, i. e. the notion of pseudorandomness (PRP) and indistinguishability (IND). Furthermore, recent cryptanalytic progress has shown that block ciphers well designed against known cryptanalysis techniques including related-key attacks (RKA) may turn out to be less secure against related-key attacks than expected. The notion of provable security of block ciphers against related-key attacks was initiated by Bellare and Kohno, and sub-sequently treated by Lucks. Concrete block cipher constructions were proposed therein with provable security guarantees. In this paper, we are interested in the security no-tions for RKA-secure block ciphers...|$|R
5000|$|Ruthenian nobility, {{originally}} {{characterized as}} East Slavic language speaking and Orthodox, found itself {{ruled by the}} expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where it rose from second class status to equal partners of the Lithuanian nobility. Following the Polish-Lithuanian union of the 14th century, the Ruthenian nobles became increasingly polonized, adopting the Polish language and religion (which increasingly meant converting from the Orthodox faith to Roman Catholicism). Ruthenian nobility, however, retained a distinct identity within {{the body of the}} Polish-Lithuanian szlachta, leading to the Latin expression gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus or gente Rutheni, natione Poloni (translated as [...] "of Polish nationality, but Ruthenian origin", [...] "of Ruthenia race and Polish nation", or in various <b>similar</b> <b>veins),</b> although {{the extent to which they}} retained and maintained this separate identity is still debated by scholars, and varied based on time and place.|$|R

He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E
5|$|Dancing is {{a popular}} pastime in Wales; {{traditional}} dances include folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out; this is attributed {{to the influence of}} Nonconformists and their belief that any physical diversion was worthless and satanic, especially mixed dancing. These ancient dances, orally passed down, were almost single-handedly rescued by Lois Blake (1890–1974) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets, recording both steps and music. In a <b>similar</b> <b>vein,</b> clog dancing was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood (1882–1967) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages. Clog dancing, traditionally a male dominated art, is now a common part of eisteddfodau. In 2010, a 30-year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end {{due to a lack of}} participants, though clog dancing has seen a revival in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a <b>similar</b> <b>vein</b> that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching.
