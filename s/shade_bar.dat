40|$|Centroid-based {{partitioning}} {{cluster analysis}} {{is a popular}} method for segmenting data into more homo- geneous subgroups. Visualization can help tremendously to understand the positions of these subgroups relative {{to each other in}} higher dimensional spaces and to assess the quality of partitions. In this talk we present several improvements on existing cluster displays using neighborhood graphs with edge weights based on cluster separation and convex hulls of inner and outer cluster regions. Using symbols or complete high-level plots in the nodes of the graph help to understand the association of background variables and clusters. A new display called shadow-stars can be used to diagnose pairwise cluster separation with respect to the distribution of the original data. Barplots of centroid profiles are improved by <b>shading</b> <b>bars</b> corresponding to statistically significant or user-relevant differences in darker colors.

5000|$|Hague {{was born}} in Sheffield, England in 1828 and in his youth {{launched}} {{a career as a}} clog dancer. In 1850, he moved with his brothers Tom and William to America, where they toured as the Brothers Hague Concert Party. He went on to partner two other renowned cloggers, Dublin-born Tim Hayes and fellow Yorkshireman Dick Sands, in the leading minstrel and variety theaters. He co-managed Wagner and Hague's Pontoon Minstrels, touring the western states, then briefly retired from show business in 1866, opening the Champion <b>Shades</b> <b>bar</b> with his brother Tom opposite the Mechanics Hall theater in Utica, New York. A visit to Utica by W.H. Lee's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, a company made up of genuinely black minstrels, inspired Hague to purchase the group and launch a tour of England. Hague's troupe, which included variety star Japanese Tommie, debuted at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool. The troupe was initially a failure in both Liverpool and on tour, but business picked up when Hague added white singers and instrumentalists, retaining only a few [...] "colored" [...] specialty performers.

30|$|The concentration-dependent parameters, {{including}} k and k ARM, all vary by {{a factor}} of less than 4; the magnetic grain-size-dependent parameter k/k ARM varies {{by a factor}} of less than 2. The relatively constant concentration and grain size of the magnetic grains satisfy the criteria suggested for the construction of relative paleointensity proxies (e.g., Tauxe 1993). The magnetic-concentration-sensitive parameters, ARM and k, are often used to normalize the NRM for constructing paleointensity proxies (e.g., Valet 2003; Suganuma et al. 2008, 2009). However, the low-temperature component is thought to be a secondary acquired “noise” with respect to the primary magnetic signal, as shown by rock-magnetic experiments. In this study, we use the ARM after ThD at 300  °C as a normalizer for the concentration of magnetic grains that carries a primary signal to avoid the secondary low-temperature component. The ratio of NRM 300 /ARM 300 (both proxies are coercivity fractions between 30 and 50 mT for the NRM and ARM vectors after thermal demagnetization at 300  °C) is used as a paleomagnetic paleointensity proxy. Although a similar method was used by Wu et al. (2015), they used magnetic susceptibility as a normalizer. The uppermost diagram of Fig.  6 displays a prominent low in the relative paleointensity proxy at the directional change zone of the M–B boundary (indicated by a <b>shaded</b> <b>bar).</b>|$|R

40|$|The banking {{industry}} performed exceptionally well during the strong economic {{expansion of the}} past five years. Strong demand for loans and banking services and the strong supply of quality customers helped boost bank earnings. But how will banks fare given the recent weakening of national economic conditions? Will we see a repeat of their performance in the last downturn, in 1991, when depressed earnings, high failure rates, and contracting loan portfolios inflicted significant damage on banks and the economy in general? So far this year, we have seen signs of a beginning of a contraction in bank lending. While earnings have held up through the second quarter, bank stocks have started to dip {{along with the rest of}} the market. This Economic Letter addresses the question of how banks will fare during an economic slowing by revisiting bank performance over previous business cycles. The analysis shows that lending and bank earnings tend to droop during a downturn, but that the relationship between performance and macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth, is not particularly strong at other points in the cycle. I also point out how the 1991 recession was a vastly different experience for the {{banking industry}} compared to previous recessions. Lending, pricing, and performance over the cycle In theory, banks can compensate for a riskier environment by tightening their lending standards—by charging higher interest rates on their loans, by demanding more collateral, and by simply refusing to lend to marginal customers. This behavior is fairly well documented over the business cycle (see Lown and Morgan 2001). The effects of credit tightening (as well as of lower demand, which, of course, also occurs during downturns) are shown in Figure 1. The quarterly (annualized) growth rate of commercial and industrial loans is quite volatile, but tends to dip when the economy enters into recession (marked with <b>shaded</b> <b>bars).</b> Like loan volumes, loan prices—proxied here by the prime rate—tend to rise as the economy enters into recession. These interest rate changes probably understate the price response by banks, as the spreads over prime charged to the riskiest borrowers can rise...|$|R

60|$|Secondly, {{even in the}} {{earliest}} periods, among powerful nations, this linear decoration {{is more or less}} filled with chequered or <b>barred</b> <b>shade,</b> and begins at once to represent animal or floral form, by filling its outlines with flat shadow, or with flat colour. And here we instantly find two great divisions of temper and thought. The Greeks look upon all colour first as light; they are, as compared with other races, insensitive to hue, exquisitely sensitive to phenomena of light. And their linear school passes into one of flat masses of light and darkness, represented in the main by four tints,--white, black, and two reds, one brick colour, more or less vivid, the other dark purple; these two standing mentally their favourite +porphyreos+ colour, in its light and dark powers. On the other hand, many of the Northern nations are at first entirely insensible to light and shade, but exquisitely sensitive to colour, and their linear decoration is filled with flat tints, infinitely varied, but with no expression of light and shade. Both these schools have a limited but absolute perfection of their own, and their peculiar successes can in no wise be imitated, except by the strictest observance of the same limitations.|$|R
40|$|Students of {{elementary}} school still have difficulties to {{understand the concept of}} percentages. Therefore, this study aims to figure out how teacher can support students to understand the concept of percentages: 1) students show an awareness that percentages are related to something; 2) students are able to compute the part of a whole while the percentage is given; 3) students are able to compute a whole if its part and its percentage is given. The study was conducted before students learned percentages formally in class, and then they only have their pre-requisite knowledge about fractions and their own initial knowledge of percentages they found from their surroundings. Based on those aims, we use Design Research as a method. We develop a set of instructional activities which is exploring students’ initial knowledge of percentages. Besides, contextual situation based on Realistic Mathematics (RME) approach which are loading bar on a game, voting results, road repair, and discount problems was used to {{contribute to the development of}} students’ understanding of percentages.

40|$|AbstractA {{contrast}} gauge {{consists of}} a narrow <b>bar</b> <b>shaded</b> from dark on bottom to light on top [Shapiro, A. G., Charles, J. P., & Shear-Heyman, M. (2005). Visual illusions based on single-field contrast asynchronies. Journal of Vision, 5 (10), 764 – 782]. The perceptual division between dark and light on the bar depends on the luminance level of the surround: when the surround has a high luminance level, the perceptual divider moves up the bar; when the surround has a low luminance level, the perceptual divider moves down the bar. This paper examines {{the extent to which}} the perceptual division between light and dark can be used as an indicator to mark the zero contrast level between the bar and the surround. In the experiments, the bar was surrounded by a field whose luminance modulated in time. Three observers marked the maximum and minimum levels of the perceptual divider as a function of modulation amplitude, chromaticity (R, G, B, W), temporal frequency, and width of the surround. Linear changes in the modulation amplitude of the surround produced linear changes in the observers’ settings of the indicator. Observer settings matched zero luminance contrast when the surround was wide (12. 5 deg), was modulating at less than or equal to 1 Hz, and had W or G chromaticity, but not when the surround was narrow, or was modulating faster than 1 Hz, or had R or B chromaticity. The effects of surround size suggest that the perceived minimum contrast results from processes that operate over multiple spatial scales. To test this hypothesis, the paper presents a new configuration in which near and far contrast information create different perceptual signatures. Under normal viewing conditions, the motion of the indicator follows the contrast information from the nearest edge, but when high spatial frequency information is removed (through image blur), the motion follows the contrast from the far spatial edge. It is therefore likely that the setting for the indicator for the contrast gauge depends on multiple processes and is not a simple indicator of luminance contrast. The perceptual response to low spatial frequency contrast appears to be given less perceptual weight when high spatial frequencies are present in the image...|$|R
