5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E

25|$|Key {{points in}} support of LBL include that {{students}} gain the opportunity to listen to leading clinicians or academics, whereas PBL tutors may be underused.

25|$|Industrial espionage was {{implicated in}} the {{capacitor}} plague, {{in connection with the}} theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for Rubycon in Japan left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon's ZA and ZL series capacitors, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed a copy of this electrolyte. Then, some <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula and began to market it to many of the aluminium electrolytic manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers. This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminum capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.|$|E

25|$|The Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) began {{excavating}} in July 1984 {{under the}} direction of its founder, George F. Bass, and was then turned over to INA’s Vice President for Turkey, Cemal Pulak, who directed the excavation from 1985 to 1994. The wreck lay between 44 and 52 meters deep on a steep, rocky slope riddled with sand pockets. Half of the <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> aided in the excavation lived in a camp built into the southeastern face of the promontory, which the ship most likely hit, while the other half lived aboard the Virazon, INA’s research vessel at the time. The excavation site utilized an underwater telephone booth and air-lifts. The mapping of the site was done by triangulation. Meter tapes and metal squares were used as an orientation aid for excavators. Since the completion of the excavation in September 1994, all efforts have been concentrated on full-time conservation, study, and sampling for analysis in the conservation laboratory of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1969 in Greenwich Village, New York, the New York City police raided a gay bar, {{a routine}} {{practice}} at the time. The establishment, the Stonewall Inn, was a well known LGBT establishment located on Christopher Street. The bar {{was made up of}} two former horse stables which had been renovated into one building in 1930. Like all gay bars of the era, it was subject to countless police raids, as LGBT activities and fraternization were still largely illegal. But this time, when the police began arresting patrons, the customers began pelting them with coins, and later, bottles and rocks. The lesbian and gay crowd also freed <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> had been put into police vans, and the outnumbered officers retreated inside the bar. Soon, the Tactical Patrol Force (TPF), originally trained to deal with war protests, were called in to control the mob, which was now using a parking meter as a battering ram. As the patrol force advanced, the crowd did not disperse, but instead doubled back and re-formed behind the riot police, throwing rocks, shouting “Gay Power!”, dancing, and taunting their opposition. For the next several nights, the crowd would return in ever increasing numbers, handing out leaflets and rallying themselves. In early July, {{due in large part to}} the riots in June, discussions in the gay community lead to the formation of the Gay Liberation Front. Soon the word “Stonewall” came to represent fighting for equality in the gay community. And in commemoration, Gay Pride marches are held every year on the anniversary of the riot.|$|E

500|$|The SR N15X {{class or}} Remembrance class were a design of British 4-6-0 steam {{locomotives}} converted in 1934 by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway {{from the large}} LB L class 4-6-4 tank locomotives that had become redundant on the London–Brighton line following electrification. It was hoped that further service could be obtained from these locomotives on the Southern's Western Section, sharing {{the duties of the}} N15 class locomotives.

500|$|The {{layout of}} the first two Megami Tensei games were noticeably {{different}} from later games: Megami Tensei used a 3D first-person perspective, while Megami Tensei II used a combination of first-person 3D displays for battle and top-down 2D displays for navigation. The change was suggested by <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> did not want players getting lost in a large 3D environment. The 2D/first person viewpoint continued until Nocturne, which switched to a third-person perspective. This was done due to a condition similar to car sickness called [...] "3D sickness" [...] with first person shooters in Japan at the time: the developers wanted something for players to focus on. The first-person perspective was reintroduced in Strange Journey, and incorporated into IVs battles along with navigable 3D environments.|$|E

[...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known.

In February 2007, some members of Capcom's Clover Studio began working on Resident Evil 5 while others were working on , which debuted for the Wii. Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original Resident Evil, directed [...] Resident Evil 5. He was one of several <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> worked on the original game to be involved in Resident Evil 5 development.

500|$|Wipeout Pure was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis).

The team received development kits for the PlayStation Portable in August 2004; {{by this time the}} development team had grown to twenty people. Dave Burrows, one of the original two <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> conceptualised the game, reflected in a retrospective [...] "post-mortem" [...] that the studio had to learn from their previous mistakes with their predecessor, Wipeout Fusion. Burrows cited that one of the principal difficulties the development team faced was that the team's artists and designers were [...] "fighting almost all of the time"; designers would first design a track for the game, then pass it over to the artists whilst the former were still making adjustments to it. Burrows also recalled that the developer's editing kits required many hours worth of [...] "tweaking", which ultimately did not result in a smooth workflow.|$|E
