40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{recently}} developed a HIVconsv vaccine strategy, consisting of combined conserved regions of HIV- 1, to adequately cover viral diversity. To evaluate efficacy in nonhuman primates, an equivalent SIV-derived immunogen SIVconsv {{was designed and}} delivered as plasmid DNA or <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides. DESIGN: Rhesus macaques lacking protective MHC class I alleles Mamu-A* 001  :  01, B* 008  :  01, B* 017  :  01 were immunized with either SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides (S) alone or in combination with plasmid DNA encoding the same conserved regions (D) using SSS or DDSS regimens. METHODS: The SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptide vaccine consisted of 46 approximately 30 -amino acid-long peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA- 720 and adjuvanted with pegylated type I interferon and imiquimod. RESULTS: Both SSS and DDSS regimens generated high frequencies of SIV-specific IFN-γ-producing cells comparable with reported adenoviral vector systems. Strong polyfunctional CD 4 ⁺ T-cell and modest CD 8 ⁺ T-cell responses were generated, which were of central memory T-cell phenotype. Furthermore, SIVconsv-specific antibody responses were induced capable of recognizing the Env glycoprotein. Eight weeks after the last immunization, control and SIVconsv-vaccinated animals were challenged intrarectally with 10 MID 50 of pathogenic SIVmac 251. Two out of six animals in the DDSS group were protected against infection, while all 14 animals in the SSS and two control groups were infected. Vaccine induced SIV-specific IgG responses in mucosal washes prechallenge were highest in the two protected animals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that vaccine-elicited responses towards conserved regions can afford partial protection against a high-dose intrarectal SIVmac 251 challenge...|$|R

40|$|A novel T-cell vaccine {{strategy}} {{designed to}} deal with the enormity of HIV- 1 variation is described and tested {{for the first time in}} macaques to inform and complement approaching clinical trials. T-cell immunogen HIVconsv, which directs vaccine-induced responses to the most conserved regions of the HIV- 1, proteome and thus both targets diverse clades in the population and reduces the chance of escape in infected individuals, was delivered using six different vaccine modalities: plasmid DNA (D), attenuated human (A) and chimpanzee (C) adenoviruses, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (M), <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides, and Semliki Forest virus replicons. We confirmed that the initial DDDAM regimen, which mimics one of the clinical schedules (DDDCM), is highly immunogenic in macaques. Furthermore, adjuvanted <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides divided into sub-pools and delivered into anatomically separate sites induced T-cell responses that were markedly broader than those elicited by traditional single-open-reading-frame genetic vaccines and increased by 30 % the overall response magnitude compared with DDDAM. Thus, by improving both the HIV- 1 -derived immunogen and vector regimen/delivery, this approach could induce stronger, broader, and theoretically more protective T-cell responses than vaccines previously used in humans...|$|R

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LC) are {{professional}} antigen presenting cells (APCs) that initiate humoral {{and cellular}} immune responses. Targeted delivery of antigen towards DC- or LC-specific receptors enhances vaccine efficacy. In this study, {{we compared the}} efficiency of glycan-based antigen targeting to both the human DC-specific C-type lectin receptor (CLR) DC-SIGN and the LC-specific CLR langerin. Since DC-SIGN and langerin are able to recognize the difucosylated oligosaccharide Lewis Y (LeY), we prepared neoglycoconjugates bearing this glycan epitope to allow targeting of both lectins. LeY-modified liposomes, with an approximate diameter of 200 nm, were significantly endocytosed by DC-SIGN+ DCs and mediated efficient antigen presentation to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Surprisingly, although langerin bound to LeY-modified liposomes, LCs exposed to LeY-modified liposomes could not endocytose liposomes nor mediate antigen presentation to T cells. However, LCs mediated an enhanced cross-presentation when antigen was delivered through langerin using LeY-modified <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides. In contrast, LeY-modified <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides were recognized by DC-SIGN, but did not trigger antigen internalization nor antigen cross-presentation. These data demonstrate that langerin and DC-SIGN have different size requirements for antigen uptake. Although using glycans remains an interesting option {{in the design of}} anti-cancer vaccines targeting multiple CLRs, aspects such as molecule size and conformation need to be taken in consideration...|$|R

Women with cervical neoplasia (n = 11) and healthy individuals (n = 19) were intradermally challenged with 8 different pools of HPV 16 E 2, E 6 and E 7 peptides. The skin test was safe as the injections were perceived as mildly painful and no adverse events were observed. The majority of skin reactions appeared significantly earlier in HPV 16 + patients (< 8 days) than in healthy subjects (8 - 25 days).

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to develop a cancer vaccine {{formulation}} for treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV) -induced malignancies. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides (SLPs) derived from HPV 16 E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins have been used for therapeutic vaccination in clinical trials with promising results. In preclinical and clinical studies adjuvants based on mineral oils (such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and Montanide) are used to create a sustained release depot at the injection site. While the depot effect of mineral oils is important for induction of robust immune responses, their administration is accompanied with severe adverse and long lasting side effects. In order to develop an alternative for IFA family of adjuvants, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) based on hydrophilic polyester (poly(d,l lactic-co-hydroxymethyl glycolic acid) (pLHMGA)) were prepared. These NPs were loaded with a <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptide (SLP) derived from HPV 16 E 7 oncoprotein and a toll like receptor 3 (TLR 3) ligand (poly IC) by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. The therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticulate formulations was compared to that of HPV SLP + poly IC formulated in IFA. Encapsulation of HPV SLP antigen in NPs substantially enhanced the population of HPV-specific CD 8 + T cells when combined with poly IC either co-encapsulated with the antigen or in its soluble form. The therapeutic efficacy of NPs containing poly IC in tumor eradication was equivalent to that of the IFA formulation. Importantly, administration of pLHMGA nanoparticles was not associated with adverse effects and therefore these biodegradable nanoparticles are excellent substitutes for IFA in cancer vaccines...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the studies}} {{described}} in this thesis was to investigate innovative immunotherapeutic strategies for treatment of gynaecologic malignancies, in particular ovarian and cervical cancer. The suitability of p 53 {{to serve as a}} tumor antigen and the utility of <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> p 53 -derived peptides for immunotherapy of ovarian cancer were investigated in pre-clinical and clinical studies. We concluded that p 53 is a promising tumor antigen for immunotherapy, since a repertoire of p 53 -specific memory T cells was detected in ovarian cancer patients. Subsequently, immunization of ovarian cancer patients with a p 53 -based <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides vaccine (p 53 -SLP) showed that the p 53 -SLP vaccine is safe, well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in ovarian cancer patients. For the treatment of HPV-induced cervical cancer, the induction of HPV-specific immune responses by recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) was previously shown to be highly effective in a pre-clinical mouse model. We showed that the induction of anti-tumor responses is not hampered by SFV-specific immunity in homologous prime-boost protocols. However, a phenomenon called T cell competition, competition between SFV-specific and tumor antigen-specific T cells, may occur upon immunization with rSFV. The fact that homologous prime-boost immunization regimens involving rSFV are not severely affected by vector-specific cellular immune responses suggests that the immunogenicity of the SFV vector is limited. This provides a further explanation for the exquisite ability of the SFV vector system to induce strong CTL responses against encoded foreign antigens of interest. Furthermore, we investigated serum cytokines as novel diagnostic and prognostic options for ovarian cancer. We demonstrated that serum levels of the cytokine IL- 7, in combination with CA- 125, more accurately distinguishes between malignant and benign ovarian tumors than serum CA- 125 alone. ...|$|R
