Though traditionally served warm, cold varieties exist in supermarkets and food stalls in cafeterias with bean curd in a <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> state. These pre-packed cups, sold with a plastic spoon or wooden popsicle stick, tend to contain a firmer tofu.|$|R
60|$|All {{around him}} the great ocean {{was covered with}} its coat of <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> ice; for {{although}} winter was past, and the sun of early spring {{was at the time}} gleaming on bergs that raised their battlements and pinnacles into a bright blue sky, the hoary king of the far north refused as yet to resign his sceptre and submit to the interregnum of the genial sun.|$|R
5000|$|Back {{closures}} {{allow for}} a <b>solid</b> <b>unbroken</b> front to the garment that is uncluttered by fasteners. On thinner and more fitted garments, the bulk introduced by a button placket or a zippered seam may also be deemed less conspicuous when worn at the back. Designers thus often favor back closures in couture and formal wear, where aesthetics are more important: the solid front makes it simpler to feature elaborate necklines, embroidery and fabric patterns across the bust.|$|R
5|$|Unlike humans, horses do {{not sleep}} in a <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} {{standing}} rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|R
50|$|Monobrowlines are {{a variant}} of browlines in which the bridge is {{contiguous}} with the caps, creating a <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> line {{across the top of}} the frame. The style dates back to the Shuron Stag, a browline prototype, which enjoyed some brief popularity before being replaced by the Ronsir as Shuron's flagship frame. The original stag had no metal chassis: the lenses were mounted directly to the brow caps via two sets of screws. The modern monobrowline originated in the 1980s, as part of an effort by Bausch and Lomb to diversify their Ray-Ban sunglass collection with the Wayfarer Max, a fusion of the then-popular Wayfarer and Clubmaster sunglass models. The style proved unpopular and was quickly phased out. The monobrowline design was resurrected by a variety of manufacturers in the 2010s (chiefly Oakley) after browlines returned to popularity. Unlike its tenure in the 1980s, monobrowlines proved to be a popular variant among eyeglass wearers in the 2010s.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 1960s {{and into}} the early 1970s, WHIO-TV's logo was the numeral [...] "7" [...] with the station's call letters and city of license inside a {{perforated}} circle. By the early 1970s the logo was streamlined, with the [...] "7" [...] now broken {{at the point where}} the two lines in the [...] "7" [...] meet; by this time the [...] "7" [...] was by itself inside a <b>solid</b> <b>unbroken</b> circle (usually with the call letters nearby), drawing comparisons with the [...] "Circle 7 logo" [...] used by New York's WABC-TV and other ABC-owned stations. A graphics package used around 1996 also was used, with modifications, at three other Cox-owned stations: WSOC-TV in Charlotte, WFTV in Orlando, and KIRO-TV in Seattle. Aside from some slight changes, this logo remained until early 2007, when the break was removed. Even after the change, the [...] "broken 7" [...] logo remained on the anchor desk until the move to the Cox Media Center building in December 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Belchen, {{with its}} <b>furrowed,</b> <b>unbroken</b> rock faces, rises 1,000 metres {{out of the}} Münstertal valley. Its north face is thus the area of highest relief energy in the German Central Uplands. Even towards the south the {{mountain}} drops steeply, its schrofen slopes descending 800 metres into the valley bowl of the Little Wiese near Neuenweg.|$|R
50|$|The {{cemetery}} {{is located}} on the southern slope of Long Hill, on the eastern bank of the River Dour. The site is visible from the river valley coming from the coast line. Geologically, the base rock was <b>unbroken</b> <b>solid</b> chalk.|$|R
60|$|Having picketed {{his horse}} the man {{led the way}} up the steep hill. When they reached the castle Malcolm saw that it was less ruined than it had {{appeared}} to be from below. The battlements had indeed crumbled away, and there were cracks and fissures in the upper parts of the walls, but below the walls were still <b>solid</b> and <b>unbroken,</b> and as the rock was almost precipitous, save at the point at which a narrow path wound up to the entrance, it was still capable of making a stout defence against attack.|$|R
5000|$|Horses do {{not need}} a <b>solid</b> <b>unbroken</b> period of sleep time. They obtain needed sleep by many short periods of rest. This is to be {{expected}} of a prey animal, that needs to be ready on a moment's notice to flee from predators. Horses may spend anywhere from four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. However, not all this time is the horse asleep; total sleep time in a day may range from several minutes to two hours. [...] Horses require approximately {{two and a half hours}} of sleep, on average, in a 24-hour period. Most of this sleep occurs in many short intervals of about 15 minutes each. [...] These short periods of sleep consist of five minutes of slow-wave sleep, followed by five minutes of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and then another five minutes of slow-wave sleep.Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. [...] This condition differs from narcolepsy, which horses may suffer from.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} band years in Fagersta, Sweden, Grahn, of Finnish descent, also played drums for another local band, Bad Dreams Always, a {{hardcore}} punk band. Grahn's father {{was part of}} a Finnish cover band called The Sailors, which, according to Howlin' Pelle Almqvist, The Hives' frontman, was [...] "The biggest guitar rock band in Finland at the time." [...] Grahn's father also sang in a band called The Ventons. Grahn is known for his high speed drumming and accuracy when performing, switching beats easily in songs. This may be because he himself started at the age of nine and would relentlessly play them day and night. [...] "A Get Together to Tear it Apart" [...] from Veni Vidi Vicious has an introduction by Grahn's drumming at a highly fast tempo. In The Hives' third album, Tyrannosaurus Hives, Grahn achieved an almost inhuman quality in his drumming, with rhythms and beats that are usually made by machines or synthesizers. The best example of this is in the song [...] "Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones," [...] where Grahn switches between his snare drum and mounted tom-tom with his left hand, while playing eighth-notes on his hi-hat cymbals. Another example is in the song [...] "A Little More for Little You," [...] in which Grahn plays almost three minutes of <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> sixteenth notes at a very fast tempo. Amongst other songs on the album, [...] "Love In Plaster" [...] has one of the fastest tempos thus creating a faster drum beat. Grahn's drumming on the song is unbroken, and many fans joke of Chris Dangerous' [...] "bionic arm".|$|R
6000|$|Now if {{an artist}} taking for his subject {{a chain of}} vast mountains, several leagues long, were to unite all their {{varieties}} of ravine, crag, chasm, and precipice, into one <b>solid,</b> <b>unbroken</b> mass, with one light side and one dark side, looking like a white ball or parallelopiped two yards broad, the words [...] "breadth," [...] "boldness," [...] or, [...] "generalization," [...] would scarcely be received as a sufficient apology for a proceeding so glaringly false, and so painfully degrading. But when, instead of the really large and simple forms of mountains, united, as they commonly are, by some great principle of common organization, and so closely resembling each other as often to correspond in line, and join in effect; when instead of this, {{we have to do}} with spaces of cloud twice as vast, broken up into a multiplicity of forms necessary to, and characteristic of, their very nature--those forms subject to a thousand local changes, having no association with each other, and rendered visible in a thousand places by their own transparency or cavities, where the mountain forms would be lost in shade,--that this far greater space, and this far more complicated arrangement, should be all summed up into one round mass, with one swell of white, and one flat side of unbroken gray, is considered an evidence of the sublimest powers in the artist of generalization and breadth. Now it may be broad, it may be grand, it may be beautiful, artistical, and in every way desirable. I don't say it is not--I merely say it is a concentration of every kind of falsehood: it is depriving heaven of its space, clouds of their buoyancy, winds of their motion, and distance of its blue.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of silicon {{in which the}} crystal lattice of the entire <b>solid</b> is continuous, <b>unbroken</b> to its edges, and free of any grain boundaries. Mono-Si can be prepared intrinsic, consisting only of exceedingly pure silicon, or doped, containing very small quantities of other elements added to change its semiconducting properties. Most silicon monocrystals are grown by the Czochralski process into ingots of up to 2 meters in length and weighing several hundred kilograms. These cylinders are then sliced into thin wafers {{of a few hundred}} microns for further processing.|$|R

Introduction: The relation {{of color to}} light {{is much the same}} as that of music to sound. Color has its many tones, its long scales of tints and shades, its true and its false chords. Mere sound is not particularly pleasing to us, but allow the sound to be developed into its highest forms, music, and the whole soul is thrilled. Do in light our enjoyment reaches its heighth when we view the varied hues of the sunset, or the beauties of art unfolded flower. Hence it seems very appropriate to designate color as “the music of light. ” What a dull prosaic would indeed this would be, were there no soft green forests of varying shades to rest our eyes, no new wonders in the form of unfolding blossoms always giving evidence of the inexhaustible resources of nature. Nature uses splendid judgement in the selection of colors. No glaring masses of <b>solid</b> color, <b>unbroken</b> by tint or shade are ever used...|$|R

Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 323), [...] "That which transforms things and fits them together is called change 化而裁之謂之變; that which stimulates them and sets them in motion is called continuity", with a lunar analogy (tr. Kim 2000: 128): [...] "progression {{from the first}} day to the thirtieth day a lunar month is hua (transformation). Having reached this thirtieth day, concluded and made one month, the next day belongs to the next month. This is pien (change)." [...] This [...] "change" [...] distinction also applied to lines in the Yijing hexagrams, which are either <b>unbroken,</b> <b>solid</b> Yang lines or broken, open Yin ones: [...] "Pien is from a yin line to a yang line. It changes suddenly. Therefore, it is called [...] "change" [...] (pien). change from yin to yang naturally grows to become sudden. This is called change. From yang to yin, it gradually goes on vanishing and wearing out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Le Roy v. Tatham, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156 (1852), is a {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court holding that a principle in the abstract cannot be patented, {{and no one can}} claim in it an exclusive right. The inventors had discovered the principle that hot, but congealed, lead under pressure would re-unite as an <b>unbroken</b> <b>solid</b> material, which permitted manufacture of a superior lead pipe. The apparatus to make lead pipe was old and obvious: the inventors, by making slight changes in the old machinery to provide sufficient heat and pressure to remelt the lead, in effect, invented a new use of an old machine. The claim was to the old or obvious apparatus (as an apparatus) [...] "when used to form pipes of metal under heat and pressure in the manner set forth or in any other manner substantially the same." [...] It was not lawful to patent the old apparatus again, however used, so that the patent amounted to an attempt to patent the principle. That made the patent invalid.|$|R
