5|$|During the <b>streak,</b> the Elias Sports Bureau {{changed its}} {{criteria}} for the official consecutive scoreless innings record for starting pitchers from including fractional innings in which one or two outs had been recorded to counting only complete scoreless innings. Since the <b>streak</b> was active {{at the end of}} the 1988 season, it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional scoreless innings to begin the next year. However, he yielded a run in his first inning of the 1989 season, thus ending the <b>streak.</b> The <b>streak</b> only includes innings pitched in the regular season, excluding eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 (unofficially extending his <b>streak</b> to 67 combined innings). Although he completed the ninth inning in each start, the streak's final game lasted 16 innings, of which he only pitched the first ten. Thus, Hershiser did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Like Drysdale's <b>streak,</b> the penultimate game of Hershiser's <b>streak</b> was a Dodgers–Giants game that featured a controversial umpire's ruling that saved the <b>streak.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bright slope <b>streaks</b> are <b>streaks</b> {{that have}} a lighter tone (about 2%) than their surroundings. (See F in Photo Gallery.) They are much rarer than dark slope <b>streaks,</b> but both types of <b>streaks</b> have similar morphologies and occur in the same regions of Mars. Evidence {{suggests}} that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are older than dark slope <b>streaks.</b> New bright slope <b>streaks</b> have never been observed, and dark slope <b>streaks</b> can be seen overlying bright slope <b>streaks</b> in some images, indicating that the former are younger than the latter. It is likely that bright slope <b>streaks</b> form from old dark slope <b>streaks</b> that have transitioned past a partially faded stage. This supposition is supported by geographical evidence indicating that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are slightly more common in regions where the formation rate of new dark slope <b>streaks</b> is low. In other words, areas with relatively many bright <b>streaks</b> {{tend to be less}} active and contain a higher population of old dark <b>streaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dark slope <b>streaks</b> {{commonly}} {{share the}} same slope with other slope <b>streaks</b> of varying tones. The darkest <b>streaks</b> are presumed to be youngest; they have margins that are more sharply defined than <b>streaks</b> that are not as dark. This relationship suggests that <b>streaks</b> lighten and become more diffuse with age, probably because they become covered with fresh dust falling from the atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceWe {{documented}} {{the distribution and}} the time-variation of the specific dark wind <b>streaks</b> at Pavonis Mons. We focused on the <b>streaks</b> we named Spire <b>Streaks,</b> which are overlapping spindle shaped dark <b>streaks</b> at the upper boundary of the coalesced dark <b>streaks</b> on Tharsis volcanoes. We investigated both visible and infrared images obtained by Viking orbiter camera, Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), THEMIS, CTX and HiRISE of the spire <b>streaks</b> at Pavonis Mons. We also used topographic data obtained by Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) to see {{the relationship between the}} topography and the distribution of the spire <b>streaks.</b> The spire <b>streaks</b> at Pavonis Mons provide us high-resolution information about the direction of the nighttime slope wind, and could be indirect clues for the time-variation of the nighttime environment. We conclude that the spire <b>streaks</b> are erosional features. However, some features of the spire <b>streaks</b> reported in this paper are outside the scope of previous modeling for erosional process, and we need a new category of model for the formation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{numerical}} simulations and theoretical classical analysis of time delays {{with respect to}} the instant of ionization in a numerical <b>streaking</b> experiment. These results confirm our previous interpretation of the <b>streaking</b> time delay as a finite-range and field-weighted time delay. We show that in the <b>streaking</b> experiments the time delay strongly depends on the parameters of the <b>streaking</b> field. Consequently, the <b>streaking</b> time delay is accumulated over a finite range in space, which the emitted electron probes after its transition into the continuum until the <b>streaking</b> pulse ceases. Moreover, we confirm by results of our numerical simulations that the <b>streaking</b> time delay can be understood as a sum (or integral) over field-free time delays weighted by the relative instantaneous field strength during the propagation of the photoelectron.

40|$|Viking orbiter {{observations}} extending over 1 Martian {{year have}} been used in conjunction with Mariner 9 data obtained in 1971 - 1972 to study the seasonal and secular behavior of several kinds of wind <b>streaks.</b> Most bright <b>streaks,</b> inferred to consist of dust storm fallout in the lees of obstacles, have changed very little in form or orientation over a period of 3 Martian years. Some are extremely stable and have experienced no effective eolian action over the 3 years. A few bright <b>streaks</b> changed rapidly during global dust storms; these <b>streaks</b> are located in areas subject to both global and topographic winds. Viking images have shown {{for the first time that}} dark, erosional <b>streaks</b> are stable from the time of their formation after major dust storms until the onset of the next episode of major storm activity. Available evidence shows that the large, dark <b>streaks</b> in Oxia Palus consist of material deflated from dune fields within the associated craters. These <b>streaks</b> lengthened secularly since 1972; changes appear to occur episodically during southern summer. The great majority of all <b>streaks</b> reflect winds during the period from late southern spring to early southern fall, although some changes occur throughout the year.
