50|$|Rivers are {{generally}} steep and swift, and few are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> except in their lower reaches. Most rivers {{are less than}} 300 kilometers in length, but their rapid flow from the mountains provides a valuable, renewable resource: hydroelectric power generation. Japan's hydroelectric power potential has been exploited almost to capacity. Seasonal variations in flow have led to extensive development of flood control measures. Most of the rivers are very short. The longest, the Shinano River, which winds through Nagano Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture and flows into the Sea of Japan, is only 367 kilometers long. The largest freshwater lake is Lake Biwa, northeast of Kyoto.|$|E
50|$|Through {{this period}} {{the issue of}} radio {{spectrum}} use was becoming a major concern, and had led to international efforts to decide on a frequency band <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> long-range <b>navigation.</b> This process eventually settled on the band from 90 to 100 kHz.

50|$|Apart from tea and {{petroleum}} refineries, Assam has few {{industries of}} significance. Industrial development is inhibited by its physical and political isolation from neighbouring {{countries such as}} Myanmar, China and Bangladesh and from the other growing South East Asian economies. The region is landlocked and situated in the eastern most periphery of India and is linked to the mainland of India by a flood and cyclone prone narrow corridor with weak transportation infrastructure. The international airport in Guwahati is yet to find airlines providing better direct international flights. The Brahmaputra <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> does not have sufficient infrastructure for international trade and success of such a navigable trade route will be dependent on proper channel maintenance, and diplomatic and trade relationships with Bangladesh.|$|E
50|$|For centuries, Cooum {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of the socio-economic and cultural life of the city. Till the early twentieth century, it was a clean river, most <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation.</b> In ancient times, it played a pivotal part in the far-flung maritime trade between the Roman empire, South India and Sri Lanka. Cooum's proximity to the ancient port of Manarpha or Mylapore added to the river's strategic importance. Manarpha was frequented by Roman merchants who came here to buy Indian textiles, gemstones and spices. In return, India procured gold, silver, copper and high-quality wine from the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered ancient wine jars, Roman and Chinese coins on the banks of the river. In the late eighteenth century, Pachaiyappa Mudaliar, the renowned philanthropist, bathed in this river before offering prayers at the Komaleeswarar Temple in Komaleeswaranpet.|$|E
50|$|As rivers flow onward {{towards the}} sea, they {{experience}} a considerable diminution in their fall, and a progressive {{increase in the}} basin which they drain, owing to the successive influx of their various tributaries. Thus, their current gradually becomes more gentle and their discharge larger in volume and less subject to abrupt variations; and, consequently, they become more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation.</b> Eventually, large rivers, under favorable conditions, often furnish important natural highways for inland navigation in the lower portion of their course, as, for instance, the Rhine, the Danube and the Mississippi. River engineering works are only required to prevent changes {{in the course of}} the stream, to regulate its depth, and especially to fix the low-water channel and concentrate the flow in it, so as to increase as far as practicable the navigable depth at the lowest stage of the water level.|$|E
50|$|The Hunte is a 189 km long {{river in}} {{north-western}} Germany (Lower Saxony), a left {{tributary of the}} Weser. It rises in the Wiehengebirge hills.

50|$|Egypt's {{expanding}} {{interests in}} trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build <b>suitable</b> ships <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> {{of the open}} sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled {{the length of the}} Red Sea to the Kingdom of Punt—possibly modern day Somalia—for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs (treenails) or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{appearance of the}} name Skipsea is in the 12th century and the name is of Scandinavian origin, but the actual town-site has been in use much longer.This is of no real surprise, as {{this part of the}} English coast was frequented by Viking invaders before the Norman Conquest. There is some evidence that the name Skipsea refers to its original Viking meaning of [...] "Ship Lake", but the closest literal meaning of Skipsea is [...] "a lake navigable by ships". [...] This name refers to the village's original location {{on the edge of a}} lake, which was <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> and eel-fishing, that was slightly inland from the sea. This land has since been lost because of erosion, making Skipsea a seaside Village. There is evidence of habitation dating back to the Stone and Bronze Ages because of the 19th century archaeological discovery of platforms, presumably for huts.|$|E
5000|$|Since around 1900, {{after the}} Treaty of Beijing, where Russia gained Outer Manchuria, {{the east side}} of the border had mainly been demarcated by three rivers, the Argun River from the triparty {{junction}} with Mongolia to the north tip of China, running southwest to northeast, then the Amur River to Khabarovsk from northwest to southeast, where it was joined by Ussuri River running south to north. The Ussuri River was demarcated in a non-conventional means: the demarcation line was on the right (Chinese) side of the river, putting the river with all islands in Russian possession. (“The modern method (used for the past 200 years) of demarcating a river boundary between states today is to set the boundary at either the median line (ligne médiane) of the river or around the area most <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> under what is known as the ‘thalweg principle.’”) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1768, the {{engineer}} Robert Whitworth, who {{by this time}} was James Brindley's chief surveyor and draughtsman, was asked to assess the project. He reported that the river section was not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation,</b> and should {{be replaced by a}} canal, for which he suggested two routes and a cost of £22,000, and that beyond Sprucefield the navigation should be constructed as a canal, either on the north bank of the Lagan, or on the south, which would involve building an aqueduct at Spencer's Bridge to cross the river. Although attempts were made to raise the necessary finance, and two Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1772 and 1774, to give additional powers to local commissioners, no real progress was made, and in 1779, the 'Company of Undertakers of the Lagan Navigation' was formed. The Marquess of Donegall was the chief shareholder, and most other members were either landed gentry or drawn from the nobility, and so had considerable financial resources.|$|E

50|$|Channelization of {{a stream}} may be {{undertaken}} for several reasons. One {{is to make a}} stream more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation</b> or for navigation by larger vessels with deep draughts. Another is to restrict water to a certain area {{of a stream}}'s natural bottom lands so that the bulk of such lands can be made available for agriculture. A third reason is flood control, with the idea of giving a stream a sufficiently large and deep channel so that flooding beyond those limits will be minimal or nonexistent, at least on a routine basis. One major reason is to reduce natural erosion; as a natural waterway curves back and forth, it usually deposits sand and gravel {{on the inside of the}} corners where the water flows slowly, and cuts sand, gravel, subsoil, and precious topsoil from the outside corners where it flows rapidly due to a change in direction. Unlike sand and gravel, the topsoil that is eroded does not get deposited on the inside of the next corner of the river. It simply washes away.|$|E
50|$|The DFW Metroplex had an additional, if subtle, {{geologic}} advantage. The Trinity is {{not good}} for navigation by boats but is great for drinking. Trinity River water is better than either of the larger rivers to the north and south, the Red River and the Brazos River. The larger rivers are longer and flow over salt-bearing Permian sediments, well west of the Trinity headwaters. The Trinity is consequently sweeter water than either the larger Brazos or Red rivers. Life is better and easier near sweet water, and this simple fact helped DFW prosper relative to settlements on the larger rivers to the north and south. Because the Trinity is not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>navigation,</b> the Metroplex could not have grown to be a large city until the railroad arrived, which happened early in the Metroplex's history, in the early 1870s. (See: History of Dallas, Texas (1874-1929)) The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is thus truly a modern metropolitan area, because it could not have grown so large until mechanical transportation systems made the Trinity disadvantage in river navigation insignificant.|$|E
