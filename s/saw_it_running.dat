50|$|One {{of the six}} {{prototype}} Tortoises {{constructed of}} mild steel has been preserved at The Tank Museum in Bovington, England. The vehicle is in running condition. A 2011 overhaul <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>running</b> under its own power {{for the first time}} since the 1950s. It was shown to the public in June 2011 at Tankfest 2011, the Bovington museum's annual display of running vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was during}} a visit by Frank Whittle to Gloster that Carter became {{involved}} in the development of jet aircraft. At the time Gloster were working on a twin-boom fighter, for specification F.18/37 - also used for the Hawker Typhoon, to be powered by a Napier Sabre piston engine which attracted the attention of Whittle who thought that the layout would be suitable for his new engine. Although the design Whittle saw would not progress beyond the project stage, within a few weeks, Carter was asked by the Air Ministry to submit plans for a brand new aircraft to use Whittle's engine. He agreed to the project before seeing the engine for himself. While not impressed with the engine itself, when he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>running</b> he was convinced that it could develop into a suitable powerplant given what they had managed to achieve in the somewhat primitive conditions at Lutterworth.|$|E
50|$|The Scaddan {{government}} was characterised by its {{involvement in a}} number of State-owned manufacturing and service businesses {{on the back of a}} relatively sluggish economy. The Government Trading Concerns Act 1912 <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> establishing and <b>running</b> the State Brickworks, the State Saw Mills, the State Implement Works, the State Shipping Service, the State Hotels, the State Quarry at Boya as well as meatworks, ferries and tramways.|$|R
60|$|As the touring-car {{came closer}} {{those in the}} sleigh {{who were able to}} look back <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> was <b>running</b> at a great rate of speed and swaying from side to side of the roadway. It {{contained}} four young men, out, evidently, for a gloriously good time. Dave did not dare look back to see what was coming. The grays had their ears laid well back and their whole manner showed that they were growing more nervous every instant.|$|R
60|$|Then {{one bright}} sunny morning {{something}} happened. Johnny Chuck <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Jimmy Skunk <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Happy Jack Squirrel <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Sammy Jay <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> And they told all the others.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} before she knocked! I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her white face, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her trembling hands, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her look at Laura.|$|R
5000|$|Wasser's {{assertion}} has, however, been disputed: [...] "Wow, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> when I was 6. <b>Saw</b> <b>it</b> in Brooklyn".|$|R
50|$|Parts of Australia <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> begin before sunrise, while {{parts of}} South America <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> end just after sunset.The eclipse is also {{seen in the}} Philippines {{and other parts of}} Asia at moonset. Parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> when it is visible.|$|R
60|$|Bradley Headstone caught hold of {{a pillar}} behind him. If Mr Milvey knew an ashy face when he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> then.|$|R
60|$|Clowes did {{not learn}} the news till he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on the notice-board, on the {{following}} Monday. When he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> he whistled softly.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>it</b> {{was they}} <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Nettie, the younger Miss Bunting, <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> first. She pointed, she says, {{before she could}} find words to speak. Then they all <b>saw</b> <b>it!</b> Miss Glendower, I believe, was {{the person who was}} last to see it. At any rate it would have been like her if she had been.|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} thought before of Hugh, but now, now, Dora's words {{came back to him}} at once, and he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> all--he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> all plainly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, like croquet," [...] laughed Aunt Jane. [...] "We <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> {{rise and}} <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> fall; and here {{come all the}} players, the revival. Well, how went the game?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself," [...] said a fat man, {{with a bunch}} of newly-purchased leeks in his hand. [...] "I was in Santa Maria Novella, and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself. The woman started up and threw out her arms, and cried out and said she saw a big bull with fiery horns coming down on the church to crush <b>it.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself." ...|$|R
50|$|The manner {{by which}} Article 66 was handled left {{the issue of}} the port of Rijeka (Fiume) unresolved. Croatia <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as part of its territory, but Hungary <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as Corpus separatum.|$|R
50|$|The move {{created some}} {{controversy}} {{both in the}} city and church communities. Some <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as Bellevue abandoning a community that could use the church while others <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a growing issue of white flight.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, it {{was given}} to James Lawson, a friend of Donovan. [...] "From the moment I <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> it just made me laugh," [...] Lawson states. Lawson {{describes}} himself as the [...] "elephant keeper." [...] He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a [...] "ridiculous" [...] way of commemorating the prospects attending his first-time home owner status.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> this {{afternoon}} {{when you were}} away at the Aid Society," [...] said Anne, a little slowly. [...] "I was passing your door when I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on the cushion, so I went in to look at it." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{proceedings}} concluded at 11 p.m. on 7 August, to mixed reviews. Labor <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an 'historic event'; {{their opponents}} <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as 'a waste of time'. On 8 August 1974, the Governor-General gave Royal Assent {{to all the}} bills.|$|R
60|$|I mean {{to speak}} of {{only one of these}} many world-renowned buildings, the Taj Mahal, the most celebrated {{construction}} in the earth. I had read a great deal too much about <b>it.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the daytime, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the moonlight, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> near at hand, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> from a distance; and I knew all the time, that of its kind it was the wonder of THE world, with no competitor now and no possible future competitor; and yet, it was not MY Taj. My Taj had been built by excitable literary people; it was solidly lodged in my head, and I could not blast it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take the {{swimming}} of Mountain Lad yesterday. I lived it over last night as I had lived it in reality. Then I lived it as a spectator--as the girls <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> as you <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> as the cowboy <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> and, most of all, as my husband <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Then I {{made up a}} picture of it, many pictures of it, from all angles, and painted them, and framed them, and hung them, and then, a spectator, looked at them {{as if for the}} first time. And I made myself many kinds of spectators, from crabbed old maids and lean pantaloons to girls in boarding school and Greek boys of thousands of years ago.|$|R
50|$|Gregory <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in 1886.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} by Scholz, who collated {{it in some}} places. It {{was added to the}} list of New Testament manuscripts by Scholz (1794-1852).Edward Maunde Thompson edited facsimile of one page the codex.Burgon <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> C. R. Gregory <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in 1886.|$|R
6000|$|Such was the City of Pines when I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> first. When I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> last it was but {{a smoking}} ruin, and now doubtless it {{is the home of}} bats and jackals; now it is 'a court for owls,' now 'the line of {{confusion}} is stretched out upon it and the stones of emptiness fill its streets.' ...|$|R
50|$|I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> premiered as a {{one-shot}} {{work in a}} September 30, 1972 special issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump, entitled Monthly Shōnen Jump featuring manga based on various creators' biographies. Monthly Shōnen Jump later split into its own manga anthology. Nakazawa's editor later urged him to write a longer series based on I <b>Saw</b> <b>It,</b> Barefoot Gen was what became of this. I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> was later published {{as a part of}} a compilation of Nakazawa's short stories by Holp Shuppan, entitled Heiwa no Kane Series (平和の鐘シリーズ).|$|R

50|$|During World War I, Lithuania {{declared}} independence on February 16, 1918. The declaration {{stated that}} Lithuania {{would be a}} democratic republic with Vilnius as its capital. This claim was based on historical grounds, as the city was {{the capital of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the city was multi-ethnic and other groups laid similar claims. Belarusians <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as the capital of the Belarusian nation and laid claims to the heritage of the former Grand Duchy; Jews <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as the capital of Yiddish culture; Poles <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a Polish-inhabited city.|$|R

6000|$|... "If I told you, Humphrey, Bickley {{would not}} believe, so I will not tell. Perhaps I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in that crystal, {{as did the}} necromancers of the early world. Or perhaps the crystal serves some {{different}} purpose and I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> otherwise--with my soul. At least what I say is true." ...|$|R
50|$|Ellison {{worked for}} a time in a film {{laboratory}} and while there was offered a screen test. He developed the film footage himself, and after he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> decided it was not satisfactory so he would not show it to the director. But the director <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> anyway and Ellison got a contract.|$|R
25|$|March {{organizers}} themselves disagreed {{over the}} purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the Kennedy Administration. Randolph, King, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a way of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a way of challenging and condemning the Kennedy administration's inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.|$|R
