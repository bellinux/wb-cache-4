40|$|AbstractThis paper completes our {{characterization}} of subfields {{of the matrix}} ring (F) n when the field F is a finite extension of its prime subfield Fp of characteristic p, for p a prime or zero. If N ⊂ (F) n is any subfield having rank n, then NSn(Fp) is separable, where Sn(Fp) ={αIn:α ∈ Fp} is the set of all <b>scalar</b> <b>matrices</b> over Fp. Moreover, an intermediate field M between Sn(Fp) and N has finite degree over Sn(Fp) {{if and only if}} M is a simple extension of Sn(Fp), say M = Sn(Fp) [A], A ∈ M. Let Sn(K) be the field of all <b>scalar</b> <b>matrices</b> in M (called the scalar interior of M), and let Sn(F′) be the scalar interior of N. Then K is a subfield of F with [K:Fp] < ∞, and the intermediate field Sn(F′) [A] between M and N (called the scalar closure of M in N) can be obtained by adjoining to M only <b>scalar</b> <b>matrices</b> over F′. Under classical hypotheses, the primary results of this paper constructively exhibit the fields K while characterizing the fields M. In particular, K is shown to be the fixed field of a subgroup H of G(Ff/Fp), where Ff is the coefficient field of the minimal polynomial f(x) of A over F, and H is explicitly determined by the canonical factorization of f(x) over F. The results generalize directly to subfields of (F) n having arbitrary rank itr < n...|$|R
