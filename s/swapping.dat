5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery <b>swapping.</b> In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery <b>swapping</b> station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, {{about half the time}} it takes to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E

5|$|This {{claim was}} {{rejected}} by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat <b>swapping</b> {{of friends and family}} among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian.

5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} <b>swapping</b> the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
50|$|A <b>swap</b> bank is {{a generic}} term to {{describe}} a financial institution that facilitates <b>swaps</b> between counterparties. A <b>swap</b> bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. The <b>swap</b> bank serves as either a <b>swap</b> broker or <b>swap</b> dealer. As a broker, the <b>swap</b> bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the <b>swap.</b> The <b>swap</b> broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most <b>swap</b> banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market marker, the <b>swap</b> bank stands willing to accept {{either side of a}} currency <b>swap,</b> and then later lay it off, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the <b>swap</b> bank assumes a position in the <b>swap</b> and therefore assumes certain risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the <b>swap</b> bank would receive a portion of the cash flows passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.|$|R

This study hypothesizes Treasury-LIBOR <b>swap</b> spreads {{as a function of}} the Treasury rate of comparable maturity, the slope of the yield curve, the volatility of short-term interest rates, a proxy for default risk, and liquidity in the <b>swap</b> market. The study finds that, in the long-run, <b>swap</b> spreads are negatively related to the yield curve slope and liquidity in the <b>swap</b> market.

5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include <b>swapping</b> the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A political machine known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote <b>swapping</b> had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery <b>swapping</b> stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E

In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, <b>swapping</b> with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the Ypres–Commines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division {{were placed in the}} centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to draw some attention away from the fighting that was occurring on the Somme.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the preseason, then interim-head coach Ben Olsen assumed head {{coaching}} duties, under {{a three-year contract}} for an undisclosed price. Olsen became the first head coach in franchise history to both play for and coach the squad. Upon retiring as a player on 24 November 2009 Olsen became an assistant coach under head coach Curt Onalfo. On 7 August 2010 Olsen was named interim head coach after Onalfo was fired. Olsen finished the 2010 season with a 3–8–1 record. Several major offseason acquisitions were made, in both the offense and defense. Notable signings included Charlie Davies on loan, Perry Kitchen, Dax McCarty and Josh Wolff. In the summer, a major trade was made when United traded McCarty to their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls, for Dwayne De Rosario. During the MLS regular season, United regularly hovered {{in the middle of}} the league's overall table, frequently <b>swapping</b> positions barely in or outside of a berth in the MLS Cup Playoffs. Ultimately, their playoff run ended in the 33rd week of the campaign, culminating a six-match winless streak, that included five consecutive losses.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette <b>swapping</b> scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap Kiyomi Takada, Kira's spokesperson.

However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do in such a situation. Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; Teru Mikami uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and <b>swapping</b> the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.|$|E

In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by <b>swapping</b> them out with another Spirit.
