5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is {{parasitised}} by the taiga tick, {{which can}} host the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, {{the cause of}} Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} for the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is uncertain, although {{estimates for the}} small European part of the range vary from 100â€“500 breeding pairs. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable. For this reason the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although as a northern breeding species it may {{in the long term}} be affected by climate change.|$|E
5|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>accentors</b> are {{typically}} skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover. They have an above average {{ability to maintain}} their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.|$|R
5|$|October {{and early}} November 2016 saw an {{unprecedented}} influx of <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentors</b> into western Europe, including provisional first records for Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, {{in some cases}} attracting national attention and hundreds of twitchers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>accentors</b> {{leave the}} north of their {{breeding}} range from mid-September onwards, but may stay for a further month {{or two in the}} south. In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and south easternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Russian-based German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1776 as Motacilla montanella. The accentors {{were moved to}} their current genus by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.|$|E
5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> breeds in a belt across {{northern}} Russia {{east from}} {{just west of}} the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern Siberia. It is migratory, wintering in east China and Korea. It is only rarely recorded in Japan in winter.|$|E
50|$|Resident {{bird species}} include hazel grouse, black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, goldcrest, Eurasian treecreeper, and spotted nutcracker. Summer {{visitors}} to the Hidaka Mountains include Japanese <b>accentor,</b> <b>Siberian</b> blue robin, Japanese robin, red-flanked bluetail, Siberian thrush, Eastern crowned warbler, narcissus flycatcher, blue-and-white flycatcher, dark-sided flycatcher, grey bunting, and Eurasian bullfinch. Notable bird species that transit the Hidaka mountains are Arctic warbler and eyebrowed thrush.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects, {{typically}} picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near snow fields. Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being {{carried to the}} nest at each visit.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may {{also be found in}} dry grassland and woods.|$|E
5|$|The {{call of the}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} stable population. It is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> has brown upperparts and wings, {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking {{on its back}} and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium ("eyebrow"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E

500|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>accentor</b> is from June to August.

The nest is constructed from coarse vegetation such as twigs and leaves, and lined with hair or fine grasses. The eggs are a glossy deep blue-green and measure they weigh about [...] The clutch of four to six eggs is incubated by the female for about ten days to hatching and the downy brown-black chicks are then fed by both parents. They are able to breed in the following year.|$|E
