40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to assess the accuracy of current Direct Strength Method (DSM) equations applied to steel <b>structural</b> <b>welded</b> H shapes in axial compression. Commercialised hot-rolled H sections covering IPE, HE, HD, HL, HP, W and UB profiles and made of three grades (235 MPa, 355 MPa and 460 MPa) were treated in (Li & Rossi 2012). This analysis focuses on welded sections made of the same three grades, including sections characterized by local buckling with a significant post-buckling reserve. The finite element model is described. Then, {{the results of a}} parametric analysis using the finite element model are re-ported.

40|$|This {{project work}} is {{dedicated}} to study the influence of welding process on mechanical properties (such as ultimate tensile strength, hardness, and impact toughness) of <b>welded</b> <b>structural</b> steel component. In this work three grades of <b>welded</b> <b>structural</b> steel have been developed by using three different grades of electrodes such as E 7016, E 7018 and E 7024. Comparative study has been made between the three grades ofwelded structural steel work pieces. Nondestructive test methods are used to find {{the quality of the}} weld.

Based on the results of the tests carried out on the welded specimen using the three different grades of electrodes it is observed that the <b>structural</b> steel <b>welded</b> using E 7016 grade exhibits better mechanical properties and hence crack resisting capability or fracture toughness. The stress intensity factor for the <b>structural</b> steel <b>welded</b> using E 7016 has been evaluated by using the data obtained from the fracture toughness test. The stress intensity factor thus obtained is validated by using FEM. Finally, mini hydraulic excavator bucket has been taken for the static stress analysis in the welded region...|$|R

A major advantage of radiography compared to other inspection techniques is the availability of objective quality evidence, the radiograph, as a permanent record of the inspection.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{laboratory tests}} of arc-welded T-joints between equal width rectangular hollow sections (called “matched box connections” in ANSI/AWS D 1. 1 - 2000 <b>Structural</b> <b>Welding</b> Code). The brace and chord members were cold-formed with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa. The welds were laid using MMAW and GMAW processes without profiling the brace ends. The brace of each specimen was loaded in tension to failure with the chord supported continuously {{so as not}} to induce significant bending effects. The test results showed that the joint strength can be improved by using backing strips for the butt (or groove) welds, while backing rods (or filler rods) should not be used as they led to larger variation in joint strengths, and often, inferior strengths. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the IIW Recommendations and Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8. It is shown that for cold-formed tubes with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa (or above), a design check on the strength of the butt (or groove) weld is required in addition to the checks on the strengths of the chord and brace members specified in the current design guidelines. An equation is proposed for calculating the strength of the weld...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} an engineering approach based upon a toughness scaling methodology incorporating the effects of weld strength mismatch on crack-tip driving forces. The approach adopts a nondimensional Weibull stress, (sigma) over bar (w), as a the near-tip driving force to correlate cleavage fracture across cracked weld configurations with different mismatch conditions even though the loading parameter (measured by J) may vary widely due to mismatch and constraint variations. Application of the procedure to predict the failure strain for an overmatch girth weld made of an API X 80 pipeline steel demonstrates the effectiveness of the micromechanics approach.

40|$|Rotary kilns {{fired by}} coal or gas burners {{are widely used}} to process mineral sands to extract pure minerals, most {{commonly}} titanium dioxide, (TiO 2), in Western Australia. The kilns vary in size depending on refinery throughput, however most are very large items up to 70 metres long and 6 meters in diameter. The kilns are constructed from carbon manganese structural and pressure vessel plates and welded {{in the same manner}} a s large pressure vessels, however <b>structural</b> <b>welding</b> standards are applied. The mineral sands are purified using a pyrometallurgical process where the internal operating temperature reaches approximately 1200 °C. These temperatures are outside the operational limits of carbon manganese steel, so a protective internal layer of refractory approximately 250 mm thick is required to reduce the shell temperature to between 100 °C and 200 °C. The refractory is poured in strips along the bottom of the kiln incorporating refractory anchors to stabilise the refractory upon drying. The refractory anchors are 253 MA stainless steel, secured to the kiln shell via a welded lug incorporating a slot. This design is referred to as a “rotor lok” assembly. Failure of the welded lug is relatively common during service, requiring costly kiln shutdown for remedial work and casting new refractory. The failures are mainly contributable to stress concentrations present at the fillet weld toes, with fatigue the failure mechanism in all cases. When failures arise, movement of the refractory lining over time causes a loss of lining where irreversible damage to the kiln shell occurs. This dissertation researches and discusses alternative methods for securing the 253 MA stainless steel refractory anchor to the kiln shell to provide a higher level of serviceability and reliability to prevent costly unexpected refinery shutdown. Over time, total replacement of the refractory is necessary, and renewing the anchor attachments using current methods is time consuming and expensive without consideration to lost production revenue. Stud welding is proposed as a realistic option for the application of securing the refractory anchor. The author has attempted to persuade operators of rotary kilns that this option is viable, by applying mechanical testing regimes to selected studs which show the stud welded option out performs the welded lug in all testing applied...|$|E

Common approaches for ergonomic risk evaluations of manual handling tasks in workplaces are: (i) perceptions based information and (ii) field observations, both have certain limitations and challenges. Therefore, applying virtual reality (VR) technique with kinematic motion captures and simulation studies in virtual environment have been additionally considered in our research.
