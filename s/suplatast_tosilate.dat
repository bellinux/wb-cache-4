40|$|Background: <b>Suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> {{is a type}} 2 (Th 2) {{cytokine}} inhibitor {{that blocks}} the production of IgE antibodies and the invasion of tissues by eosinophils during an allergic reaction. <b>Suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> ameliorates asthma symptoms and airway hypersensitivity by inhibiting production of the Th 2 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 5. Methods: In the present study, a comparative examination of the therapeutic effects of <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> {{was carried out in}} patients with mild intermittent and mild persistent asthma by randomly allocating 35 adult patients to a <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> group (n = 18; 100 mg <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> three times daily) and a beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) group (n = 17; 200 μg BDP twice daily) for 6 weeks of treatment. Results: The <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> group required more time than the BDP group to show improvement in peak expiratory flow, but at week 6 the change from baseline was nearly the same in both groups. A significant improvement was observed for both groups in the peripheral blood eosinophil ratio, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels, induced sputum ECP levels, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and airway hypersensitivity, but induced sputum ECP level was lower in the BDP group than in the <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> group. Total IgE levels decreased in the <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> group only.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe airway wall of {{asthmatic}} {{patients is}} infiltrated with inflammatory cells, consisting chiefly of eosinophils and T lymphocytes. Among these T lymphocytes, Th 2 cells {{are involved in}} the regulation of the IgE immune response and local allergic inflammation, which underlie allergic diseases. Various cytokines produced and released by Th 2 cells play important roles in the development of many allergic diseases, including asthma, and the exacerbations of their disease states. Therefore, targeting of Th 2 cell-derived cytokines is a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of asthma. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents can potently inhibit Th 2 cytokine-mediated responses, but have no selectivity for Th 2 cells: they also exert pharmacological activity against cells other than inflammatory cells, thereby potentially causing adverse side-effects. However, <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> is the only specific Th 2 cytokine inhibitor that can be used clinically and it has been used widely in Japan as a maintenance drug in the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. There is considerable evidence of the effectiveness of <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> in patients with mild asthma or moderate persistent asthma. Furthermore, an effect on cough variant asthma and a steroid-sparing effect have also been reported for <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Th 2 -related immune and {{inflammatory}} responses {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), but few clinical lines of evidence have been reported regarding how and whether Th 2 -related responses are associated with other risk factors {{in the treatment of}} AD patients. In this study, the associations between the polymorphisms of genes related to the pathophysiology of AD and the efficacy of <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate,</b> an oral immunemodulator known to downregulate Th 2 -related allergic responses, were analyzed in adult patients with chronic AD. Patients were recruited from our previous study, where <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> was evaluated for its efficacy when used in combination with topical steroids. The genotypes of 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 27 genes related to AD pathogenesis were then determined in 17 responders and 18 non-responders, as defined by the improvement rate in their AD skin scores. While {{no significant difference in the}} patient background was observed between responders and non-responders, significant associations were noted between the response to treatment with <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> and three SNPs of IL- 4 (- 590 C/T: P= 0. 04, - 33 C/T: P= 0. 04) and IL- 12 B (1188 A/C: P= 0. 03), but not for the other SNPs. Of note, ethnic differences in the genotype frequencies of IL- 4 - 590 C/T and IL- 12 B 1188 A/C SNPs were found. In conclusion, the present results raise the possibility that AD patients who tend to produce more IL- 4 and IL- 12 may be susceptible to <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> treatment and that ethnic variations should be considered to further understand the role of Th 2 -related responses...|$|E

40|$|Background: Immunomodulatory {{therapy has}} been {{recently}} introduced {{for the management}} of asthma. <b>Suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> (ST), a new immune-modifying drug, is known to improve the airway function by inhibiting the release of Th- 2 cytokines. However, its efficacy as a controller listed in the guideline, Global Initiative for Asthma 2005 has not been established. In this study we investigated the role of ST in leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) non-responders with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma before initiating corticosteroids inhalation therapy. Methods: This was a prospective open-level clinical trial. LTRAs was given to 41 patients with asthma for 4 weeks and clinical efficacy was assessed using daily symptom scores. The 10 patients, aged 2. 5 - 8. 5 years, who failed to show clinical improvement, were defined as LTRA non-responders. After a 1 -week washout period, the efficacy of ST was investigated and compared with LTRA non-responders for the following 4 weeks. Results: LTRA non-responders showed a significant improvement in the average symptom score, peak expiratory flow, use of rescue medication and the proportion of symptom-free days with ST therapy.

40|$|AbstractHistamine H 1 {{receptor}} (H 1 R) gene is upregulated {{in patients}} with pollinosis; its expression level is highly correlated with the nasal symptom severity. Antihistamines are widely used as allergy treatments because they inhibit histamine signaling by blocking H 1 R or suppressing H 1 R signaling as inverse agonists. However, long-term treatment with antihistamines does not completely resolve toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) -induced nasal symptoms, although it can decrease H 1 R gene expression to the basal level, suggesting additional signaling {{is responsible for the}} pathogenesis of the allergic symptoms. Here, we show that treatment with <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> in combination with antihistamines markedly alleviates nasal symptoms in TDI-sensitized rats. Suplatast suppressed TDI-induced upregulation of IL- 9 gene expression. Suplatast also suppressed ionomycin/phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate-induced upregulation of IL- 2 gene expression in Jurkat cells, in which calcineurin (CN) /nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling is known to be involved. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that suplatast inhibited binding of NFAT to DNA. Furthermore, suplatast suppressed ionomycin-induced IL- 9 mRNA upregulation in RBL- 2 H 3 cells, in which CN/NFAT signaling is also involved. These data suggest that suplatast suppressed NFAT-mediated IL- 9 gene expression in TDI-sensitized rats and this might be the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effects of combined therapy of suplatast with antihistamine...|$|E

Methods: : This study compared the prophylactic effectiveness of <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> with that of mequitazine in children with asthma symptoms, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn. The study group comprised 27 children aged 2 to 15 years who required treatment for asthmatic attacks {{during the past year}} and tested positive at least for mite allergen in the preceding autumn. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either suplatast or mequitazine. The primary endpoint of this study was the number of days without symptoms during the 8 weeks of treatment.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the predictive factors, among laboratory test data and patient background variables, of an efficient response to the anti-allergic agent <b>suplatast</b> <b>tosilate</b> in patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma. Methods: The subjects were 44 patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy who were enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of suplatast (300 and 600 mg/day). Improvements in respiratory function parameters and symptom scores during the first 4 weeks of administration of suplatast were assessed to evaluate the response to the drug. Logistic regression analysis was used to relate the response to the independent variables. Secondly, to test whether these results were applicable to clinical practice, we examined the data from a phase III clinical trial of suplatast. Results: Twenty-two patients were assessed as responders according to our criteria. The percentage of blood eosinophil (%EOS, P = 0. 015) and basophil (%BASO, P = 0. 019) counts were identified as significant variables to predict responders. When cut-off levels for %EOS and %BASO were set at 7. 5 and 1. 2, respectively, the sensitivity for prediction of responders with lower %EOS and %BASO was 81. 8 % (18 / 22). Furthermore, when we applied the same cut-off levels to subjects of a phase III clinical trial of suplatast, the sensitivity of prediction was found to be as high as 75. 0 % (6 / 8). Conclusions: These results indicate that %EOS and %BASO are good candidates to predict the response to suplatast among patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy. These predictors may contribute, in combination with genomic information, to stratified medical treatment tailored to the individual needs of patients...|$|E
