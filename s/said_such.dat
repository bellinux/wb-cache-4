5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having <b>said</b> <b>such</b> things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E
25|$|This {{ruling by}} the appeals court {{provoked}} strong criticism from attorneys representing detainees at Guantanamo {{as well as from}} within the appeals court. Lawyers <b>said</b> <b>such</b> a special presumption does not comply with the requirements set by the Supreme Court in its Boumediene decision.|$|E
25|$|Considering Padilla {{was held}} for years in {{military}} custody with no formal charges, many observers were shocked by the charges finally brought by the Bush presidential administration. Critics <b>said</b> <b>such</b> a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the cause that would eventually be tried.|$|E

25|$|On {{election}} day morning, Corwin obtained {{a court order}} from a Justice of the New York Supreme Court that took effect when the polls closed. The order would impound all voting equipment, temporarily enjoin the canvas of paper ballots and bar the certification of the winner pending further court proceedings. Corwin's campaign <b>said</b> <b>such</b> orders are usual in close elections. According to The Buffalo News, however, the order was likely rendered moot by Corwin's concession, also on May 24, 2011.|$|E
25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they <b>said</b> <b>such</b> things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E

25|$|On June 22, 2015, Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley {{called for}} the flag's removal from state house grounds. In the {{following}} weeks before the flag was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, were arrested for removing or attempting to remove the flag as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. The attempts to remove the flag were criticized by several S.C. State legislators who supported the flag's removal because they <b>said</b> <b>such</b> actions could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{began to}} shift its {{focus in the}} early 2000s to attract a broader audience, by {{incorporating}} more reality-based series focusing on automotive, occupations, and speculative investigation series; though the refocused programming strategy proved popular, Discovery Channel's ratings began to decline {{by the middle of}} the decade. The drop in viewership was widely attributed to an over-reliance on a few hit series, such as Monster Garage and American Chopper. Some critics <b>said</b> <b>such</b> shows strayed from Discovery's intention of providing more educationally based shows aimed at helping viewers learn about the world around them. In 2005, Discovery changed its programming focus to include more popular science and historical themes. The network's ratings eventually recovered in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Home Minister {{and former}} Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Rajnath Singh, appealed to people to {{maintain}} communal harmony and promised strict action against those try to disrupt it. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley <b>said</b> <b>such</b> incidents affect {{the image of}} the nation and people should rise above them. Mahesh Sharma, a BJP Union Minister, said that the lynching was not planned but an unfortunate accident. However, he promised justice to the family. Another BJP leader Tarun Vijay said that this incident may derail the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda of development. He asked Hindus to look after cows instead of resorting to violence. He also pointed to the issues of beef export and stray cows consuming plastic from garbage. Another BJP leader, Sakshi Maharaj criticised the exgratia amount and said that if a Hindu had been killed his family would have received much less.|$|E

He merely distinguished Re London Wine Co, allowing him to decide the case on the facts alone.

500|$|A {{spokeswoman}} for Conroy <b>said</b> <b>such</b> attacks {{were not a}} legitimate political protest. According to her, they were [...] "totally irresponsible and potentially deny services to the Australian public". The Systems Administrators Guild of Australia said that it [...] "condemned DDoS attacks as {{the wrong way to}} express disagreement with the proposed law". Anti-censorship groups criticised the attacks, saying they hurt their cause. A purported spokesperson for the attackers recommended that the wider Australian public protest the filter by signing the petition of Electronic Frontiers Australia.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao {{is not the place to}} look for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she <b>said</b> <b>such</b> a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He <b>said</b> <b>such</b> criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we really had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E

500|$|In October 2014, a {{stand-up}} comedy routine by Hannibal Buress, addressing allegations of rape against Cosby, went viral on YouTube. On November 10, Cosby posted a message requesting meme images, using a hashtag of #CosbyMeme, on his Twitter feed. Many {{of the images}} posted in response related to the allegations, which were fresh in the respondents' minds. After numerous women came forward as victims of Cosby's alleged actions, a television special and a series in development were cancelled. Cosby refused to address the situation; his lawyer <b>said</b> <b>such</b> actions would dignify [...] "decade-old, discredited" [...] allegations. Many media outlets commented on the way such actions clashed with his image as [...] "America's Dad". One of the accusers felt nobody would believe her claims {{at the time of}} the alleged incident, given Cosby's status in advertising. Joan Tarshis told the media that Cosby was [...] "Mr America; Mr Jello, as I called him".|$|E
500|$|Israel {{accomplished}} its {{objective of}} destroying the Fatah camp, {{and on a}} tactical level, the battle did indeed end in Israel's favor. [...] "The Karama operation exposed the vulnerability of PLO units deployed along the Jordan River and so they moved their concentrations up into the mountains. This imposed additional strains on them and made their operations into the West Bank even more involved and difficult {{than they had been}} hitherto." [...] Politically however, Israel was heavily condemned by the world opinion. U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Arthur Goldberg, said [...] "We believe that the military counteractions such as those which have just taken place, on a scale out of proportion to the acts of violence that preceded it, are greatly to be deplored." [...] US Ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, said that in twenty years time, a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the destruction of Israel. Eban reported the Ambassabor's statement to the cabinet, and Menachem Begin <b>said</b> <b>such</b> an utterance must not be cited in a cabinet meeting.|$|E
