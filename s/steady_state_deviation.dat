A model is presented of the dynamic behaviour of the system on an aggregate level. For two control modes, the variance and the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>deviation</b> of the order flow time from the norm is calculated.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{pipeline system}} with a multistage centrifugal pump was used to study the effect of transient operations on the hydrodynamic performance of a centrifugal pump. Several transient flow operations were considered, ranging from very mild to severe transients. The dynamic relationship of total pressure rise across the pump to the flow rate was {{compared with that of}} the <b>steady</b> <b>state.</b> <b>Deviation</b> between the dynamic pump head and the value given by the steady-state curve at the same instantaneous discharge was established and found to be a function of the severity of the transient. It was found that severe flow conditions could cause this deviation to exceed 30 % of the steady-state value. The use of the steady-state pump head-discharge relationship in the solution of transient pipe flow by the method of characteristics (MOC) is discussed. It was found that the steady-state pump head-discharge curve was not accurate enough to support the solution of unsteady pipe flow application by the MOC...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the highly}} complex {{structure}} of the load-sensing pump, its compensators and controlling elements, simulation of load-sensing pump system pose many challenges to researchers. One way to overcome some of the difficulties with creating complex computer model {{is the use of}} “black box” approach to create an approximation of the system behaviour by analyzing input/output relationships. That means the details of the physical phenomena are not so much of concern in the “black box” approach. Neural network can be used to implement the black box concept for system identification and it is proven that the neural network have the ability to model very complex behaviour and there is a well defined set of neural and neural network structures. Previous studies have shown the problems and limitations in dynamic system modeling using static neuron based neural networks. Some new neuron structures, Dynamic Neural Units (DNUs), have been developed which open a new area to the research associated with the system modelling. The overall objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of using a dynamic neural unit (DNU) based dynamic neural network (DNN) in modeling a hydraulic component (specifically a load-sensing pump), and the model could be used in a simulation with any other required component model to aid in hydraulic system design. To be truly representative of the component, the neural network model must be valid for both the steady state and the transient response. Due to three components (compensator, pump and control valve) in a load sensing pump system, there were three different pump model structures (the pump, compensator and valve model, the compensator and pump model, and the “pump only” model) from the practical point of view, and they were analysed thoroughly in this study. In this study, the DNU based DNN was used to model a “pump only” model which was a portion of a complete load sensing pump. After the trained DNN was tested {{with a wide variety of}} system inputs and due to the steady state error illustrated by the trained DNN, compensation equation approach and DNN and SNN combination approach were then adopted to overcome the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>deviation.</b> It was verified, through this work, that the DNU based DNN can capture the dynamics of a nonlinear system, and the DNN and SNN combination can eliminate the steady state error which was generated by the trained DNN. The first major contribution of this research was in investigating the feasibility of using the DNN to model a nonlinear system and eliminating the “error accumulation” problem encountered in the previous work. The second major contribution is exploring the combination of DNN and SNN to make the neural network model valid for both steady state and the transient response...|$|E
40|$|For a {{microgrid}} {{with high}} renewable energy penetration to work autonomously, it must maintain its own supply-demand balance of active power. Maximum peak power tracking algorithms, which emphasize high renewable energy utilization, may cause a supply-demand imbalance when the available renewable generation {{is more than}} demanded, especially for autonomous microgrids. Currently, droop control {{is one of the}} most popular decentralized methods for sharing active and reactive loads among the distributed generators. However, conventional droop control methods suffer from slow and oscillating dynamic response and <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>deviations.</b> To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a distributed subgradient-based solution to coordinate the operations of different types of distributed renewable generators in a microgrid. By controlling the utilization levels of renewable generators, the supply-demand balance can be well maintained and the system dynamic performance can be significantly improved. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control solution...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{an economy}} where the labour market does not {{necessarily}} clear because real wages are sticky. Wages are fully indexed to prices, and are optimally adjusted over time in response to <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>deviations</b> of output and of inflation. Inflation deviations will arise if wage setters make contracts that take into account long term forces, fulfilling a “social contract”. When fiscal policy drives a wedge between long run and current inflation, it can have supply-side effects. If goods markets always clear and future inflation is perfectly foreseen, fiscal policy can have real supply-side effects. With only money finance, such effectiveness exists only if the economy has sufferred from an exogenous supply shock. If debt shares in the finance of fiscal deficits, real effects can be created even if the system is in <b>steady</b> <b>state.</b> The direction of the effects depend upon {{the extent to which}} fiscal policy is endogenised on account of the implied debt service. A fiscally cautious government will create net output gains after an expansion. If goods markets do not clear, and the price level (but not inflation) is sticky, supply-side fiscal policy can only operate in a Classical Unemployment region. In this region, fiscal expansion only affects inflation, and output is perpetually stuck. ...|$|R

In the present paper, we compare distributed secondary control strategies {{with regard to their}} behaviour under the explicit consideration of clock drifts. In particular we show that, if not considered in the tuning procedure, the presence of clock drifts may impair an accurate frequency restoration and power sharing. As a consequence, we derive tuning criteria such that zero <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> frequency <b>deviation</b> and power sharing is achieved even in the presence of clock drifts.

We also show that the inclusion of controllable demand results in a drop in <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> frequency <b>deviations.</b> We discuss how various classes of dynamics used in recent studies fit within our framework and show that this allows for less conservative stability and optimality conditions.
