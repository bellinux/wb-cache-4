In 2014, Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced {{formation of a}} National Sports Institute (ISN) in Tawau. It will be the third sports <b>satellite</b> <b>centre</b> in Sabah once completed in 2015. A cross-border sporting event was held in 2014 between the town and Nunukan in Indonesia. It has been proposed to be repeated annually to strengthen ties between the towns.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The <b>satellite</b> <b>centre</b> rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E

For example, the French space agency CNES has a total budget of €2015 million, of which €755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to ESA. Several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and ESA (e.g. COROT). Also, ESA {{is not the only}} European governmental space organisation (for example European Union <b>Satellite</b> <b>Centre).</b>|$|E
25|$|EU {{forces have}} been {{deployed}} on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia. EU military operations are supported {{by a number of}} bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union <b>Satellite</b> <b>Centre</b> and the European Union Military Staff. Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders. It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration. In 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management. In an EU consisting of 28 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} 160 years Papanui has {{developed}} into a major suburban centre and is a <b>satellite</b> <b>centre</b> for Government and City Council services. These include the central government 'Super Centre' in Winstone Avenue, Housing New Zealand in Restell Street and the Council Service Centre and Library on Langdons Road. The area has two high schools and five primary schools. Commercial growth has been strong {{with most of the}} Trades and Professions centred on the shopping areas. There is little farm land left in the suburb with most of it having been developed into residential and commercial properties. The original Papanui shopping village is located at the Papanui Junction and the area is home to Northlands Shopping Centre on the Main North Road, {{which is one of the}} largest malls in the South Island.|$|E

25|$|Assembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, {{designated}} C25, {{started on}} 5 August 2013. The mounting {{of the five}} scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research Organisation <b>Satellite</b> <b>Centre,</b> Bangalore, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle. The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months. Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission. During a meeting on 30 September 2014, NASA and ISRO officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore Mars. One of the working group's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the MAVEN orbiter and MOM, {{as well as other}} current and future Mars missions.|$|E

2500|$|By {{this period}} the {{distinctive}} Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, {{and continued to}} develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to Islamic art. [...] In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from Baghdad” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the mihrab of the Great Mosque (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must {{have led to the}} establishment of a <b>satellite</b> <b>centre</b> for the production of ceramics in Quairawan, but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.|$|E

This study identifies the social significance especially the uses and abuses of <b>satellite</b> television <b>centres</b> in Makurdi town. Also, the study identifies the strategy that is effective in curbing the abuses of <b>satellite</b> television viewing <b>centres</b> in Makurdi town. Using a survey of two hundred and twenty (220) respondents who patronise <b>satellite</b> television viewing <b>centres</b> in Makurdi, the study finds among other things that: <b>satellite</b> television viewing <b>centres</b> are used to advance sporting interests, however they are abused when criminals use these centres as meeting places and hideouts. Furthermore, the study finds that the dominant use of <b>satellite</b> television viewing <b>centres</b> to televise football matches leads to neglect of local football teams and this has far reaching implications. The study recommends that proprietors should regulate entry and the police force should step up monitoring of these centres to ensure order and rule of law. Also, proprietors of these centres should explore the profitability of such centres for other purposes such as music videos as an additional income earner to football. Finally, the Nigerian government should utilise the huge gathering of youth at <b>satellite</b> television viewing <b>centres</b> {{as an opportunity to}} create awareness {{on a wide range of}} issues...|$|R
