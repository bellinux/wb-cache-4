By multiplication he found that each plant produced enough seeds to plant [...] of ground, and the great grandchildren of a single plant could [...] "carpet the entire surface of the land throughout the globe" [...] if unchecked.|$|E

2500|$|Fertilized flowers mature {{to form an}} egg shaped, two-parted <b>seed</b> <b>capsule.</b> As the <b>seed</b> <b>capsule</b> dries out it cracks open (dehisces), {{dropping}} the seed on the ground (see gravity dispersal). The black seeds are generally round and often bear webbed surface markings, although those of B. lamellata are strongly ridged (see [...] ). The germination of many species is brought on by brush fires after the dry period; components of the smoke are responsible for triggering germination.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the iris}} has flowered, between June and August, it {{produces}} an ellipsoid or obovoid (oblong-ovoid), light green, <b>seed</b> <b>capsule.</b> It is [...] long and 2-2.5cm wide, and has 6 ribs. When it ripens, (and goes brown), it splits in three, along 2 or more seams, {{starting from the}} top. Inside, are multiple, black-brown seeds, which are pyriform (pear shaped) and have a small cream (coloured) aril (appendage).|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{fragment of}} the Orgueil meteorite (kept {{in a sealed}} glass jar since its discovery) was found in 1965 to have a <b>seed</b> <b>capsule</b> embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed {{was found to be}} that of a European Juncaceae or Rush plant that had been glued into the fragment and camouflaged using coal dust. The outer [...] "fusion layer" [...] was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator of this hoax is unknown, it is thought that they sought to influence the 19th century debate on spontaneous generation — rather than panspermia — by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.|$|E

30|$|Small {{numbers of}} {{capsules}} {{were collected from}} fragmented populations, single plants in some cases, from the CHM following the guidelines stipulated in the collecting permit from Madagascar Conservation authorities. The majority of <b>seed</b> <b>capsules</b> collected by the IVC method yielded seeds in a good state of freshness that stayed sterile inside the capsules. There was some discoloration in {{a small percentage of}} small <b>seed</b> <b>capsules.</b> Based on the size, colour and texture of the <b>seed</b> <b>capsules</b> the sterilisation regime was followed as in Table  1, which shows that almost all the <b>seed</b> <b>capsules</b> collected in Madagascar by IVC gave rise to sterile seed cultures. In total 87.5 % of the capsules were sterile and the seeds were also clean after 3  months of culture. Both NaDCC and PPM were essential to suppress microbial growth at various steps of the process from wild collecting to culture of seeds under laboratory conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of balance training, plus black <b>seeds</b> <b>capsules</b> on knee joint injuries, balance and performance. Materials and Methods: Thirty students from Banha Univ. volunteered to participate in the study, they were affected with knee joint injuries (strain, sprain), aged (19 - 22 y). They were divided to three groups each of 10 students, balance training group, balance training with black <b>seeds</b> <b>capsules</b> (200 mg/daily), control group. The training course run for one hour a day, four days weekly and lasted 3 months. Control group did not participate to the training. Tests were performed at baseline and after 3 months: vertical jump, isometric lower limb extension 5 huttle run, balance test, knee joint range motion. The results suggest neuromuscular adaptation and activation of proprioceptors leading to improved balance, range of motion and performance in case of balance training group plus black <b>seeds</b> <b>capsules</b> compared to balance training alone or control group.
