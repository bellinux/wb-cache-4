5|$|Cú Chulainn {{has many}} lovers, but Emer's only jealousy comes when he {{falls in love}} with Fand, wife of Manannán mac Lir. Manannán has left her and she has been {{attacked}} by three Fomorians who want to control the Irish Sea. Cú Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manannán knows their relationship is doomed because Cú Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; Cú Chulainn's presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand's love for Cú Chulainn she decides to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer's magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manannan <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> cloak between Cú Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and Cú Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks {{briefly to}} Sen. Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{production}} is {{an adaptation of}} {{only part of the}} novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fist in anger at the squire after he has departed.|$|E

In response Pokrovsky only <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head and then passes away.

A coup attempt by Nathan Bedford Forrest III <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> confidence in his men, and he begins to lose his grip on reality. Even then, he believes {{that he will be}} able to get his way through the use of superbombs, a technology he had poured everything he could into upon realizing the war would not be short.

However, the bomb detonates on the outskirts of the city west of the Schuylkill River and doesn't affect any US Government buildings.|$|E

500|$|In {{conveying}} his {{impressions of}} Falstaff, Hazlitt first emphasises the sheer physical bulk that we remember him by: [...] "We are as {{well acquainted with}} his person as his mind, and his jokes come upon us with double force and relish from the quantity of flesh through which they make their way, as he <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fat sides with laughter [...]|$|E
500|$|During {{spawning}} season, the fins and {{underside of}} male bowfin often {{change in color}} to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. [...] The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie {{side by side in}} the nest. [...] She deposits her eggs while he <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.|$|E

500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to be one of them. The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to let her in. It is likely she quit the job for him and wants to stay. The assistant <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a flutter of silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the door. After that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E

Renato arrives and shakes Riccardo's hand in greeting. Riccardo's true identity is now revealed and he is acclaimed by the people.|$|E
60|$|Morris <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head {{to convey}} the blankness of his ignorance, whereupon other men {{addressed}} him, also in northern tongues. Then, as he still <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head, a lad of about nineteen came forward and spoke in broken and barbarous French.|$|R

2500|$|Joel Coen {{seems to}} agree. In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Picasso, keen as a whip, {{spirited}} as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to {{his studio}} and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head {{and does not}} smile! He chats thoughtfully of the [...] "Harmony and volume" [...] and [...] "architectural values," [...] and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At this point, if the oleh has {{recently}} been in danger of death (such as serious sickness or surgery or an airplane flight or captivity), he will add the Birkhat HaGomel – a blessing of thanks to God [...] "who has dealt kindly with me". The officiant may add a benediction for the oleh's good health, {{and there are some}} other blessings that may be added depending on the situation. The oleh will kiss the scroll again, and may shake hands with the oleh of the previous portion, who now returns to his seat, and if there is another portion to be read, the oleh steps aside for the next oleh, stands beside the desk while the next oleh reads his portion, <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> hand and offers felicitation, thanks the officiant and the actual scroll reader for the honor he has received, and then returns to his seat – but slowly, as if reluctant to leave the scroll, and probably will pause on the way to accept the felicitations of various members of the congregation.|$|E
60|$|On {{his very}} first Sunday he preached to his {{congregation}} on eternal punishment, leaning forward in his black gown and <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> fist at them.

6000|$|... "The {{senior clerk}} <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> grey locks sadly! sadly he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> thin grey locks, for he grieved {{at the sight}} which he saw. 'Twas sad to see the {{energies}} of this young man thus sapped in his early youth by the all-absorbing strength of a hopeless passion. Crinoline was now, as it were, a household word at the Episcopal Audit Board. The senior clerk believed her to be cruel, and as he knew for what object these two hours of idleness were requested, he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> thin grey locks in sorrow.|$|R
2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that [...] "there are teeth-marks all over it [...] [...] [...] she nibbles her pencil [...] [...] [...] she's HUMAN!" [...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> hand firmly, then tells him, [...] "You're a good man, Charlie Brown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{also was}} caricatured in several Warner Brothers {{cartoons}} including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (1939, as Casper the Caveman), I Love to Singa, Slap Happy Pappy, and Goofy Groceries (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), Malibu Beach Party (1940, as himself), and The Mouse that Jack Built (1959). The last {{of these is}} probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a phat-phat-bang! away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head, smiles wryly, and mutters, [...] "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." [...] Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.|$|E
2500|$|Trinity's mascot, the bantam, was {{conceived}} by Joseph Buffington, Class of 1875, {{who was a}} federal judge and trustee of the College. He was a noted speaker, and gave an address during an 1899 dinner with alumni of other prestigious colleges. Giving his view on what a Trinity student is, and supporting his view that Trinity students {{are different from the}} [...] "collegiate barnyard" [...] consisting of Harvard and Yale (amongst others such as Amherst), Buffington said: [...] "But I tell you, my fellow chanticleers, that the Trinity bantam has been brought up in the Trinity barnyard on different principles, and the most marked outcome of his collegiate training is the fostering of a habit which leads him to size things from his own standpoint, and not have somebody else size them for him." [...] He continued, saying: [...] "You will therefore understand, gentlemen, the spirit in which the Trinity bantam, game from comb to spur, crows at your door, hops in, <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> tail feathers, and with a sociable nod to the venerable John, and a good natured [...] "How d'ydo" [...] to the ponderous old Elihu steps into the collegiate cock pit, makes his best bow to the tiger, says he is glad to be here, is not a whit abashed at your hugeness, [...] is satisfied with himself and his own particular coop." ...|$|E
