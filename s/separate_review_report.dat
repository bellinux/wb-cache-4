40|$|Recent {{policy in}} {{relation}} to clinical research proposals in the UK has distinguished between two types of review: scientific and ethical. This distinction has been formally enshrined in the recent changes to research ethics committee (REC) structure and operating procedures, introduced as the UK response to the EU Directive on clinical trials. Recent reviews and recommendations have confirmed {{the place of the}} distinction and the <b>separate</b> <b>review</b> processes. However, serious reservations can be mounted about the science/ethics distinction and the policy of <b>separate</b> <b>review</b> that has been built upon it. We argue here that, first, the science/ethics distinction is incoherent, and, second, that RECs should not only be permitted to consider a study's science, but that they have anobligation do so...|$|R
40|$|This note {{explores the}} {{regulatory}} process of UK privatised utilities through the periodic review of prices.

It argues that regulatory process appears to involve a covert dialogue and exchange of information between the regulator and regulated and also a second <b>separate</b> <b>review</b> process that consists of an overt dialogue. Using a semiotic analysis the authors suggest that the unfolding of each of these overt reviews follows a very similar pattern that is constantly being re-enacted. It is concluded that further research is required into the relative importance of the two <b>separate</b> <b>review</b> processes in the setting of the price-cap...|$|R
