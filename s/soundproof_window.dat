50|$|Sump’n Else was an {{afternoon}} staple on Channel 8. It {{was a big}} attraction for area {{high school students who}} came from throughout North Texas to see and be seen on the show. The program broadcast live from NorthPark Center shopping mall in a storefront studio that featured a <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> so shoppers and fans could see the daily action. When major music acts appeared on the program, police officers were located {{both inside and outside the}} mall directing traffic and handling the large crowds. A youth-oriented clothing store called Pois'n Ivy opened next to the studio and advertised on the show, capitalizing on the local popularity of the program.|$|E
5000|$|The studio {{consisted}} of a three-room suite. The middle room contained the broadcast booth entered from the hallway, which had a <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> and door into the smaller news/production studio by the outside wall. One adjacent room was used for office space and meetings; the other room served as the record library. Later, a separate room across the hall {{was used for the}} record library, freeing up a room for meetings and overflow office space. One of the unofficial perks of volunteering for WCUA in this location was access to the sizable roof overlooking the football stadium. [...] "St. John's Beach" [...] proved an ideal location for social gatherings, football related and otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|Ferren led the Disney Imagineering R&D {{group as}} Senior Vice President, then Executive Vice President, before {{eventually}} becoming President of R&D and Creative Technology for Disney, {{and head of}} technology for the company for 10 years. [...] According to his former boss, CEO Michael Eisner, Ferren's mission was [...] "to dream {{about the future and}} show us new and innovative ways to tell stories". [...] Starting in 1993, he was the first corporate executive to receive the now-common, job title of [...] "Creative Technology", indicating responsibility for both creative and technical domains. Ferren supported Disney's Strategic Planning Group and had direct involvement {{in a wide variety of}} design and technology projects for Disney Theme Parks, such as the Tower of Terror ride, the Test Track by General Motors, the Indiana Jones Adventure, the Virtual Reality Animation Studio, and manyABC Television projects. His team was responsible for engineering the ABC Times Square Studios armored electronic-dimming <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> systems, and curved LED ticker display.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{after several}} decades of {{existing}} {{in the shadow}} of nearby O'Hare International Airport, the school received federal funds which allowed for the installation of <b>soundproof</b> <b>windows,</b> air conditioning, and sound dampening ceilings. The project began in 1997 and took three years to complete.|$|R
50|$|All music {{halls and}} {{performance}} areas are fitted with <b>soundproof</b> <b>windows</b> which prevent sound from escaping, even while open, {{as well as}} walls engineered to prevent sound crossing at right angles. The floors of the centres also float {{on a bed of}} air, so as to maintain good soundproofing.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{advanced}} approach for designing <b>soundproof</b> <b>windows</b> with good ventilation. The structure {{of this study}} is based on three acoustics theorem and can reduce noise and ventilate the space at the same time. Using this structure on wall can help also avoid noise interference effect indoors and increase air quality. This study uses plants as appropriate soundproof structure to improve carbon dioxide content for providing better living environment. Simulations of the sound field and CFD demonstrate that the structure has good performance on noise reduction and effect of ventilation...|$|R
5000|$|Miranda {{escapes from}} the hospital, having {{recognized}} the girl as a ghost. Seeking {{clues to the}} mystery of why she killed her husband, she goes to a farmhouse in Willow Creek, Rhode Island. In the cellar of the barn, she discovers a room containing a blood-stained bed, {{what appears to be a}} box containing drugs, restraints, and video equipment. She watches the tape that is still in the camera and the viewer hears a woman screaming as if tortured or raped. In the final seconds of the video, Douglas walks into the shot, covers a woman's lifeless body on the bed with a sheet, and winks at the camera. At this point, police arrive and one officer comes closer to Miranda and draws a gun on her while she is holding a knife to him. Miranda backs up to a staircase and, all of a sudden, an injured, frantically screaming girl grabs hold of her from the adjoining crawlspace. The police release the girl, and Miranda is taken to jail. While she is in jail, Sheriff Ryan (John Carroll Lynch), who was Douglas's closest friend, talks to Miranda and quizzes her on how she knew all these things. He does not believe her claim that ghosts told her everything and asks her what sort of person the accomplice would be. Miranda uses her experience as a psychiatrist to give a psychological profile, and as she does so, realizes that Ryan fits the profile perfectly. He attacks her and, in the fight, reveals his tattoo (an Anima Sola). Miranda kills the sheriff in an act of self-defense with the help of the ghost. Pete, just a few seconds later, shows up at the station, worried about Miranda's safety after he solves the mystery himself. He looks relieved to see Miranda safe and, through the <b>soundproof</b> <b>window,</b> mouths the words [...] "I'm sorry, Miranda." ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> or wall {{which is}} {{transparent}} to airflow is presented. The design {{is based on}} two wave theories: the theory of diffraction and the theory of acoustic metamaterials. It consists of a three-dimensional array of strong diffraction-type resonators with many holes centered on each individual resonator. The negative effective bulk modulus of the resonators produces evanescent wave, {{and at the same}} time the air holes with subwavelength diameter existed on the surfaces of the window for macroscopic air ventilation. The acoustic performance levels of two soundproof windows with air holes of 20 mm and 50 mm diameters were measured. The sound level was reduced by about 30 - 35 dB in the frequency range of 400 - 5, 000 Hz with the 20 mm window, and by about 20 - 35 dB in the frequency range of 700 - 2, 200 Hz with the 50 mm window. Multi stop-band was created by the multi-layers of the window. The attenuation length or the thickness of the window was limited by background noise. The effectiveness of the <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> with airflow was demonstrated by a real installation...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{is derived}} from the Latin word “nausea” {{implying}} ‘unwanted sound’ or ‘sound that is loud, unpleasant or unexpected’. The noise originates from human activities, especially the urbanization and the development of transport and industry. The passive method is a simple approach which includes the use of absorbers, barriers to reduce the interior noise in an enclosure. For enclosure structures on passive vibration noise control, the vibration and the noise are reduced either by adding appropriate passive elements or by modifying the system. It also can use the method to reduce noise such as acoustical site planning, architectural design, construction method and barrier construction. With use the <b>soundproof</b> <b>window</b> will reduce noise levels by 75 - 95...|$|E
50|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for fluorine gas is sulfur hexafluoride, {{which is used}} as a dielectric medium in high voltage switching stations. SF6 gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air. It is extremely inert and, compared to oil-filled switchgear, has no hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Sulfur hexafluoride is also used in <b>soundproof</b> <b>windows,</b> in the electronics industry, as well as niche medical and military applications. The compound can be made without using fluorine gas, but the reaction between pure sulfur and pure fluorine gas, first developed by Henri Moissan, remains the commercial practice. About 6,000 metric tons per year of fluorine gas are consumed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the 7W was spacious and featured [...] of slide-back seat room for front-seat passengers, arm rests, ash trays, dome lighting, deep cushions, cabin heaters, ventilators, <b>soundproofing,</b> large <b>windows,</b> and interior access to the [...] capacity luggage compartment. The interior could be configured {{for four or five}} passengers.|$|R
25|$|After {{the death}} of Helen Carte in 1913, Rupert D'Oyly Carte became the {{controlling}} stockholder of the hotel group. In 1919, he sold the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1894 {{at the urging of}} Ritz. For the Savoy, he hired a new chef, François Latry, who served from 1919 to 1942. In the 1920s he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants. It also became the first hotel with air conditioning, steam-heating and <b>soundproofed</b> <b>windows</b> in the rooms, 24-hour room service and telephones in every bathroom. It also manufactured its own mattresses. One famous incident during Rupert's early years was the 1923 shooting, at the hotel, of a wealthy young Egyptian, Prince Fahmy Bey, by his French wife, Marguerite. The widow was acquitted of murder after it was revealed that her husband had treated her with extreme cruelty throughout the six-month marriage and had stated {{that he was going to}} kill her.|$|R

50|$|Designed for comfort, the {{interior}} of the 7W was spacious and featured 18 in of slide-back seat room for front-seat passengers, arm rests, ash trays, dome lighting, deep cushions, cabin heaters, ventilators, <b>soundproofing,</b> large <b>windows,</b> and interior access to the 100 lb capacity luggage compartment. Built during the Great Depression, the 7W was the brainchild of company-founder William G. Skelly of Skelly Oil who desired a fast, comfortable aircraft to support his tastes and those of his rich oil-executive colleagues.|$|R
50|$|The {{limousine}} {{body style}} has a partition separating the driver {{from the rear}} passenger compartment. This partition usually contains a sliding (often <b>soundproof)</b> glass <b>window</b> so that conversations between passengers in the rear compartment may be kept private. Communication with the driver is possible either by opening {{the window in the}} partition or by using an intercom system. Alternative versions of the style include the limousine-landaulet, with a removable or folding roof section over the rear passenger seat, and the limousine de-ville, with a solid roof over the rear passengers but a removable or folding roof section over the driver's seat.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "L" [...] in the {{designation}} meant leicht (light), unlike in other BMW designations, where it meant lang (long). The lightness {{was achieved by}} using thinner steel to build the unit body, deleting the trim and soundproofing, using aluminium alloy doors, bonnet, and boot lid, and using Perspex side windows. The five hundred 3.0 CSLs exported to the United Kingdom were not quite as light as the others, as the importer had insisted on retaining the <b>soundproofing,</b> electric <b>windows,</b> and stock E9 bumpers on these cars. The CSL was never sold in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The WRX {{debuted in}} November 1992 with [...] The center {{differential}} was a viscous coupling type, the rear {{limited slip differential}} was a viscous type. The WRX Type RA is a stripped down version of the WRX that was available in the Japanese market for people to purchase for motorsports and tuning. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced <b>soundproofing,</b> manual <b>windows,</b> no air conditioning, no anti-lock brakes, and added racing features such as more robust engines, driver controlled center differentials, and shorter gearing. The WRX Type RA uses a closer ratio gearbox and a three-spoke leather steering wheel from Nardi.|$|R

Interior designs were by Andrés Escobar, featuring floor-to-ceiling <b>windows,</b> <b>soundproof</b> oak floors, washer-dryers, stainless-steel appliances and CaesarStone countertop.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTraffic {{noise is}} one of the main {{problems}} cities have to deal with. Therefore noise reducing measures have been carried out. In order to choose suitable measures it is important to know about their effects. The normal way of evaluating these measures in Germany is to focus on the reduction of sound level. But noise, defined as a sound which is perceived as nuisance cannot be measured just by these numbers. It is an individual perception and therefore varies from person to person. Moreover, depending on the type of measure, there are side effects which have an influence e. g. on accessibility (barriers) or the living environment (green), which in turn affects people's annoyance. Therefore the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia funded a study carried out by the Institute for Urban and Transport Planning. Main part of this study was a survey performed in four German cities where the following five measures had been implemented over the last years: noise reducing asphalt, grass covered tramways, noise barriers, <b>soundproof</b> <b>windows</b> and night driving bans for lorries. The aim of this research was to “measure” the subjective effect of noise reducing measures on residents. The results show that residents feel negatively affected by traffic noise in different ways, e. g. that noise reduces their living quality and causes sleep problems or makes it necessary to keep the windows shut. The main health problems which were reported are nervousness, sleep and hearing problems. The longer residents live close to traffic noise, the higher is the rate of noise induced health problems. After implementation of the measures almost all of the residents experienced an improvement of their living situation. The rate of highly annoyed people was reduced by 8, 3 % to 22, 9 %...|$|R
50|$|The studios were {{originally}} {{located on the}} second floor of the George Sherman (student) Union building. In 1969 it moved to the first floor of the Myles Standish Hall dormitory. In 1982, it moved into the new Myles Standish Annex, where the defunct Grahm Junior College was; the actual broadcast from the new space was delayed several months due to a broken water main. In the late 1980s, the basement studios were completely refurbished with new <b>soundproofing,</b> angled <b>windows</b> etc.. In 1997, WTBU moved to third floor of the College of Communication building at 640 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, taking over much of the space vacated by WBUR when it moved to 890 Commonwealth Avenue. Both stations remain in those spaces today. Before moving out, torrential rains in October 1996 flooded many basements (and the tunnel of the next-door MBTA Green Line!).|$|R
50|$|At {{the heart}} of Schermerhorn Symphony Center is the 30000 sq ft, 1,844-seat Laura Turner Concert Hall, which is home to theNashville Symphony. The hall is of the shoebox style. It {{features}} natural lighting, which streams in through 30 <b>soundproof,</b> double-paned clerestory <b>windows.</b> Intricate symbolic motifs appear throughout the hall {{and the rest of}} the center, including irises (the Tennessee state flower), horseshoes (a tribute to the late Laura Turner's love of horses) and coffee beans (representing Nashville's Cheek family, which played a key role in the founding of the Nashville Symphony and also originally owned the Maxwell House Coffee brand).|$|R
