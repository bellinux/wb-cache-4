25|$|The {{various sizes}} of Laser are all cat-rigged; in {{they have only}} a main sail and no head sail. The Laser Standard sail has a <b>sail</b> <b>area</b> of 7.06 m² (76ft²) and, {{especially}} in higher winds (15 knots and over), is most competitive when sailed by a very fit, agile, and muscular person weighing no less than 80kg (175lb).|$|E
25|$|Competitiveness between {{boats in}} the class is {{maintained}} by requiring the boats to be {{in compliance with the}} 12 Metre formula. Designers and builders are required to take into account such things as the <b>sail</b> <b>area,</b> the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth (the measurement around the boat from one sideboard, under the keel, and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side). The measurements are then weighted in the formula. For example, the present formula takes the square root of the <b>sail</b> <b>area</b> rather than total area. The combination of weighted measurements must be {{less than or equal to}} 12 metres. Designers are free to change any of the component variables, as well as other details, such as the size of the rudder and keel, so long as the corresponding changes elsewhere produce an ultimate sum of 12 metres and the resulting boat is both seaworthy and safe. Though disparity between boats are minimized by the rule, enough variation exists so that races are as much about design and construction as they are about seamanship and tactics.|$|E
25|$|Her {{original}} home port was Amsterdam. Her classification was SI Z1234+, EU 98/18. Her length overall was 48 meters (157 feet). Her beam was 6.90 meters (22.6 feet), with a draught of 2.80 meters (9.2 feet). Her masthead height was 29.00 meters (95 feet). Her displacement was 280 tons with a gross tonnage of 153 tons. She was rigged as a three-masted topsail schooner with a <b>sail</b> <b>area</b> of 720 m² (7,750 square feet) across 11 sails.|$|E
5|$|Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a <b>sailing</b> <b>area,</b> {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for dinghy sailing. The lake {{is divided}} into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The <b>sailing</b> <b>area</b> is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|R

25|$|While {{awaiting}} his discharge, Jackson {{was serving}} aboard Trenton in Samoa {{when it was}} wrecked by the 1889 Apia cyclone on March 16, 1889. As the ship had been caught with no steam in its boilers, crewmen were ordered to form a line along the deck and spread their coats to form a makeshift sail. Jackson led a group of sailors into the rigging where they spread their coats to increase the <b>sail</b> <b>area,</b> at significant hazard to their lives. This desperate measure successfully propelled Trenton out of danger long enough to help rescue the ship's company of the similarly wrecked Vandalia, before both crews were compelled to abandon ship.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the immense}} {{success of the}} Reliance, she was used only one season, her design and {{maintenance}} keeping her from being used for any other purpose than for a cup defense. The extremity of both 1903 cup contenders encouraged Nathanael Herreshoff to make boats more wholesome and durable by devising a new rule. Proposing {{in the same year}} the Universal Rule, he added the elements of overall length and displacement into the rating, to the benefit of heavy, voluminous hulls and also divided boats into classes, without handicapping <b>sail</b> <b>area.</b> This went against the American Yacht Clubs' and the British Yacht Racing Association's general desire to promote speed at all costs for cup boats, but the NYYC adopted Herreshoff's proposal. Lipton long pleaded for a smaller size of yachts in the new rule, and the NYYC conceded to seventy-five footers in 1914. Lipton turned to Charles Ernest Nicholson for his fourth challenge, and got a superb design under the inauspicious shape of Shamrock IV, with a flat transom. She was the most powerful yacht that year, and the NYYC turned out three cup candidates to defend the cup: of George Owen's Defiance and William Gardner's Vanitie, it was Herreshoff who designed the wisest of all contenders. His last design for the cup, the Resolute, was small, which earned significant time allowance over other yachts. Barr had died, but his crew manned the Resolute, which faced stiff competition from Vanitie, but {{went on to win the}} selection trials, before the Cup was suspended as World War I broke out.|$|E
25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little <b>sail</b> <b>area</b> for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E
