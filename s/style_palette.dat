Kehittämäni storyboard-analyysimetodi tarjoaa työkalut kuvareportaasin valokuvien keskinäisten suhteiden arviointiin. Sovellan storyboard-analyysimallia kahteen aineistoon. Perusaineistona on National Geographicin suomenkielinen vuosikerta 2001 ja vertailuaineistona eri aikakauslehdissä 1948 - 2001 julkaistuja kuvareportaaseja ja verkkoreportaaseja. Tutkimuksessa arvioidaan ennen kaikkea painetun kuvareportaasin kehitystä, evoluutiota. Lisäksi pohditaan sitä, millaisia muutoksia uusi media tuo kuvakerrontaan. Kuvareportaasia arvioidaan media- ja kuvajournalismitutkimuksen valossa. Kuvareportaasin rakenteita on neljä: klassinen, moderni, galleria- ja multimediarakenne. Tyylin käsitettä tarkastellaan taidehistorian ja valokuvauksen näkökulmasta. Jaan reportaasikuvauksen tyylipaletin neljään kategoriaan: klassiseen, kriittis-realistiseen, moderniin värikuvadokumentaristiseen ja postmoderniin tyyliin. Storyboardissa analysoidaan kuvareportaasin kontrasteja ja jatkumoita. Kontrasti on kahden kuvan välinen voimakas jännite. Jatkumot sen sijaan luovat reportaasille koheesiota, sidosteisuutta. Jatkumoita on kaikkiaan viisi: samuus, kaltaisuus, yhteenkuuluvuus, aika ja kausaalisuus. Storyboardien analyysin ja tutkijaluvun perusteella tehty kuvareportaasien vertailu osoittaa keskeiset tutkimustulokset. Tulkintani mukaan National Geographicin (NG) kuvareportaasit edustavat suurimmaksi osaksi modernia rakennetta ja modernia värikuvadokumentaristista tyyliä. Olen tutkinut suurten, ns. valtajulkisuuden lehtien (Life, National Geographic, Helsingin Sanomien kuukausiliite ja Observer) lisäksi kulttuuri- ja mielipide- sekä elämäntapalehtiä (Colors, Image, Ydin ja Citylehti). Ne tarjoavat areenan kuvareportaasin tuoreille ja vaihtoehtoisille kehitysvirtauksille. Molemmat analysoimani verkkoreportaasit edustavat multimediarakennetta, vaikkakaan eivät postmodernia tyyliä. Rakenne ja tyyli eivät kuvareportaasin revoluution näkökulmasta välttämättä vastaa toisiaan. The {{research}} examines photo reportage {{from the}} point of view of style and structure. The story board method of analysis, which I have developed, offers tools to investigate the interrelations between pictures in photo reportage. This model of analysis is applied to two data. The basic data consists of the annual volume of the Finnish version of National Geographic in 2001 which is compared with photo reportage and web reportage in different magazines in different time periods. The focus is on the (r) evolution of photo reportage. The work begins with an analysis of (photo) graphic research (chapters 3 and 4) as a backgrounder for visual communication and photo reportage. Especially the concepts used in the media research of reportage are examined in the theoretical analysis in chapters 6 and 7. The storyboard method of analysis is introduced in chapter 5. It is applied to the analysis of the interrelations between pictures but not very much used to analyse individual pictures. Photo reportage consists of contrasts and continuums. Contrast is the strong tension between two pictures. On the other hand, the continuums create the cohesion in reportage. There are five types of continuums: sameness (the same person), analogy (similar action and/or visual similarity), togetherness (the same theme), time (chronology) and causality (cause and effect). The whole reportage is disassembled as a diagram where the researcher shows how the visual narrative has been structured. In addition, the reportages are illustr! ated as miniature pages. When the storyboard method is applied to empirical analysis, each picture in the reportage is evaluated as an entity, as a unity of picture and content. The Gypsies reportage in National Geographic makes an exception, however, which is also evaluated {{from the point}} of view of graphic continuums. The storyboard method has not been applied to web reportage because that would involve a considerable extension of the storyboard. This method of analysis is also not suitable for the analysis of complete thematic issues (Colors). In addition to the traditional scientific reading, this research contains a two-part reception study where a group of students evaluated The Gypsies reportage published in National Geographic. The research also contains findings from an interview with the Kurdish student Sadek Kardo-Rubar including the point of view of the photographed person which illuminates the institutional nature of National Geographic as a creator of otherness and imago. The authors of the reportage Markus Jokela and Ilkka Malmberg recount their working method and the so called taking possession method when the different styles of photo reportage are examined in chapter 8. I have divided the styles of photo reportage into four different categories: the classical, the critical-realistic, the modern colour photo documentary and the postmodern style. The concept of style is examined in the methodology chapter (5) mainly in light of Altti Kuusamo's art historical style research. The concept of style is applied to the <b>style</b> <b>palette</b> of photography and photo reportage in chapter 8. The style periods are also defined as periods of time although one has to take into account that styles escape narrow definitions. They can exist side by side or they are periodically reborn as the so called retro styles. The structures of photo reportage are analysed in the story board and meta-reading of the comparative data. Four structures can be found: the classical, the modern, the gallery and the multimedia (chapter 9). This part of the research builds up on the analysis of the narrative structures of Look and Life in chapter 7. The reportage in both the basic and comparative data are classified in the diagram in the concluding chapter (12) where the co-ordinates are the two variables of the structure of photo reportage and the style of reportage photography. On the basis of the meta-reading that was carried out, it can be concluded that the photo reportage in National Geographic mostly represent the modern structure and the modern colour photo style. Photo reportage dealing with the space and science are both structurally and stylistically different from the basic data in National Geographic. They come close to the postmodern style and the gallery structure. The reportage on natural phenomena resemble classical photo reportage. The comparative data has been selected to represent different time periods. Pictures taken by the classical photographer of photo journalism W. Eugene Smith in the 1940 s and 1950 s represent a style and a structure which I define as classical. On the other hand, photo reportage by Markus Jokela and Martin Parr illustrate the structural and stylistic development of modern photo reportage in the 1980 s and 1990 s. In order to support the representativeness of the comparative and the basic data I have selected magazines with wide circulation (Life, National Geographic and the magazines of Helsingin Sanomat and Observer) as well as culture, independent and lifestyle magazines (Colors, Image, Ydin, Citylehti). They offer an arena for fresh and alternative development trends in photo reportage and are often influenced by the gallery structure. Both of the web reportage that I have analysed represent the multimedia structure although they do not represent the postmodern style. So, {{from the point of}} the view of the evolution of photo reportage, structure and style do not necessarily correspond to one another. Instead, the web reportage made in the multimedia structure enabled by the 21 st century web media can anachronistically represent the traditional styles of reportage photography...|$|E

His favorite subjects were of the Alps of Bavaria and South Tirole, the Isle of Capri, the English Garden in Munich, the lake region surrounding Starnberg, and fishing boats on the North Sea.

Subjects such as carnivals, masks, puppetry, skeletons, and fantastic allegories are dominant in Ensor's mature work. Ensor dressed skeletons up in his studio and arranged them in colorful, enigmatic tableaux on the canvas, and used masks as a theatrical aspect in his still lifes. Attracted by masks' plastic forms, bright colors, and potential for psychological impact, he created a format in which he could paint with complete freedom.|$|R

50|$|The Painting Fool, {{developed}} by Simon Colton originated {{as a system}} for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting <b>styles,</b> colour <b>palettes</b> and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool {{raised questions about the}} extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as AARON does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.|$|R

Redesigning a school’s web site can become a complex process and requires careful planning. Studies with web users (Yale Style Guide, Nielsen, Siegel) have produced work that informs school web site revisers of ways to make a site more usable and enjoyable. The US government and the W 3 C consortium have accessibility guidelines for web sites to assist site reviewers in adapting their site so users of all abilities have equitable access.

5000|$|Whereas {{there may}} have been an {{influence}} of Dutch marine painter Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, some regard the impact on his style of the work of the 16th century Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder as more significant. [...] It is assumed that van Eertvelt spent some time in the Dutch Republic in the early 1600s although there is no record of this other than his paintings of Dutch ships and ports. He may have resided in Haarlem, but there is no proof for the widespread suggestion that he studied under Vroom. He may very well have familiarized himself with Vroom’s style in Antwerp where paintings of Vroom as well as copies and imitations after them were readily available in the art market. Van Eertvelt is known to have made copies of Vroom’s work but was able to develop his own style.In his early paintings, van Eertvelt adopted a bright, mannerist <b>style</b> and his <b>palette</b> was characterized by greenish-black and brown tones.

50|$|The {{event was}} also immortalized in a {{painting}} by Theodore Robinson titled The Wedding March. Butler became a key player and link between the American Colony and Claude Monet. The Butler family organized many dinners such as one held October 25, 1892 with Robinson, Hale, Hart and Marthe Hoschedé. “I’m making great culinary preparations for the winter.” Butler decided to buy an orchard and built a new house. “We, Suzanne and Jimmy and I wish that you were here we’d {{like to see you}} first rate. I have been working some, about half as much as I should - perhaps less - We are building a house back of Peggy’s in that little orchard you must remember. Said house is to be a wonder of elegance and taste - You will see it next year perhaps.”Butler participated in the publication and conception of the Courier Innocent. He did the cover and illustrated many pages. Butler painted a series of his own family: son Jimmy Butler born in 1893, and daughter Lilly Butler born in 1894. Those paintings included series' entitled The Bath, After the Bath, and Playing with Jimmy. Butler developed his own impressionist <b>style</b> with light <b>palettes</b> and loose brushstrokes, reminiscent of works done by Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard.

In the fall of 1921, Harris ventured beyond Algoma to Lake Superior's North Shore, where he would return annually for the next seven years. While his Algoma and urban paintings of the late 1910s and early 1920s were characterized by rich, bright colours and decorative composition motifs, the discovery of Lake Superior subject material catalyzed a transition to a more austere, simplified <b>style,</b> with limited <b>palettes</b> - often jewel colours with a range of neutral tones. In 1924, a sketching trip with A.Y. Jackson to Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rockies marked the beginning of Harris' mountain subjects, which he continued to explore with annual sketching trips until 1929, exploring areas around Banff National Park, Yoho National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park. In 1930, Harris went on his last extended sketching trip, travelling to the Arctic aboard the supply ship SS. Beothic for two months, during which time he completed over 50 sketches. The resulting Arctic canvases that he developed from the oil panels marked the end of his landscape period, and from 1935 on, Harris enthusiastically embraced abstract painting.After the disbanding of the Group of Seven in 1933, Harris and the other surviving members including A. J. Casson, Arthur Lismer, A. Y. Jackson, and Franklin Carmichael, were instrumental in forming its successor, the larger national group, the Canadian Group of Painters.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION In the 19302 ̆ 7 s when Regionalism was the {{dominate}} {{style in}} American art, Aaron Pyle studied {{with one of}} its leading exponents, Thomas Hart Benton. From Benton he learned a method, a philosophy and a style. Aaron Pyle began each of his paintings {{with a series of}} sketches, preliminary drawings and grisaille studies. The first ideas were drawn in small thumbnail sketches less than two inches square. Second, were larger outline drawings on a grid for enlarging. Third, were tracings which were transferred to illustration board in preparation for a monochrome painting, which was the fourth step in the evolution of a painting. The monochrome was made to establish major light and dark areas and as a check on the design of the composition. This method seems to imply that the artist feared color, and early in his career, Pyle did paint a number of finished pictures in grisaille, e. g. THE BLACKSMITH (catalogue no. 10) and PICKING CORN (catalogue no. 7). However, there is evidence to indicate that he thought about color, because there are index card size paintings in full color which belong to the series of pencil drawings and black and white studies that were made for each painting. Furthermore, it appears that Pyle also executed lithographs of most of his major works. Egg temera was Aaron Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s chosen medium for finished works. Often called a difficult and time consuming technique, one of its chief virtues is its quick drying properties. This, along with it insolubility and capacity to adhere to any surface, render it desirable to many artists. In fact it was the chief artist 2 ̆ 7 s medium of the middle ages. Also, it is transparent, has a smooth surface and a soft brush stroke, which are qualities Pyle liked since his painting method was not one dependent on 2 ̆ 2 in painting 2 ̆ 2 and smooth tonalities, but was rather one based on glazing or overpainting. While it is possible to glaze with oil, it is somewhat difficult because oil dries slowly, and the artist cannot apply the next thin, transparent film of color immediately. Thus, egg tempera suited Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s style and temperament. His careful establishment of all elements in a painting prior to the final picture is an old procedure which now-a-days is usually used only by art students. And in a sense Aaron Pyle was a student all of his life. He followed Thomas Hart Benton 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy of painting American life and agrarian subjects in particular. Benton, a thoroughly urban person, drew his inspiration from a life in which he had little first hand experience.
