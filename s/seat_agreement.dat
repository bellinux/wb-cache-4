40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{performed a}} numeral reading task under five levels of sinusoidal whole-body vibralion at various frequencies {{in each of}} the three translational axes. In the z-axis the vibration frequencies were spaced at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 63 Hz, and in the x and y-axes at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 32 Hz. All of the vibration conditions were presented with two sealing conditions: hard flat seat with fixed footrcst and a simulated helicopter seat with moving footrest. With both seats the effect of vibration level on reading accuracy was found to be significant at all but the highest frequencies of z-axis vibration. It was also significant for x-axis vibration with the simulated helicopter seat, but not for x-axis vibralion with the flat seat or for y-axis vibration with either seat. Results are presented in the form of equal performance contours. Measures of translational and rotational head motion were also made for each vibration axis and seat. Very little vibration was found to be transmitted to the head during x-axis vibration with the flat seat or y-axis vibration with either <b>seat,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the small effect of vibration on reading performance in these cases. These results were combined with performance data to investigate the feasibilily of predicting performance decrements directly from head motions. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. </p...|$|R
50|$|The two M. G. Party MLAs who {{had played}} a pivotal role in the ouster of the Kakodkar {{government}} were Dayanand Narvekar and Dilkush Desai. Narvekar joined the Indian National Congress in December 1979 and was soon followed by Desai. At that time, the Indian National Congress in Goa was known as the Indian National Congress (Urs) faction because after the Indian National Congress split of 1978, the Congress Legislature Party in the Goa, Daman and Diu Legislative Assembly identified itself with the Indian National Congress (Urs). The Indian National Congress (Urs) as a political party in Goa was led by its President Wilfred de Souza, who was not a MLA. The Indian National Congress led by Indira Gandhi (Indira Congress) also had its presence in Goa and was led by Purushottam Kakodkar. But as far as the Goa Legislative Assembly election, 1980 were concerned, the Indian National Congress (Urs) (Urs Congress) as well as the Indira Congress had an understanding between themselves. The Indian National Congress (Urs) led by Wilfred de Souza had a <b>seat</b> sharing <b>agreement</b> with the Indira Congress and the latter was given 6 constituencies. The Indian National Congress (Urs) contested in 22 constituencies while 1 constituency was left for an independent candidate. Indira Gandhi addressed a public meeting on 12 December 1979 at Panaji's Azad Maidan grounds where she apologised to the people for imposing a state of Emergency in 1975. She expressed the need for developing Goa without harming its natural beauty.|$|R
