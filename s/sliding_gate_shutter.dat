40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish bath depth, <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> opening {{position}} and nozzle bore diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the <b>slide</b> <b>gate.</b> More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> is open wider and the potential for air aspiration is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and nozzle bore diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|R

40|$|Primarily, a Gated-Viewing (GV) system {{provides}} range gated imagery. By increasing the camera delay time from frame to frame, a so-called <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is obtained by which 3 -D reconstruction is possible. An important parameter of a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence is the step size {{by which the}} gate is shifted. In {{order to reduce the}} total number of required images, this step size should be as large as possible without significantly degrading the range accuracy. In this paper we have studied the influence of the gate shift step size on the resulting range accuracy. Therefore, we have combined the Intevac Gated-Viewing detector M 506 with a pulsed 1. 57 µm illumination laser. The maximal laser pulse energy is 65 mJ. The target is a one-square-meter-plate at a distance of 500 m. The plate is laminated with a Spectralon layer having Lambertian reflection behavior with a homogeneous reflectance of 93 %. For the measurements, this plate was orientated diagonally to the line of sight of the sensor in order to provide a depth scenario. We have considered different combinations of the two parameters »gate length« (13. 5 m, 23. 25 m, 33 m) and »signal-to-noise ratio« (SNR) (2 dB, 3 dB, 5 dB, 6 dB, 7 dB, 8 dB). For each considered set of parameters, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence of the target was recorded. Per range, 20 frames were collected. The gate shift step size was set to the minimal possible value, 75 cm. By skipping certain ranges, a <b>sliding</b> <b>gates</b> sequence with a larger gate shift step size is obtained. For example, skipping the ranges 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, [...] . (equivalent: taking the ranges 1, 4, 7, [...] .) results in a gate shift step size of 2. 25 m. Finally, the range accuracies were derived {{as a function of the}} gate shift step size. Additionally, the influence of frame averaging on these functions was studied...|$|R

50|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>gate</b> {{operators}} are commonly {{installed at the}} end of the gate in the closed position but can also be installed by the end of the gate in the open position. In America the most common form of automation is a chain attached across the gate near the bottom and passing through the operator, which shuttles it back and forth. In the end of the gate/open position you do not see the chain or any operating equipment near the gate. In Europe a metal or plastic rack is attached to the gate with a gear fitted to the operator. The American method is more flexible and allows for greater movement in the gates, the European method makes for a quieter and more secure system. <b>Sliding</b> <b>gates</b> are often large, heavy and therefore more hazardous than swing gates they can however be equipped with appropriate safety devices making them some of the safest gate systems available.|$|R

To evaluate possible mechanisms for crack formation, this research applies a 3 -D finite-element model of the thermal and mechanical stress in a sliding-gate plate during preheating and casting induced by thermal expansion and/or mechanical movement. The thermal model is first validated with previous temperature histories measured during preheating and casting in a ladle plate. The model of a tundish <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> nozzle is then used to investigate thermal-mechanical behavior and cracking due to the temperature variations during preheating and casting.

The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis.

Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 slide plates.
