50|$|The {{informal}} economy or the informal sector, {{also referred to}} by the names “black market” and “underground market,” consists of entrepreneurs who engage in economic activities that fail to fulfill certain legal requirements even though their objectives are actually lawful. Perhaps the talipapa and sidewalk vendors can be good examples of this sector of the economy. Other examples could include the street children who sell sampaguita, or even people who engage in criminal acts affecting the economy, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, and theft. The other more popular forms of informality can perhaps be the informal financial <b>sector</b> (<b>loan</b> sharks) {{and the proliferation of}} informal settlements, or squatters’ areas. People normally dive into the informal sector due to poverty where they are somehow forced to produce or create income, or even due to the feeling that they are not being treated fairly by economic institutions. People who engage in informal activities somehow believe that informal economic activity is an expression of freedom from all the binding policies of the economy, and it is only then when they finally feel the true essence of being in a free market economy.|$|E

40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} {{determinants of}} banking sector distresses in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Ger-many, Greece, Spain and the UK are analysed using an econometric model estimated on panel data from partly the early 1980 s to 2002. The dependent variable is {{the ratio of}} banks’ loan losses to lending. In ad-dition to the lagged dependent variable, the explanatory variables include a surprise change in incomes and real interest rates, both variables as a separate cross-product term with lagged aggregate indebtedness. The underlying macroeconomic account that this paper puts forward is that loan losses are basically gen-erated by strong adverse aggregate shocks under high exposure of banks to such shocks. The underlying innovations to income and real interest rates are constructed using published macro-economic forecast for these variables. According to the results, high customer indebtedness combined with adverse macroeco-nomic surprise shocks to income and real interest rates contributed to the distress in banking <b>sector.</b> <b>Loan</b> losses also display strong autoregressive behaviour which might indicate a feedback effect from loan losses back to macroeconomic level in deep recessions.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{domestic}} financial intermediation of foreign capital inflows based on agency costs is developed for studying financial crises in emerging markets. In equilibrium for the model economy, the banking system becomes progressively more fragile under imperfect prudential regulation and public <b>sector</b> <b>loan</b> guarantees until a crisis occurs with an expected reversal of capital flows. The crisis in this model evolves endogenously as the banking system becomes increasingly vulnerable through the renegotiation of firm debts. Firm revenues are subject to idiosyncratic firm-specific technology shocks, {{but there are no}} aggregate shocks. The model generates dynamic relationships between foreign capital inflows, domestic investment, firm debt and the value of firm and bank equity in an endogenous growth model. Prior to crisis, foreign capital inflows and bank debt rise relative to investment and domestic production. The aggregate portfolio of the banking sector deteriorates and the total value of bank equities declines in proportion to that for goods producers progressively. The model’s assumptions and implications for the behavior of the economy before and after crisis are compared to the experience of five East Asian economies.

In its most recent experience, the District has demonstrated the value of these loans beyond simple kWh savings. In 2002, The District received $ 3. 0 million in private sector loans for projects including indoor lighting retrofits, cooling tower upgrades, and Continuous Commissioning?. Documented energy cost savings from this project exceeded the projected savings since its completion in early 2005. Now nearly a decade later, ACCD is participating in a State-funded revolving loan program for energy retrofits estimated at $ 10 million. A wide range of projects are proposed, including indoor and outdoor lighting retrofits, central plant upgrades, solar thermal pool heating, enhanced retrofit commissioning and installation of water based thermal storage systems. In addition, existing campus load profile analysis uncovered utility rate change options that yielded instant savings. In total, over $ 1 million per year in cost savings and 4 megawatts of mitigated power generation capacity are projected due to these projects.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the question whether}} firms in the manufacturing sector in Africa are credit constrained. The fact that few firms obtain credit {{is not sufficient to}} prove constraints, since certain firms may not have a demand for credit while others may be refused credit as part of profit maximising behaviour by banks. To investigate this question, we use direct evidence on whether firms had a demand of credit and whether their demand was satisfied in the formal credit market, based on panel data on firms in the manufacturing sector from six African countries. More than half the firms in the sample had no demand for credit. Of those firms with a demand for credit, only a quarter obtained a formal <b>sector</b> <b>loan.</b> In line with expectations, our analysis suggests that banks allocate credit on the basis of expected profits. However, controlling for credit demand, outstanding debt is positively related with obtaining further lending while micro or small firms are less likely to get a loan than large firms. The latter effect is strong and present in the regression, despite including several variables typically referred to as explaining why small or ‘informal ’ firms do not get credit. The role of outstanding debt {{is likely to be a}} reflection of inefficiency in credit markets, while the fact that size matters is consistent with a bias as well, although we cannot totally exclude that they reflect transactions costs on the part of banks. Finally, we could not detect any differences between countries in the effects of these factors in the credit allocation rule, although financial deepening is found to explain most of the country-specific fixed effects, shifting the probability of obtaining credit across the firm distribution...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} statistical techniques in credit portfolio management, with emphasis on actuarial and risk theoretic pricing and reserving measures. The bank corporate loan portfolio is envisaged as an insurance collective, with margins charged for credit risk forming premium income, provisions made forming claims outgo, and variation over time in provisioning and profitability producing a need for reserves. The research leads to the computation of portfolio specific measures of risk, and suggests that a value-at-risk (VAR) based reserve computation has several advantages over current regulatory reserving methodology in bank capital adequacy regulation (CAR) with respect to non-residential private <b>sector</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios. These latter, current CAR practices are invariably used by banks to compute the respective capital adequacy backing required on loans. A loan pricing model is developed that allocates capital required by reference to observed provisioning rates across a total of 64 differing combinations of rating factors. This represents a statistically rigorous return on risk adjusted capital (RORAC) approach to loan pricing. The suggested approach is illustrated by reference to a particular portfolio of loans. The reserving and pricing measures computed are portfolio specific, but the methodology developed and tested on the specific portfolio (dataset) of loans has a wider, more general applicability. A credit market comprising portfolios which are both more and less risky than the original particular portfolio is hypothesised, and existing regulation is compared to VAR regulation {{in the context of}} the hypothesised credit market. Fewer insolvencies are observed using the VAR framework than under existing regulation, and problem portfolios are identified earlier than under existing regulation. For the particular portfolio of loans, existing algorithm-based loan pricing is compared with the proposed loan pricing model. Significant differences are observed in loan pricing by reference to gearing and collateral, and the elimination of observed inefficiencies in pricing is recommended. Although the proposed model has some limitations, it is argued to be an improvement on existing regulatory and banking practice...|$|E
