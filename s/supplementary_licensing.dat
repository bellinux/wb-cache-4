2500|$|The government's Smeed Report of 1964 was {{the first}} full {{assessment}} of the practicality of road pricing in a British city {{on the basis of}} congestion. It recommended a method of [...] "car user restraint" [...] by a variable system of charging for road usage – if the government had the will to do so. During {{the early years of the}} Greater London Council, which was formed in 1965, the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or <b>supplementary</b> <b>licensing</b> for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre. These plans were being developed at the same time as the London Ringways, a series of 4 orbital motorways around and within London including Ringway 1 (the London Motorway Box) leading to widespread public protest by Homes before Roads and others. Only a small section of these road schemes had been implemented by the time Labour gained control in the 1973 Greater London Council elections, and the new administration abandoned the road building plans in favour of public transport and traffic management. The new administration, to which Ken Livingstone had just been elected for the first time, studied a congestion scheme similar to the one which was eventually adopted the following year.|$|E
40|$|Parts I and II {{together}} {{investigates the}} implementation aspects of road pricing by setting down {{criteria for a}} ‘good’ road pricing system. Besides analyzing the gamut of indirect and direct methods of charging for road usage, the paper surveys alternative congestion pricing technologies including: 1) cordon pricing using manual tollbooths, 2) <b>supplementary</b> <b>licensing,</b> 3) off-vehicle recording systems such as automatic vehicle identification, commonly known as AVI, and 4) on-vehicle charging systems such as smart card technology. Each of these instruments is dealt with by a relatively in-depth case study analysis based on the benefits, costs and revenues of implementing and utilizing each charging mechanism. Since benefit figures are not always readily available, the cost per transaction of operating a system {{over the long run}} is used as an index of the relative cost-effectiveness of each technology. Based on alternative quantitative and qualitative criteria, the implications of using each of these technologies for tackling congestion are summarized in a key table and conditional policy recommendations are made. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION This evidence, {{submitted}} to the Select Committee for its inquiry into Urban Congestion Charging, is based on my research into the subject, and professional involvement in studies of methods for managing the demand for urban travel, over the last twenty years. In the 1970 s I was responsible, within the Greater London Council, for their studies {{of the use of}} comprehensive parking control, physical restriction of road space, and <b>supplementary</b> <b>licensing</b> (a low technology method of congestion charging) as methods of traffic restraint. At the same time, I was an adviser to the World Bank in its study of Singapore's area licensing scheme which is still the only congestion charging system in operation. In the 1980 s I was an adviser to the US Transport Research Board in its investigation of appropriate methods for managing urban traffic, and to The MVA Consultancy in its study of electronic road pricing for Hong Kong. Since 1987 I have been involved, as a director of The MVA Consultancy, in a series of integrated transport studies in London (for the London Planning Advisory Committee), Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol and Merseyside, each of which has investigated the role of congestion charging as part of a wider transport strategy. I am currently directing a programme of research, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, which is assessing the relative impact on urban road networks of different methods of imposing congestion charging, on their own and in combination with traffic signal control and bus priorities. This research has used Cambridge and York as case studies. In addition, I am currently acting as one of the technical advisers to the Department of Transport's study of congestion charging in London.

40|$|The author explores 20 {{criteria}} for a good road pricing system and presents case studies illustrating the costs, revenues, and benefits of alternative congestion charging mechanisms. The author finds that manual tollbooths are not suitable for congestion charging because they are land-, labor-, and time-intensive. Cordon pricing (as in the Bergen toll ring) {{can be an effective}} instrument for charging for congestion if half the toll lanes are reserved for seasonal pass holders traveling through the pricing points at regular highway speed. Enforcement of those driving in reserved lanes can be carried out by periodic videographs of vehicle license plates. Area licensing schemes require that vehicles entering the central business district during peak hours prominently display a monthly or daily license. Enforcement is undertaken at gantry points by traffic wardens who perform visual checks on the nonstop traffic. The enforcement costs of area licensing schemes are prohibitive at motorway speeds but relatively low-cost in a standard congested urban setting with limited gateways. Area licensing schemes, also known as <b>supplementary</b> <b>licensing,</b> carry the lowest cost per transaction. Electronic road pricing with automatic vehicle identification (an off-vehicle recording system) is electronic toll collection by time of day writ large and made obligatory on vehicle owners in a jurisdiction. The cost of the electronic equipment is not trivial, but is outweighed by the benefits. Sensitivity analysis performed on the Hong Kong electronic road pricing scheme in 1983 - 85 shows that even after excluding time savings, the savings in operating costs produce benefit figures that are greater than system costs. The invasion-of-privacy issues that led to the political failure of the Hong Kong electronic road pricing scheme can not be overcome by giving road users access to confidential numbered account arrangements with a prepaid cash deposit. The capital cost of electronic road pricing with smart card technology (an on-vehicle charging system) is higher than the cost for automatic vehicle identification technology alone, but benefits still outweigh costs (as in the Dutch proposal). Together, the benefit-cost ratio and the cost per transaction are acceptable but this technology is still not widely used commercially. The author argues that electronic approaches to direct road use charging are superior to manual approaches for road users, road authorities, and society as a whole. And rapid progress in microelectronics, cryptology, and microwave technologies will continue to yield large-scale economies in the manufacturing of automatic vehicle identification equipment, read-write transponders, smart cards, and the hardware and software that go with them. The author ranks electronic road pricing with automatic vehicle identification alone higher than electronic road pricing with smart card-type AVI based on an unweighted index of all criteria. And generally, the area licensing scheme is superior to cordon pricing. If budgets allow, authorities should investigate the feasibility of electronic road pricing. If the budget is tight, they should look into the area licensing scheme with its low cost and high benefit-cost ratio (the latter being the most important of the 20 criteria the author uses). Both conceptually and practically, the author finds {{that it is important to}} earmark the proceeds of road pricing to implement marginal cost pricing in the road sector.
