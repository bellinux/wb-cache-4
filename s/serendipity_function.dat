40|$|A simple matrix-displacement {{method is}} {{presented}} here {{to facilitate the}} static analysis of rigidly-jointed coplanar beam frames. The geometric arrangement of the frame, the boundary conditions, the material properties, and the external loading, are allowed complete generality, thereby enabling a large range of 2 D structures to be modelled. Point loads, self-weight, inertial and distributed loads may all be accommodated in the analysis; {{emphasis is placed on}} the inclusion of the distributed loads, since these prove a more significant challenge to represent accurately in a matrix-displacement type of analysis. The chief novelty of this work is that for such structures exact solutions may be obtained with great ease for the displacement, reactions, and the individual member bending moment, shear force, and axial force, through the inclusion of suitable <b>serendipity</b> <b>functions</b> in the element formulation. The computational effort is the minimum possible for this class of problem, requiring the solution to just 3 S simultaneous equations, where S represents the total number of junctions or nodes used to define the frame. Such solutions can easily be implemented using desktop computing, and five examples of increasing complexity are presented herein to demonstrate the efficacy of the method...|$|R
40|$|A mixed, eight-node {{solid element}} is {{developed}} {{with the aim}} to accurately and efficiently capture local stresses in composites. The nodal degrees of freedom are the three displacements and the three interlaminar stresses. Characteristic features, C 0, tri-linear, <b>serendipity</b> shape <b>functions</b> are used to interpolate these quantities across the element volume. With this choice, the intraelement stress fields satisfy the equilibrium equations in integral form. Integration is exact. It is carried out by a symbolic calculus tool. To test the element performances, the intricate stress fields of thick sandwich composites with undamaged and damaged face layers, piezoelectrically actuated beams, thermally loaded laminates and close to a two-material wedge singularity are investigated. The element appears robust, stable and rather accurate using reasonably fine meshes. Compared to displacement-based counterpart elements, the computational effort is not larger...|$|R
40|$|While {{the use of}} {{finite element}} methods for the {{numerical}} approximation of eigenvalues is a well-studied problem, the use of serendipity elements for this purpose has received little attention in the literature. We show by numerical experiments that serendipity elements, which are defined on a square reference geometry, can attain the same order of accuracy as their tensor product counterparts while using dramatically fewer degrees of freedom. In some cases, the serendipity method uses only half as many basis functions as the tensor product method while still producing the same numerical approximation of an eigenvalue. To encourage the further use and study of serendipity elements, we provide a table of <b>serendipity</b> basis <b>functions</b> for low order cases and a Mathematica file {{that can be used}} to generate the basis functions for higher order cases...|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common arrhythmia in the United States and is a risk factor for stroke and cardiac dysfunction. Pharmacological and surgical treatments of AF have limited efficacy, partly attributable to a limited understanding of its basic mechanisms. Patient-specific computational models have shown promise for planning personalized treatment strategies for AF, but progress is still nascent and computational studies do not currently solve in clinical timescales. In this dissertation, the author describes new finite element methods for modeling human AF, and then uses these methods in a patient-specific model to suggest mechanisms for AF maintenance and termination. A clinical description of AF and the basic mechanisms of AF are presented in Chapter 1. New methods for constructing cubic Hermite models of the atria from non-invasive imaging data are presented in Chapter 2, and these methods are extended to construct four-chamber models of the heart in Chapter 3. Heretofore, high-order finite element models have not been used on complicated shapes such as that of the atria and ventricular models with valve annuli, yet high-order models have attractive properties such as superior convergence compared to linear finite element models in electrophysiology and biomechanics problems, which can decrease the time required for simulations toward clinical timescales. Convergence properties of both cubic Hermite and cubic Hermite-style <b>serendipity</b> basis <b>functions</b> for the solution of the monodomain equation of cardiac electrophysiology are evaluated in Chapter 4. We find that cubic Hermite and cubic Hermite-style <b>serendipity</b> basis <b>functions</b> have superior convergence properties in the monodomain problem in comparison with linear finite elements for equal numbers of elements and integration points. In Chapter 5, we examine an experimental case study of AF {{with the aid of a}} patient-specific model. We find that meandering rotors are important focal sources of AF, and are made possible by remodeling of the action potential shape and a decrease in electrical anisotropy. Virtual radiofrequency ablation may terminate AF by creating a spatial excitable gap near the rotor and decreasing the fractionation exacerbated by rotor meander. We then speculate how patient-specific models of AF might be used in the futur...|$|R
40|$|The eight-node isoparametric plate {{bending element}} {{based on the}} <b>serendipity</b> shape <b>functions</b> behaves very poorly even after reduced {{integration}} of the shear strain energy. It has therefore {{been the subject of}} considerable study using various devices to improve itx 2014;mixed methods, enforcing of constraints, tensorial transformations, etc. In this paper, we shall proceed from the field-consistency paradigm to understand why the original element and even the element modified by the 2 * 2 Gaussian rule cannot achieve, consistently, the true shear strain constraints in the penalty limit of thin plate behaviour. We then derive the optimal shear strain definitions that leave the element free of all problems in the rectangular form, for most sets of practical boundary suppressions. From this, we next determine the optimum manner of co-ordinate transformation that preserves the true constraints even {{in the form of a}} general quadrilateral. This is achieved within the context of iso-P Jacobean transformations and without having to bring in tensorial or base vector definitions and transformations. This should be the simplest displacement type version of this element...|$|R
40|$|A CÂ° {{layerwise}} plate element {{with standard}} nodal d. o. f. and <b>serendipity</b> interpolation <b>functions</b> {{is applied to}} the analysis of laminates and sandwiches giving rise to strong layerwise effects. The element is obtained using an energy updating technique and symbolic calculus starting from a physically-based zig-zag model with variable kinematics and fixed d. o. f. able to a priori satisfy to displacement and stress continuity at the material interfaces. Non classical feature, a high-order piecewise zig-zag variation of the transverse displacement is assumed as it helps keeping equilibrium. Crushing of core is studied carrying apart a detailed 3 D modelling of the honeycomb structure discretizing the cell walls with plate elements, with the aim of obtaining apparent elastic moduli at each load level. Using such apparent moduli, a 2 D homogenized analysis is carried out simulating sandwiches as multi-layered structures Applications are presented to plates undergoing impulsive loading incorporating plies with spatially variable stiffness properties. It is shown that accurate predictions are always obtained in in the numerical applications with a very low computational effort. Compared to kinematically based zig-zag models, present physically based one is proven to more accurate, being always in a good agreement with exact 3 D solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|A quadrilateral, eight-node, mixed plate element {{based upon}} a recent 3 D, {{variable}} kinematics zig-zag plate model by the authors is developed. Representation can be refined across the thickness though the number of unknown {{does not depend on}} the number of constituent layers, the nodal variables being fixed. The out-of-plane stress continuity is a priori satisfied at the interfaces and the material properties are allowed to step-vary moving over the plane of the structure. In order to obtain a C 0 model, all derivatives of unknowns are converted with a technique that does not introduce additional d. o. f. Equilibrium equations are satisfied just in approximate integral form, mid-plane displacements and interlaminar stresses, the nodal d. o. f., being interpolated using the same standard <b>serendipity</b> shape <b>functions.</b> As shown by numerical results, this does not result in any precision loss. Accuracy, solvability and convergence are assessed considering multi-layered monolithic and sandwich-like structures with different boundary conditions and abruptly changing material properties across the thickness, for which exact solutions are available. Also a bonded joint is studied, which is treated as a laminate with spatially variable properties. In all these cases, the element is shown to be fast convergent and free from spurious, oscillating results...|$|R
40|$|The eight-node isoparametric Mindlin plate {{bending element}} {{based on the}} <b>serendipity</b> shape <b>functions</b> {{has had a long}} 13; history of {{investigation}} behind it, and has seen various devices to improve it - mixed methods, enforcing of constraints, tensorial transformations etc. Only very recently have successful versions free of locking in general quadrilateral form and without kinematic modes emerged. In this paper, we shall examine two of the most successful displacement method procedures (a field-consistency approach and a line-consistency approach) and 13; proceeding from these, design three very accurate versions - one based on a variationally correct field-consistency paradigm alone, and two versions derived from the need to ensure consistency of tangential shear strains along principal reference lines so that the usual patch tests are exactly passed. The latter two have shear strain definitions that leave the element free of all problems (locking and kinematic modes) for all boundary suppressions and element distortions whereas the former 13; has two kinematic modes. These line-consistent elements however introduce spurious quadratic shear stress oscillations as they have not been derived in a variationally correct sense. The recovery of accurate transverse shear stress resultants must therefore be performed very carefully and a filtering technique is implemented for this...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the use of p-type finite element method (FEM) for structural and fluid dynamics problems that hold promise for reactor physics problems. These advances include using hierarchic shape functions, element-by-element iterative solvers and more powerful mapping techniques. Use of the hierarchic shape functions allows greater flexibility and efficiency in implementing energy-dependent flux expansions and incorporating localized refinement of the solution space. The irregular matrices generated by the p-type FEM can be solved efficiently using element-by-element conjugate gradient iterative solvers. These solvers do not require storage of either the global or local stiffness matrices and can be highly vectorized. Mapping techniques based on blending function interpolation allow exact representation of curved boundaries using coarse element grids. These features were implemented in a developmental two-dimensional neutron diffusion program based on the use of hierarchic shape functions (FEM 2 DH). Several aspects in the effective use of p-type analysis were explored. Two choices of elemental preconditioning were examined [...] the proper selection of the polynomial shape functions and the proper number of functions to use. Of the five shape function polynomials tested, the integral Legendre functions were the most effective. The <b>serendipity</b> set of <b>functions</b> is preferable over the full tensor product set. Two global preconditioners were also examined [...] simple diagonal and incomplete Cholesky. The full effectiveness of the finite element methodology was demonstrated on a two-region, two-group cylindrical problem but solved in the x-y coordinate space, using a non-structured element grid. The exact, analytic eigenvalue solution was achieved with FEM 2 DH using various combinations of element grids and flux expansions...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} {{improvements}} to the discrete ordinates (S_N) neutron transport equation using a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) spatial discretization on arbitrary polytope (polygonal and polyhedral) grids compatible for massively-parallel computer architectures. Polytope meshes are attractive for multiple reasons, including their use in other physics communities and their ease in handling local mesh refinement strategies. In this work, we focus on two topical areas of research. First, we discuss higher-order basis functions compatible to solve the DGFEM S_N transport equation on arbitrary polygonal meshes. Second, we assess Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) schemes compatible with polytope grids for massively-parallel transport problems. We first utilize basis functions compatible with arbitrary polygonal grids for the DGFEM transport equation. We analyze four different basis functions that have linear completeness on polygons: the Wachspress rational functions, the PWL functions, the mean value coordinates, and the maximum entropy coordinates. We then describe the procedure to extend these polygonal linear basis functions into the quadratic <b>serendipity</b> space of <b>functions.</b> These quadratic basis functions can exactly interpolate monomial functions up to order 2. Both the linear and quadratic sets of basis functions preserve transport solutions in the thick diffusion limit. Maximum convergence rates of 2 and 3 are observed for regular transport solutions for the linear and quadratic basis functions, respectively. For problems that are limited by the regularity of the transport solution, convergence rates of 3 / 2 (when the solution is continuous) and 1 / 2 (when the solution is discontinuous) are observed. Spatial Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) achieved superior convergence rates than uniform refinement, even for problems bounded by the solution regularity. We demonstrated accuracy in the AMR solutions {{by allowing them to}} reach a level where the ray effects of the angular discretization are realized. Next, we analyzed DSA schemes to accelerate both the within-group iterations as well as the thermal upscattering iterations for multigroup transport problems. Accelerating the thermal upscattering iterations is important for materials (e. g., graphite) with significant thermal energy scattering and minimal absorption. All of the acceleration schemes analyzed use a DGFEM discretization of the diffusion equation that is compatible with arbitrary polytope meshes: the Modified Interior Penalty Method (MIP). MIP uses the same DGFEM discretization as the transport equation. The MIP form is Symmetric Positive De_nite (SPD) and e_ciently solved with Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) with Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioning. The analysis from previous work was extended to show MIP's stability and robustness for accelerating 3 D transport problems. MIP DSA preconditioning was implemented in the Parallel Deterministic Transport (PDT) code at Texas A&M University and linked with the HYPRE suite of linear solvers. Good scalability was numerically verified out to around 131 K processors. The fraction of time spent performing DSA operations was small for problems with sufficient work performed in the transport sweep (O(10 ^ 3) angular directions). Finally, we have developed a novel methodology to accelerate transport problems dominated by thermal neutron upscattering. Compared to historical upscatter acceleration methods, our method is parallelizable and amenable to massively parallel transport calculations. Speedup factors of about 3 - 4 were observed with our new method...|$|R
