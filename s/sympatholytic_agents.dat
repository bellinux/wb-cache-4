40|$|During exercise, {{blood flow}} {{increases}} {{to the working}} skeletal muscle primarily because of dilation of the arteries and arterioles feeding the muscle. Sympathetic nerve activity also increases during exercise, augmenting {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at the arterial wall and into the blood. NE acts to constrict blood vessels; however, arteries and arterioles within contracting skeletal muscle dilate despite the increased NE present. This has led to the concept of functional sympatholysis (4), the idea that a chemical released from contracting skeletal muscle interferes with NE signaling. NE acts by binding to adrenergic (alpha and beta) receptors, and it is alpha receptors in the arterial wall that cause vasoconstriction (8). While both α- 1 and α- 2 receptor subtypes have been found in some vascular beds of some species, there is significant evidence that in rat calf muscles, the response to norepinephrine is mediated solely by α- 1 receptors (5, 9). Because α- 1 receptors are the sole respondents to sympathetic signaling, we studied three proposed substances that may interfere with sympathetic signaling at the α- 1 receptors, thereby mediating sympatholysis. There is evidence to suggest that heat and acidosis may partially mediate sympatholysis of α- 1 receptors (1, 2). This study sought to determine whether increased levels of shear stress, potassium, or adenosine also contribute to sympatholysis. If shear stress, potassium, and adenosine are, in fact, <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents,</b> they will reduce the vasoconstriction mediated by the α- 1 receptors in rat soleus muscle feed arteries. We hypothesized that all three variables would be <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|E

This is at a time when previous studies have shown these neurons to be using acetylcholine (ACh) as their neurotransmitter. Cultures which were grown without supporting cells and from which cholinergic synaptic interactions were recorded physiologically were processed for autoradiography after incubation with [3 H]NE.

40|$|Abstract. Sympathetic {{hyperactivity}} {{plays an}} important and distinct role in hypertension associated with chronic renal failure (CRF). Renal ischemia, elevated angiotensin II, and suppressed brain nitric oxide (NO) all stimulate sympathetic activity. Evidence is accumulating for a role of sympathetic hyperactivity in renal and cardiac damage in patients with CRF. Decreased NO availability and increased oxidative stress, characteristic in CRF patients, seem to sensitize target organs for damaging actions of sympathetic hyperactivity. Fortunately, <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents</b> can slow down progression of renal and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists suppress sympathetic activity, but complete elimination {{of the effect of}} sympathetic hyperactivity can be obtained only with specific adrenergic blockers. However, this important therapeutic option is grossly neglected, painfully illustrated by the unwillingness to treat CRF patients with �-blockers, even if they have had a myocardial infarction.

40|$|The main {{symptoms}} of excruciating pain, trophic and inflammatory changes, {{as well as}} functional impairment of limbs are {{the hallmark of the}} complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). While functional impairments have to be treated by physical and occupational therapy, the former three symptoms are amendable to drug treatment: antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and opioids are the most important drug classes for alleviating neuropathic pain whereas acute nociceptive pain may be positively influenced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids. In addition, calcitonin and the biphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts and therefore loss of bone mass and may thus also reduce pain. The use of <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents</b> beyond locoregional anesthesia techniques (which are covered elsewhere in this issue) is not unequivocal.

40|$|Sympathetic {{activation}} during acute {{myocardial infarction}} is an important arrhythmogenic mechanism, but the role of central autonomic inputs and their modulating factors remain unclear.

We studied wild-type (n= 20) and ETB-deficient rats (n= 20) after permanent coronary ligation, with or without pretreatment with clonidine. Cardiac rhythm was continuously recorded for 24 hours by implantable telemetry devices, coupled by the assessment of autonomic and heart failure indices. Sympathetic activation and arrhythmogenesis were more prominent in ETB-deficient rats during the early phase post-ligation. Clonidine improved these outcomes throughout the observation period in ETB-deficient rats, but only during the delayed phase in wild-type rats. However, this benefit was counterbalanced by atrioventricular conduction abnormalities and by higher incidence of heart failure, the latter particularly evident in ETB-deficient rats. Myocardial ETB-receptors attenuate the arrhythmogenic effects of central sympathetic activation during {{acute myocardial infarction}}.

This regimen {{resulted in a}} negative sodium balance {{by an average of}} 300 mEq. The loss of sodium closely correlated to the decrease of body weight (r = 0. 70, p less than 0. 005). Blood pressure (BP) decreased from 176 / 166 +/- 8 / 3 to 155 / 109 +/- 6 / 3 mm Hg. There was a significant correlation between percent increments in plasma renin activity (PRA) and the rise in plasma norepinephrine (r = 0. 68, p less than 0. 05) and a close negative correlation between percent increase in PRA and the ratio of fall in mean blood pressure (MAP) per unit of weight loss (r = - 0. 73, p less than 0. 005). Thus, {{patients with}} the least percent increase in PRA demonstrated the greatest fall in BP per unit of weight loss, indicating that relative rather than absolute elevation of renin may be the factor limiting antihypertensive efficacy of sodium depletion.

40|$|During exercise, {{sympathetic}} nerve activity increases, augmenting {{the release of}} the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at the arterial wall and into the blood. NE binds to arterial adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction, yet arteries in contracting skeletal muscle dilate during exercise. Previous evidence from Ives et al. suggests that heat and acidosis may partially inhibit constriction resulting from α- 1 adrenergic receptors (termed sympatholysis). Our lab has previously demonstrated that rat soleus feed arteries respond to sympathetic signaling solely by α- 1 adrenoceptors. We hypothesized that increased levels of arterial wall shear stress, potassium, or adenosine also contribute to sympatholysis, thereby reducing sympathetic vasoconstriction. This study measured the constriction response to phenylephrine (PE; an α- 1 agonist) in the presence of varying levels of shear stress, potassium, and adenosine. Soleus feed arteries were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cannulated on two glass micropipettes for in vitro video microscopy.

It is felt that the primary causes for the increase in vascular resistance are progressive diminution in the cardiac output and the local effect of low blood temperature on the vasculature. IT WAS the object of these studies to elu-cidate the effects of hypothermia on the systemic and pulmonary circulations and to assess the effects of sympatholytic and sym-pathomimetic agents on the course of hypo-thermia. Despite the use by several investigators of agents acting on the autonomic nervous sys-tem in the hope of favorably modifying the course of hypothermia, there has been rela-tively little investigation of alterations in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance produced by hypothermia. The effects of low body temperature on peripheral resistance were initially studied by Bigelow 1 and more recently by Sabiston and his associates. 2 The pulmonary circulation during hypothermia in the intact animal has had scant investigation except for Prec's studies of pulmonary artery pressure in eight dogs cooled to 28 C. 3 and the recent studies of Galletti and his associ-ates 4 performed under conditions of constant flow.

Recordings were made using radiotelemetry in 17 adult SHR before and after treatment with rilmenidine (2 mg/kg/day), perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle in the drinking water for 2 weeks. Rilmenidine reduced MAP by 7. 2 ± 1. 7 mmHg while perindopril reduced MAP by 19 ± 3 mmHg. Double logistic curve fit analysis showed that the rate and power of increase in systolic pressure during the transition from light to dark was reduced by 50 % and 65 %, respectively, but had no effect on diastolic pressure. Rilmenidine also reduced blood pressure variability in the autonomic frequency in the active period as assessed by spectral analysis which is consistent with reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity. Perindopril had no effect on the rate or power of the arousal surge in either systolic or diastolic pressure. These results suggest that the arousal induced surge in blood pressure can largely be reduced by an antihypertensive agent that inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, while effective in reducing blood pressure, does not alter the rate or power of the surge associated with arousal...|$|R

40|$|Raynaud’s {{phenomenon}} (RP) is a vasospastic disorder {{characterized by}} episodic color changes of blanching, cyanosis, and hyperemia {{in response to}} cold and/or emotional stress. Although most typically noted in the fingers, the circulation of the toes, ears, nose and tongue is also frequently affected. Population {{studies have shown that}} RP in adults is more common in women than men, with prevalence estimates ranging from 4 % to 30 %. Geographic variations in the prevalence reflect differences in climate. RP may be a primary or a secondary process. LeRoy and Medsger suggested criteria for primary RP: symmetric attacks, the absence of tissue necrosis, ulceration or gangrene, the absence of a secondary cause, negative antinuclear antibodies, normal nailfold capillaroscopy and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Secondary RP is characterized by an age of onset of more than 30 years, painful and asymmetric attacks, ischemic skin lesions, positive autoautoantibodies, capillaroscopic abnormalities and/or clinical features suggestive of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Among the CTDs, systemic sclerosis has the highest frequency of RP. Finding a cause for RP requires a knowledge of the patient’s occupational, smoking, drug history, physical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy, routine laboratory tests and autoantibodies. Furthermore, RP should be distinguished from acrocyanosis, a condition characterized by continuous cyanosis of the hands or feet that is aggravated by cold temperature. The most important instruction to the patient is abstinence from any smoking, offending drugs should be discontinued, and abrupt changes in temperature.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} system helps maintain {{blood pressure and}} {{blood flow to the}} different organ systems through many elaborate mechanisms. These mechanisms include the different blood vessels, each with their own properties, as well as both neural and humoral factors. The vessels that are most relevant here are arterioles, also known as resistance vessels, as they {{play a significant role in}} regulating organ blood flow, vascular resistance, and blood pressure in many different physiological conditions, such as exercise. More specifically, the focus of this paper is the endothelial layer of the arteriolar wall and its role in attenuating sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction, or sympatholysis. 	Exercising skeletal muscle cells require an increase in blood flow to adequately meet their oxygen and nutrient demands. In order to accomplish this, there is an increase in cardiac output by the heart and also a redistribution of blood flow away from inactive regions towards active muscle cells. This critical redistribution of blood flow depends on the sympathetic nervous system, which increases in activity during contraction to cause vasoconstriction of the arterioles that supply other inactive organs except the brain. Despite this increase in sympathetic nerve activity, there is also profound vasodilation in the microvasculature of active skeletal muscle cells. It is this paradox that helps match the increase in metabolism with an increase in blood flow during exercise, and it is also this mechanism that has been coined ‘functional sympatholysis. ’ 	Although much effort has been put into studying the mechanism through which functional sympatholysis occurs, the existing data and evidence are not sufficient to deduce a clear picture at this time. There are inconsistencies regarding the functional distribution of alpha-adrenergic receptors, the role of non-adrenergic receptors, the impact of many different metabolic factors, and finally also the contribution of non-metabolic factors. Due to such contrasting data, it is clear that further research will need to be conducted in order to obtain a concrete explanation for sympatholysis. 	A recent study has postulated that the process of sympatholysis may primarily involve the endothelium. This study used various manipulations that involved endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses as well as endothelium-independent vasodilatory responses intersected with sympathetic adrenergic nerve activity to determine that only those vasodilatory agents that functioned using the endothelium were able to attenuate sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction. This compelling evidence has made way for further inquiry into the endothelium’s role in this very important process. 	Due to the fact that the greatest amount of research has been devoted to studying the contraction-related attenuated responsiveness of alpha-adrenergic receptors, a hypothetical study and its various methods are proposed in this paper. This hypothesis states that both adenosine triphosphate and flow-mediated dilation, two vasodilatory stimuli that rely on a functional endothelium, are <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents,</b> whereas adenosine, which acts on vascular smooth muscle to cause vasodilation, is not sympatholytic. The conclusions that might be drawn from such a study and their various implications are also discussed. 	Finally, the major relevancy in this topic relates to the fact that sympatholysis or impaired sympatholysis may be a factor in many metabolic and cardiovascular diseases along with exercise. Some of the diseases discussed here are type II diabetes, hypertension, and chronic myocardial infarction. A concrete understanding of the mechanism by which this process occurs would potentially help invent new treatment plans and prevention. At this point, it seems probable that the endothelium does play a significant role in sympatholysis, but whether it is the primary dictator and whether there are also other influences that are absolutely essential still remains relatively uncertain...|$|E

Recent clinical studies show renal sympathetic nerve ablation is an effective treatment in uncontrolled hypertensive patients (Esler et al., 2010) which has strengthened research interest into {{the contribution of the}} sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to hypertension.

BPH/ 2 J mice are a genetic model of hypertension which were selectively bred to exhibit elevated blood pressure (BP) compared with concurrently bred hypotensive (BPL/ 1 J) and normotensive (BPN/ 3 J) controls. Whilst originally bred to evaluate the genetics of hypertension, they have since been studied {{in a wide range of}} areas. Importantly recent findings indicate that BPH/ 2 J mice have a neurogenic form of hypertension, primarily based on findings demonstrating that the hypertension is abolished by ganglion blockade, indicating a considerable contribution from the SNS (Davern et al., 2009 b). Early studies also demonstrate abnormal brain catecholamine levels in BPH/ 2 J mice compared with normotensive BPN/ 3 J counterparts and more recently BPH/ 2 J mice were reported to have greater neuronal activity in limbic and hypothalamic brain regions associated with autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system (Schlager & Freeman, 1983; Strazielle et al., 2004; Davern et al., 2009 b). As such there is mounting evidence to suggest that the CNS may be an important mediator of the hypertension. Consequently hypertensive BPH/ 2 J mice appear to be a suitable model to study the potential causes contributing to overactivity of the SNS in hypertension. In the present thesis a range of potential mechanistic paradigms were explored to identify the major factors contributing to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. In the first instance an extensive characterization of the metabolic profile in BPH/ 2 J mice was assessed to determine the potential influence of metabolic factors on BP. Additionally the known interactions between the SNS and peripheral and central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on cardiovascular regulation were investigated using pharmacological inhibition, immunohistochemical indicators of sympathetic innervation and measurement of renal gene expression. Finally the role of the CNS in the sympathetically mediated hypertension was explored by means of pharmacological inhibition and excitotoxic lesions. Together the aim was to provide additional insight into the factors contributing to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. A range of characteristics indicate that BPH/ 2 J mice may have metabolic abnormalities including low body weight (BW), hyperactivity and abnormal thermoregulation (Rosenberg et al., 1982; Malo et al., 1989; Davern et al., 2009 b). Importantly metabolic rate positively correlates with BP, yet there has been no systematic assessment of the metabolic profile of BPH/ 2 J mice so it is unknown whether metabolic differences may be contributing to the hypertension (Luke et al., 2004). Consequently the first study of this thesis (chapter 3) was conducted to determine whether there are differences in energy metabolism in BPH/ 2 J mice and whether any identified differences may be associated with hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. This was examined by characterizing the metabolic profile of hypertensive BPH/ 2 J mice in comparison with normotensive BPN/ 3 J and C 57 Bl 6 mice. Whole body metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were measured over 24 hours by indirect calorimetry and radiotelemetry respectively in conscious young (10 - 13 week) and older (22 - 23 week) BPH/ 2 J, normotensive BPN/ 3 J and C 57 Bl 6 mice. The main finding was that whilst metabolic rate was greater in BPH/ 2 J compared with BPN/ 3 J mice, it was actually similar to the normotensive C 57 Bl 6 mice. This indicates that high metabolic rate is not axiomatically related to the hypertension. Importantly, at a time when metabolic rate was comparable between all three strains, hypertension was still apparent in BPH/ 2 J mice. Furthermore whilst there was a strong positive correlation between BP and metabolic rate in BPH/ 2 J mice, this was shown to be driven by differences in physical activity rather than metabolic rate. Echo magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI) also revealed that strain differences in BW between BPH/ 2 J and BPN/ 3 J mice were not accompanied by differences in body composition. Taken together, the findings suggest that the hypertension is largely unrelated to differences in energy metabolism in BPH/ 2 J mice. The RAS is another factor crucial for BP regulation and involved in many forms of hypertension, yet there are conflicting reports on the contribution of the RAS to the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. Furthermore it is possible that the RAS interacts with the augmented SNS activity in BPH/ 2 J mice via the actions of either the central or peripheral RAS. Yet the potential involvement of these systems has not been fully delineated in BPH/ 2 J mice. Consequently the second study of this thesis (chapter 4) details an investigation of the hypothesis that the hypertension may be mediated by an interaction between the peripheral RAS and the overactive SNS in BPH/ 2 J mice (Davern et al., 2009 b). BPH/ 2 J and BPN/ 3 J mice were pre-implanted with radio-telemetry devices to measure BP. Depressor responses to the ganglion blocker pentolinium in mice pre-treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat revealed a 2 -fold greater sympathetic contribution to BP in BPH/ 2 J mice during both the light and dark periods of the 24 -hour light cycle, when mice are predominantly inactive and active respectively. However, the depressor response to enalaprilat was 4 -fold greater in BPH/ 2 J compared with BPN/ 3 J mice, but only during the dark (active) period when hypertension is at its greatest in BPH/ 2 J mice. Importantly, the greater RAS contribution during the active period was associated with 1. 6 -fold higher renal Ren 1 mRNA expression and also a lower abundance of renal miR- 181 a, a negative regulator of human renin mRNA. Ren 1 mRNA levels were positively associated with depressor responses to pentolinium and furthermore TH staining indicated a 1. 4 -fold greater abundance of renal sympathetic innervation in BPH/ 2 J compared with BPN/ 3 J mice. Taken together these findings suggest that tonic overactivity of the SNS is a major contributor to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice, yet the RAS also contributes, doing so to a greater extent during the active period and less during the inactive period. Therefore it is possible that renal hyper-innervation and enhanced sympathetically-induced renin synthesis mediated by lower levels of the microRNA miR- 181 a is contributing to the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. To complement the first study which assessed the contribution of the peripheral RAS, the focus of the second study was on the role of the central RAS, as overactivity of this system is implicated in other models of neurogenic hypertension (Ye et al., 2002 a). Thus the aim of the third study (chapter 5) was to determine the influence of AngII activation of central angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT 1 R) on the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice, as well as the possible contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To determine the contribution to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice, pre-implanted telemetry devices were used to measure the cardiovascular response to acute and chronic intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of AT 1 R antagonists, candesartan and losartan in BPH/ 2 J and BPN/ 3 J mice. Additionally the acute cardiovascular response to ICV administration of superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol and ROS scavenger resveratrol were measured. ICV injection of tempol or resveratrol had minimal effect on BP in either strain during periods of either inactivity or activity. During the dark (active) period acute ICV injection of an AT 1 R antagonist induced depressor responses which were 40 % smaller in BPH/ 2 J compared with BPN/ 3 J mice, whereas during the inactive period the effect was minimal in both strains. Furthermore during this active period, ICV injection of AngII produced a smaller pressor response in BPH/ 2 J compared with BPN/ 3 J mice. Chronic ICV administration of losartan for 7 days via an osmotic minipump induced a greater decrease in BP in BPH/ 2 J mice and had minimal effect in BPN/ 3 J mice. However, the effect was comparable to that observed following systemic administration, suggesting that this chronic hypotensive effect in BPH/ 2 J mice was likely to be peripherally mediated rather than central. Collectively, based on acute and steady state inhibition of central AT 1 Rs, these findings suggest that greater activity of the central RAS does not appear to contribute to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. Regardless of the lack of contribution of the central RAS to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice, the hypertension is mediated by a persistent overactivity of the SNS and as such it is likely that these mice are sensitive to centrally acting <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agents</b> (Davern et al., 2009 b) (Study 2). Therefore the aim of the fourth study (chapter 6) was to assess whether BPH/ 2 J mice were indeed sensitive to the antihypertensive effect of rilmenidine, an antihypertensive agent which has centrally mediated sympatholytic effects predominantly via actions at premotor neurons located within the RVLM (Head et al., 1998). Chronic oral administration of rilmenidine at a wide range of doses had minimal effect on 24 -hour average BP in both strains. Chronic ICV administration of rilmenidine marginally reduced BP in BPH/ 2 J mice in the active (night) period but this response was comparable with that observed in BPN/ 3 J mice. By contrast i. p. injection of rilmenidine induced greater acute depressor responses in BPH/ 2 J mice than in BPN/ 3 J mice, but more than half of this response was blocked by atropine pre-treatment suggesting it was due to cardiac vagal influences rather than vasomotor actions. The remaining hypotensive effect was moderate and again comparable between strains. These results show that the sympathetic inhibitory effects of rilmenidine are similar in hypertensive BPH/ 2 J and BPN/ 3 J mice, suggesting that the neurogenic hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice does not appear to be suitable for treatment by centrally acting antihypertensive agents. Furthermore since the central sympatholytic effects of rilmenidine are reported to be predominantly due to actions on premotor sympathetic neurons located within the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM), these findings also indirectly suggest that the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice is unlikely mediated by greater neuronal activity in the RVLM. Since the exaggerated sympathetic activity and hypertension did not appear to be driven by neurons located in the RVLM, other brain regions were considered. Davern and colleagues recently reported that Fos labeling was greater in the medial amygdala (MeAm) of BPH/ 2 J mice than in BPN/ 3 J mice, indicating greater neuronal activity in this region which is necessary for regulation of the behavioural, hormonal and cardiovascular responses to stress (Kubo et al., 2004; Davern et al., 2009 b). This was one of the only brain regions assessed which showed greater neuronal activity in BPH/ 2 J mice during both the dark (active) and light (inactive) period of the 24 -hour light cycle. Furthermore neuronal activity in the MeAm correlated strongly with BP suggesting that activity within this region may be associated with the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice. The contribution of neurons located within the MeAm to hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice was assessed in the fifth and final study (chapter 7) by assessing the cardiovascular effect of MeAm lesions. MeAm lesions had little effect in BPN/ 3 J mice but caused marked reductions in BP in BPH/ 2 J mice, abolishing the BP difference between the two strains during the light (inactive) period and reducing the BP difference by more than half during the dark (active) period of the 24 -hour light cycle. Furthermore the hypotensive effect of lesions in BPH/ 2 J mice was similar during both the light (inactive) and dark (active) period, suggesting a tonic influence which is independent of the state of arousal of the animal. Mid frequency MAP power was also reduced in both strains following MeAm lesions, indicating neurons located within the MeAm may influence vasomotor SNS activity. Interestingly, MeAm lesions did not reduce the pressor response to any of the stressors in BPH/ 2 J mice, suggesting that the hypotensive effect of MeAm lesions is not a consequence of attenuated stress reactivity. These results show that the MeAm is contributing to the hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice but this effect is independent of its role in stress reactivity and circadian BP influences. Collectively the findings from the present thesis suggest that BPH/ 2 J mice have a complex form of hypertension which is neurogenic in origin and manifested by the actions of the SNS and RAS in the periphery but is largely independent of the central RAS and metabolic differences. Hypertension in BPH/ 2 J mice seems to be driven by tonic overactivity of neurons located within the MeAm and a persistent exaggeration of the SNS which is independent of premotor sympathetic neurons located within the RVLM. The effects of the augmented SNS activity appear to be particularly important in the kidney as it drives greater renin secretion, leading to greater AngII production and its associated hypertensive effects. This greater peripheral contribution of the RAS is likely facilitated by the down regulation of the negative regulator of Ren 1 mRNA, microRNA- 181 a. Importantly this down-regulation of microRNA- 181 a is akin to that recently reported in human hypertensive patients (Marques et al., 2011 c). Together these findings contribute to the characterization of BPH/ 2 J mice and highlight its potential as a valuable model of neurogenic hypertension...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of degenerative {{joint disease}} (osteoarthritis) {{has been the}} subject of debate and conjecture for many years. Because the syndrome is found so often in older subjects, it would seem logical to correlate the general arteriosclerotic vas-cular changes with the degenerative joint pathol-ogy. However, the weight of investigative evi-dence has been against such a relationship, and the factors of "wear and tear " and "stress and strain " are considered to be the major forces in the development of degenerative joint diseases (1). In many instances where pathological changes of degenerative joint disease have been discovered, no complaint of pain or disability had been made (2, 3). It would appear that arteriosclerotic changes per se cannot explain degenerative joint disease (4, 5), and that vasomotor changes may play a significant role. In peripheral vascular dis-ease, intra-arterial Priscoline ® was reported to produce increased blood flow and to relieve pain and disability. It was therefore reasonable to ex-pect a comparable effect in and around a joint and such an investigation was made by one of us (S. D.) in a series of patients with degenerative joint disease of the knee (6). Priscoline ® (2 -benzylimidazoline hydrochloride), an adrenolytic and <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agent</b> with a direct action upon autonomic nerve endings, was given by the intra-arterial (femoral artery) route. In view of the beneficial subjective effect, a study was then made of intra-articular temperature changes in normal knee joints (7). This investigation dem-onstrated that the joint temperatures increased in normal subjects following intra-arterial sympatho-lytic agents (Priscoline®), presumably as a result of intra-articular vasodilatation. In another series of studies by one of us, the clearance rates of radio-active sodium from skin and muscle were investi...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{review of}} cohort studies and {{clinical}} trials evaluating antihypertensive {{drugs in the}} prevention of cognition decline and all dementia in patients with hypertension indicates that two antihypertensive drug classes have greater protective effects, independent of blood pressure decrease: dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers as shown in the Syst-Eur trial and angiotensin-AT 1 receptor blockers as found in the MOSES and ONTARGET trials. By contrast, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs) prevent dementia only in patients with a stroke history, provided they are combined, and prevent stroke recurrence. A Japanese cohort study and a small trial in patients already suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest, however, that the BBB-penetrating ACEI may slow down cognitive decline. Only cohort studies support the hypothesis that diuretics, (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), may decrease the risk of AD. beta-blockers worsen cognition decline, or are neutral, according to whether or not they cross the BBB. Centrally-acting <b>sympatholytic</b> <b>agent</b> {{have a negative impact on}} cognition as BBB-penetrating beta-blockers, probably by blunting the adrenergic pathways. The AD protective effect of DHP appears related to the blockade of neuronal calcium channels. The ambiguous effect of ACEI on cognitive decline and dementia prevention may be explained by the fact that brain ACE is not specific for angiotensin-I. Brain ACE also catabolizes cognition-enhancing brain peptides, amyloid peptides and converts toxic Abeta(42) into less toxic Abeta(40). Therefore, ACEIs may have short-term cognition-enhancing properties and may increase in the long term Abeta(42) brain burden and cognitive decline. The clinical relevance of this scenario, mainly observed in animals, cannot be excluded in man, since the ACE gene has been associated with AD via the human whole genome analysis. To support the hypothesized deleterious effect of ACEI on human AD, confirmation that the ACE gene polymorphism DD is associated with protection against AD is necessary, since this polymorphism increases ACE activity. Independently of their preventive impact on beta-amyloid degenerative neuropathological process by overexpressing insulin degrading enzyme which catabolyses amyloid, the angiotensin AT 1 -receptor-blockers may have greater cognition protective effects than ACEI (observed in the ONTARGET trial), as they share with ACEI cognition-enhancing effects directly linked with a common AT 1 -blunting effect. In addition, they increase angiotensin II and IV formation and therefore stimulate non-opposed AT 2 and AT 4 receptors, whose activation in cognitive processes is well established...|$|R
40|$|The <b>sympatholytic</b> {{antihypertensive}} <b>agent</b> moxonidine, a centrally-acting I 1 -imidazoline receptor agonist, has {{in clinical}} studies shown a beneficial effect on insulin resistance in hypertensive patients. Since skeletal muscle {{is the major}} organ involved in glucose disposal, experiments were performed to investigate whether moxonidine have direct effects on skeletal muscle cells in vitro. Satellite cells from skeletal muscle biopsies (musculus vastus lateralis and musculus transversus abdominis) were differentiated into myotubes and stimulated with moxonidine. Studies of glucose uptake was performed with [2 - 3 H]-deoxyglucose. Further, the specificity of the glucose transport was explored by applying cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of glucose transporters. The intracellular signalling mechanism of moxonidine was investigated with Western blotting using antibodies against the intracellular kinases Akt and ERK, and the glucose transporter GLUT- 4, respectively. Expression of GLUT- 4 was also measured by real-time PCR. The involvement of Gi-protein-coupling in the signalling pathway of moxonidine was examined by adding pertussis toxin prior to moxonidine-incubation. Moxonidine treatment for 60 minutes yielded a minor increase in glucose uptake of skeletal muscle cells, with a maximum increase of 31 % by 3 nM moxonidine. This confirms the beneficial effects on glucose metabolism seen in clinical studies. Moxonidine treatment for 15 minutes tended to increase the phosphorylation of Akt, yielding a maximum increase of 41 %. Experiments with perussis toxin did not indicate that Gi-coupling {{is involved in the}} intracellular signalling of moxonidine. In the literature, studies report the activation of ERK by moxonidine. However, ERK {{does not seem to be}} involved in the signalling mechanism of moxonidine in our cell model. The expression of GLUT- 4 protein was significantly increased with a maximum of 70 % after 72 hours of moxonidine treatment, however, only a small increase in the level of GLUT- 4 mRNA was detected. The activation of Akt and the increase seen in GLUT- 4 protein might be involved in the mechanism behind the metabolic effects of moxonidine...|$|R
40|$|The blood {{pressure}} response following parenteral administration of eledoisin varies conspicuously from one animal species to another. In the dog the polypeptide elicits a clear hypotension under all experimental conditions. Eledoisin is active at extremely low dose levels and hypotension is not appreciably affected by previous treatment with atropine, <b>sympatholytic</b> drugs, ganglion-blocking <b>agents</b> or reserpine. Eledoisin potently antagonizes the pressor effects of catechol amines and of angiotensin. Longlasting hypotension {{can be obtained}} by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection of the polypeptide. The mechanism of action of eledoisin in the dog is believed to be chiefly peripheral. The rabbit, the guinea-pig and the cat behave like the dog in the type but not in the intensity of their blood-pressure response to eledoisin. The rat gives variable responses to the polypeptide. After treatment with a ganglion-blocking drug, or in the pithed rat, a rise in {{blood pressure}} is the predominant effect. In the anaesthetized chicken eledoisin generally produces a diphasic response, but in the decapitated animal only hypertension. This last effect is believed to depend largely, if not entirely, on the release of catechol amines from body stores. The dog blood pressure may be used for the assay of eledoisin; suitable results may also be obtained from the pressor effects in decapitated chickens...|$|R
40|$|The chronotropic and dromotropic {{actions of}} ethmozin and its {{diethylamine}} analog ethacizin were {{studied in the}} presence and absence of combined muscarinic, beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade in the intact canine heart in situ (n = 38). Injections of ethacizin, 5, 10 and 25 µg/ml into the sinus node artery caused an immediate and significant (p < 0. 001) sinus bradycardia of 2, 6 and 11 %, respectively. Injection of 25 and 50 µg/ml of ethacizin into the atrioventricular (AV) node artery significantly (p < 0. 001) prolonged AV conduction time with occasional second degree heart block. Conduction delay was located exclusively during the AH interval of the His bundle electrogram. Autonomic blockade did not alter the negative chronotropic or negative dromotropic effects of ethacizin. Ethacizin, 25 µg/ml injected into the sinus node artery immediately reduced the sinus node response to vagal stimulations by 30 % {{and the effect of}} acetylcholine, 0. 1 µg/ml, injected into the sinus node artery by 50 %. Ethacizin, 25 µg/ml, injected into the AV node artery immediately reduced the duration of complete AV block elicited by vagal stimulation or intranodal acetylcholine, 0. 5 µg/ml, by 90 %. Ethacizin caused a minor reduction in sinus node response to right stellate stimulations without, however, altering the sinus node response to intranodal norepinephrine. Ethmozin injections of up to 50 µg/ml, into the sinus and AV node arteries had no chronotropic or dromotropic effects. Ethmozin had a minor and variable vagolytic action but significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the sinus node response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Hence, ethacizin, in contrast to ethmozin, has a direct depressing action on both the sinus node and the AV junction. Ethacizin also has a transient atropinic action together with a minor sympatholytic effect. Ethmozin has virtually no atropinic action but a moderate <b>sympatholytic</b> effect.
