40|$|We {{analyze the}} quantum {{fluctuations}} of vacuum <b>stress</b> <b>tensors</b> and spacetime curvatures, using {{the framework of}} linear response theory which connects these fluctuations to dissipation mechanisms arising when <b>stress</b> <b>tensors</b> and spacetime metric are coupled. Vacuum fluctuations of spacetime curvatures are {{shown to be a}} sum of two contributions at lowest orders; the first one corresponds to vacuum gravitational waves and is restricted to light-like wavevectors and vanishing Einstein curvature, while the second one arises from gravity of vacuum <b>stress</b> <b>tensors.</b> From these fluctuations, we deduce noise spectra for geodesic deviations registered by probe fields which determine ultimate limits in length or time measurements.

40|$|We obtain holographically renormalized {{boundary}} <b>stress</b> <b>tensors</b> {{with the}} emphasis on a special point in the parameter space of three dimensional new massive gravity, using the so-called Fefferman-Graham coordinates with relevant counter terms. Through the linearized equations of motion with a standard prescription, we also obtain correlators among these <b>stress</b> <b>tensors.</b> We argue that the self-consistency of holographic renormalization determines counter terms up to unphysical ambiguities. Using these renormalized <b>stress</b> <b>tensors</b> in Fefferman-Graham coordinates, we obtain the central charges of dual CFT, and mass and angular momentum of some $AdS$ black hole solutions. These results are consistent with the previous ones obtained by other methods. In this study on the Fefferman-Graham expansion of new massive gravity, some aspects of higher curvature gravity are revealed.
