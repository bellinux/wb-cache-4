40|$|Transgenic plants {{expressing a}} foreign gene are a {{suitable}} {{system for the}} production of relevant immunogens in high amounts {{that can be used for}} the development of a new generation of vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. In the present study, the expression of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of hantavirus serotype Puumala in tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> was investigated. Transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were generated and established. These transgenic plants expressed the N protein of Puumala virus strain CG- 1820. No major differences were observed when the phenotype and growth rates of transgenic plants were compared to those of normal plants. However, it was found that the leaves of transgenic tobacco plants were more slender and the tubers of transgenic <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were smaller than those in normal plants. In order to investigate the distribution of the expression of the foreign gene in transgenic plants, the proteins of leaves and roots of the individual transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were examined by Western blot analyses. It was found that all transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> expressed the N protein in the leaves, whereas transgenic <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> are able to significantly express the viral proteins also in the tubers and roots. The antigens were expressed at a level of 1 ng of protein/ 5 μg of dried leaves. The hantaviral recombinant N proteins obtained from transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were able to elicit specific humoral and mucosal immune responses when administered intraperitoneally or orally to rabbits and mice. The expression of viral proteins in plants has two major advantages compared to other expression systems: firstly, there is no risk of contamination with mammalian viruses or other pathogens, and secondly, the production of high amounts of antigens is cheap and therefore of great economic interest.

A joint effort of industry, {{policy makers and}} science initiated a four year scientific project on detection and control of volunteer <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> A proof-of-principle machine for automated detection and control of volunteer <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in sugar beet fields has been tested in experimental fields. Machine vision-based detection at 100 mm 2 precision is combined with a micro-sprayer with five needles and a working width of 0. 2 m. The accuracy of the system was ± 14 mm in longitudinal direction and ± 7. 5 mm in transverse direction. The main error source was the variability in micro-sprayer droplet velocity that caused longitudinal errors. However, 77 % of volunteer plants with a size larger than 1200 mm 2 were successfully controlled at machine speeds up to 0. 8 m s- 1.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate disease incidence of potato virus Y (PVY) and to investigate its effects on the growth and morphology of <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> and its productivity. High rates of occurrence of viral symptoms in the surveyed field were recorded. The mainly included symptoms were mild to severe yellowing, mottling, necrosis, stunting and malformation of <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> The effect of the virus on potato crop was studied using Vegetative growth and yield characters of healthy, current season and seed born PVY infected plants. There is differentiation between the growth of the current season, seed born PVY-infected and the virus free <b>potato</b> <b>plant.</b> Results showed that infection by PVY leads to reduce many physiological fuctions of above and under ground parts of host plant like size of leaf area, total chlorophyll content, number of tubers, tuber weight and total yiela of a plant. Depending on the results, because of reducing physiological fuctions of above ground part of <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> (leaf area and total chlorophyll content), the number and the weight of tuber decreased, so the productivity of the plant decreased...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of shoot growth restriction in the dry matter partitioning and minituber production of <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> grown in a closed soilless system. Minitubers of the cultivars 'Macaca' and 'Asterix' were planted in the greenhouse in the density of 100 hills m- 2, during autumn and spring growing seasons. Growth restriction levels were gotten by pruning shoots at 10, 20 and 30 cm height or without pruning. The growth restriction levels were identified by their respective leaf area index. The experiment was a factorial (cultivars x growth restriction x growing season) in a random design, with four replications. Growth restriction affected the dry matter production of <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in both growing seasons and cultivars. Pruning <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> at 30 cm is a feasible technique to control leaf area index and it has lower effect on harvest index and number than in dry matter production of minitubers.

40|$|Tuber {{volume of}} sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) was {{measured}} in course of time by applying an on-line laser micrometer (LM) system, and diurnal change in tuber growth was analyzed. Tuber growth rate fluctuated synchronizing with the photoperiod, where the growth rate in the light was kept lower than that in the dark. Rapid increase and decrease in the growth rate were occurred after darkening and lightening, respectively. These results suggest that tuber growth of sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> responds {{to changes in the}} shoot environment, and the growth response was considered to be related to leaf transpiration through dynamics of plant water balance. Thus, diurnal pattern of tuber growth in sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> was revealed clearly by using the LM system...|$|R

Releases between different arrangements of potted host and non-host plants showed (1) greater beetle colonization and greater length of time spent on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> growing alone than on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> surrounded by non-host vegetation, and (2) no effect of <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> density on colonization or tenure time.

40|$|At low concentrations, Cu is {{considered}} {{as an essential}} micronutrient for plants and as a constituent and activator of several enzymes. However, when in excess, Cu can negatively affect plant growth and metabolism. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate physiological responses of sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> at different Cu concentrations by measuring morphological parameters, antioxidant metabolism, stomatal characteristics, and mineral profile. For this purpose, sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were grown hydroponically in complete nutrient solution for six days. Then, the plants were transferred to solutions containing different Cu concentrations, 0. 041 (control), 0. 082, and 0. 164 mM, and maintained for nine days. The main effect of increased Cu concentration was observed in the roots. The sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> grown in 0. 082 mM Cu solution showed increased activity of antioxidant enzymes and no changes in growth parameters. However, at a concentration of 0. 164 mM, Cu was transported from the roots to the shoots. This concentration altered morpho-anatomical characteristics and activated the antioxidant system because of the stress generated by excess Cu. On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that the sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were able to tolerate Cu toxicity until 0. 082 mM...|$|R

So far, most studies on potato were conducted under greenhouse or in vitro conditions and few reported on results within the field.

In both trials, individual subplots were arranged in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. Microbial inoculants were entrapped in alginate beads. Four treatments were considered: inoculum applied to the cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> (I+CC+), inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop – i. e. bare soil – (I+CC−), no inoculum applied either at cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> or on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> (I−CC+), no inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop – i. e. bare soil – (I−CC−). Potato yield (i. e. tuber weight, size and number) was evaluated in both trials. Potato root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and abundance of Trichoderma harzianum in soil were evaluated in trial 2. In both trials, the most advantageous strategy to increase potato tuber weight was by inoculating the cover crop. For cultivar Sarpo Mira (trial 1) inoculation increased significantly (P 30 mm long.
