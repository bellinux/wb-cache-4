40|$|A well {{crystallized}} powder {{sample of}} <b>sodium</b> holmium <b>orthosilicate</b> oxyapatite, Na 2. 27 Ho 7. 73 (SiO 4) 6 O 0. 72, was obtained after mechanical milling and thermal treatment at 1123  K. Crystal structure {{analysis was performed}} {{from the results of}} Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron diffraction data. As in other rare-earth <b>orthosilicate</b> apatites, <b>sodium</b> cations appear located sharing with holmium the 4 f Wyckoff position {{at the center of a}} tricapped trigonal prism. In its turn, holmium almost fully occupies the 6 h position at the center of a seven-coordinated penta­gonal bipyramid. A small quantity of Na atoms was found at this site. No vacancies are present in the two independent crystallographic sites available for Ho and Na atoms...|$|R
40|$|Inorganic {{adhesives}} {{have several}} benefits over traditional joining methods for joining electrical steels used in magnetic cores of numerous industrial applications. As insulators with very high melting temperatures, the adhesives offer {{the possibility of}} increasing the efficiency of these machines. The aim of this project was to characterize sodium silicates as adhesives for such applications and develop methodology for their processing. The chemical and physical properties of the water-soluble sodium silicates were easily altered by changing the composition of Na₂O, SiO₄, and water, offering a spectrum of properties to investigate. Several aspects of the electrical steel provided by POSCO were also investigated, including surface chemistry and microstructure due to processing of the steel sheets. Coating efficacy was evaluated based on the adhesive's ability to wet the substrate to form a uniform coating, as well as resistance to mechanical loads, including adhesion and flexural strain. Greater degree of alkalinity in the sodium silicates resulted in improved wetting, uniformity, adhesion, and flexural strain for the range of viscosities that supported these behaviors. The microstructure of the electrical steels influenced {{the interaction of the}} adhesive with the surface, but properties still improved with higher alkalinity. Firing parameters were used to alter the mechanical properties of the silicates, as well as to determine operability limits. The best mechanical properties occurred for those coupons fired between 600 °C and 800 °C. The efficacy did not degrade significantly with long exposure to high temperatures, offering promise for <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicates</b> as appropriate adhesives for the described applications. Further study of the environmental conditions under which the adhesives will be used, as well as full characterization of the insulating properties will allow the processes developed here to be scaled up for industrial use. by Jordan Marks.

40|$|Neurofibrillary tangles {{are one of}} two lesions {{found in}} the brain of Alzheimer disease victims. With {{synthetic}} peptide fragments of human neurofilament NF-M 17 (Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ser-Pro- Val-Pro-Lys-Ser-Pro-Val-Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated), CD studies were done to {{examine the effect of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> on the conformational state produced by Al 3 + on fragments of neuronal proteins. Previous studies had shown a conformational transition from alpha-helix and random to beta-pleated sheet upon addition of Al 3 + to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides. If sufficient quantities of Al 3 + are added, the peptide precipitates from solution. The ability to reverse or slow the progression of aggregation was examined. Al 3 + binding was reversed with 1 - 2 molar equivalents of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> (with respect to Al 3 +), altering the conformation from beta-sheet to random coil and resulting in a CD spectrum {{similar to that of the}} initial peptide. The tight binding of the SiO 4 (4 -) with the Al 3 + provides the mechanism for this transition. These results provide additional information toward understanding the role of aluminum in the Alzheimer diseased brain and suggest the investigation of the possible use of silicates as a therapeutic agent...|$|E
40|$|The desilicated {{form of the}} ZSM- 5 was {{prepared}} by a process which involved the selective removal of silicon atoms from the parent sodium form zeolite in an aqueous basic solution of sodium carbonate. If the resulting material was activated at 700 C̕, its pore size was larger {{than that of the}} parent zeolite. The sample is called DS for: Desilication and Stabilization. The desilication treatment has the effect of lowering the Si/Al ratio, while keeping the zeolite structure essentially unmodified. The silicate material which had been removed was determined to be in large proportion <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate.</b> Ion-exchange of the Na-DZSM- 5 with ammonium chloride gives us the more acidic form H-DZSM- 5. An amount of 5 wt. % <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> is reinserted on the H-DZSM- 5 zeolite and with a stepwise heating treatment to 700 C̕ for 16 - 18 hours, the pore size decreases to 4. 6 Å. This process is termed DRS, which stands for: Desilication, Reinsertion and Stabilization. To get this pore narrowing, there is a reaction that occurs between the zeolite's and the orthosilicate's silanols during the thermal treatment. This reaction results from dehydroxylation and formation of siloxane bonds. Selective adsorptive tests with the BTX aromatics and catalytic runs performed with methanol at various reaction temperatures, confirm the enlargement due to the DS treatment, and the pore narrowing {{as the result of the}} DRS treatment. With the goal of better understanding the mechanism involved in the DRS process and to improve the success rate, we passed the <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> through an acid resin and then an amount of 8 wt. % of the resulting orthosilicic acid was reinserted into the H-DZSM- 5. The sample was then activated to 700 C̕ for a period of 16 - 18 hours and a measure of the median pore size gave us 4. 4 Å with an improved reproducibility. The reaction temperature between the zeolite's and the orthosilicic silanols was determined with the Differential Scanning Calorimetry/Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DSC/TGA) instrument to be ca. 600 C̕. The product of this reaction gives us the formation of new siloxane bonds which are responsible for pore narrowing. Selective adsorption tests with n-heptane and isooctane, catalytic runs performed with methanol at various reaction temperature, the determination of the constraint index and the internal space, confirmed the pore narrowing as the result of the DRS treatment...|$|E
40|$|Film growth {{conditions}} {{were selected to}} enable the extent of migration of fluoride ions in anodic oxides on tantalum to be determined precisely. By using a preformed film formed in <b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> electrolyte in which the incorpo-rated silicon species are immobile, a marker is generated to which mobilities may be referenced. Thus, by reanodizing the preformed film in fluoride electrolyte, secondary ion mass spectroscopy depth profiling allows precise determination {{of the extent of}} migration of the inwardly mobile fluoride ions. Fluoride ions migrate inward at a rate 1. 85 times faster than that of O ' ions, leading {{to the development of a}} fluoride enriched region of TaF, between the tantalum substrate and the outer anodic tantala oxide. From this base, consideration is given to the varied processes involved in ionic transport in amorphous anodic oxides and the requirements for enhanced understanding...|$|E
40|$|The desilicated {{forms of}} the Na-X, Na-Y, the {{ammonium}} and sodium {{forms of the}} ZSM- 5 zeolite were prepared by a process which involves the selective removal of silicon atoms from the parent zeolite in an aqueous basic solution. This treatment has the effect to decrease the Si/Al ratio while keeping the zeolite structure almost unmodified. In all cases, we noticed an enhancement of the ion-exchange capacity. This property could be exploited industrially since the desilicated forms have higher total ion removal rates of calcium and magnesium ions from a solution of hard water. As for two ZSM- 5 zeolites, having quite different Si/Al ratio, the preparation of highly thermally stable zeolite materials with smaller micropores at 4. 9 A or larger at 5. 5 A {{than those of the}} parent ZSM- 5 zeolites was possible. These final materials were obtained by a process which involved the following additional steps: (i) reinsertion into the desilicated ZSM- 5 zeolite of a well defined amount of silicon species (<b>sodium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> and pyrosilicate) which have been selectively removed from the zeolitic framework during the desilication process, and then (ii) activation of the resulting materials in air at high temperatures (550 ∘C). The amount of the reinserted silicon containing species depends on the pore size wanted. The zeolite materials so obtained still have quite high surface areas and pore volumes. This method has the great advantage of being very reproducible, giving us a micropore size which is much smaller or much larger by ± 0. 4 A than the size of the parent zeolite with a quite homogeneous micropore distribution, and the latter characteristic must result in selectivity in catalysis or adsorption...|$|E
