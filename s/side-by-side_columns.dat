50|$|The {{most popular}} type of {{magazine}} in modern rifles and handguns, a box magazine stores cartridges in a column, either one above the other or staggered zigzag fashion. This zigzag stack is often {{identified as a}} double-column or double-stack since a single staggered column is actually two <b>side-by-side</b> vertical <b>columns</b> offset by half of the diameter of a round. As the firearm cycles, cartridges are moved {{to the top of}} the magazine by a follower driven by spring compression to either a single feed position or side-by-side feed positions. Box magazines may be integral to the firearm or removable.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{over two}} <b>side-by-side</b> square <b>columns</b> is studied numerically and {{experimentally}} at low Reynolds number (Re= 100 - 200) {{to investigate the}} effects of the gap distance on the behaviour of the flow. Different gap distances between two square columns are simulated to analyse the interactions of laminar wakes with a gap flow. Four different flow regimes are observed based on different gap distance. Experimental test are performed to validate the simulations. A new water tank has been built specifically for these tests due to the requirements of low Reynolds number and the high sensitivity of the gap flow. Initial experimental flow visualizations of the vortex wake confirm the findings of distinct gap flow regimes...|$|R
5000|$|Philip {{assembled}} {{his army}} in traditional feudal fashion: three battles abreast. He himself commanded the right, while the centre {{was under the}} command of the marshal, Broglio dei Bonsi, and the left Thomas II Sanseverino, count of Marsico. Frederick too followed typical medieval tactics and aligned his forces in three <b>columns</b> <b>side-by-side.</b> Frederick commanded his own centre, composed entirely of infantry. The left he put under command of Blasco I of Alagona, with a little cavalry and some Almogàvers. The right was composed mainly of cavalry under the direction of Frederick's premier vassals, the victors of Montaperti.|$|R
5|$|This {{order of}} battle was almost always followed, the Battle of the Great Plains and the Battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a {{flanking}} force, routing the opposing Carthaginians. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into <b>columns,</b> <b>side-by-side,</b> with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|R
2500|$|Around 235CE, Origen, a Christian {{scholar in}} Alexandria, {{completed}} the Hexapla, a comprehensive {{comparison of the}} ancient versions and Hebrew text <b>side-by-side</b> in six <b>columns,</b> with diacritical markings (a.k.a. [...] "editor's marks", [...] "critical signs" [...] or [...] "Aristarchian signs"). Much of this work was lost, but several compilations of the fragments are available. In the first column was the contemporary Hebrew, in the second a Greek transliteration of it, then the newer Greek versions each in their own columns. Origen also kept a column for the Old Greek (the Septuagint), which included readings from all the Greek versions into a critical apparatus with diacritical marks indicating to which version each line (Gr. στίχος) belonged. Perhaps the voluminous Hexapla was never copied in its entirety, but Origen's combined text ("the fifth column") was copied frequently, eventually without the editing marks, and the older uncombined text of the LXX was neglected. Thus this combined text became the first major Christian recension of the LXX, often called the Hexaplar recension. In the century following Origen, two other major recensions were identified by Jerome, who attributed these to Lucian and Hesychius.|$|R
40|$|There {{was a small}} {{mistake in}} the command file used to compute the results in our paper [McKitrick and Michaels 2004]. 1 The formula for {{computing}} cosine of absolute latitude (COSABLAT) takes the angle in radians but our data were entered in degrees. We have corrected this and produced new versions of the affected Tables. Table 4 below, showing the central results of the paper, displays the original and corrected <b>columns</b> <b>side-by-side</b> for ease of comparison. Tables 5 — 8 are presented in corrected versions only. As is evident in Table 4, except for the impacts on the COSABLAT variable itself, the changes are very small. The principal effect of the correction is a reduced weight on the constant term and an increased weight on the COSABLAT variable itself. Indeed the correction improves the overall fit and removes the anomalously small cosine-latitude effect. The socioeconomic variables remain significant and the effects carry over from the station data to the gridded data as before. Because the main patterns of results persist across the revised tables, the original discussions as worded in our paper need only minor modification, and our overall conclusion, re-stated here, is unaffected: Overall, {{the results of this}} study support the hypothesis that published temperature data are contaminated with nonclimatic influences that add up to a net warming bias, and that efforts should be made t...|$|R
