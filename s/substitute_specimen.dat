40|$|The compound, Sr 3 NiPtO 6, {{belonging}} to a K 4 CdCl 6 -type rhombohedral structure, has been reported not to exhibit magnetic ordering at least down to 1. 8 K, despite a relatively large value of paramagnetic Curie temperature. This is attributable to geometrical frustration. Here we report {{the results of our}} efforts to gradually replace Sr by Ba and to probe the influence of positive (external) and negative (chemical) pressure on the magnetic behavior of this compound. In the Ba substituted series, single phase is formed up to x= 1. 0 with Ba substituting for Sr. The magnetic properties of the parent compound in the entire temperature range of investigation are not influenced at all in any of the compositions studied as well as under external pressure (investigated up to 10 kbar). Spin-liquid-like heat-capacity behavior (finite linear term) is observed even in Ba <b>substituted</b> <b>specimens.</b> Thus, the magnetic anomalies of this compound are quite robust...|$|R
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{integrity of}} European Gymnopus subsect. Levipedes is verified based on anatomicmorphological characters {{with support from}} DNA sequences of ITS and translation elongation factor 1 -alpha genes. Seven species (G. alpinus, G. aquosus, G. dryophilus – including var. lanipes, G. erythropus, G. fagiphilus, G. hybridus, and G. ocior) belonging to this subsection are included. We clarify the concepts of G. dryophilus and G. ocior, which were occasionally confused in older literature. Due to unavailability of previously selected neotype of G. dryophilus the <b>substitute</b> neotype <b>specimen</b> is selected. Gymnopus dryophilus var. lanipes is confirmed as a variety; no important differences from nominotypical variability were detected. All discriminative characters used for identification of these species are discussed in detail. An identification key is also provided...|$|R
5000|$|Virtual herbaria are {{established}} {{in part to}} increase the longevity of specimens. Major herbaria participate in international loan programs, where a researcher can request specimens to be shipped in for study. This shipping contributes to {{the wear and tear}} of specimens. If, however, digital images are available, images of the specimens can be sent electronically. These images may be a sufficient <b>substitute</b> for the <b>specimens</b> themselves, or alternatively, the researcher can use the images to [...] "preview" [...] the specimens, to which ones should be sent out for further study. This process cuts down on the shipping, and thus the wear and tear of the specimens, as well as the wait times associated with shipping.|$|R
40|$|Even {{though a}} lot of {{research}} has been carried out concerning the preparation of carbonate apatite (CHA), they were related to CHA in the form of powder. In the present study, macroporous CHA bone substitutes were prepared through composition-transformation of gypsum and Ca-hydroxide. Here, we investigated the effect of added Ca-hydroxide to gypsum, carbonation periods, and hydrothermal temperatures for phosphatization to understand the basic principle of composition-transformation of gypsum added Ca-hydroxide to fabricate CHA bone <b>substitutes.</b> The <b>specimens</b> were characterized in terms of chemical and physical properties, such as extent of transformation of macroporous gypsum added Ca-hydroxide into CHA body, type and content of carbonate, and crystal morphology. It was observed that the transformation was faster with higher hydrothermal temperature. However, higher hydrothermal temperature caused de-carbonation phenomena which resulted in the lack of carbonate ions of the product. Moreover, the higher the percentage of Ca-hydroxide added to gypsum, caused the complete transformation of gypsum into CHA to be slower. These findings have been applied to the standard fabrication procedure of carbonate apatite, which in turn will allow scaling up process, and will be provided for biomedical purposes for the Indonesian community...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Flyash {{substitution}} {{to cement}} is a well-recognized approach to reduce CO 2 emissions. Although flyash concrete {{is prone to}} brittle behavior, researchers have shown that addition of fibers could reduce brittle behavior. Previous research efforts seem to have utlised a single type of fiber or two types of fibers. In this research, three types of fibers - steel, polypropylene and basalt as 0 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 % and 1 % by volume of concrete were mixed in varying proportions with concrete <b>specimens</b> <b>substituted</b> with 50 % flyash (Class F). All specimens were tested for compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and flexural strength {{over a period of}} 3 to 56 days of curing. Test results showed that significant improvement in mechanical properties could be obtained by a particular hybrid fiber reinforcement combination (1 % steel fiber, 0. 75 % polypropylene fiber and 0. 75 % basalt fiber). The observed strength values were observed to exceed previous research results. Workability of concrete was affected when the fiber combination exceeded 3 %. Thus a limiting value for adding fibers and the combination to achieve maximum strengths have been identified in this research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Composite {{synthetic}} {{bones are}} a commercially available <b>substitute</b> for cadaveric <b>specimens,</b> {{and they have}} previously been validated to replicate natural bone under quasi-static, non-destructive testing. Synthetic tibias {{could be used to}} analyse injury risk to the lower leg during impact events, but their failure mode must be validated by way of comparative tests to human bone. Synthetic tibias were instrumented with strain gauges and subjected to axial impact loading. Two different projectile masses were used for the tests, and the effects of force, momentum, and energy on failure were compared with previous cadaveric data. The composite tibias failed at forces between 37 – 45 per cent of those from cadavers, and failed via cortical delamination in combination with fracture. A Weibull analysis generated a survivability curve based on axial force at failure, and was shown to be lower than previous cadaveric curves. Failure was dependent on both the momentum and energy applied. Strain distributions through the synthetic tibias were significantly different from those of cadavers. The convex distal articular surface of the synthetic bones may partially account for the lower fracture tolerance. As a result of the many differences in response, these synthetic tibias are not recommended for use in impact fracture studies...|$|R
40|$|Sawbones 4 th Generation {{composite}} {{bones are}} useful tools for the mechanical testing of orthopaedic devices and validation of FE models. The products {{are intended to}} provide more reliability and less variability than cadaveric specimens, and have been often used in biomechanical analyses. However, no independent validation of these data exists. Three point bending tests on the cortical component of the femur and on sheets of the same material were conducted in separate independent laboratories to determine the Young’s modulus of the material. These data were incorporated into a FE model of a femur to be validated against an equivalent mechanical test using both force-displacement and strain gauge data. There was significant inter-sample variability in Young’s modulus, potentially due to microstructural heterogeneity. All samples were significantly less stiff than the quoted value of 16. 0 GPa (Sawbones 2014), with a mean Young’s modulus of 10. 7 GPa calculated for the cortical sample and 8. 4 GPa for the sheets. The FE model compared favourably with the mechanical testing, with a 3. 3 % higher stiffness than that recorded experimentally, giving confidence in our Young’s modulus data. This paper has highlighted that that {{care must be taken}} when employing these products as <b>substitutes</b> for cadaveric <b>specimens...</b>|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{problem of}} acrylic resin denture teeth {{separating}} from their denture base remains {{a major problem}} in prosthodontic practice and is frustrating to the patients as well as the dentists. Purpose: This study investigated the influence of tin foil substitute contamination on bond strength between acrylic resin denture teeth and their denture base. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 modified acrylic resin maxillary left central incisors were processed to their denture base material. The 80 specimens were divided into two groups of 40 specimens each: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group had the denture tooth ridge lap area contaminated with tin foil <b>substitute.</b> The 40 <b>specimens</b> in the control group were not contaminated. After 7 days of storage at room temperature, the bond strengths of the two groups were tested with a universal testing machine. The nature of failure was noted as adhesive (interface) or cohesive (in tooth or denture base material). The Welch test and z-test were performed to identify significant differences. Results: The uncontaminated specimens (group I) showed superior bond strength as compared to the contaminated specimens (group II); the difference in bond strength between the groups was highly significant (P< 0. 0001). Also the contaminated specimens exhibited predominantly adhesive failure (89. 74 %), whereas the uncontaminated specimens exhibited 55 % adhesive failure and 45 % cohesive failure. Conclusion: Tin foil substitute contamination of the ridge laps of acrylic resin denture teeth greatly reduced the bond strength...|$|R
40|$|Background : Herbal drugs used {{to treat}} illness {{according}} to Ayurveda are often misidentified or adulterated with similar plant materials. Objective: To aid taxonomical identification, we used DNA barcoding to evaluate authentic and substitute samples of herb and phylogenetic relationship of four medicinal plants of family Asparagaceace and Asclepiadaceae. Materials and Methods : DNA extracted from dry root samples of two authentic and two <b>substitutes</b> of four <b>specimens</b> belonging to four species were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Primers for nuclear DNA (nu ITS 2) and plastid DNA (matK and rpoC 1) were used for PCR and sequence analysis was performed by Clustal W. The intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence were calculated using MEGA V 4. 0. Statistical Analysis : Kimura′s two parameter model, neighbor joining and bootstrapping methods were used in this work. Results: The result indicates the efficiency of amplification for ITS 2 candidate DNA barcodes was 100 % for four species tested. The average interspecific divergence is 0. 12 and intraspecific variation was 0. 232 {{in the case of}} two Asparagaceae species. In two Asclepiadaceae species, average interspecific divergence and intraspecific variation were 0. 178 and 0. 004 respectively. Conclusions: Our findings show that the ITS 2 region can effectively discriminate Asparagus racemosus and Hemidesmus indicus from its substitute samples and hence can resolve species admixtures in raw samples. The ITS 2 region may be used as one of the standard DNA barcodes to identify closely related species of family Asclepiadaceae but was noninformative for Asparagaceae species suggesting a need for the development of new markers for each family. More detailed studies involving more species and substitutes are warranted...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{the aim of this}} study to give a {{comprehensive}} description of the important crinoid fauna's of the Palaeozoic core of North Western Spain (provinces Palencia, León and Asturias). This was opportune since fine collections of crinoids had been made during the years 1955 — 1960 by students of Leiden University (Holland). Moreover, existing collections of Spanish crinoids have not recieved hitherto due attention. Up to the present day only ten species of Palaeozoic crinoids have been known from Spain. Five new genera and sixteen new species of Spanish crinoids are now described. Fourteen previously described genera are reported {{for the first time to}} occur in Spain, either from new species or from species not yet sufficiently well known to allow specific arrangement. Six previously described species are recorded for the first time from Spain. So the total number of known Spanish crinoid species has now been raised to fifty six (thirty two genera) : twenty five Emsian species, nine Couvinian species, six Givetian species, one Fransnian species, one Visean species, four Namurian species and four Moscovian species. The other species, represented by museum specimens only, are of uncertain Devonian or Carboniferous age. Camerates are far more numerous than inadunates, whereas flexibles are not known with any certainty. Camerates include thirty eight species (twenty two genera); inadunates eightteen species (ten genera). Among camerates only seven species belong to the diplobathrids; stratigraphically they seem to be restricted to the Emsian. Pterinocrinus decembrachiatus, Griphocrinus ovetensis, Orthocrinus robustus and Orthocrinus elongatus are described as new species of diplobathrids. The genera Diamenocrinus, Pterinocrinus, Macarocrinus and Griphocrinus are recorded for the first time from Spain. Orthocrinus was already known. W. E. Schmidt's species Orthocrinus planus is regarded a nomen dubium, since only poor fragments are assignable to the species. Camerates further include thirty one species of monobathrids, among which periechocrinids (fourteen species) and hapalocrinids/platycrinids (nine species) are of special importance. Stratigraphical distribution of the Spanish monobathrids is from the Lower Devonian to Upper Carboniferous. Among periechocrinids (restricted to Devonian strata) Pradocrinus is held as an independent genus with the only species P. Baylii de Verneuil, 1850 as the type-species. The genus is only known to occur in Spain. The available generic names Lenneocrinus and Pyxidocrinus were used for assignment of Spanish species. Lenneocrinus is now definitely erected with L. cirratus Jaekel, 1918 as the type-species. A diagnosis has been given on p. 29. The genus is first reported to occur in Spain from the new Frasnian species L. ventanillensis. Pyxidocrinus was proposed as a conditional name but is now erected as genus with Actinocrinus prumiensis as type-species and J. Muller as the author. A diagnosis has been given on p. 35. P. collensis and P. latus are referred to it as new species. P. San-Migueli (Astre, 1925), formerly referred to Periechocrinus and Pithocrinus and P. bifrons (W. E. Schmidt, 1932, formerly referred to Megistocrinus and Pithocrinus have now been ranked under Pyxidocrinus. Although Pyxidocrinus has a German species as the type, it is essentially a Spanish genus. Strangely enough it is only now reported for the first time as occurring in Spain. The genus Pithocrinus Kirk, 1945, with P. Cooperi Kirk, 1945 as the type-species has been emended so as to include forms with globose dorsal cups, a variable number of free arms per ray and a stout subcentral anal tube. The arms are described for the first time. For emended diagnosis see p. 46. Although Pithocrinus has an American type it is essentially a Spanish genus. P. ovatus and P. spinosus are referred to this genus as new species, P. Waliszewskii Oehlert, 1896, formerly referred to Megistocrinus is kept within it, but P. intrastigmatus Schmidt, 1932, formerly referred to Saccocrinus is excluded and used as the type-species of the new genus Stamnocrinus diagnosis see p. 59 which is believed to include Dorycrinus devonicus Springer, 1911 and two more Spanish species, not yet sufficiently well known so as to allow definite description. Stamnocrinus is restricted to Devonian strata. The new Emsian species Corocrinus? grandosensis is provisionally referred to Corocrinus because it possesses characters unknown up to now from that genus. Gennaeocrinus is first recorded from Spain from a species very similar to G. nyssa. The study of the important Devonian periechocrinid fauna has revealed that no Devonian forms can be assigned to the type genus Periechocrinus, which genus must be of exclusively Silurian age. A group of Lower Carboniferous and Mississippian species, hitherto assigned to Periechocrinus, both for morphological as for stratigraphical reasons cannot belong to Periechocrinus nor to any of the Devonian periechocrinid genera. The new genus Aryballocrinus is erected for them with Periechocrinus ? Whitei Hall, 1861 as the type-species. A diagnosis for this genus is given on p. 72. The genus includes six species, four of which were formerly referred with doubt to Periechocrinus: Aryballocrinus Whitei (Hall, 1861), Aryballocrinus tenuidiscus (Hall, 1861), Aryballocrinus awthornsensis (J. Wright, 1955) and Aryballocrinus spec. 1 (Laudon & Severson, 1953). Further are included Aryballocrinus Sampsoni Miller & Gurley, 1896, formerly referred to Corocrinus and Aryballocrinus parvus Wachsmuth & Springer, 1890, formerly referred to Megistocrinus Other monobathrids include specimens of Iberocrinus multibrachiatus Sieverts Doreck, 1951, which species proved to occur in the Moscovian of Spain. Nunnacrinus ? stellaris is first reported from the Namurian of Spain. The genus Pimlicocrinus is first recorded outside Great Britain. Pimlicocrinus latus occurs in the Namurian of Spain, whereas in England it is in the Dinantian. Another two species of Pimlicocrinus are not yet fully described. One of them is of Moscovian age and probably conspecific with a specimen from the Westfalian of Marocco. A single cup is assigned to Aorocrinus. This would mean the first occurrence of this genus outside the North American continent. Platyhexacrinus Kegeli W. E. Schmidt, 1932 is mentioned because two new <b>specimens</b> <b>substitute</b> for the lost types. Trybliocrinus Flatheanus is redescribed in great detail. The species Hadrocrinus hispaniae Schmidt, 1932 is placed into synonymy with it. Much attention has been given to the ontogenetic growth. Ontogenetic phenomena are regarded as special characters of the family Polypetidae, in which family the genus Himerocrinus Springer, 1921 is placed on the ground that it is supposed to have an ontogenetic growth largely comparable to that here described for Trybliocrinus. Platycrinicae form an important part of the Spanish fauna. Besides Platycrinus spec. ex gr. bollandensis of Namurian age and Pleurocrinus spec. ex gr. coplowensis of unknown provenance, they may all be found in Lower and Middle Devonian strata. The Spanish hapalocrinids and related platycrinids are characterized by aberrant positions of the smaller basal and by differentation of the posterior interradius. The new hapalocrinid genus Cantharocrinus with C. minor spec. Nov. as the type-species (diagnosis see p. 117) and the new species C. simplex as co-type, is still only known from Spain. The new platycrinid genus Oenochoacrinus with Oe. princeps spec. Nov. as type-species (diagnosis see p. 124) and the new species Oe. pileatus and Oe. scaber as cotypes, is still known only from Spain. The genus is erected for platycrinids with a tegmen composed of five orals and five modified first axillar ambulacrals. The genus showed to posses affinity with the Permian genus Neoplatycrinus. The better understanding of modified first axillar ambulacrals, as a character consistent with the presence of but one first primibrach and two secundibrachs in trunked armbases led to a review of the morphological relations of genera in the Platycrinicae. A suggestion for their evolution is given, based on detailed morphological comparison (see textfig. 32). Among the inadunates previously described from Spain Storthingocrinus Haugi Oehlert, 1896 and Storthingocrinus labiatus W. E. Schmidt, 1932 are regarded as nomina dubia. The incomplete nature of the specimens attributed to them, forces us to do this because their cups are undistinguishable from so many other inadunate cups. The affinity of North American Devonian crinoids with the West European fauna is once more expressed by the first record from Spain of the species Vasocrinus valens Lyon, 1857; Vasocrinus turbinatus Kirk, 1929; Vasocrinus stellaris (Schultze, 1867) and spec. cf. V. sculptus Lyon, 1857. A highly interesting inadunate proved to be a form with pentalobate stem, composed of five different joint series, two anals in cup and enlarged thecal cavity by incorporation of a smalll number of interradials and the presence of a madreporite. It is described as the new genus Situlacrinus with S. costatus spec. Nov. as the type-species diagnosis see p. 153 The genus is placed provisionally among the Barycrinidae. It would be the first Devonian form of that family and the first record from Europe. The Givetian cupressocrinid fauna has largely affinitiy with Middle Devonian fauna's in the Eifel region. Cupressocrinites Townsendi, Cupressocrinites spec. cf. C. Schlotheimi, Cupressocrinites inflatus, Cupressocrinites Sampelayoi and a species not sufficiently well presented to receive full description are described from Spain. C. inflatus and C. aff. Schlotheimi have their first mention outside Germany. The genus Aviadocrinus Almela & Revilla, 1950 is put into synonymy with Cupressocrinites Goldfuss, 1831 because all the essential characters of its type-species A. Sampelayoi occur dispersedly among Cupressocrinites species. The genera Bactrocrinites, Lasiocrinus (?), Cromyocrinus and Paradelocrinus are reported for the first time from Spain. The Devonian crinoid faunas in the province of León occur in four different levels: at the top of the La Vid formation; at the base of the Santa Lucia formation; at the top of the Santa Lucia formation; and in the middle part of the Portilla formation. The first two faunas are of Emsian age. The Emsian fauna has affinities with the Lower Devonian fauna of Western Germany and with the Middle Devonian fauna of the region West-Central New York, Kentucky, Michigan, Indiana. The Spanish Emsian fauna is the richest of all known Spanish crinoid faunas...|$|R
