5|$|Prior to the invasion, {{significant}} fortifications {{known as}} the Rupnik Line were constructed along the Italian and Reich borders, within what became the 7th Army's area of operations. Along the frontier with Italy, mutually supporting bunkers were established on forward slopes of the mountain ranges behind a belt of obstacles. The main positions followed a line from Mount Blegoš <b>south-south-east</b> through Hlavče Njive, Žirovski Vrh, Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev, Zaplana, Mount Slivnica, Grahovo, and Lož to Petičak. To the north of Mount Blegoš, positions ran behind {{the lines of the}} Selška Sora and Sava Bohinjka rivers. Fortifications were also established in the mountainous Gorski kotar region between Karlovac and Fiume on the upper Adriatic coast. Along the Reich border, the Yugoslavs concentrated on preparing to block the passes through the Karawank and Kamnik Alps, and built bunkers behind obstacles along the routes leading south from the border towards Dravograd, Maribor and Ptuj. Preparations were also made to block routes north of the Drava and along the southern banks of the Mura and Drava. These fortifications were to be manned by border guard units, and were not the responsibility of the 7th Army.|$|E

25|$|Lady Elizabeth {{was only}} in service for nine years when she met her fate on 30 June 1878, while she was on charter for Messrs Shenton and Monger to carry a cargo of lead ore and 611 tons of {{sandalwood}} to Shanghai. Captain Scott encountered rough weather around Rottnest Island and the ship was driven south because of the difficulties in acquiring navigational headings. On the morning of 30 June, Captain Scott ordered the crew {{to head back to}} Fremantle about 55 kilometres away to <b>south-south-east.</b> During the heavy storm, one man was lost overboard but the crew could not launch any boats to rescue the sailor because of the weather.|$|E
25|$|Every ship in {{the line}} within range began firing. At 1844, after more than ten {{and a half hours}} of attacks, U-546 rolled under and sank (in {{position}} , <b>south-south-east</b> of Cape Farewell, Greenland). Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station, Newfoundland. Eight of the surviving, captured crewmen of U-546 were tortured by US military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U-546's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly get information on what the U.S. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental US by German submarines. The USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.|$|E
25|$|The fort was {{oriented}} {{in such a}} {{way that}} its main gate, or porta praetoria faced <b>south-south-east,</b> that is away from the limes but towards Nida. The central structure of the fort was a large principia, a central plaza surrounded by housing or offices for the higher officers, which was flanked by a roofed hall for assemblies of the fort's garrison. The praetentura (front part of the fort) contained the praetorium (the fort commander's residence) to the west of the via praetoria, and a large horreum (grain store) to its east. The rest of the fort's interior, today a park-like area of grass and trees, should be visualised as packed with further buildings: stables, magazines, workshops and, of course, the actual troop quarters, subdivided into contubernia. Two such troop barracks have been reconstructed in the southeast part of the fort. For the general arrangement and terminology of Roman fort architecture, see Castra.|$|E

The ship sank within four minutes {{with the loss of}} 17 of her crew of 50. The survivors were picked up by the Portuguese destroyer Lima. After the attack the U-boat was depth charged for several hours by convoy escorts, but managed to escape unharmed.|$|E
500|$|When Richard Siward remodelled {{the castle}} [...] {{it is likely}} that he added the motte with its stone {{enclosure}} castle and replaced the single small bailey with two large enclosures south of the motte. These enclosures may have housed a market as was the case at Lochmaben Castle. There are few examples in Scotland of earthwork castles being rebuilt in stone. The four-sided motte measures [...] at the summit. The enclosure castle on top is roughly rectangular, measuring , with a round tower at each corner. Little survives above ground of this structure, though the <b>south-south-east</b> tower survives best. The south side of the enclosure castle had an additional tower which tower with the <b>south-south-east</b> corner tower flanked the entrance. Inside, the castle had a well on the east side and a range of buildings extending along the west and north sides; these likely contained a great hall, the kitchens, and a chamber. There was a postern gate just south of the north-east tower. This phase of Tibbers is [...] "one of the few authentic surviving remnants of English castle building in Scotland during the Plantagenet occupation." ...|$|E
500|$|The village, {{which is}} at about [...] above sea-level, sits largely on the Kimmeridge Clay, a Jurassic shallow-water shelf-sea deposit, with an overall <b>south-{{south-east}}</b> to south-east dip. Underlying the Kimmeridge Clay, are similarly dipping older Jurassic clays, which also contain thin beds of limestone and sandstone. Overlying the Kimmeridge Clay and lying some distance {{to the east of}} the village are similarly dipping, younger Cretaceous rocks, comprising the Greensand and Chalk. At the west of the village, an outlier of Greensand forms the foundation of a hill rising to some [...] above sea-level. This hill is capped by much younger (Pleistocene) boulder clay, the result of large ice sheets having moved over the wider general area.|$|E
500|$|On 24 November, {{in support}} of Operation Crusader, the LRDG were ordered to attack Axis rear areas. Already on patrol, 'Y1' and 'Y2' Patrols {{attacked}} targets in the Mechili, Derna and Gazala area. 'Y1' damaged fifteen vehicles in a transport park and 'Y2' captured a small fort and about 20 Italians. 'S2' and 'R2' Patrols attacked targets in the Benghazi, Barce and Marawa area, where they ambushed nine vehicles. 'G1' and 'G2' Patrols were assigned the main road near Agedabia where 'G1' made two attacks on road traffic and shot up a few vehicles. After the Axis forces withdrew from Cyrenaica the LRDG moved to a base at Jalo oasis, about [...] to the <b>south-south-east</b> of Ajdabiya.|$|E

500|$|The Australian cruiser {{continued}} on a <b>south-south-east</b> heading at low speed; observers aboard Kormoran doubted that Sydney was under control. Although disappearing {{over the horizon}} shortly later, the glow from the damaged, burning warship was consistently seen by the Germans until about 22:00, and sporadically until midnight. At {{some point during the}} night, Sydney lost buoyancy and sank: the bow was torn off as she submerged and descended almost vertically, {{while the rest of the}} hull glided [...] forward as she sank, hitting the bottom upright and stern first. Sydneys shells had crippled Kormoran; the German sailors abandoned ship after it was determined that below-deck fires could not be controlled before they reached the gun magazines or the mines in the cargo hold. The raider was scuttled at midnight, and sank slowly until the mine deck exploded half an hour later.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 June, I-24 and I-21 briefly bombarded Sydney and Newcastle. [...] Just after midnight, I-24 {{surfaced}} [...] <b>south-south-east</b> of Macquarie Lighthouse. The submarine's commander ordered the gun crew to target the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They fired 10 shells over a four-minute period; nine landed in the Eastern Suburbs and one landed in water. I-24 then crash dived to prevent successful retaliation by coastal artillery batteries. Only one shell detonated, and the only injuries inflicted were cuts and fractures from falling bricks or broken glass when the unexploded shells hit buildings. A United States Army Air Forces pilot, 1st Lieutenant George Cantello, based at Bankstown Airport was ordered into the air to retaliate, but was killed when engine failure caused his Airacobra to crash in a paddock at Hammondville. In 1988, following efforts by residents and the US Consulate in Sydney, the City of Bankstown established a memorial park in his honour.|$|E
500|$|The Whitebrook, {{formerly}} known as The Crown at Whitebrook, is a restaurant with rooms in Whitebrook, [...] <b>south-south-east</b> of Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales, near the River Wye and the border with England. The building is thought to date from the 17th century and by the 19th century it {{was used as a}} roadside inn. Its restaurant was run by Chef Patron James Sommerin until 2013; it gained a Michelin star in 2007. It contains eight double rooms and a [...] garden. On 7 March 2013, it closed because of financial difficulties; at the time it had the longest held Michelin star in Wales. Critics praised the food under Sommerin, but have criticised the difficulty in finding the restaurant. It re-opened in October 2013 under new chef and owner Chris Harrod, and regained the Michelin star in 2014. Harrod serves a menu using locally produced meat and vegetables along with foraged ingredients such as charlock, hedge bedstraw and pennywort.|$|E
500|$|This was successful, and the British {{lost sight}} of the Germans until 8:05, when [...] spotted smoke bearing west-north-west. Ten minutes later, she had closed the range enough to {{identify}} German torpedo boats, and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only [...] away. Inflexible opened fire at 8:20, followed by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers. New Zealand and Indomitable concentrated their fire on , and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage. Shortly after 8:30, the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans had poor visibility and were able to fire only a few rounds at them before turning away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8:40. After this, Beatty changed course to <b>south-south-east</b> and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 2:55 the next morning, when the order was given to reverse course and head home.|$|E
500|$|In March the regiment, {{still part}} of the brigade, was {{assigned}} to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division. Then on 23 April the regiment was ordered to move into the Sinai Desert to counter a Turkish attack against the British yeomanry at Katia. The following week the whole brigade relieved the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Romani. The defeated Turkish troops had withdrawn east around [...] to Salmana and the brigade was ordered to attack those positions. On 30 May the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved in advance of the brigade, circling around to get into a position to the <b>south-south-east</b> of Salmana. By 04:45 the regiment was ready and the attack started. They galloped towards the Turkish position on a mound, defended by around 200–300 men. Reaching the base of the mound, they dismounted and charged uphill with bayonets fixed. The defenders withdrew, pursued by the 3rd Squadron until Turkish reinforcements appeared and the squadron rejoined the regiment. Turkish casualties in the assault are unknown, but the regiment had only one man wounded.|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} of guerrillas {{to the south}} was reported by local tribesmen, leading a troop under Lieutenant Fanie Coetzee to investigate. A group of insurgents opened fire on Coetzee's troop from a high ridge, but {{he was able to}} move his men gradually around their flank to their rear, from where Petter-Bowyer says [...] "he gave the terrorists a serious walloping". 1 Commando, RLI was called in to assist with the search for the remaining cadres while the Portuguese placed some troops on the border. A 1 Commando troop discovered tracks of 16 men heading <b>south-south-east</b> on 1 August 1968 and another found tracks of three going north-west. The next day three insurgents were captured by police. Between 2 and 6 August the police killed one guerrilla and captured several more. By the morning of 7 August there remained 11 cadres at large, but after no progress was made over the following days the operation was closed down on 12 August, the JOC resolving that the outstanding guerrillas had most probably returned to Zambia. Over the next month three more bodies were found and one captured, leaving seven unaccounted for. Around the same time the RAR defeated a third ZIPRA group of 25 men in Operation Mansion, killing six and capturing 18, as well as 14 ZANLA cadres, of whom four were killed and 10 arrested during Operation Gravel.|$|E
