40|$|We have {{measured}} {{domain wall}} magnetoresistance {{in a single}} lithographically constrained domain wall. An H-shaped Ni nano-bridge was fabricated by e-beam lithography with the two sides being single magnetic do- mains showing independent magnetic switching. The connection between the sides constraining the domain wall when the <b>sides</b> <b>line</b> up anti-parallel. The magneto-resistance curve clearly identifies the magnetic con- figurations that are expected from a spin valve-like structure. The value of the magneto-resistance at room temperature is around 0. 1 % or 0. 4 ­. This value is shown to be in agreement with a theoretical formulation based on spin accumulation. Micromagnetic simulations show {{it is possible to}} reduce the size of the domain wall further by shortening the length of the bridge...|$|E
40|$|A {{measure for}} the {{description}} of the chirality of triangles is introduced. The measure χM is zero for triangles with at least one mirror axe, i. e. equilateral or isosceles triangles, and positive or negative for scalane, i. e. left or right handed triangles, respectively. A triangle is a polygon with three vertices A, B,C connected by three <b>sides</b> (<b>line</b> segments) a, b, c. Figure 1 shows the definition of the symbols [1]. Note that A, B,C are labeled in a counter clock wise fashion, if we look from the top. It is a two dimensional object since 3 points define a two dimensional plane. Figure 1 : Triangle and the definition of the standard notation (From Ref. [1]). When we analyze the symmetry of triangles we find equilateral triangles with a = b = c, which have C 3 v symmetry, i. e. three fold rotational symmetry and 3 mirror axes. The isosceles triangles have two sides with equal length, and C 1 v symmetry, i. e. one fold rotational symmetry and 1 mirror axe. All other triangles, where a 6 = b 6 = c 6 = a are scalane and have no mirror symmetry. Since the concept of chirality and mirror symmetry may also be applied to two dimensional objects, scalane triangles are considered to be chiral. In two dimensions, the role of a mirror plane in three dimensional objects is taken by a mirror axis. 1 a...|$|E
40|$|In {{magnetic}} materials, {{domains of}} magnetic orientation in opposite direction are often alternated. The transition in orientation between these domains, the domain wall, is not abrupt but spatially extended. When a current is {{passed through the}} magnetic material, {{the resistance of the}} material is dependent on whether such domain wall exists, which in its turn depends on the external magnetic field. This magneto-resistance is larger for smaller domain walls. Although the domain wall width is in principle a materials parameter, by patterning the magnetic sample into certain nanostructures, it is possible to constrain the domain wall such that its width is smaller than its natural unconstrained width. We have measured domain wall magnetoresistance in a single lithographically constrained domain wall. An H-shaped Ni nanobridge was fabricated by either e-beam lithography or a combination of e-beam lithography and helium ion milling. The two sides of the device are both single magnetic domains showing independent magnetic switching. The connection between the sides constrains the domain wall when the <b>sides</b> <b>line</b> up antiparallel. The magnetoresistance curve clearly identifies the magnetic configurations that are expected from a spin-valve like structure. The room temperature domain wall measurements give a magneto-resistance ratio of 0. 1 % for the 94 nm and 0. 2 % for the 32 nm constriction. Although these values are in itself small, they are the first results on lithographically prepared single domain spin valves. The single-layered device might allow for easier fabrication and space savings for high dense storage applications as compared to giant magneto-resistance and tunneling magneto-resistance. Also, the research of spin-based logic devices will benefit from the physical understanding that follows from measurements of magneto-resistance devices without material interface...|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed steel wall frame {{systems are}} {{commonly}} made of lipped or unlipped (plain) C-section studs with Gypsum plasterboard lining {{and are used}} in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. However, the design of these wall frames does not utilise the strengthening effects of the plasterboard lining in carrying axial loads. An experimental study has shown that the strength of the studs in compression was increased significantly when they were lined with plasterboard on one or both sides. In order to fully understand the behaviour of one <b>side</b> <b>lined</b> steel wall frames, a detailed parametric study was undertaken using finite element analyses. A finite element model of one <b>side</b> <b>lined</b> wall frame was developed and validated using experimental results.
