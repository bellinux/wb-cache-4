40|$|Acute, low‐dose {{ultraviolet}} B radiation (UVR) alters cutaneous immunity at {{the local}} site as well as systemically. Within 2 – 3 days of UVR exposure, recipient mice lose their capacity to develop contact hypersensitivity (CH) when hapten is painted on unexposed skin. This loss correlates temporally with a functional deficit among dendritic antigen‐presenting cells within non‐draining lymph nodes and spleen. In the experiments described, the delayed <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> following acute, low‐dose UVR exposure {{was found to be}} eliminated with neutralizing anti‐interleukin‐ 10 (IL‐ 10) antibody. Intracutaneous injection of IL‐ 10 generated a deficiency of systemic immunity as well as a functional deficit among lymph node dendritic cells that was similar to that induced by UVR. The skin itself was found to be the source of the IL‐ 10 responsible for these defects, and epidermis (presumably keratinocytes) rather than mast cells was found to be the source of IL‐ 10 within UVR‐exposed skin. The potential relationships are discussed between the delayed systemic immune deficit created by acute, low‐dose UVR, and the systemic immune deficits caused by chronic, high‐dose UVR and by a single, high‐dose UVR exposure...|$|E

The disease is prevalent within a world-wide, more stubborn, which can be blinding fungal infection, it is often accompanied by corneal ulcers, purulent infection and impaired vision, severe corneal perforation can occur, endophthalmitis complications and even threatening the entire eye, causing blindness or loss of the affected eye, seriously affecting the health and quality of life of patients. In recent years, due to the plant corneal trauma, chronic ocular surface diseases, eye surgery and corneal transplants have increased. The broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids abuse and improper use of contact lenses, as well as A worker DS, diabetes, <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> disease and other immunocompromised populations also increase. It is resulting in the incidence of fungal keratitis, fungal keratitis significantly increased incidence of occult infection progresses rapidly, early diagnosis is difficult; ophthalmology less common antifungal agents, and pathogenic fungi resistant serious difficulties effective treatment. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to control the infection. Therefore, the master of fungal keratitis law etiological and epidemiological characteristics, understand the diagnosis and treatment of common fungal infection, early and accurate diagnosis of the disease, timely and effective treatment and prognosis of recovery is important...|$|E
40|$|We used a {{panel of}} {{different}} phenotypic tests for the identification of C. dubliniensis and for the discrimination between C. albicans from C. dubliniensis. The cultivation on Staibagar, the growth test at 45 °C and the assimilation test API® ID 32 C were the most sensitive assays. The cultivation on Staibagar had a test sensitivity and specificity which was comparable to the molecular reference method, i. e. AP-PCR. The growth test for the differentiation between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis should always be performed at 45 °C and not at 42 °C. Several cultivation methods should be performed {{in order to reach}} an adequate accuracy of the results. Two of the 212 analysed C. dubliniensis isolates had an API®-code, which was typical for C. dubliniensis but had not been published before (7042. 1000. 15 und 7142. 1400. 11). The assimilation of the carbohydrates Trehalose, Methyl-αD-Glukopyranoside and Xylose were the best for the differentiation between C. dubliniensis und C. albicans. For that aim Lactate is not appropriate. We demonstrated that some isolates of C. dubliniensis can assimilate Methyl-αD-Glukopyranosid und Xylose. 6. 2 Clinical relevance of C. dubliniensis C. dubliniensis had the potential to cause oropharyngeal disease in HIV-infected patients. Colonisation with C. dubliniensis only caused disease in HIV-infected patients. In all cases the patients had either been treated prophylactic or therapeutic with Fluconazole. C. dubliniensis had most frequently been isolated in mixed culture with C. glabrata and not with C. albicans as published by others. An oropharyngeal candidosis (OPC) was observed in a mean concentration of C. dubliniensis of 104 colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL), which corresponds to the published values for a pathologic concentration of C. albicans. However, C. dubliniensis was also able to cause a disease in a considerable lower concentration (102 cfu/mL) in HIV-infected individuals. An OPC that was caused by C. dubliniensis was observed to appear with a mean viral load of 125. 000 copies/mL. In the literature a viral load of 36. 000 cop/mL is considered the level above which OPC in HIV-infected patients is predicted. This difference favours the thesis that C. dubliniensis is a less virulent pathogen than C. albicans. Concerning the immunosuppression 200 CD 4 cells/µL is considered the level at which OPC due to C. albicans infection is predicted, which could be confirmed for C. dubliniensis in this work. The apperance of OPC due to C. dubliniensis did not show any significant difference between the patients that recieved HIV treatment with Protease Inhibitors and those patients that were not treated with Protease Inhibitors. The protective effect of those drugs against infections caused by C. albicans could not be confirmed for C. dubliniensis. 6. 3 Genotyping of C. dubliniensis with the probe Cd 25 All isolates had a very close genetic relationship and belonged most likely to the published Cd 25 group I. Most of the different clones appeared individually in one patient. Infrequently, two patients also shared one clone, but an exchange of C. dubliniensis clones among sexual partners could not be detected. Closely related genotypes were observed most frequently in sequential C. dubliniensis isolates of HIV-positive patients. Second frequently the same isotype persisted in the course of disease. In rare cases one clone was replaced by another not releated one. The close relationship among the sequential isolates was most likely due to progressive microevolution. We could demonstrate that one HIV-infected individuum could be conloniezed at the same time with different C. dubliniensis isolates which were closely related as well as with C. dubliniensis isolates that showed a a more distant relationship only. When the isolates were genotyped with the Cd 25 probe we could not observe any genetic differences between i) C. dubliniensis isolates of patients with low (36. 000 copies/mL) viral load, and ii) C. dubliniensis isolates of patients with sufficient (CD 4 cell count > 200 /µL) and reduced (CD 4 cell count < 200 /µL) immune status. The C. dubliniensis clones of the patients that were HIV-negative and from those who suffered from OPC had a greater genetic diversity as the clones from the HIV-positive patients and the patients who were colonized asymptomatically with C. dubliniensis respectively. However, a distinct genetic group was neither formed by the clones of the patients with OPC nor by the clones of the HIV-negative patients. We did not find any evidence for a genetic subpopulation of C. dubliniensis (according to the Cd 25 genotype) that appeares particulary in patients with HIV, especially in patients with high viral load and advanced immunosuppression. Also the C. dubliniensis isolates that caused disease did not differ from those that were associated with asymptomatic colonization. An OPC due to C. dubliniensis seems to be associated to the local immune deficiency in the oral cavity or the <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> than to the occurence of a particular virulent C. dubliniensis strain. The Cd 25 fingerprint profile may possibly not be sufficient to discriminate between those C. dubliniensis genotypes. We also showed that resistent C. dubliniensis strains can be selected by Fluconazole treatment in vivo. Most of the C. dubliniensis isolates were sensitive for Fluconazole and Itraconazole despite Fluconazole exposition. We observed a cross-resistance between Fluconazole and Itraconazole. C. dubliniensis isolates developed resistance against Itraconazole more frequently than against Fluconazole, also without prior antimycotic selection pressure. The treatment of choice for C. dubliniensis caused infections is rather Fluconazole than Itraconazole. Reduced sensivity for Itraconazole was accompanied by a particular C. dubliniensis genotype in 21 %. In most of the cases (79 %) no particular Cd 25 genotype was detected in the azole resistant isolates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Systemic</b> {{and local}} <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{associated}} with cancer, {{and the role of}} M 2 tumor-associated macrophages in this phenomenon is well recognized. However, the immune status of macrophages from peripheral compartments in tumor hosts is unclear. Peritoneal macrophages (PEM) are derived from circulating monocytes and recruited to the peritoneal cavity where they differentiate into macrophages. We have previously shown that PEMs from mice bearing D 1 -DMBA- 3 mammary tumors (T-PEM) are deficient in inflammatory functions and that this impairment {{is associated with}} diminished expression of transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein. We now provide evidence that T-PEMs display neither M 1 nor M 2 phenotypes, yet exhibit deficiencies in the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and various proinflammatory signaling pathways. Moreover, due to nuclear factor kappaB down-regulation, increased apoptosis was observed in T-PEMs. We report {{for the first time that}} macrophage depletion is associated with increased macrophage progenitors in bone marrow. Furthermore, T-PEMs have a lower expression of macrophage differentiation markers F 4 / 80, CD 68, CD 115, and CD 11 b, whereas Gr- 1 is up-regulated. Our results suggest that T-PEMs are less differentiated and represent a newly derived population from blood monocytes. Lastly, we show that transforming growth factor-beta and prostaglandin E(2), two immunosuppressive tumor-derived factors, may be involved in this phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSerratia marcescens is an entomopathogenic {{bacterium}} that opportunistically infects a {{wide range}} of hosts, including humans. In a model of septic injury, if directly introduced into the body cavity of Drosophila, this pathogen is insensitive to the host's <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> response and kills flies in a day. We find that S. marcescens resistance to the Drosophila <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> (imd) -mediated humoral response requires the bacterial lipopolysaccharide O-antigen. If ingested by Drosophila, bacteria cross the gut and penetrate the body cavity. During this passage, the bacteria can be observed within the cells of the intestinal epithelium. In such an oral infection model, the flies succumb to infection only after 6 days. We demonstrate that two complementary host defense mechanisms act together against such food-borne infection: an antimicrobial response in the intestine that is regulated by the imd pathway and phagocytosis by hemocytes of bacteria that have escaped into the hemolymph. Interestingly, bacteria present in the hemolymph elicit a <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> response only when phagocytosis is blocked. Our observations support a model wherein peptidoglycan fragments released during bacterial growth activate the imd pathway and do not back a proposed role for phagocytosis in the immune activation of the fat body. Thanks to the genetic tools available in both host and pathogen, the molecular dissection of the interactions between S. marcescens and Drosophila will provide a useful paradigm for deciphering intestinal pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Cough is {{the single}} most common reason for primary care {{physician}} visits and, when chronic, a frequent indication for specialist referrals. In children, a chronic cough (> 4 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. One common cause of childhood chronic cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), especially in children aged < 6 years. PBB is characterized by a chronic wet or productive cough without signs of an alternative cause and responds to 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Most children with PBB are unable to expectorate sputum. If bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are performed, evidence of bronchitis and purulent endobronchial secretions are seen. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens typically reveal marked neutrophil infiltration and culture large numbers of respiratory bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae. Although regarded as having a good prognosis, recurrences are common and if these are frequent or do not respond to antibiotic treatments of up to 4 -weeks duration, the child should be investigated for other causes of chronic wet cough, such as bronchiectasis. The contribution of airway malacia and pathobiologic mechanisms of PBB remain uncertain and, other than reduced alveolar phagocytosis, evidence of <b>systemic,</b> or local <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> is lacking. Instead, pulmonary defenses show activated innate immunity and increased gene expression of the interleukin- 1 ß signalling pathway. Whether these changes in local inflammatory responses are cause or effect remains to be determined. It is likely that PBB and bronchiectasis are at the opposite ends of the same disease spectrum, so children with chronic wet cough require close monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore and understand nurses&# 039; experiences of managing pain for persons living with human immune virus/ acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndrome receiving palliative care at home in Botswana. Background: Community palliative and hospice care in Africa and Botswana were developed for persons with end-stage acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndrome and other terminal illnesses being cared for at home. As antiretro viral therapies extend the lives of persons living with human <b>immune</b> virus/acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndromes, there is an increase in the chronic conditions associated with human <b>immune</b> virus/acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndrome. Despite a strong demand for care of persons living with human <b>immune</b> virus/acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndromes and other chronic illnesses, little is known about Botswanan community nurses&# 039; capacity to manage community-based end-of-life care for persons living with human <b>immune</b> virus/acquired <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> syndromes.

40|$|Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with {{or without}} nasal polyps is a chronic {{inflammatory}} condition involving the mucosa of the upper airways. It constitutes a major health problem and often involves {{a significant impact on}} quality of life. Despite optimal medical and surgical treatment CRS can still persist. Objective: The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of humoral <b>immune</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in refractory CRS patients. The second goal was to examine the effect of Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency on the development and persistency of CRS. Patients and methods: Refractory CRS patients {{with or without}} nasal polyps who were referred to the ENT-department of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam between 2004 and 2008 were retrospectively identified. The humoral immune status was evaluated. The prevalence of the following immune-deficiencies were analysed: MBL, alternative and classical complement activation pathway, IgA, total IgG and IgG 1 -IgG 4. compare the prevalence of MBL deficiency in CRS patients with a healthy control group. Additionally, auto-antibodies indicating systemic diseases involved in sinus pathology were analyzed. Results: Of the 150 CRS patients, 75 (50 %) had laboratory evidence of a humoral <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency.</b> There was no significant difference in the prevalence of humoral <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> between CRS patients with or without nasal polyps. The prevalence of MBL deficiency in CRS patients did not differ from the healthy control group. Conclusion: Half of the refractory CRS patients have at least one humoral <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency.</b> It is important to identify subtle <b>immune</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in an early stage of CRS. Early detection of an <b>immune</b> <b>deficiency</b> may influence the outcome of treatment. This study could not demonstrate the value of solitary MBL deficiency.

40|$|Metastatic {{disease in}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is a cause of {{increasing}} mortality amongst cancer patients. As with other types of cancer, cells of the <b>systemic</b> <b>immune</b> system play a range of important roles in the development of metastatic lesions in the CNS, both repressing and promoting tumour growth. Recent advances in immunotherapy have changed the emphasis in cancer treatment away from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy for certain tumour types.
