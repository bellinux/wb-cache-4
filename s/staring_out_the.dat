500|$|Music writers Covach and Boone {{describe}} the riff as blues-derived, {{which uses a}} minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common blues scale). [...] The song follows a blues chord progression (I–IV–I) during the first eight bars. [...] Brown {{had a difficult time}} writing lyrics that fit the riff. [...] After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist Pete Brown was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. [...] Slowly, he started to write [...] "It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes", which is used in the first verse. [...] Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title. [...] It consists of eight-bar sections using three chords, when the key shifts to the V chord (I = V): ...|$|E
60|$|Having walked {{about eight}} miles since we struck the beach, {{and passed the}} {{boundary}} between Wellfleet and Truro, a stone post in the sand,--for even this sand comes {{under the jurisdiction of}} one town or another,--we turned inland over barren hills and valleys, whither the sea, for some reason, did not follow us, and, tracing up a Hollow, discovered two or three sober-looking houses within half a mile, uncommonly near the eastern coast. Their garrets were apparently so full of chambers, that their roofs could hardly lie down straight, and we did not doubt that there was room for us there. Houses near the sea are generally low and broad. These were a story and a half high; but if you merely counted the windows in their gable-ends, you would think that there were many stories more, or, at any rate, that the half-story was the only one thought worthy of being illustrated. The great number of windows in the ends of the houses, and their irregularity in size and position, here and elsewhere on the Cape, struck us agreeably,--as if each of the various occupants who had their cunabula behind had punched a hole where his necessities required it, and, according to his size and stature, without regard to outside effect. There were windows for the grown folks, and windows for the children,--three or four apiece; as a certain man had a large hole cut in his barn-door for the cat, and another smaller one for the kitten. Sometimes they were so low under the eaves that I thought they must have perforated the plate beam for another apartment, and I noticed some which were triangular, to fit that part more exactly. The ends of the houses had thus as many muzzles as a revolver, and, if the inhabitants have the same habit of <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> windows that some of our neighbors have, a traveller must stand a small chance with them.|$|E

"It {{brought back}} the memory of sitting in a small apartment, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window at one o'clock in the morning, {{watching}} the rain come down," [...] wrote Bronson in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits.

50|$|The architect, {{holding the}} plans, is <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{window at the}} {{unfinished}} house, waiting patiently for sufficient funds to allow work to restart. Some commentators have identified him as a lawyer along with Silvertongue here for the bargaining, stating that his facial features and posture indicate his amazed disgust at what even he can tell is hideous.|$|E
50|$|Corrinado {{sits alone}} in his prison cell, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> tiny barred window, over the jagged cliffs, {{and out to the}} sea beyond.

5000|$|... "A Winter's Tale" [...] {{is a song}} by Queen, {{from the}} album Made in Heaven, {{released}} in 1995 after Freddie Mercury's death in 1991. It was written after the Innuendo sessions, inspired as Mercury was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> windows of his hospital, at Lake Geneva. The song has a psychedelic, dreamy feel, and describes what Mercury saw outside the windows.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, {{after seeing}} Robin on Channel 4, British band Radiohead {{approached}} Magnus Carlsson {{to make a}} video for their song [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] with Robin in it.

5000|$|The {{scene where}} Eric Cartman {{is on the}} bus writing lyrics on {{the palm of his}} hand is a {{reference}} to American rapper Eminem's semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile.

5000|$|The deputy sees {{a flying}} saucer land while <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of the sheriff's office, and sees the two {{occupants}} approach.

50|$|The young trophy wife of Manilla Trane, known {{throughout}} town as a terrific chef. She earned her nickname {{because of her}} height {{as well as the}} size of her hair, which, according to the townspeople, looked as if were held up by branches. Lack of attention from her husband turned her into an insomniac, and she was often seen late at night <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of the high tower of Manilla's fortress.|$|E
50|$|Then the Lille police arrest Joseph. When Pharaon gets to {{the police}} station, he finds him beaten up and weeping. Being a man of deep feeling, he comforts him.

60|$|The {{man made}} no reply, but {{went over to}} <b>the</b> window, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> yard. There was {{something}} vaguely ominous in his attitude. The rector watched him a moment, {{and then turned to}} the mother.|$|R
50|$|At the home, Johan {{is sitting}} in a {{wheelchair}} <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, mumbling for himself about his past to an animated flashback. Johan grew up on the countryside, when the grass was always green. His father was strong, his mother liked to bake. He was also harassed by a boy named Evert, {{while at the same time}} being in love with Evert's cute sister. At his confirmation, Evert tackled him so that all the girls' dresses were ruined by the sacramental wine. This made Evert's sister laugh at him, and with his heart broken he decided to run away to Stockholm.|$|E

Only all is not silent, not entirely, there is the sound of a drip (evocative of the remark Hamm makes in Endgame: [...] "There is {{something}} dripping in my head"); this agitates Henry greatly, and he breaks off his story there for a second.|$|E
50|$|Austin and Julie {{have begun}} a relationship. Susan is {{concerned}} and gets Karl’s help to set limits for Austin and Julie but Karl {{is much more}} concerned with Susan’s relationship with Ian, and decides not to help. Austin and Julie both {{end up on the}} back of Austin’s motorcycle much to Susan’s dismay. Later, Susan is <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window when Julie asks her mother why, after sixteen years of good judgment on Julie's part, she can't trust her now with Austin. Susan tells her that relationships {{have nothing to do with}} good judgment and that anyone can still get hurt. After Susan leaves, Julie lifts the curtain where Susan had been standing to see that she had been staring wistfully at Edie and Mike kissing passionately.|$|E
60|$|She {{went and}} stood at <b>the</b> further window, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> rain. For a long time we were {{absolutely}} still. The wind and rain came in little gusts upon the pane. She turned to me abruptly.|$|R
