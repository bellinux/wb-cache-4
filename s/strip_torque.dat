It {{is likely that the}} tactile feedback that surgeons rely on is based on localized tissue yielding, which may predispose the screw-bone interface to failure. A limited number of studies have investigated the ratio between clinical tightening <b>torque</b> and <b>stripping</b> <b>torque.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure, for the first time, the ratio between yield torque (T yield) and <b>stripping</b> <b>torque</b> (T max) during screw insertion into the cancellous bone and to compare these torques with clinical levels of tightening reported in the literature. Additionally, a rotational limit was investigated as a potential end point for screw insertion in cancellous bone. METHODS: A 6. 5 -mm outer diameter commercial cancellous bone screw was inserted into human femoral head specimens (n = 89). Screws were inserted to failure, while recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head, and rotation angle. RESULTS: The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: T yield, T max, T yield/T max, slope, T plateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of T yield/T max and rotation angle was 85. 45...|$|R

Results: The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: Tyield, Tmax, Tyield/Tmax, slope, Tplateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of Tyield/Tmax and rotation angle was 85. 45 % and 96. 5 degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variation was greatest for the rotation angle compared with the ratio of Tyield/Tmax (0. 37 vs. 0. 12). Conclusions: The detection of yield may be a more precise method than the rotation angle in cancellous bone; however, bone–screw constructs that exhibit a Tyield close to Tmax may be more susceptible to stripping during insertion. Future work can identify factors that influence the ratio of Tyield/Tmax may help to reduce the incidence of screw stripping. Melissa K. Ryan, Aaron A. Mohtar, John J. Costi and Karen J.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of acoustic emission during orthopaedic screw fixation was performed using polyurethane foam as the bone-simulating material. Three sets of screws, a dynamic hip screw, a small fragment screw {{and a large}} fragment screw, were investigated, monitoring acoustic-emission activity during the screw tightening. In some specimens, screws were deliberately overtightened in order to investigate the feasibility of detecting the <b>stripping</b> <b>torque</b> in advance. One set of data was supported by load cell measurements to directly measure the axial load through the screw. Data showed that acoustic emission can give good indications of impending screw stripping; such indications are not available to the surgeon at {{the current state of}} the art using traditional torque measuring devices, and current practice relies on the surgeon’s experience alone. The results suggest that acoustic emission may have the potential to prevent screw overtightening and bone tissue damage, eliminating one of the commonest sources of human error in such scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Screws {{are widely}} used for the {{internal}} fixation of fractures, either alone or with plates. Constant improvement in design and in operative techniques has led to increased holding power, which now exceeds the shear strength of bone. In fact, if one tries to pull out a freshly inserted screw, the bone threads do not strip but the screw pulls out a small cone-shaped button of compact bone (Bechtol 1971). If one considers only the result of such an immediate test, the question of bone formation around the screws {{would seem to be}} of no interest, as a further increase in holding power would have no practical importance. In cases of accidental stripping of screws, however, bone healing certainly is a matter of considerable importance, as shown by Bechtol (1959). In fact, he found that during the first four weeks after insertion of a screw the holding power exceeded the initial <b>stripping</b> <b>torque,</b> though it should be carefully noted that these screws, once in place, were not subjected to any mechanical forces. Though the enormous holding power of screws in compact bone generally persists during the course offracture healing, clinical experience shows that a plate and its screws are sometimes avulsed from bone. In such cases no bone can be detected around the screws. Moreover...|$|R

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the <b>stripping</b> <b>torque...</b>|$|R

Licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] analysis of bone is an innovative technique that uses sequential image data to analyze bone mechanics under a given loading regime. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel device capable of performing step-wise screw insertion into excised bone specimens, within the microCT environment, whilst simultaneously recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head and rotation angle. The system is computer controlled and screw insertion is performed in incremental steps of insertion torque. A series of screw insertion tests to failure were performed (n= 21) to establish a relationship between the torque at head contact and <b>stripping</b> <b>torque</b> (R 2 = 0. 89). The test-device was then used to perform step-wise screw insertion, stopping at intervals of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % between screw head contact and screw stripping. Image data-sets were acquired at each of these time-points as well as at head contact and post-failure. Examination of the image data revealed the trabecular deformation as a result of increased insertion torque was restricted to within 1 mm of the outer diameter of the screw thread. Minimal deformation occurred prior to the step between the 80 % time-point and post-failure. The device presented has allowed, for the first time, visualization of the micro-mechanical response in the peri-implant bone with increased tightening torque. Further testing on more samples is expected to increase our understanding of the effects of increased tightening torque at the micro-structural level, and the failure mechanisms of trabeculae...|$|R
40|$|Surgeons {{generally}} use subjective feel {{to tighten}} bone screws {{as much as}} possible without stripping the threads; however, subsequent fixation failures are common, particularly in osteoporotic bone. We hypothesise that if the preload generated in reduced bone quality and it’s dissipation over time was better understood, then some of these failures could be avoided through the use of more appropriate fastening torques or a different number of screws. This ongoing study aims to develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the preload generated for different bone densities and cortical thicknesses. To date, experimental tests (n= 10) were conducted using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the bone-implant pressure (LLW Prescale Fuji Film) and surface strains (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T.) for a range of tightening torques. The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. An axisymmetric finite element model was developed based on the experimental tests (Ansys 15. 0). Our early simulations predicted the equivalent strain {{at the edge of the}} implant-bone contact region to be 0. 062 %, which was within the range of the experimentally observed values (0. 04 - 0. 07 %). The predicted bone-implant pressure also compared favorably with a pressure varying between 2. 5 and 0 MPa. Using an experimentally derived relationship between fastening torque and bone-implant pressure, the model has the potential to predict preload for any bone quality. Our intention is to develop this model, in combination with established formulas to calculate <b>stripping</b> <b>torque,</b> into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate screw fastening torques for different bone qualities...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} many endosseous {{implants}} in orthopaedic and dental applications {{depends on the}} surface characteristics, as they affect osseous integration. Previous investigations indicated that a novel large-grit sand-blasted and acid-etched (SLA) titanium (denoted as SLAffinity-Ti) implant had better bone integration {{than that of a}} comparably shaped implant with a plasma-sprayed titanium surface. The purpose of the present investigation was to create a SLAffinity surface on pedicle screws and trauma screws and to compare it with the surfaces of a sand-blasted-only implant and commercial implants in terms of bone integration. The cortical bone and spine of twelve minipigs were implanted with 3 and 4 implants, respectively, and the bone integration was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), mechanical tests (pull-out strength and <b>stripping</b> <b>torque),</b> and histological analysis (toluidine blue and hematoxylin and eosin staining) one and three months after implantation. The micro-CT images showed that the gap between the bone and implant was consistently higher in the sand-blasted-only and commercial groups compared to that in the SLAffinity group 1 and 3 months after implantation. Moreover, the bone volume of implant inserted into bone and the percentage of implant inside bone tissue were greater in the SLAffinity screws 1 and 3 months after implantation, as compared to the sand-blasted and commercial screws. In the mechanical tests, the removal torque and pull-out strength (p < 0. 05) were higher in the SLAffinity group at 1 and 3 months. The histological results were consistent with mechanical testing, showing that the SLAffinity group had the most mineralized matrix, the most bone formation around the screws, and the most bone cells in bone tissue. These findings indicate that a SLAffinity surface can effectively enhance the holding strength and integration of pedicle screws and cortical screws, promoting early healing and improving outcomes, compared to sand-blasted-only and commercial implants...|$|R
