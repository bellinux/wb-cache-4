After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbols,</b> thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E

25|$|Semiotics {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within semiotics that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbols</b> or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E

30|$|Within {{the theory}} of action, {{cultural}} patterns constitute the basic forms that shape the meaning of action in terms of motivation and decision making. The modes of motivational orientation can be classified as cognitive, cathectic (or expressive, emotional bonding between actors or between actors and norms), and evaluative orientations. Evaluative orientations are {{a combination of the}} first and the second type of motivational orientation. Cognitive orientations are organised in <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> ideas or beliefs. Cathectic orientations are organised in <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> expressive (emotional) <b>symbols,</b> and evaluative orientations consist <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> value-orientations. It is the evaluative dimension which introduces reflections about consequences of actions and invokes value standards. <b>Systems</b> <b>of</b> cognitive <b>symbols</b> (beliefs) organise ways <b>of</b> cognising, <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> expressive <b>symbols</b> organise ways <b>of</b> cathecting, and <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> value <b>symbols</b> organise ways <b>of</b> evaluating. Ways of evaluating are necessary in order to resolve conflicts between divergent beliefs (cognitions) or divergent wants (cathexes) of individuals in a concrete situation.|$|R

2500|$|Minspeak is an {{encoding}} {{system based}} on the idea of sequencing picture symbols. This system is governed by a specific set of rules and uses iconic encoding, indicating {{that there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between a symbol and its meaning. [...] As the symbols typically contain a variety of details, each symbol may be associated with multiple meanings. The meaning is defined by combining pictures in short sequences, and these sequences follow patterns. [...] For example, the rainbow icon combines with other icons to denote colors, such as [...] "rainbow" [...] and [...] "apple" [...] combining to signify the word [...] "red." [...] Therefore, Minspeak operates as a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbols,</b> and not as a set of symbols, because it allows for the creation of [...] "novel" [...] concepts not explicitly expressed by each symbol, but rather by the combination of existing symbols. For example, a Minspeak symbol depicting a dog holding a newspaper can also represent the concepts [...] "dog", [...] "pet" [...] and [...] "bring/get", depending on the other symbols with which it is combined. [...] Minspeak provides a means of coding language whereby specific combinations of symbols generate specific messages.|$|E

[...] From his point of view, {{none of the above}} principles are rules; they are formal laws, that is, arbitrarily chosen relations to which the algebraic symbols must be subject. He does not mention the law, which had already been pointed out by Gregory, namely, [...] and to which was afterwards given the name Law of association. If the commutative law fails, the associative may hold good; but not vice versa. It is an unfortunate thing for the symbolist or formalist that in universal arithmetic [...] is not equal to for then the commutative law would have full scope. Why does he not give it full scope? Because the foundations of algebra are, after all, real not formal, material not symbolic. To the formalists the index operations are exceedingly refractory, in consequence of which some take no account of them, but relegate them to applied mathematics. To give an inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey is an impossible task, and reminds one not a little of the task of those philosophers who attempt to give an inventory of the a priori knowledge of the mind.|$|E

They were governmental appliances in another way: representing as they did the worship of the god, the triumphs of the god-king, the submission of his subjects, and the punishment of the rebellious. Further, they were governmental, as being the products of an art reverenced by the people as a sacred mystery. From the habitual use of this pictorial representation there grew up the but-slightly-modified practice of picture-writing--a practice which was found still extant among North American peoples at the time they were discovered.

At the same time we find that for the expression of proper names, which could not be otherwise conveyed, signs having phonetic values were employed; and though it is alleged that the Egyptians never achieved complete alphabetic writing, yet it can scarcely be doubted that these phonetic symbols, occasionally used in aid of their ideographic ones, were the germs of an alphabetic system. Once having become separate from hieroglyphics, alphabetic writing itself underwent numerous differentiations--multiplied alphabets were produced; between most of which, however, more or less connection can still be traced. And in each civilized nation there has now grown up, for the representation of one set of sounds, several sets of written signs used for distinct purposes.
