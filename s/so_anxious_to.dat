25|$|Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson's sweet-natured wife. Though happily married, {{they are}} <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> avoid hurting each other's {{feelings}} that they rarely {{tell each other}} what they really think. They have a son, Arthur Carlson, Jr., whom they've sent off to military school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|E
25|$|According to Winkler's {{commentary}} on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses {{for the role of}} Linda when Ashley Judd's agent advised him she was interested in the part. Winkler was certain her salary demand would exceed that allowed by the budget, but the actress was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> portray Linda she was willing to lower her usual asking price. Judd is twenty years younger than Kline, although the composer's wife was eight years older than he.|$|E
25|$|In {{his three}} years in Gotha, he was twice offered positions, in Stuttgart and at Oxford University; he {{declined}} both. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, when the St. Sebaldus Church organist Georg Caspar Wecker (and his possible former teacher) died on 20 April 1695, the city authorities were <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> appoint Pachelbel (then a famous Nuremberger) to the position that they officially invited him to assume it without holding the usual job examination or inviting applications from prominent organists from lesser churches. He accepted, was released from Gotha in 1695, and arrived in Nuremberg in summer, with the city council paying his per diem expenses.|$|E

25|$|Roberts' {{own account}} {{mentions}} neither Demerara nor the slave revolt but his palpable aversion to slavery colors his negotiating stance, where subjects act as slaves to the king). By 1827, nearly impoverished by depredations of French and Spanish privateers on his {{ships in the}} West Indies, he chartered the Mary Ann to trade in the Indian Ocean. Roberts arrived in the port of Zanzibar in October 1827, and the next year, had an audience with the newly arrived Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> counterbalance British influence that he asked Roberts to escort some vessels to the United States to petition for trade; Roberts promised to bring the matter up with his Government. Upon returning, he wrote U.S. Senator Levi Woodbury, a personal friend, of the aggravations endured by American shipping, that might be alleviated by negotiating commercial treaties.|$|E
500|$|Joyce {{tested the}} sea-ice on 18 April {{and found it}} firm, but the {{following}} day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I fail to understand how these people are <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> {{do a good job}} as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as {{it was meant to be}} for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E

500|$|Ross and O'Reilly {{soon came}} to the usual {{division}} of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. [...] This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked {{on a tour of}} the mints) [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> have your mind at ease about the office here [...] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. [...] They are so much more direct and up to date than letters... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." [...] Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E
500|$|In July 1993, Weinberg had {{a chance}} {{sidewalk}} meeting outside Carnegie Deli with newly selected Late Night host Conan O'Brien, where Weinberg spoke about his ideas for music on the show. O'Brien promised Weinberg an audition. Within a few short days Weinberg put together The Max Weinberg 7, recruiting musicians he had worked with during his career including on the Killer Joe project, starting with guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino. Weinberg decided a muscular, drums-driven jump blues vibe, partly derived from the Killer Joe sound, is what he would use {{as a starting point}} for the group's sound. At the early August audition, the outfit impressed O'Brien with their ability to play not just rock but also rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, pop, and big band swing; Weinberg was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> land the job that he threw up afterward. After a final meeting with executive producer Lorne Michaels they were hired as the house band. The band performed on the show every night since its premiere on September 13, 1993. O'Brien later said of the Weinberg choice, [...] "The energy and enthusiasm of his music coincided with the show I wanted to do. Plus, his tan offset my ghostly complexion." [...] Weinberg held the title of music director on the show, while Vivino did most of the arranging. Of his career rebound, Weinberg said simply: [...] "I grabbed the brass ring twice." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1870s, Bean was {{operating}} a saloon in Beanville.

A store owner in Beanville [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> have this unscrupulous character out of the neighborhood" [...] that she bought all of Bean's possessions for $900 {{so that he could}} leave San Antonio. At the time, Bean and his wife were separated. Bean left his children with friends as he prepared to go west.|$|E
2500|$|Brownson was {{summed up}} by poet and critic James Russell Lowell in his satirical A Fable for Critics as someone trying to bite off {{more than he could}} chew: [...] "his mouth very full with {{attempting}} to gulp a Gregorian bull". Edgar Allan Poe refers to Brownson in his Autography series, calling him [...] "an extraordinary man," [...] though he [...] "has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> impress upon his readers." [...] He is also mentioned in Poe's story [...] "Mesmeric Revelation," [...] referring to Brownson's 1840 novel Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted.

2500|$|Robinson {{learned his}} cricket at his Denaby club {{and was sent}} to Bramall Lane, Sheffield, for George Hirst to assess. [...] He began as a {{promising}} wicketkeeper batsman but – [...] "There was no room to keep wicket <b>so,</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> impress Mr Hirst, I bowled a few quick leg-breaks and googlies." [...] He was invited to the famous [...] "winter shed" [...] at Headingley and told, in true Yorkshire fashion, to forget the leg breaks and concentrate on off spin. [...] Yorkshire had Hedley Verity to spin the ball away from the bat and needed an off spinner as variation as the great George Macaulay was coming {{to the end of}} his career.|$|E

[...] (Anthony Connor, [...] "Voices from Cooperstown" [...] (1982), p.37) [...] Player-manager Ty Cobb was reportedly so impressed with Gehringer that he asked club owner Frank Navin to sign Gehringer to a contract on the spot.

2500|$|In 1911, Carnegie {{became a}} {{sympathetic}} benefactor to George Ellery Hale, {{who was trying}} to build the [...] Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, and donated an additional ten million dollars to the Carnegie Institution with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope: [...] "I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> hear the expected results from it. I should like to be satisfied before I depart, {{that we are going to}} repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens."

2500|$|His profligacy in {{employing}} {{such tactics}} {{may have led}} to additional umpires being assigned to monitor the basepaths", only 4 of the 23 plays involved McGraw blocking runners; most were when he was running the bases. [...] To show how overblown the notion that McGraw blocked many runners is, at least overtly, after seeing the 5’7", 155-pound McGraw try to block Cleveland's Buck Ewing from third base, and Ewing [...] "went into him with such force that he knocked McGraw off his feet", John B. Foster of the Cleveland Leader wrote, [...] "McGraw is rather a light youngster to be <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> block men off the bases.

2500|$|The {{first known}} melody {{written for the}} song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was {{published}} in The Congregationalist. By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written. A hymn tune composed by Samuel A. Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to {{him while he was}} on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City, after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. Supposedly, he was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn [...] "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work [...] "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled [...] "America the Beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|Wesley is {{introduced}} in Angel having been {{fired from the}} Watcher's Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character [...] "a little shake". He elaborates, When he arrived in Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He {{was living in the}} ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less sure of himself all the time. [...] Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, [...] "Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [...] was struggling with his demon nature, he had seen a lot more of the world in the same way Angel had." [...] Nonetheless Denisof believes that in this period, his character [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> be a tough rogue demon hunter but was clearly a kind of soft puppy dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|By May 19, rumors {{were still}} being spread. Many people {{believed}} that the slayer had been caught. Some of them believed he was being held at the Bowie County Jail surrounded by Texas Rangers with submachine guns on their knees. Others believed he was flown to an out-of-town jail. The Gazette and News offices were drowned with phone calls, both local and long distance, inquiring about the apprehension of the killer. [...] "Newspapers Will Tell Public If Killer Is Caught", read one of the sub-headlines of the May 19th edition of Texarkana Gazette. Sheriff Presley declared that innocent people were being accused of being the Phantom and asked the residents to show more consideration for their fellow citizens. Presley stated, [...] "These rumors positively are not true. We can understand why the people believe them. All of us are tense and are hopeful that at any hour officers will announce they have the killer in custody. The people must not become <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> rid themselves of the killer, however, that they brand innocent persons as the murderer and believe unfounded stories.
