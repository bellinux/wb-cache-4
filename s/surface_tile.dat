The robot was initially using a gait evolved {{to work on a}} smooth <b>surface</b> (<b>tile).</b> When tested on a rough surface (carpet) the learned gait was found to be inappropriate because the legs were causing drag as they repositioned. An efficient move to reposition on the smooth surface did not work on the rough surface. Anytime Learning with Fitness Biasing was applied to the continued evolution of the individual leg cycles as the simulated robot moved from an area of smooth to rough terrain. An actual robot was used to test the results. Following training using fitness biasing, the robot’s gait was more appropriate for a rough surface as it learned to raise its leg more before initiating the return movement. I...|$|E

Through self-trapping of electronic defects, the recombination energy of the projectile ion (i. e. the potential energy that the ion carries into the collision with the surface) can be converted into kinetic energy of surface atoms and lead to the ablation of secondary particles from the surface. This process is called potential sputter-ing (PS) and has to be distinguished from the well known process of kinetic sputtering (KS), where the removal of surface atoms/ions is due to the kinetic energy of the projectile. PS with very slow ions offers the possibility for con-trolled modification of the surface layer without radiation damage to deeper layers.

Agricultural pollution {{is a primary}} source of impairment to water bodies in the US. In the agriculturally intensive Midwestern Region of the US, agricultural production is contingent upon the drainage of excess water from the landscape through constructed drainage networks. Drainage networks typically consist of horizontal subsurface tile drains and vertical surface inlets routed to drainage channels and streams. Surface inlets are utilized to drain topographical areas which often accumulate surface water. North Central Iowa is an agriculturally intensive area comprising the southeastern portion of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) : a landscape containing a high density of enclosed topographical depressions known as prairie potholes. This region maintains {{a large number of}} surface drains in order to drain the prairie potholes and thus increase the productivity of the lands within them. Draining prairie potholes by the installation of surface drains may increase water flows as well as the loadings of agricultural water quality contaminants to receiving waters. This study focuses on the hydrology of and contaminant loading from a drained prairie pothole located in a 39. 5 ha agricultural field in North Central Iowa. To assess the hydrology of the drained topographical depression, water balances were performed using climactic and water level data. Flows of water into the <b>surface</b> <b>tile</b> inlet were calculated using continuous water level data obtained via pressure transducer located near the surface drain within the topographical depression. Precipitation inflows and evaporative outflows to the pond were calculated using climactic data. Groundwater levels were monitored to assess groundwater and surface water interactions. The results of these water balances showed distinct differences in the inflows to and outflows from the depression based on antecedent conditions. In wet conditions, groundwater flow to the pond was significant source of water accounting for more than 20 % of the total inflow. In drier conditions groundwater was not a source of water and infiltration comprised at least 30 % of the outflow. Over the entire study period, the surface drain was the largest outflow from the pond accounting for 17160 m 3, 95 %, of the iii total outflow. Evaporation from and precipitation on the pond surface proved to be minor components of the water budget, accounting for 2 % and 4 % of the total water budget, respectively. Concentrations of potential agricultural pollutants (Total Dissolved Solids, Nitrate, Dissolved Phosphate, Total Phosphorus, Total Suspended Solids, and Dissolved Organic Carbon) were determined by the analysis of grab samples obtained from ponded water which accumulated within the depression as the result of precipitation events. Chemical loads and yields were calculated using corresponding flows into the surface drain and constituent concentrations from June until Mid-August of 2008. These values were then compared to calculated upstream loads within the receiving drainage channel to compare the relative contributions of the <b>surface</b> <b>tile</b> inlet to the watershed’s effluent. The receiving channel drains a 3640 ha catchment containing extensive drainage infrastructure immediately upstream of topographical depression. Calculated yields from the drained depression were: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) : 168 kg ha- 1, Nitrate as nitrogen (NO 3 - -N) : 8. 4 kg ha- 1, Orthophosphate as phosphorus (PO 43 - -P) : 0. 4 kg ha- 1, Total Phosphorus as phosphorus (TP -P) : 0. 9 kg ha- 1, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) : 788 kg ha- 1, and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) : 11 kg ha- 1. Calculated yields for the receiving channel were: TDS: 722 kg ha- 1, NO 3 - -N: 23. 2 kg ha- 1, PO 43 - -P: 0. 4 kg ha- 1, TP -P: 1. 0 kg ha- 1, TSS: 991 kg ha- 1, DOC: 11 kg ha- 1.

40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{research}} suggesting that water table management (WTM) can significantly reduce nitrate (NO 3 ") loads in agricultural drainage, a study {{was carried out}} in 2001 and 2002 in Coteau-du-Lac, 60 km west of Montreal, to investigate the effect of water table management on the migration of phosphorus (P) via tile drainage and surface runoff. The second main objective was to study the influence of WTM on grain corn yields. Two drainage treatments were compared: conventional free drainage and WTM (combined controlled drainage and subirrigation) with a design water table depth at 0. 6 m below the ground <b>surface.</b> <b>Tile</b> drainage and surface runoff were monitored and sampled automatically. Increased outflow volumes and concentrations - and therefore increased P loads - were measured in drainage water from plots under WTM. Plots under WTM also generally exhibited higher P loads in surface runoff. Higher P concentrations in surface runoff from plots under WTM were observed in surface runoff, especially during winter. Phosphorus loads from combined tile drainage and surface runoff were low compared with literature data (< 0. 4 kg/ha/year). However, the mean P concentrations in tile drainage were above Quebec's surface water quality standard of 0. 03 mg total P/L during both growing seasons in plots under WTM, but not in plots with conventional free drainage. Mean P concentrations in surface runoff water routinely exceeded the criteria, except in plots with conventional free drainage in winter 2002. Therefore, P from tile drainage and surface runoff could contribute to the eutrophication of surface water. Based on these results, WTM increases P loads from the field, both in tile drainage and surface runoff. However, the well water used for subirrigation was found to contain P concentrations above Quebec's surface water quality standard, and this could partly explain the higher P concentrations found in water from plots under WTM. Water table management increased grain corn yields by 35 % in both years. The growing seasons of 2001 and 2002 were among the driest ever recorded in Canada...|$|E
