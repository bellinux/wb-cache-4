5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for bounce dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the <b>support</b> <b>vessel.</b> In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1927, Kirishimas first {{reconstruction}} rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her {{armor and}} improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Kirishima acted primarily as a <b>support</b> <b>vessel</b> and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Kido Butai as an escort for the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|Arcona {{served in}} all three German navies {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. She served both with the fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a <b>support</b> <b>vessel</b> for the U-boat {{campaign}} in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used for secondary duties. After the German Navy became the Kriegsmarine in 1935, it rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the final days of the war, and broken up for scrap in 19481949.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the <b>support</b> <b>vessel</b> for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E

25|$|A dive boat {{will not}} be {{carrying}} a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving <b>support</b> <b>vessel,</b> so treatment {{would be limited to}} oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where the equipment is available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may choose to do in-water recompression.|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied diving is diving using {{equipment}} {{supplied with}} breathing gas using a diver's umbilical from the surface, {{either from the}} shore or from a diving <b>support</b> <b>vessel,</b> sometimes indirectly via a diving bell. This is different from scuba diving, where the diver's breathing equipment is completely self-contained {{and there is no}} link to the surface. The primary advantages of conventional surface supplied diving are lower risk of drowning and considerably larger breathing gas supply than scuba, allowing longer working periods and safer decompression.|$|E

25|$|Surface-oriented, or bounce diving, is how {{commercial}} divers {{refer to}} diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure. The alternative, while retaining surface supply, is saturation diving. For bounce dives, the diver may be deployed directly, often from a diving <b>support</b> <b>vessel</b> or indirectly via a diving bell. Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or surface decompression in a deck chamber. Small closed bell systems {{which include a}} two-man bell, a launch and recovery frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP) are reasonably mobile, and suited to deep bounce dives.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{saturation}} diving allows professional divers to {{live and}} work at pressures greater than 50 msw (160 fsw) for days or weeks at a time. This type of diving allows for greater economy of work and enhanced safety for the divers. After working in the water, they rest and live in a dry pressurized habitat on or connected to a diving <b>support</b> <b>vessel,</b> oil platform or other floating work station, at approximately the same pressure as the work depth. The diving team is compressed to the working pressure only once, {{at the beginning of the}} work period, and decompressed to surface pressure once, after the entire work period of days or weeks.|$|E
25|$|In July 1994, MacInnis {{organized}} and led six publicly funded dives to the SS Edmund Fitzgerald over a three-day period. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided the Edwin A. Link as the <b>support</b> <b>vessel,</b> and their manned submersible, the Celia. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) paid $10,000 {{for three of}} its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation of why the Fitzgerald sank. MacInnis helped organize another series of dives in July 1995 to salvage the bell from the Fitzgerald. Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten's atmospheric diving suit, the Newtsuit, was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, {{replace it with a}} replica, and put a beer can in the Fitzgeralds pilothouse. At MacInnis' suggestion, the replica bell was inscribed with the names of the Fitzgeralds crew.|$|E
