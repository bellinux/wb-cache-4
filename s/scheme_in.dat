Also, it is investigated as to whether FTA users in importing (exporting) are more likely to use FTA <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> exporting (importing). To do that, we employed a unique survey in which the detailed information on FTA use is available for Japanese affiliates in ASEAN. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, firm size matters in the use of FTA <b>schemes</b> only <b>in</b> exporting, not in importing. Second, the past experience of FTA use in exporting (importing) does not help firms use the FTA <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> importing (exporting). Thus, it is necessary to assist firms to use FTA <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> exporting even if they are already using FTA <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> importing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dierent {{measurement}} <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> multistation machining systems carry dierent {{amounts of}} information about the root causes of dimensional machining errors. The choice of a measurement strategy in a multistation machining system is therefore crucial for subsequent successful identi®cation of the machining error root causes. Recent advances in the linear state-space modelling of dimensional errors in multistation machining processes facilitate a formal and systematic characterization of measurement <b>schemes.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, the stream-of-variation methodology is employed to characterize various measurement <b>schemes</b> quantitatively <b>in</b> multistation machining systems using the Bayesian approach in statistics. Application of these methods is demonstrated in the characterization of measurement <b>schemes</b> <b>in</b> the machining process used for machining of an automotive cylinder head...|$|R
