40|$|It is {{well known}} that in {{implementations}} of sliding mode controllers using hysteresis comparators, when the hysteresis band amplitude tends to zero the real dynamics tends to the ideal sliding dynamics. However, in real systems physical limitations do not allow to effectively lower this value at will, and a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> is likely to appear. In this paper we relate this error with a non zero average value of the switching function in each switching period: it is shown that, in linear systems, when the controller has a constant switching frequency and the switching function is periodic, the average value of the difference between real and ideal steady state dynamics is proportional to the average value of the switching function. Hence, when this average value is non zero an average <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> appears, while a zero average value for the switching function entails no average <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error.</b> The proof is carried out using a regular form approach, and the result is exemplified in a buck converter. Simulation results show that when the switching function is periodic and shows a piecewise linear behavior within the hysteresis band, thus guaranteeing zero average value, the average state error disappears. In turn, when this piecewise linear character is lost and the switching function has non zero mean value, an average <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> arises.

40|$|Electro-Mechanical Dual Acting Pulley Continuously Variable Transmission (EMDAP CVT) is a {{transmission}} operated by electro-mechanical actuated system. It has a potential to reduce energy consumption where power is only needed during changing of CVT ratio and no additional power {{is needed to}} maintain the CVT ratio due to self-lock mechanism design feature of the EMDAP CVT. In this research, simulation of an EMDAP CVT model was first performed in order to evaluate controller system performance using MATLAB/Simulink software package. Then, confirmation of the simulation results is made by experimental data that is being measured from EMDAP CVT test rig. In order to obtain adequate performance, basic Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), Proportional Derivative (PD) and Proportional Derivative with Conditional Integral (PDCI) controller schemes were proposed to control EMDAP CVT ratio. Relay feedback and Ziegler-Nichols methods were utilized to tune the PID based controller parameters. From simulation analysis, the basic PID based controller shows a huge overshoot up to 280 % and it takes very long settling time up to 65 seconds. However, this controller generates very small <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> which is around 0. 2 %. The PD controller shows better performance {{where there is no}} overshoot occurred and faster settling time, i. e. 8 seconds, but <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> is a bit higher, i. e. 3. 2 %, than the basic PID based controller. The best performance is predicted by PDCI controller where it shows maximum overshoot at 0. 2 %, 8 seconds in settling time and <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> at 0. 1 %. In the experimental work, only PD and PDCI controller schemes are adopted because of their good control performance in the simulation. It is found that performance of the PD and PDCI controllers in the experiments are quite close to those predicted in the simulation. For the PD controller, experimental results show no overshoot, it takes only 4 seconds in settling time and produces <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> of 10 %. As for the PDCI controller, it shows 1 % in maximum overshoot, 8 seconds in settling time and <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>error</b> at 1 %.

Additionally, once they occur in a short period, the overshoots are difficult to be noticed by a human observer.
