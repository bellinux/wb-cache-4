40|$|The plasmid {{types and}} serotypes of 164 Rhodococcus equi strains {{obtained}} from <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of swine from different piggeries in 28 villages and towns located {{throughout the country}} were examined. The strains were tested by PCR {{for the presence of}} 15 - to 17 -kDa virulence-associated protein antigen (VapA) and 20 -kDa virulence-associated protein antigen (VapB) genes. Plasmid DNAs were isolated and analyzed by digestion with restriction endonucleases to estimate size and compare their polymorphism characteristics. None of the 164 isolates contained the vapA gene, and 44 (26. 8 %) isolates were positive for the vapB gene, showing a product of the expected 827 -bp size in the PCR amplification. The 44 isolates of intermediate virulence contained virulence plasmids that were identified as types 1 (3 isolates), 4 (1 isolate), 5 (36 isolates), 6 (1 isolate), and 7 (2 isolates) and as a new variant (1 isolate). On the basis of restriction digestion patterns of plasmid DNAs, we tentatively designated the variant as type 17. Use of the serotyping method of Prescott showed that 110 (67. 1 %) out of the 164 isolates were typeable and that serotype 2 predominated (83 isolates [50. 6 %]), followed by serotype 1 (26 strains [15. 9 %]). Only one isolate belonged to serotype 3. A total of 54 (32. 9 %) isolates were untypeable in Prescott's system. The prevalence of R. equi strains of intermediate virulence among the isolates that came from the <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of swine in Hungary was lower than that seen with isolates obtained elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} reported {{the existence of}} Rhodococcus equi isolates with at least three virulence levels, isolated from AIDS patients: virulent R. equi having 15 - to 17 -kDa antigens that kills mice with 10 (6) cells, intermediately virulent R. equi having a 20 -kDa antigen that kills mice with 10 (7) cells, and avirulent R. equi that does not kill mice with 10 (8) cells or more (S. Takai, Y. Imai, N. Fukunaga, Y. Uchida, K. Kamisawa, Y. Sasaki, S. Tsubaki, and T. Sekizaki, J. Infect. Dis. 172 : 1306 - 1311, 1995). Virulent R. equi having the 15 - to 17 -kDa antigens has been isolated frequently from horses and their environment, but the source of intermediately virulent R. equi having the 20 -kDa antigen is poorly understood. There are many reports of the isolation of R. equi from the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of pigs with and without lesions resembling those of tuberculosis. Therefore, we analyzed antigens of R. equi isolates from the <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of pigs by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against these virulence-associated antigens. Immunoblots of whole-cell antigen preparations of R. equi pig isolates revealed {{the presence of the}} 20 -kDa antigen in almost all the pig isolates studied, and these isolates were intermediately virulent for mice. We also demonstrated that the expression of the 20 -kDa antigen and its pathogenicity in mice were associated strongly with the presence of five large, distinct plasmids of 70 to 95 kb; two of the five plasmids from pig isolates were the same sizes as those from human isolates. These results suggest that R. equi having the 20 -kDa antigen exists in the <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of pigs and that the source of infection in some human cases might be associated with pigs and their environment...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies {{is to develop a}} {{respiratory}} allergy model in Brown Norway (BN) rats using ovalbumin (Ova) as the antigenic stimulus. Specifically, we are interested in studying the mechanisms underlying the development of pulmonary T helper type 2 (Th 2) responses following Ova sensitization and inhalation challenge. We have previously reported on the development of an active pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by the presence of eosinophils and measurement of serum immunoglobulin E levels in Ova-sensitized but not in alum-treated, Ova-challenged or sham control rats. In the current study, we have used cDNA microarray technology to assess the gene expression in tracheobronchial, mesenteric and <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> as well as in pulmonary cells and tissues of Ova-sensitized, alum-sensitized or sham control BN rats. Preliminary cDNA microarray results of lung tissue from BN rats exposed to ova–ova (Ova-sensitized, Ova-challenged) 4 or 24 h after ova challenge did not show up-regulation (relative to sham controls) of mRNA for interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) or IL- 5 but did show up-regulation of eotaxin (4 h), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAMs), which are likely to be prerequisites for eosinophilic pulmonary inflammatory responses measured at 24 and 48 h post Ova inhalation exposure.

40|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{continues to be}} a major public health problem, particularly in the adolescent and young adult populations. Generally, such a behavior tends to be confined to the weekends, to attain frequently binge drinking. This study in peripubertal male rats compares the effect of the discontinuous feeding of a liquid diet containing a moderate amount of ethanol (6. 2 % wt/vol) to that of continuous ethanol administration or a control diet, taking as end points the 24 ‐h variations of plasma prolactin levels and mitogenic responses and lymphocyte subset populations in <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleen. Animals received the ethanol liquid diet starting on day 35 of life, the diet being similar to that given to controls except for that maltose was isocalorically replaced by ethanol. Ethanol provided 36 % of the total caloric content. Every week, the discontinuous ethanol group received the ethanol diet for 3 days and the control liquid diet for the remaining 4 days. After 4 weeks, rats were killed at 6 time intervals, beginning at 0900 h. A significant decrease of splenic cells´response to concanavalin A, and of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and splenic cells’ response to lipopolysaccharide was found in rats under the discontinuous ethanol regime, as compared to control or ethanolchronic rats. Under discontinuous ethanol feeding mean values of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and splenic CD 8 + and CD 4 +‐CD 8 +cells decreased, whereas those of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and splenic T cells, and splenic B cells, augmented. In rats chronically fed with ethanol, splenic mean levels of CD 8 + and CD 4 +‐CD 8 +cells augmented. Both modalities of ethanol administration disrupted the 24 h variation in immune function seen in controls. Mean plasma prolactin levels 3 increased by 3. 6 and 8. 5 fold in rats chronically or discontinuously fed with alcohol, respectively. The immune parameters examined in an additional group of rats fed regular chow and water ad libitum did not differ significantly from control liquid diet. The results support the view that the discontinuous drinking of a moderate amount of ethanol can be more harmful for the immune system than a continuous ethanol intake, presumably by inducing a greater stress as indicated by the augmented plasma prolactin levels observed...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacteria {{are widely}} {{prevalent}} in the environment. They occur in all animal species {{as well as in}} soil, hay dust and have also been found in wood shavings and saw dust. Mycobacteria are true survivors. They can survive in soil for up to 9 years. In addition to apathogenic types, i. e. unharmful to human and animal health, there are also types of mycobacteria that can cause disease in humans and animals. These zoonotic agents are roughly subdivided into “tuberculous” and “nontuberculous” mycobacteria. The first include the closely related pathogens of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which cause common tuberculosis. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (mycobacteriosis) are caused by pathogens of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAIC). Both pathogenic species can also infect pigs. Available statistics show that the number of infections are low (0. 15 to 0. 5 % of slaughtered animals have potentially pathogenic mycobacteria). According to currently available findings it appears highly improbable that humans are infected with tuberculous mycobacteria through foodstuffs produced from pork. In addition, there are no known cases in which the transmission of mycobacterioses, which can be caused by the nontuberculous mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium avium-intra¬cellulare complex, occurred through foodstuffs. However, a final assessment of this risk is not possible at present as the total data available on infections of slaughter pigs with these pathogens are insufficient. Nonetheless, it is imperative that slaughter pigs are tested for infections with pathogenic mycobacteria. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) deems it unnecessary to perform an incision of the <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (Lnn. mandibulares) under certain conditions, e. g. if the animals are raised in integrated production systems and if serological testing methods are applied within production...|$|R

Recently, a novel atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV) linked with the development of congenital tremor (CT) in neonatal pigs was described in Europe and the Americas. Here, the first Asian APPV complete polyprotein coding sequence was assembled from serum samples from newborn piglets affected with CT in Southern China, and termed APPV_GD. 14 organ samples from affected piglets were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to investigate the tissue tropism of APPV, and 135 serum samples from pigs from 10 farms were used for identifying APPV in adult pigs. The highest genome loads were found in <b>submaxillary</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and PCR-based detection showed that APPV genomes were present in seven samples from five farms. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the full-length genomes of the pestiviruses, and APPV_GD appeared on a new branch with another newly discovered APPV. Nucleotide identity analysis demonstrated that APPV_GD shared the highest nucleotide sequence identity with a German APPV. Bayesian inference was performed using 25 partial sequences of the APPV NS 5 B gene (528 bp) isolated from four countries in recent years. According to this analysis, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the current APPV strains might have emerged in Germany and then diversified and spread to Asia, the Americas, and other countries in Europe. However, the result of bayesian inference could change when more APPV strains are isolated in the future. The present study is the first to report APPV in China and infers the origin and dissemination of the current strains of the virus...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the incidence of caseous lesions in the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of slaughter pigs prompted a large-scale investigation in five slaughterhouses in The Netherlands.

Greater numbers of pigs with affected <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were found in 13 groups (8. 5 %). Four pigs had lesions in the kidneys, liver, or spleen. Acid-fast bacteria were detected by microscopic examination of 121 of 292 Ziehl-Neelsen-stained smears of caseous lesions (41 %). In a follow-up study, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria were isolated from 219 of 402 affected <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (54. 2 %). Ninety-one of the isolated strains were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing with insertion sequence IS 1245 as a probe.

Only one pig isolate exhibited the bird-type RFLP pattern. MAC isolates from 191 human patients in The Netherlands in 1996 were also typed by RFLP analysis. Computer-assisted analysis showed that the RFLP patterns of 61 % of the human isolates and 59 % of the porcine isolates were at least 75 % similar to the RFLP patterns of the other group of strains.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to clarify the outcome of the ratio between metastatic and examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in esophagogastric junction cancer patients with or without 7 examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> METHODS: A total of 3, 481 patients who underwent operation are identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Different <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected groups are analyzed to test the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio factor. RESULTS: There are 2522 patients with 7 or more <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected and 959 patients with less than 7 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement are independent prognostic factors.

As a result of pathology report, in 8 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was involved with cancer which in final pathologic report there was involvement of the <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> In other 2 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was clean which in final pathology report there was no involvement in <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Conclusion: In this study there was a concordance between the pathology report of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement. According to this study we can find out that when the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is not involved with the cancer we can refuse from wide <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{positivity}} nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in patients with macro, micro and submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and find predictive factors of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Study was conducted at the Department of Surgery in Pardubice, Pilsen, Ostrava and Zlín. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were assessed based on standards of Czech Pathological Society. Detection of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was performed based on radionavigation or combination of radionavigation and blue dye method. In group N 1 (macrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 50 % (45 from 90 patients). In group N 1 Mi (micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 26. 7 % (16 from 60 patients). In group NO I+ (sub-micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 6. 7 % (1 from 15 patients). Predictive factors were size of metastasis, number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> High positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in pacients with macro and micrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> advocates to perform axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection. Due to small number of patients with submicrometastases it is not possible to assess if axillary dissection is necessary or not. Predictive factors of positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are size of metastasis in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor due to small tumors in the study. In spite of this it is necessary to consider it like a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In patients with macro and micrometastases it is necessary to perform axillary dissection. In patients with submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> it is necessary to consider predictive factors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{metastasis}} is {{an important}} factor for predicting the prognosis of colorectal can-cer patients. However, approximately 60 % of patients do not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation (less than 12 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes).</b> In this study, we identified a more effective tool for predicting the prognosis of patients who received inadequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation. Materials and Methods The number of metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> total number of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> examined, number of negative metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (NL), <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> ratio (LR), and the number of apical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (APL) were examined, and the prognostic impact of these parameters was examined in patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery from January 2004 to December 2011. In total, 806 people were analyzed retrospectively. Results In comparison of different <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> analysis methods for rectal cancer patients who did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, the LR showed a significant difference in over-all survival (OS) and the APL predicted a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS). In the case of colon cancer patients who did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, LR predicted a significant difference in DFS and OS, and the APL predicted a significant difference in DFS. Conclusion If patients did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation, the LR and NL were useful parameters to complement N stage for predicting OS in colon cancer, whereas LR was com-plementary for rectal cancer. The APL could be used for prediction of DFS in all patients.
