50|$|RHEB {{functions}} differently {{compared to}} other proteins in the Ras superfamily. Similar {{to those in the}} Ras superfamily, the protein has GTPase activity and shuttles between a GDP-bound form and a GTP-bound form, and farnesylation of the protein is required for this activity. However, unlike those in the Ras superfamily, conformational change when shuttling between forms only affects switch I, while switch II remains relatively stable, due to difference in secondary structure. Ras switch II forms a long α-helical structure between <b>shuttling,</b> while RHEB <b>switch</b> II adopts a more atypical conformation allowing for novel functions. Such a conformation causes a decreased intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis as compared to RAS due to the catalytic Asp65 in the switch II region of RHEB being blocked from the active site.|$|R
40|$|The central {{component}} of the programmable molecular switch recently demonstrated by Stoddart and Heath is [2]rotaxane, which consists of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) shuttle (CBPQT^(4 +)) (PF_ 6 -) _ 4 (the ring) encircling a finger and moving between two stations, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP). As a step toward understanding the mechanism of this switch, we report here its electronic structure using two flavors of density functional theory (DFT) :[*] B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G^(**) and PBE/ 6 - 31 G^(**). We find that the electronic structure of composite [2]rotaxane can be constructed reasonably well from its parts by combining the states of separate stations (TTF and DNP) {{with or without the}} (CBPQT) (PF_ 6) _ 4 shuttle around them. That is, the “CBPQT@TTF” state, (TTF) (CBPQT) (PF_ 6) _ 4 −(DNP), is described well as a combination of the (TTF) (CBPQT) (PF_ 6) _ 4 complex and free DNP, and the “CBPQT@DNP” state, (TTF) −(DNP) (CBPQT) (PF_ 6) _ 4, is described well as a combination of free TTF and the (DNP) (CBPQT) (PF_ 6) _ 4 complex. This allows an aufbau or a “bottom-up” approach to predict the complicated [n]rotaxanes in terms of their components. This should be useful in designing new components to lead to improved properties of the switches. A critical function of the (CBPQT^(4 +)) (PF_ 6 -) _ 4 <b>shuttle</b> in <b>switching</b> is that it induces a downshift of the frontier orbital energy levels of the station it is on (TTF or DNP). This occurs because of the net positive electrostatic potential exerted by the CBPQT^(4 +) ring, which is located closer to the active station than the four PF_ 6 -'s. This downshift alters the relative position of energy levels between TTF and DNP, which in turn alters the electron tunneling rate between them, even when the shuttle is not involved directly in the actual tunneling process. Based on this switching mechanism, the “CBPQT@TTF” state {{is expected to be a}} better conductor since it has better aligned levels between the two stations. A second potential role of the (CBPQT^(4 +)) (PF_ 6 -) _ 4 <b>shuttle</b> in <b>switching</b> is to provide low-lying LUMO levels. If the shuttle is involved in the actual tunneling process, the reduced HOMO−LUMO gap (from 3. 6 eV for the isolated finger to 1. 1 eV for “CBPQT@TTF” or to 0. 6 eV for “CBPQT@DNP” using B 3 LYP) would significantly facilitate the electron tunneling through the system. This might occur in a folded conformation where a direct contact between free station and the shuttle on the other station is possible. When this becomes the main switching mechanism, we expect the “CBPQT@DNP” state to become a better conductor because its HOMO−LUMO gap is smaller and because its HOMO and LUMO are localized at different stations (HOMO exclusively at TTF and LUMO at CBPQT encircling DNP) so that the HOMO-to-LUMO tunneling would be through the entire molecule of [2]rotaxane. Thus an essential element in designing these switches is to determine the configuration of the molecules (e. g., through self-assembled monolayers or incorporation of conformation stabilizing units) ...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{desirability}} of developing synthetic molecular machine systems that can function on surfaces is widely recognized, to date the only well-characterized examples of electrochemically switchable rotaxane-based molecular shuttles which can do so {{are based on the}} tetracationic viologen macrocycle pioneered by Stoddart. Here, we report on a [2]rotaxane which features succinamide and naphthalene diimide hydrogen-bonding stations for a benzylic amide macrocycle that can <b>shuttle</b> and <b>switch</b> its net position both in solution and in a monolayer. Three oxidation states of the naphthalene diimide unit can be accessed electrochemically in solution, each one with a different binding affinity for the macrocycle and, hence, corresponding to a different distribution of the rings between the two stations in the molecular shuttle. Cyclic voltammetry experiments show the switching to be both reversible and cyclable and allow quantification of the translational isomer ratios (thermodynamics) and shuttling dynamics (kinetics) for their interconversion in each state. Overall, the binding affinity of the naphthalene diimide station can be changed by 6 orders of magnitude over the three states. Unlike previous electrochemically active amide-based molecular shuttles, the reduction potential of the naphthalene diimide unit is sufficiently positive (- 0. 68 V) for the process to be compatible with operation in self-assembled monolayers on gold. Incorporating pyridine units into the macrocycle allowed attachment of the shuttles to an acid-terminated self-assembled monolayer of alkane thiols on gold. The molecular shuttle monolayers were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and their electrochemical behavior probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and double-potential step chronoamperometry, which demonstrated that the redox-switched shuttling was maintained in this environment, occurring on the millisecond time scale...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe current {{trend for}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging points towards higher {{magnetic}} fields. Even though sensitivity and resolution are increased in stronger fields, T 1 contrast is often reduced, and {{this represents a}} challenge for contrast agent design. Field-dependent measurements of relaxivity are thus important to characterize contrast agents. At present, the field-dependent curves of relaxivity are usually {{carried out in the}} field range of 0 T to 2 T, using fast field cycling relaxometers. Here, we employ a high-speed sample <b>shuttling</b> device to <b>switch</b> the magnetic fields experienced by the nuclei between virtually zero field, and the center of any commercial spectrometer. We apply this approach on rare-earth (mixed Gadolinium-Europium) vanadate nanoparticles, and obtain the dispersion curves from very low magnetic field up to 11. 7 T. In contrast to the relaxivity profiles of Gd chelates, commonly used for clinical applications, which display a plateau and then a decrease for increasing magnetic fields, these nanoparticles provide maximum contrast enhancement for magnetic fields around 1 – 1. 5 T. These field-dependent curves are fitted using the so-called Magnetic Particle (MP) model and the extracted parameters discussed as a function of particle size and composition. We finally comment on the new possibilities offered by this approach...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{fabricate}} mechanical devices on {{the molecular level}} have yielded analogues of rotors, gears, <b>switches,</b> <b>shuttles,</b> turnstiles and ratchets. Molecular motors, however, {{have not yet been}} made, even though they are common in biological systems. Rotary motion as such has been induced in interlocked systems and directly visualized for single molecules, but the controlled conversion of energy into unidirectional rotary motion has remained difficult to achieve. Here we report repetitive, monodirectional rotation around a central carbon-carbon double bond in a chiral, helical alkene, with each 360 ° rotation involving four discrete isomerization steps activated by ultraviolet light or a change in the temperature of the system. We find that axial chirality and the presence of two chiral centres are essential for the observed monodirectional behaviour of the molecular motor. Two light-induced cis-trans isomerizations are each associated with a 180 ° rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond and are each followed by thermally controlled helicity inversions, which effectively block reverse rotation and thus ensure that the four individual steps add up to one full rotation in one direction only. As the energy barriers of the helicity inversion steps can be adjusted by structural modifications, chiral alkenes based on our system may find use as basic components for ‘molecular machinery’ driven by light. ...|$|R
40|$|Facing the {{challenge}} to construct nanoscale machines, it has been noted that molecular motors stand out as essential components to provide power to such systems. The diversity of fascinating biological motors, such as the kinesin or myosin linear and ATP-ase rotary motor systems, {{has been a source}} of inspiration for the development of artificial molecular mechanical devices (such as <b>switches,</b> <b>shuttles,</b> and muscles) and a variety of elegant rotor systems. The sterically overcrowded alkenes prepared in our laboratories provided the basis for a light-driven motor. Unidirectional rotation is achieved by a combination of a photochemically mediated cis-trans isomerization followed by an irreversible thermal isomerization. The motor described here is based on the second-generation light-driven unidirectional molecular motors 1. A limitation of these molecular motors proved to be their low rotary speed. A major goal of our molecular motor program is to substantially lower the Gibbs energy of activation of the thermal isomerization, the rate-determining step for the 360 ° rotation around the central double bond in these overcrowded alkenes. Thus far, all attempts to decrease the thermal isomerization barriers have involved structural modifications in order to diminish steric interactions around the fjord region of the molecules. This has been achieved by the introduction of smaller-sized atoms in 1 at bridging position X or using smaller rings appended to the central alkene. ...|$|R

40|$|CONSPECTUS: The {{promise of}} {{mechanically}} interlocked architectures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes, as prototypical molecular <b>switches</b> and <b>shuttles</b> for nanotechnological applications, has stimulated an ever increasing {{interest in their}} synthesis and function. The elaborate host cavities of interlocked structures, however, can also offer a novel approach toward molecular recognition: this Account describes the use of rotaxane and catenane host systems for binding charged guest species, and for providing sensing capability through an integrated optical or electrochemical reporter group. Particular attention is drawn to the exploitation of the unusual dynamic properties of interlocked molecules, such as guest-induced <b>shuttling</b> or conformational <b>switching,</b> as a sophisticated means of achieving a selective and functional sensor response. We initially survey interlocked host systems capable of sensing cationic guests, before focusing on our accomplishments in synthesizing rotaxanes and catenanes designed for the more challenging task of selective anion sensing. In our group, we have developed the use of discrete anionic templation to prepare mechanically interlocked structures for anion recognition applications. Removal of the anion template reveals an interlocked host system, possessing a unique three-dimensional geometrically restrained binding cavity formed between the interlocked components, which exhibits impressive selectivity toward complementary anionic guest species. By incorporating reporter groups within such systems, we have developed both electrochemical and optical anion sensors which can achieve highly selective sensing of anionic guests. Transition metals, lanthanides, and organic fluorophores integrated within the mechanically bonded structural framework of the receptor are perturbed by the binding of the guest, with a concomitant change in the emission profile. We have also exploited the unique dynamics of interlocked hosts by demonstrating that an anion-induced conformational change {{can be used as}} a means of signal transduction. Electrochemical sensing has been realized by integration of the redox-active ferrocene functionality within a range of rotaxane and catenanes; binding of an anion perturbs the metallocene, leading to a cathodic shift in the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple. In order to obtain practical sensors for target charged guest species, confinement of receptors at a surface is necessary in order to develop robust, reuseable devices. Surface confinement also offers advantages over solution based receptors, including amplification of signal, enhanced guest binding thermodynamics and the negation of solubility problems. We have fabricated anion-templated rotaxanes and catenanes on gold electrode surfaces and demonstrated that the resulting mechanically bonded self-assembled monolayers are electrochemically responsive to the binding of anions, a crucial first step toward the advancement of sophisticated, highly selective, anion sensory devices. Rotaxane and catenane host molecules may be engineered to offer a superior level of molecular recognition, and the incorporation of optical or electrochemical reporter groups within these interlocked frameworks can allow for guest sensing. Advances in synthetic templation strategies has facilitated the synthesis of interlocked architectures and widened their interest as prototype molecular machines. However, their unique host-guest properties are only now beginning to be exploited as a sophisticated approach to chemical sensing. The development of functional host-guest sensory systems such as these is of great interest to the interdisciplinary field of supramolecular chemistry...|$|R
