50|$|A pass {{can cost}} more than walk-up fares in {{southern}} countries like Italy and Spain. In Italy, the per day cost of the pass plus the 10-15 euro reservation can exceed the normal cost of a train journey. Rail Passes are very convenient for travelers planning to take many trains, instead {{of just a few}} smaller trips. In Spain, <b>seat</b> <b>reservations</b> are required for the high-speed AVE trains, however a person can use any regional service without paying any <b>seat</b> <b>reservation</b> cost. A Eurail pass may be cost-effective in France since TGV reservations are only about 5 euros, though {{it is important to note}} that pass holder fares are subject to availability. France also has many regional services which do not require a <b>seat</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Current v, {{many people}} and {{companies}} are embracing the mobile air line reservation system. Reservation systems had been implemented {{in many parts of}} the world for decades, initially from manual to computerized reservation system. Mobile, airline, bus ticketing and automated reservation systems are effectively increasing in the market. As a result of the fierce competition in the airline sector, organizations within this sector are in the process of developing systems that will improve their services to customers. Consequently, an automated <b>seat</b> <b>reservation</b> system has continued to be an open area of research. The objective of this paper is to develop a mobile airline <b>seat</b> <b>reservation</b> system that will assist the public in gaining an easier and faster way for <b>seat</b> <b>reservation</b> and providing them with more options to book a ticketfor traveling on real time. The system was developed using the Wireless Markup Language (WML) asfrontend, MySQL 4. 0 database management system as back-end and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) as the server-side scripting language. The developed system will assist the airline customers and operators in providing cost-effective system that will make possible bookings and <b>seat</b> <b>reservation</b> on real-time using a mobile phone, irrespective of location of a user...|$|R
