2500|$|The teller of {{an urban}} legend may claim it {{happened}} to a friend (or {{to a friend of}} a friend), which serves to personalize, authenticate and enhance the power of the narrative while distancing the teller. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes, contaminated foods, or other situations which would potentially affect many people. Anyone believing such stories might feel compelled to warn loved ones. Not seldom, news organizations, school officials and even police departments have issued warnings concerning the latest threat. According to the [...] "Lights Out" [...] rumor, [...] street-gang members would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded with the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective new gang-member would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of initiation. A fax received at the Nassau County, Florida fire department was forwarded to police, and from there to all city departments. Even the Minister of Defence for Canada was taken in by the same legend; he forwarded an urgent <b>security</b> <b>warning</b> to all Ontario Members of Parliament.|$|E
40|$|This work {{precisely}} evaluates whether browser <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> are as ineffective {{as proposed}} by popular sentiments and past writings. This research used different kinds of Android mobile browsers as well as desktop browsers to evaluate <b>security</b> <b>warnings.</b> <b>Security</b> experts and developers should give emphasis on making a user aware of <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> and should not neglect aim of communicating this to users. Security experts and system architects should emphasis the goal of communicating security information to end users. In most of the browsers, <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> are not emphasized, and browsers simply do not show warnings, or {{there are a number}} of ways to hide those warnings of malicious sites. This work precisely finds that how inconsistent browsers really are in prompting <b>security</b> <b>warnings.</b> In particular, majority of the modern mobile web browsers are vulnerable to these security threats. We find inconsistency in SSL warnings among web browsers. Based on this work, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers...|$|R

This paper explores {{the links between}} warning dialog design and user understanding of, motivation to respond to, and actual response to computer <b>security</b> <b>warnings.</b> We measured these variables through a 733 -participant online study that tested a set of four existing computer <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> and two redesigned versions of each across low- and high-risk conditions. In some cases our redesigned warnings significantly increased participants’ understanding and motivation to take the safest action; however, {{we were not able}} to show that participants’ responses were differentiated between low and high risk conditions. We also observed that motivation seemed to be a more important predictor of taking the safest action than understanding.

40|$|We empirically {{assess whether}} browser <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> are as {{ineffective}} {{as suggested by}} popular opinion and previous literature. We used Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome’s in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome’s malware and phishing warnings, {{and a third of}} Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This demonstrates that <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users continued through 70. 2 % of Google Chrome’s SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can {{have a significant impact on}} user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers. ...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of increasingly serious global climate change {{and the development of}} the low-carbon economy, the coordination between energy consumption carbon emissions (ECCE) and regional population, resources, environment, economy and society has become an important subject. In this paper, the research focuses on the <b>security</b> early <b>warning</b> of ECCE in Hebei Province, China. First, an assessment index system of the <b>security</b> early <b>warning</b> of ECCE is constructed based on the pressure-state-response (P-S-R) model. Then, the variance method and linearity weighted method are used to calculate the <b>security</b> early <b>warning</b> index of ECCE. From the two dimensions of time series and spatial pattern, the <b>security</b> early <b>warning</b> conditions of ECCE are analyzed in depth. Finally, with the assessment analysis of the data from 2000 to 2014, the prediction of the <b>security</b> early <b>warning</b> of carbon emissions from 2015 to 2020 is given, using a back propagation neural network based on a kidney-inspired algorithm (KA-BPNN) model. The results indicate that: (1) from 2000 to 2014, the security comprehensive index of ECCE demonstrates a fluctuating upward trend in general and the trend of the alarm level is “Severe warning”–“Moderate warning”–“Slight warning”; (2) there is a big spatial difference in the security of ECCE, with relatively high-security alarm level in the north while it is relatively low in the other areas; (3) the security index shows the trend of continuing improvement from 2015 to 2020, however the security level will remain in the state of “Semi-secure” {{for a long time and}} the corresponding alarm is still in the state of “Slight warning”, reflecting that the situation is still not optimistic...|$|R

We envisage adapting the knowledge from our research in understanding and visually communicating trust and quality to explore whether it could be beneficial to other disciplines, such as Cybersecurity; an initial exploration into that problem is presented in [35]. Opportunities have arisen in that field in particular because of the increase in attacks which target human weaknesses, both perceptual and cognitive. If systems and interfaces could be designed that better take these weaknesses into account and also understand what makes users trust or ignore <b>security</b> <b>warnings</b> and messages, this should lead to better security decisions and behaviour.|$|R
