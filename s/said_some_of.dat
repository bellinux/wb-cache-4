Klapper also said the lyrics do not compliment Perry's writing skills. The Washington Post staff writer Chris Richards' review of the track was also negative. Talking about how hooks on Teenage Dream are catchy, but quickly start to erode if listeners {{pay more attention to}} the words, he cited [...] "Peacock" [...] as an example of this.

500|$|The {{production}} team learned—some nine {{weeks prior to}} the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke. They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes.

Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E

Pratt specifically sought to make Plaza laugh during their scene together and was ultimately successful. He told Daniels before filming, [...] "I'm gonna get something out of her." [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] included a scene in which Leslie tells the state trooper multiple reasons or excuses for why she apparently shot Ron, all of which were edited together in a series of jump cuts. The technique has been commonly used throughout the Parks and Recreation series to condense multiple takes of improvisation from Poehler.|$|E
500|$|Yuri Lowenthal, who voiced Sasuke in the English dubs, felt {{honored to}} be chosen {{considering}} the large retinue of voice actors auditioning for the role, but noted the job was stressful because fans were highly critical of any deviation or mistake in his recordings. His first impression of Sasuke was that of [...] "a serious guy dedicated to his training," [...] but his view changed as he learned more of Sasuke's backstory. In 2010, Lowenthal said that Sasuke {{was one of the}} first [...] "dark" [...] characters he voiced, commenting that [...] "He's sort of a hero, but he’s not the naïve, young white – hat hero." [...] Nevertheless, he said he loves voicing the character. Due to Viz Media often censoring parts of the series' dialogue for Western viewers, Lowenthal <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Sasuke's lines were changed such as his usage of the word [...] "kill". As a result, he commented he preferred the series' original Japanese version due to remaining true to the character.|$|E

The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations."

500|$|Robert Gardiner refuted both accusations in an {{open letter}} to the vicar general of the Roman Catholic archbishopric in Élisabethville.

Gardiner also said no protests of the presence of gendarmes was ever forwarded to the International Red Cross and that the mother superior of the hospital testified that medical authorities had been advised by Union Minière officials to refrain from taking any action against the gendarmes and to avoid involving themselves in the matter altogether. As for the 70 corpses brought to Prince Leopold Hospital, Gardiner stated that [...] "o evidence has been produced to substantiate this allegation." ...|$|E
500|$|Dennis Lim of Blender {{named the}} song {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of the album, calling it [...] "hypnotic pole-dance pop". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the song [...] "futuristic and thrilling". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that [...] "somehow, out of personal chaos, pop greatness has emerged. [...] melds tack-sharp beats and a deliciously scuzzy bassline to create a dancefloor throb that feels devilishly sexy". While reviewing The Singles Collection, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called [...] "Gimme More" [...] "the best dance track she has done since 'Toxic'". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said the track set the mood for Blackout, adding that [...] "the electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears’s voice is thin [...] she delivers almost nothing but slithery come-ons and defiant invitations to nightclub decadence". New Musical Express compared Spears's vocals to [...] "a sex addict’s cry for help". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the songs of Blackout, [...] "really show off the skills of the producers", exemplifying [...] "Gimme More", [...] "Radar", [...] "Break the Ice", [...] "Heaven on Earth" [...] and [...] "Hot as Ice".|$|E

[...] Mustaine wrote the songs for the album {{in an attempt to}} [...] "stir something {{in the minds of the}} listener". The lyrics of the album were mostly about choices the American government were making at the time, which Mustaine found to be foolish. Mustaine stated recording the new songs was [...] "super fun", despite having troubles with some of the complex music and vocal arrangements. All of the lyrics and music, with the exception of one song, were written by Mustaine. [...] "Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms" [...] was co-written by Mustaine and guitarist Glen Drover. When bassist James LoMenzo was asked about the lyrics of the album, he said to [...] "talk to Dave about that". Although most of the band had no writing credits on the album, they stated that they were excited about recording the music.|$|E
500|$|New Amerykah Part One {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on 27 reviews. Slant Magazines Eric Henderson {{said it is}} a powerful listen that stands as Badu's most musically ambitious work. Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker described the album as [...] "a brilliant resurgence of black avant-garde vocal pop" [...] and [...] "the work of a restless polymath ignoring the world around her and opting for an idiosyncratic, murky feeling that reflects her impulses." [...] In the Chicago Tribune, Kot wrote that [...] "art this deeply personal" [...] is rarely an easy listen, while Alex Macpherson of The Guardian deemed it a rewarding listen that [...] "demands to be explored." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's Christian Hoard was more critical, finding Badu's socially conscious lyrics unexceptional and too ambiguous, and some songs [...] "absent-minded doodles". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed it an enjoyable effort, citing [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] and [...] "The Cell" [...] as highlights, but <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the themes seemed dated {{in comparison to the}} music: [...] "When your funk is this futuristic, not to say abstract, astrology and Farrakhan sound old, not to say ignorant".

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{contributor}} Doug Pratt {{called it}} a [...] "high point" [...] of the first season. Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said of the episode, [...] "All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don't dare grab head on. South Park allegory {{of good and evil}} is more apt and knowing than anything seen on Christy or Touched by an Angel. Funnier too." [...] However, Littlefield also <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the show's graphic dialogue, like the phrase [...] "poop on a stick", was growing [...] "pretty darn redundant". Gary Budzak of The Columbus Dispatch described the [...] "Damien" [...] episode as perhaps [...] "the most outrageous yet". Virginia Rohan of The Record praised the episode, saying, [...] "The episode is funny, and ultimately, good does conquer evil, albeit for all the wrong reasons." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News called the episode [...] "awfully funny" [...] and praised its satirical element, although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers: [...] "A scene in which the kids offer profane between-rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick-skinned viewers wince a bit." [...] Likewise, Star-Ledger reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said, [...] "Tonight's episode is crazy, vulgar and borderline blasphemous; it is also, if you're in the right frame of mind, paralyzingly funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "The Open Door is a muddle of affections. Sonically, however, it captures the Evanescence mythos {{better and more}} {{consistently}} than the first album - after all, Lee now has no apologies of being the thinking man's nu-metal chick, now that she's a star". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the album [...] "less fun", [...] and <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the songs are similar to each other. St. Louis Post-Dispatchs Sara Berry critiqued, [...] " [...] sound remains essentially the same: the strange but amicable marriage of churning guitar riffs to lead singer Amy Lee's silky soprano". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called the album a 45-minute [...] "romantic piece" [...] and said, [...] "if [...] featured more open-throated crooning and less teeth-gritting anger {{it would be a}} much more interesting record". She also added that the sound of the album gets [...] "black and blacker" [...] and, [...] "Lyrics tend toward repetition of words like 'darkness,' 'haunting,' and 'rage'". Christa Titus of Billboard called it a [...] "far more nuanced, moody and richly textured effort" [...] than Fallen. Postmedia News gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "While it's similar in style and sound to its predecessor, The Open Door loses the punchy power rifts and instead persuades the listener with piano and airy vocals". Andre Farias of Christianity Today admitted that [...] "The sound is loud, yes, but it's almost indistinguishable from its predecessor—a disappointment considering the opus was nearly three-and-a-half years in the making".|$|E
500|$|New York Daily News writer David Hinckley said Lowe and Scott {{were strong}} {{additions}} to the show, and that Scott's character in Parks was better than his character in Party Down. Hinckley said the humor [...] "remains happily rooted in the show's eccentric characters", although he <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the jokes, like Andy's [...] "November" [...] song [...] "sometimes feels {{like a series of}} short sketches instead of a show". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell described Lowe as entertaining but [...] "one-note", but said Adam Scott was [...] "much more promising and nuanced", with better potential for a romantic interest for Leslie than previous guest stars like Will Arnett and Justin Theroux. Kandell felt Schneider's imminent departure from the series seemed unceremonious, and praised Nick Offerman's reactions of [...] "unbridled ecstasy" [...] at the idea of cutbacks and the government shutdown. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic expressed doubt about the long-term effectiveness of Lowe's character, and said the April and Andy subplot felt [...] "dragged out for yet another week". However, he praised the script, the addition of Scott, and the performance of the entire cast, especially Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari. Hochberger said, [...] "I'm not convinced Parks and Recreation could have a bad episode {{at this point in the}} season." [...] TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher felt [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was an especially important episode due to the addition of the Lowe and Scott characters, the beginning of Mark's exit from the series and the economic problems for Pawnee. However, Gallagher also said the episode felt mostly like a preparation for the third season.|$|E
