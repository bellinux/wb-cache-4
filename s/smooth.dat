Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into <b>smooth</b> curves, after which they evolve as any <b>smooth</b> curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and <b>smooth</b> boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes <b>smooth,</b> despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

Under this agreement, <b>Smooth</b> would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the <b>Smooth</b> Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the <b>Smooth</b> Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. <b>Smooth</b> would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that <b>Smooth</b> would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with <b>Smooth</b> Radio London.

The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains.

The bright, <b>smooth</b> plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains.
