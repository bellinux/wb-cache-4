5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

25|$|One sample {{preparation}} issue with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is possible matrix effects {{due to the}} presence of background molecules. These matrix effects have been shown to decrease the signal in methods such as PI and ESI by amounts as much as 60% depending on the sample being analyzed. The matrix effect can also cause an increase in signal, producing false positive results. This can be corrected by purifying the sample as much as possible before LC is performed, {{but in the case of}} analyzing environmental samples where everything in the sample is of concern, {{sample preparation}} may not be the ideal solution to fix the problem. Another method that can be applied to correct the issue is by using the <b>standard</b> <b>addition</b> method.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPolymer surface–peptide binding {{interactions}} {{have been}} shown previously to lead to reductions in peptide matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) ion signals. In previous studies, increases in surface–peptide binding were characterized by the increases in both the initially adsorbed and retained quantities of 125 I-radiolabeled peptides. The present studies establish a specific correlation between the peptide retention properties of the polymer surface and {{the reduction in the}} peptide MALDI ion signal. This correlation is demonstrated by obtaining MALDI mass spectra of angiotensin I applied to various polymer surfaces having a range of peptide adsorption and retention properties. In addition, the use of a MALDI based method of <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> is shown to allow the quantitation of the polymer surface–peptide retention affinity for angiotensin I and porcine insulin.

40|$|The {{interest}} in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral drugs has grown significantly since {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) became {{a standard of}} care in clinical practice.

Here, we apply MALDI-TOF/TOF technology to quantify abacavir, amprenavir, didanosine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and stavudine in the plasma of HIVinfected patients, by <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> analysis. Regression of <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> was linear over the whole anti-HIV concentration range explored (1. 00 X 10 (- 2) - 1. 00 pmol/mu L).

40|$|A method {{based on}} <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> to {{the sample was}} used to measure {{potassium}} (K) in human erythocytes with an ion-selective electrode. A computer program was de-veloped for rapid analysis of data obtained with the elec-trode. The analysis takes into account factors such as temperature that may affect electrode behavior. Results obtained by the method agree with those obtained by flame-emission spectroscopy. The coefficient of corre-lation between the two methods is 0. 96. Our method is simple and rapid. The computer program is applicable to other analyses with ion-selective electrodes. AddItIonal Keyphrases: computerized data handling flame-emission spectroscopy compared Concentrations of Na+, K+, and other ions in serum are routinely determined in clinical laboratories. Except for erythrocytes, however, intracellular ion content is seldom measured. Abnormalities in the concentrations of Na+ or K+, or both, in erythrocytes may be associated with a variety of hematologic disorders (1, 2) and ther-apeutic (3) conditions. We commonly examine the potassium content of erythrocytes by flame-emission spectroscopy, but the ready availability of several ion-selective electrodes prompted us to seek a simpler method. This paper de-scribes results of experiments in which potassium in erythrocytes from normal humans was determined both by K+selective electrode measurements with <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> of K to the sample and by flame emission spectroscopy. The electrode method is simple and easy. A computer program, developed for analysis of the <b>standard</b> <b>additions</b> data, compensates for physical factors affecting electrode behavior, such as tempera-ture, activity coefficient, valence, and ionic strength.
