30|$|In Fig.  4, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} in the {{calculation}} of objective function, <b>system</b> normal operation <b>status</b> and failure status are considered separately. In <b>system</b> normal <b>status,</b> the benefits B dir, B del, B env and life-cycle cost of BESS C tol are calculated through power flow calculation. In <b>system</b> failure <b>status,</b> reliability improvement benefit of BESS B rel is calculated through numerical calculation method proposed in this paper. In practice, there is only one operation line in BESS operation. For a precise calculation, the interaction between these two statuses should be taken into account. The influence of normal status on reliability improvement benefit B rel has been considered (through remaining capacity of BESS S res). However, compared to the total time of <b>system</b> normal <b>status,</b> the time span of <b>system</b> failure <b>status</b> is short making the influence of failure status on BESS normal operation relatively small. Thus, to simply the calculation process and on the premise of no big impact on the results, the influence of system failure on subsequent operation of BESS has been ignored in this paper.|$|R
