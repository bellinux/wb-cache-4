5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of <b>suicide,</b> included what constitutes <b>suicide,</b> whether or not <b>suicide</b> can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of <b>suicide.</b> Arguments as to acceptability of <b>suicide</b> in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for <b>suicide</b> as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} ad for General Motors {{featured a}} laid off assembly line robot contemplating <b>suicide,</b> which drew {{criticism from the}} American Foundation for <b>Suicide</b> Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad {{be taken off the}} air and the company's website. The <b>suicide</b> scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed <b>suicide.</b> Another died of complications eight years after a <b>suicide</b> attempt, and one made a failed <b>suicide</b> attempt.|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of studies, rural and urban <b>suicides</b> were {{compared}} and the psychological factors underlying suicidal behaviour investigated. In the first study <b>suicides</b> in a Nfid-Wales county were examined and contrasted {{with a group of}} urban <b>suicides.</b> The pattern of rural <b>suicides</b> was found to differ from the urban <b>suicides.</b> Rural <b>suicides</b> were more evenly spread through the age bands, mostly married and used more violent means of death. Farmers comprised a large proportion of rural <b>suicides</b> and seem to differ from rural <b>suicides</b> in general in that 88...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{includes}} {{the association of}} various attributes such as gender, age category of victims, social status, economic status, educational status, professional status, risk factors for <b>suicides,</b> means of <b>suicides,</b> etc. {{for the number of}} <b>suicides</b> in India during 2013 / 2014. At primary level, an odds ratio is calculated to measure an association between gender and risk factors for <b>suicides,</b> the means of <b>suicides.</b> Further, we use CA to study the association between various attributes related to the <b>suicides.</b> We summarize the conclusions and findings which may be helpful for policy makers, researchers, NGO’s, etc. to develop preventive measures of <b>suicides.</b>|$|R
25|$|As per National Crime Records Bureau, {{the number}} of <b>suicides</b> by farmers and farm labourers {{increased}} to 12,360 in 2014, against 11,772 in 2013. Of these <b>suicides,</b> 5,650 were farmers <b>suicides.</b>|$|R
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the <b>suicide</b> rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of <b>suicide</b> is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, <b>suicide</b> is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes towards <b>suicide</b> slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance. John Donne's work Biathanatos, {{contained}} {{one of the first}} modern defences of <b>suicide,</b> bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as Jesus, Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction <b>suicide</b> in certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between <b>suicide</b> and homicide, although <b>suicide</b> still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and {{by the middle of}} the 20th century, <b>suicide</b> had become legal in much of the western world. The term <b>suicide</b> first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E
50|$|Estimates {{for number}} of <b>suicides</b> in India vary. For example, one study {{projected}} 187,000 <b>suicides</b> in India in 2010, while official data by the Government of India claims 134,600 <b>suicides</b> in 2010.|$|R

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} <b>suicide</b> than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took <b>suicide</b> and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that <b>suicide</b> was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of <b>suicide</b> focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of <b>suicide</b> that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic <b>suicide</b> corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic <b>suicide.</b> This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic <b>suicide</b> occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic <b>suicide,</b> which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of <b>suicide</b> for prisoners.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, the National Crime Records Bureau of India {{reported}} 13,754 farmer <b>suicides.</b> Farmer <b>suicides</b> {{account for}} 11.2% of all <b>suicides</b> in India.

50|$|In Switzerland, a {{total of}} 742 {{assisted}} <b>suicides</b> (320 men, 422 women) was recorded for 2014, compared to 1,029 non-assisted <b>suicides</b> (754 men, 275 women); most of the assisted <b>suicides</b> concerned elderly people suffering from a terminal disease.|$|R
5|$|In India, <b>suicide</b> used to {{be illegal}} and {{surviving}} family could face legal difficulties. The Indian government repealed this law in 2014. In Germany, active euthanasia is illegal and anyone present during <b>suicide</b> may be prosecuted for failure to render aid in an emergency. Switzerland has recently taken steps to legalize assisted <b>suicide</b> for the chronically mentally ill. The high court in Lausanne, Switzerland, in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} <b>suicide,</b> abetment of <b>suicide,</b> and abetment {{of attempted}} <b>suicide</b> are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians {{are unable to}} claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths. However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Suicide</b> (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing <b>suicide</b> rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that {{stronger}} social control among Catholics results in lower <b>suicide</b> rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated <b>suicide</b> {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E
5000|$|The Foxconn <b>Suicides</b> were a {{spate of}} <b>suicides</b> linked to low pay at the {{so-called}} [...] "Foxconn City" [...] industrial park in Shenzhen, China, that occurred alongside several additional <b>suicides</b> at various other Foxconn-owned locations and facilities in Mainland China. Within 2010, there was 18 attempted <b>suicides</b> by Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees resulting in 14 deaths in the same year. The series of <b>suicides</b> drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn—one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers—were investigated by several of its customers, including Apple and Hewlett-Packard (HP).|$|R
40|$|Background: Railway <b>suicides</b> {{strongly}} impact {{psychological and}} socioeconomic {{aspects of the}} railway company, its employees and possible eye witnesses. We aimed to assess the incidence of railway <b>suicides</b> compared with the total burden of <b>suicides</b> in Germany and its time trend over a 10 -year observation period. Methods: From 1991 to 2000, a total of 8653 fatal railway <b>suicides</b> were recorded by the national central registry of all passenger accidents on the German railway net. To assess time trends, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) {{of the number of}} <b>suicides</b> was estimated using Poisson regression. Adjustments were made for two age groups and measures of availability. Results: Railway <b>suicides</b> accounted for 7. 0 % (annual range 5. 0 – 7. 9 %) of all <b>suicides</b> in Germany. The time trend of the number of <b>suicides</b> by all means declined, with a significant stronger decline for older subjects [AAPC 2. 2; 95 % confidence intercal (CI) 3. 0 to 1. 5; and 4. 2; 95 % CI 5. 2 to 3. 0]. An AAPC of 1. 8 % (95 % CI 0. 1 – 3. 4) indicated an increasing time trend of the number of railway <b>suicides</b> for subjects aged # 65 years, whereas, in contrast, fatal incidences for subjects aged> 65 years exhibited a strong decrease (AAPC 6. 2 %; 95 % CI 10. 9 to 1. 3). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates different time trends for railway <b>suicides</b> comparedwith all <b>suicides.</b> It underlines the urgent need for amplified research efforts in the particular field of railway <b>suicides.</b> Further examinations are recommended, in particular concernin...|$|R
