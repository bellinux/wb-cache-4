50|$|Charles Eryl Wynn-Williams (5 March 1903 - 30 August 1979), was a Welsh physicist, {{noted for}} his {{research}} on electronic instrumentation for use in nuclear physics. His work on the <b>scale-of-two</b> <b>counter</b> contributed {{to the development of}} the modern computer.|$|E
5000|$|Returning to Imperial College {{after the}} war, Wynn-Williams devoted himself {{largely to the}} {{development}} of practical undergraduate teaching, where he was an accomplished and much liked instructor. He became lecturer and ultimately reader in physics at Imperial. In 1957 he received the Physical Society's Duddell medal in recognition of his work on the <b>scale-of-two</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1932 Wynn-Williams {{published}} {{details of}} his thyratron-based <b>scale-of-two</b> <b>counter,</b> which allowed particles to be counted at much higher rates than previously. His devices became crucial unifying elements in the hardware of the emergent discipline of nuclear physics, as they opened up new avenues of research. They were widely copied in laboratories in Europe and the United States of America, often with advice from Wynn-Williams.|$|E
