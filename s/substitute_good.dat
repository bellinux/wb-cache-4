50|$|A <b>substitute</b> <b>good</b> is {{one good}} that be {{can be used}} instead of another. In {{consumer}} theory, substitute goods or substitutes are products that a consumer perceives as similar or comparable, so that having more of one product makes them desire less of the other product. Formally, X and Y are substitutes if, {{when the price of}} X rises, the demand for Y rises.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays many agents meet {{defensive}} expenditures {{to protect}} themselves against environmental deterioration. Such expenditures may contribute to support economic growth. Environmental degradation, in fact, may induce agents {{to work harder to}} replace depleted environmental <b>goods</b> with <b>substitute</b> <b>goods.</b> The consequent rise in the activity level may further deplete the environment, worsening the agents’ expectations on the future environmental quality and increasing their demand for <b>substitute</b> <b>goods.</b> To examine this issue, we adopt a simple model in which agents formulate expectations on the future environment that can be right or wrong and examine how such expectations influence capital accumulation and growth...|$|R
5000|$|Gross {{substitutes}} (GS) {{means that}} the agents regards the items as <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> or independent goods but not complementary goods. There are many formal definitions to this property, {{all of which are}} equivalent.|$|R
50|$|When income increases, {{the demand}} curve for normal goods shifts outward as {{more will be}} demanded at all prices, while the demand curve for {{inferior}} goods shifts inward due to the increased attainability of superior substitutes. With respect to related goods, {{when the price of}} a good (e.g. a hamburger) rises, the demand curve for <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> (e.g. chicken) shifts out, while the demand curve for complementary goods (e.g. tomato sauce) shifts in (i.e. there is more demand for <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> as they become more attractive in terms of value for money, while demand for complementary goods contracts in response to the contraction of quantity demanded of the underlying good).|$|R
50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity of demand, {{in contrast to a}} <b>substitute</b> <b>good.</b> This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a <b>substitute</b> <b>good,</b> meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{situation is}} that the item is simply not available. In that case the buyer can either abandon the intent of purchase completely, spend additional time (an implicit economic cost) in further search for the good, or purchase a <b>substitute</b> <b>good.</b> According to Kornai {{the purchase of a}} substitute is compulsory. Finally, {{it is possible that the}} consumer ends up purchasing a completely unrelated good, due to the income effect, simply in the hope that selling the unneeded item later will enable her to purchase the actual good she is seeking at a future time. This has the effect of increasing demand for other goods, simply because they are there, and can lead to the spread of shortages throughout the economy.|$|E
5000|$|In economics, one {{way that}} two or more goods can be {{classified}} is by examining {{the relationship of the}} demand schedules when the price of one good changes. This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption). [...] A <b>substitute</b> <b>good,</b> in contrast to a complementary good, is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift out. A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in.Examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, tea and coffee, beer and wine. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. Take for example, the demand for Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{may lead}} agents {{to increase their}} work effort to replace the consumption of depleted free access environmental goods with that of private <b>substitute</b> <b>goods.</b> The rise in the activity level that follows may further deplete the environment, which in turn increases the production and consumption of <b>substitute</b> <b>goods.</b> Using a North–South evolutionary model, we show {{that the existence of}} a coordination failure among interacting heterogeneous agents may lead the economy towards Pareto-dominated attracting stationary states where individuals work and produce “too much” (i. e. more than socially optimal). Finally, we analyse possible welfare effects of transferring the environmental impact of Northern production to the South and show that such a policy may decrease welfare in both hemispheres...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how the strength of protection for geographical indications (GIs) affects the GI industry 2 ̆ 7 s promotion incentives, equilibrium market outcomes, and the distribution of welfare. Geographical indication producers engage in informative advertising by associating their true quality premium (relative to a substitute product) with a specific label emphasizing the GI 2 ̆ 7 s geographic origin. The extent to which the names/words of the GI label can be used and/or imitated by competing products—which depends on the strength of GI protection—determines how informative the GI promotion messages can be. Consumers’ heterogeneous preferences (vis-à-vis the GI quality premium) are modeled in a vertically differentiated framework. Both the GI industry and the substitute product industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality <b>substitute</b> <b>good</b> have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the <b>substitute</b> <b>good</b> 2 ̆ 7 s producers prefer intermediate levels of protection (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers’ incentives to promote are preserved). For consumers and aggregate welfare, the preferred level of protection depends on the model 2 ̆ 7 s parameters, with an intermediate level of protection being optimal in many circumstances...|$|E

Further, changes in the prices of indexed bonds are positively related to the price of the nonindexed security. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{industry}} is formed by single-component producers whose components are combined to create composite goods. When a given firm has {{the possibility of}} merging with either a complement or a <b>substitute</b> <b>good</b> producer, its equilibrium choice depends {{on the degree of}} product differentiation in the composite good market. A merger between complements, which allows for mixed bundling, only happens when composite goods are very differentiated. Private incentives do not always go along with social interests and the equilibrium merger can differ from the socially optimal merger. After a merger, outsiders have also the opportunity to react and merge to other outsiders or to join the previous merge. merger, composite goods, substitutes, complements, pricing strategies, countermerger...|$|E
