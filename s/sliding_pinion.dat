The model that is on display in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, is an early model with a single cylinder and shaft drive. Model II also had a front-mounted, vertical, single-cylinder engine (with a 4.5in bore and a 4in stroke), wheel steering, <b>sliding</b> <b>pinion</b> gearbox, shaft drive and a bevel rear axle with a differential.|$|E

50|$|The clock {{movement}} had a balance wheel regulated to beat {{at the rate}} of 2 seconds. Its simple wheel train turned a dial marked on the margin with a scale of 24 equal hours and 10-minute intervals. The dial rotated anticlockwise against a fixed pointer, showing mean time, and could be adjusted if necessary by intervals of 10 minutes of time by <b>sliding</b> out a <b>pinion</b> of 12 teeth that meshed with the 144 teeth of the main dial. On each side of the clock dial was a fixed plate or 'tabula orientii', graduated with months and days of the Julian calendar for the purpose of determining the times of the rising and setting of the mean sun for the latitude of Padova (about 45°deg N). At the time the clock was made, the dates of the solstices were 13 June and 13 December (Old style or Julian Calendar).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a new gear surface roughness induced noise source model while taking into ac-count the sliding contacts between meshing gear teeth. The surface asperities on tooth surfaces are modeled as compact structural beam elements that radiate {{sound in the}} off-line of action after sliding impacts, against asperities of the meshing surface, occur. A linear time-varying (LTV) model of a spur gear pair (with slid-ing friction) is employed to calculate the instantaneous <b>sliding</b> velocity between <b>pinion</b> and gear teeth, which is then applied to the asperities as the initial condition. The transient sound field from the flexural motions of surface asperities (acoustically baffled along their axes), which are released from the cylindrical Hertzian contact zone in gear teeth, is computed. The modal superposition method is used for far and free field calcu-lations given the surface roughness and its (assumed) asperity distribution on the tooth profile. Typical sound pressure predictions show that the noise levels increase with operating speeds and surface roughness.

40|$|In this Master degree {{work there}} is a {{description}} of a safety clutch of a perforator with SDS + chuck. Perforrator‘s main purpose is to drill holes in concrete, metal and wood. Safety clutch purpose is to ensure safety of electrical engine from overworking, which occurs in drilling with drill bit or crown. Safety clutch starts working when electrical engines spins pinion which is placed on cylinder. Pinion is being presseed by the spring to the cylinder‘s knuckles. Drill bit is being placed in the cylinder and when drill bit stucks or if there‘s too high resistance, knuckle goes up and overcomes spings tensile strength – pinion‘s and cylinders knuckles excel. When safety clutch starts working, <b>pinions</b> <b>slide</b> at each other and as friction exists safety clutch‘s pinions worn out. Changing worned out pinions is not complicated, but price of repair takes up to 50 % of a new perforator price. In this Master Degree work {{there is a}} comparison of four similar types of perforator safety clutches. Parameters which are included in the comparison is maximum drilling diameter in concrete, perforator price, clutch elements and safety clutch elements repair price. According to these parameters, manufacturer‘s no. 4 clutch is decided to be the weakest link. Also there is stated clutch‘s stiffness coefficient – 333. According to the stiffness coefficient, spring pushes pinion with a force of 667 N or 6, 67 kg. Averange torque is also stated in this work, as it is needed to make safety clutch work – 73 Nm. In the researched safety clutch knuckles are changed by rolls – rolls can be repaired independently from other safety clutch‘s elements. Maximum torque is set which is needed to start the modernized clutch work. The max torque is 78 Nm...|$|R
40|$|The RH and LH pinions of {{main gearbox}} {{pertaining}} to a helicopter {{were sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination showed spalling on the loading flank of two teeth of the LH pinion. Detailed study carried out on the samples from the damaged teeth discovered that the spalling initiated {{at the bottom of the}} dedendum, and that the subsurface cracks propagated progressively upward. Initiation of spalling was observed all along the bottom of the dedendum in all the teeth. This was found to be due to excessive contact stresses resulting from tip biting. In general, the evidences on the flank surface suggested considerable <b>sliding</b> of the <b>pinion</b> instead of rolling. The meshing of the pinion did not appear to be healthy. It encompassed the entire tooth height right up to the top land. It may, however, be noted that no gear/pinion is designed to have such contact patterns. Hence, it is imperative that the elastic deformation of the tooth under full load was more than that of the anticipated design value. Also, when the load on the flank is excessively high, it would promote sliding rather than rolling, as seen in the present case. The RH pinion did not have any observable damage though it also showed meshing and contact patterns similar to that seen in case of LH pinion. However, metallographic study conducted on the cross section of the teeth indicated initiation of subsurface cracks on the loading flank of this pinion as well. The microstructure, composition and the surface hardness of the teeth were found to be satisfactory. The case depth on the loading flank was found to be in the range 0. 78 to 0. 89 mm for LH pinion and 0. 78 to 0. 87 mm for RH pinion. In summary, it is stated that the LH pinion has failed by spalling. Study also showed evidences of initiation of spalling in the RH pinion. Investigation revealed that all factors required for spalling were present, namely, unfavourable meshing, high load, and tip biting. From the analysis, it appears that deficiencies other than metallurgical factors were responsible for the premature spalling in the pinions...|$|R
