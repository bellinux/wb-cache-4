5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of a}} fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E
5|$|HMS Tiptoe (pennant number P332) was a British {{submarine}} of {{the third}} group of the T class. She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 February 1944. She {{was one of two}} submarines named by Winston Churchill, and so far has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named Tiptoe. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in Tromsø harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the Firth of Clyde where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with HMS Yarmouth. Although originally named for the ability to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> someone undetected, she maintained several links with ballet, including the Royal Ballet and ballet dancer Moira Shearer. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{use their}} {{camouflage}} {{to hunt and}} <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their prey. They swim at the bottom, where shrimp and crabs are found and shoot out a jet of water to uncover the prey buried in the sand. Then when the prey tries to escape, the cuttlefish open their eight arms and shoot out two long feeding tentacles to grab them. Each arm has a pad covered in suckers which grabs and pulls prey toward its beak, paralyzing it with venom before eating it. In order to achieve a hypnotic effect and stun prey before catching them, cuttlefish are also known to change color rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the style}} of play for both {{characters}} is slightly different, controlling each character is broadly similar. Each can move forward and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, sneak, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, with the same information available to the player; currently held weapons, ammo count, a compass with objectives marked, and current health points. Both characters can single and/or dual wield six shooters, or single wield other weapons, such as rifles. Both characters can also lean {{to the left and}} right without moving from their current position, and can interact with certain objects, such as health pick-ups (in the Xbox 360 version, health automatically regenerates over time), ammo and dropped weaponry. The main differences between the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower, he cannot jump as high as Billy, but he can kick heavy obstacles out of his way and take considerably more damage from enemy fire. Billy can move faster than Ray and is quieter, allowing him to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> enemies. He can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. Billy can also use two weapons Ray cannot - a whip, and a bow and arrow.|$|E

25|$|The Armenian army kept {{advancing}} {{and occupied}} most Armenian dominated {{villages in the}} Lori/Borchali province, then proceeded to enter the town Bolnisi-Knachen near heavily fought Katharinenfeld and rested only a few dozen kilometers away from the Georgian capital. Even though attacking Tbilisi was not a primary goal for the Armenians it was an alarming immediate threat to the Georgian government. The mobilization order was not issued earlier than December 18 and approved only 2 days later. Commander Jugheli {{was put in charge}} of the ill-disciplined Georgian National Guard troops in Katharinenfeld while general Akhmetashvili was appointed {{commander in chief of the}} Georgian army forces in the Lori theatre. Jugheli's 600 men encamped in a poorly and carelessly organised position without even posting guards allowing Armenian militia to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them over night and capture several canons and machineguns and position themselves on the roofs to surprise the Georgians. However, despite the momentum the Armenians had gained, the Georgians with Jugheli leading them while under attack managed to recapture the equipment in close combat and forced the Armenians out of town, but with heavy casualties, losing 30 killed and 70 wounded. The Armenians also suffered heavy losses during retreat with 100 killed and 100 taken prisoner when they were run down by Georgian cavalry led by colonel Cholokashvili. Georgian troops crossed the river Khram with the first main objective to crush the Armenian force in the Dhaget-Samshvilde area. The Armenian troops including 500 well entrenched militia were engaged by Georgian artillery and on 24 December the villages Daghet, Bolnisi, Kachen and Samshvilde were captured by the Georgian army eliminating most of the resistance in the process.|$|E
500|$|It was undeniable that Nelson had enemies. Floridian trappers envied {{his skill}} and viewed {{him as an}} {{outsider}} because he was from New Jersey.

500|$|Beyoncé is a {{fourteen}} track {{set with}} seventeen short films: a video for each audio track, two extra videos {{to accompany the}} two-part tracks [...] "Haunted" [...] and [...] "Partition", {{as well as a}} bonus video for [...] "Grown Woman", which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart. Departing from the traditional R leanings of its predecessor, 4 (2011), Beyoncés songs are predominantly alternative R. Hence, musically, the album may be located in the post-dubstep era, fusing electronic music with R and soul. The album's dark, moody production is more textured than previous releases and songs are characterized by heavy bass and loud hi-hats, as well as prominent synthesizers. A quality of restraint features among most songs [...] "with subdued pulses, ambient effects and throbbing grooves that <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> you, threatening to explode but only occasionally transforming".|$|E

Foghorn, believing that Dawg is [...] "lower than a snake full of buckshot", says that he could {{pay a visit to}} him and [...] "gently break him in two with my good right arm!"

500|$|Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, like {{previous}} Tomb Raider games, is a third-person action-adventure puzzle game. Players {{control the}} main series protagonist Lara Croft through {{the majority of}} the game. The majority of Lara's basic moves are carried over from the previous instalment, such as walking, jumping, climbing, swinging on ropes and standard gunplay. Her new moves include a small hop, army-crawling, hand-to-hand combat and a [...] "super-jump" [...] that can be performed while running. Lara can also <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> enemies and perform stealth attacks, flatten herself against walls and peer around corners. Lara's ability to sprint, present in the three previous entries in the series, is only available when the player opens a cabinet containing gas masks in the 'Galleries Under Siege' level. Her weapons arsenal is also modified from previous games, featuring new weapons such as a K2 Impactor stun gun and upgraded versions of weapons like the shotgun.|$|E
500|$|Batman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen {{and allowing the}} camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which {{is open to the}} player {{from the beginning of the}} game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use [...] "Detective Vision", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.|$|E

500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille [...] "a nearly {{flawless}} {{piece of}} popular art, {{as well as}} one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple [...] "thank you" [...] to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon." [...] Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients – abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication – to produce a warm and irresistible concoction." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} rubber-soled {{athletic shoes}} {{date back to}} 1876 in the United Kingdom, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company made plimsolls, or sandshoes, designed for the sport of croquet. Similar rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the United States by Humphrey O'Sullivan, based on Charles Goodyear's technology. The United States Rubber Company was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes {{under a variety of}} brand names, which were later consolidated in 1916 under the name, Keds. These shoes became known as, [...] "sneakers", because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to <b>sneak</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> another person. In 1964, the founding of Nike by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman of the University of Oregon introduced many new improvements common in modern running shoes, such as rubber waffle soles, breathable nylon uppers, and cushioning in the mid-sole and heel. During the 1970s, the expertise of podiatrists also became important in athletic shoe design, to implement new design features based on how feet reacted to specific actions, such as running, jumping, or side-to-side movement. Athletic shoes for women were also designed for their specific physiological differences.|$|E
