2500|$|Texas law {{provides}} for police officer discretion in arresting any person caught committing a misdemeanor, such as violating its mandatory seat belt laws. Violation of its seat belt law in 1999 was punishable with the maximum fine of $50.

Police officer Bart Turek, then with the city of Lago Vista, recognized Ms. Atwater and pulled her over. According to court records, witnesses observed that Atwater and her children remained in her pick up when Turek approached the driver's side window and aggressively jabbed his finger toward Atwater’s face. According to Atwater's complaint (allegations, previously supported by witnesses at the scene, that the court also presumed to be true for its purposes), Turek screamed at Atwater about the seatbelts, frightening her children. When Atwater calmly and in a normal tone requested that Turek lower his voice. Turek immediately yelled [...] "you’re going to jail." [...] According to the record, Atwater remained calm when Turek told her she was going to jail. She did not act suspiciously, she did not pose any threat to Turek, and she did not engage in any illegal conduct other than failing to wear a seat belt. Turek continued to verbally abuse Atwater, accusing her of not caring for her children.

40|$|Small-sided games (SSGs) are {{suggested}} as an excellent training tool to improve physiological capacities and simulate the high physiological demands of full-sized matches (Abrantes et al., 2012).

Results indicate an age-related difference in the physiological response during SSGs. Although similar duration and pitch sizes were used, the physiological demands were lower for the under- 19 team. Comparable results were observed in regular <b>soccer</b> <b>practices</b> of elite Portuguese soccer players (Abade et al., 2013).
