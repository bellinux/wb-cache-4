5|$|As {{a senior}} at Arizona State, he played left halfback and was {{recognized}} as one of the roughest and hardest runners in the country, and as one of the top defensive players as a safety. He also excelled as a punt returner, and had a two-game <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> which he returned four punts for touchdowns. Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college.|$|E

In 29 races, he had sixpole positions, nine top10 finishes, and finished 14th in season points. The team had a new workshop built during the season.|$|E

5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and again for a three-game <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E
5|$|Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} on both {{his left shoulder}} and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was {{appointed}} to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup {{for the second time in}} four years. Selwood's 33disposals, 11clearances, and 2goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50games. His involvement in 46victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50game <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46wins and 4losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced {{arrest on}} a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from {{comments}} made by Irwin about {{the actions of the}} Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came {{with the end of the}} 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2016, Johnson {{announced}} his retirement from the NFL after nine seasons. His 11,619 receiving yards rank third in a player's first nine seasons, trailing only Torry Holt (11,864) and Jerry Rice (11,776). Since Johnson was drafted by the Lions with the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, no player has more receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and 100-yard games (46) than Johnson through the 2015 season. Among those who have played in 100 career games in NFL history, no player has averaged more receiving yards per game than Johnson. Johnson's average of 86.1 receiving yards per game is 8.7 yards better than the next-closest player on that list, Torry Holt. His 5,137 receiving yards from 2011 to 2013 are the most by any player over a three-year <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> NFL history.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 Wolverines {{had entered}} the season coming off the school's winningest two-year <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> history, {{but it did not}} reach the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament after losing {{starters}} Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton to season-ending injuries in January. The 2015–16 team follows the first season in five years in which the school did not make the NCAA Tournament. In addition to the season-ending injuries for LeVert and Walton the prior season, the team was coming off an offseason which saw Spike Albrecht and Zak Irvin have surgeries. Albrecht retired from the sport in December, although he later changed his mind. Later that month, Levert had an injury that ended his season. He only played in one conference game. He led the team in many statistical categories {{at the time of his}} injury and made midseason watchlists for various major national awards.|$|E

5|$|Torres {{returned}} to the majors in 2009, as a reserve outfielder for the San Francisco Giants. In 2010, he became their everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter, winning the Willie Mac Award and helping the team win its first World Series since 1954. After the 2011 season (in which Torres battled injuries and lost playing time in September), he {{was traded to the}} New York Mets. He spent one season with the Mets, starting in center field for the most part except for a <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> which he platooned with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, before re-signing with the Giants in 2013. He was used in a platoon split with Gregor Blanco in 2013 before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in August. After going unsigned to begin 2014, Torres signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox in June, but opted out of his contract in late July after not getting called up.|$|E
5|$|In reply, Australia were {{in trouble}} at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were {{effectively}} eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard {{in the direction of}} Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full <b>stretch</b> <b>in</b> his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.|$|E
