25|$|Frank Gifford was the play-by-play announcer, while then-ABC Sports analyst Don Meredith and then-Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann {{served as}} color commentators. Al Michaels and Jim Lampley hosted the pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame (Lampley {{presided over the}} Vince Lombardi Trophy {{presentation}} ceremony) coverage for ABC. Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte {{was quoted in the}} January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game). Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Dick Schaap, Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips,</b> Jeff Greenfield, Judd Rose, and Bill Redeker.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{appeared}} as a correspondent on The Daily Show between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later {{form the basis for}} his Colbert Report persona, one that its creator calls a [...] "fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool". Colbert frequently cites <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> — whom he describes as having [...] "the greatest neck in journalism" [...] — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as Geraldo Rivera, [...] "because he's got this great sense of mission... He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report". As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, fellow correspondent Steve Carell, or host Jon Stewart in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing. Other Daily Show correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".|$|E

2500|$|Perverted-Justice and its {{volunteers have}} been criticized {{over the years by}} several {{individuals}} and organizations. Individuals opposing Perverted Justice see it as an organization that encourages extrajudicial violence and harassment against individuals who have not yet been convicted of any crime in the legal system.

2500|$|The host of The Colbert Report is Stephen Colbert, a [...] "self-important right-wing commentator", {{portrayed by}} his real-life namesake. The {{character}} incorporates aspects of Colbert's real life, but {{is primarily a}} parody of cable news pundits, particularly Bill O'Reilly of Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "Papa Bear". To this end, the character even incorporates O'Reilly's mannerisms, described as his [...] "pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures." [...] O'Reilly's use of [...] "talking points" [...] — illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions — are parodied on The Colbert Report with the segment [...] "The Word". [...] He initially incorporated long-winded, verbose metaphors to parody CNN correspondent Aaron Brown. In addition, the character was also heavily inspired by <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips,</b> Bill Kurtis and [...] "especially" [...] Geraldo Rivera. [...] "I loved the way Geraldo made reporting a story seem like an act of courage," [...] Colbert told a reporter in 2012.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, Stone presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, <b>Stone,</b> Wendell <b>Phillips</b> and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, <b>Stone</b> and <b>Phillips</b> addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy {{that he be}} given {{a copy of the}} Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church Of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool. Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> on Dateline NBC, Dahmer had stated: [...] "If a person doesn't {{think that there is a}} God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Colbert Report premiered in October 2005. The {{first guest}} was <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips,</b> a partial {{influence}} on the character. In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word truthiness, defined as [...] "a quality characterizing a [...] "truth" [...] that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively [...] "from the gut" [...] or because it [...] "feels right" [...] without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts." [...] was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment [...] "Better Know a District" [...] in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb. In one early episode, the Colbert character purported to be {{a former member of}} a 1980s new wave group, Stephen & the Colberts, and released a fictional music video from the band for the song [...] "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believed}} {{the version of}} the incident as told by the four men – that they were merely panhandling with neither intimidation nor threats of violence. This view was later discredited when Cabey admitted in a newspaper interview that his friends had indeed intended to rob Goetz, who looked like [...] "easy bait". Some saw the incident as racial (with Goetz being white and the four young men black), and the jury verdict as a blow to race relations. Benjamin Hooks, director of the NAACP, said [...] "The jury verdict was inexcusable. [...] It was proven – according to his own statements – that Goetz did the shooting and went far {{beyond the realm of}} self-defense. There was no provocation for what he did." [...] Representative Floyd Flake agreed, saying, [...] "I think that if a black had shot four whites, the cry for the death penalty would have been almost automatic." [...] Co-counsel for Cabey C. Vernon Mason, a candidate for district attorney who was later disbarred, said Goetz's actions were racist, as did the Rev. Al Sharpton. Organized demonstrators accused Goetz of genocide. Goetz's racial language about criminal activity on 14th Street, allegedly made at a community meeting 18 months before the shooting – [...] "The only way we're going to clean up this street is {{to get rid of the}} spics and niggers" [...] – was offered as evidence of racial motivation for the shooting. Black political and religious leaders twice called for Federal civil rights investigations. An investigation by the office of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani determined that the impetus for the shooting had been fear, not race. In an interview with <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> of Dateline NBC, Goetz later admitted that his fear was enhanced due to the fact that the alleged muggers were black.|$|E
25|$|According to Rolling <b>Stone,</b> Julia <b>Phillips,</b> the {{producer}} of films like Taxi Driver and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was interested in shooting a movie based on the song's story.
