5|$|We tried {{a similar}} {{approach}} for The Little Shop of Horrors, dropping {{in and out of}} various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table with us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E
25|$|Elgar {{described}} how {{on the evening}} of 21 October 1898, after a tiring day's teaching, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano. A melody he played caught the attention of his wife, and he began to improvise variations on it in styles which reflected the character of some of his friends. These improvisations, expanded and orchestrated, became the Enigma Variations. Elgar considered including variations portraying Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, but was unable to assimilate their musical styles without pastiche, and dropped the idea.|$|E
25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E

500|$|Finally, while I {{was visiting}} Andrew at his country estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he {{suddenly}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano {{and played the}} most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless to say, I grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The {{vast majority of the}} original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement when he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it {{to a level of}} spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the first}} time I had heard this great artist play. [...] He was most amiable at the rehearsal.... To this day I can recall how Rubinstein <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano, his leonine head thrown back slightly, and began the five opening {{measures}} of the principal theme.... It seemed to me I had never before heard the piano really played. [...] The grandeur of style with which Rubinstein presented those five measures, the beauty of tone his softness of touch secured, the art with which he manipulated the pedal, are indescribable ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this info immediately... Ethel then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> typewriter which she placed on a bridge table in the living room and proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|The Grotto {{was first}} {{established}} on St. Mary's Mountain in 1805 by the university's founder, Father John DuBois. According to legend, Father DuBois {{was attracted to}} a light on the mountain and found a blessed spot and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of a large oak tree beside a stream. He made a cross of twigs and fixed it to the tree to be {{the symbol of the}} holy work he was undertaking. This was the original Grotto. Father Simon Bruté was an early steward of the Grotto. He created pathways throughout the grounds and attached crosses to the trees that now line the Stations of the Cross along the entrance. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton attended Sunday Mass at the Grotto chapel. The 1911 book The Story of the Mountain tells how Mother Seton would sit on her favorite rock at the Grotto and [...] "invoke the divine blessing by reciting the Canticle of the Three Children, and none that heard her could ever forget the tones of that voice and the fervor of that heart, which {{in the midst of the}} wild scenery of nature called upon all creatures to bless and magnify their Creator." [...] Her rosary walks around the Grotto were re-enacted in 2005 to celebrate its 200th anniversary.|$|E

60|$|He led me resistlessly to the seat, {{away from}} {{the noise of the}} regimental band and the dancers, and then <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far end from me, like a great surly bear that he was.|$|R
