40|$|Pb {{levels were}} {{measured}} in tissues of small mammals (Microtus agrestis, Apodemus flavicollis, Sorex araneus and Crocidura leucodon), inhabiting <b>shooting</b> <b>ranges</b> of the Slovenian Army (Apače, Bač, Bloška polica, Crngrob, Mačkovec, Poček); in addition, Pb content was analysed in their diet as well. The present research was {{performed with the}} aim to confirm the use of small mammals as bioindicators of Pb contamination of <b>shooting</b> <b>ranges</b> and to performthe risk assessment of military <b>shooting</b> <b>ranges</b> for small mammals. Increased Pb levels were determined in livers of small mammals, inhabiting theshooting ranges. Food {{is probably the most}} significant route of Pb exposurefor small mammals since the elevated concentrations of Pb were measured in grasses, clovers, herbs and earthworms, sampled at the <b>shooting</b> <b>ranges.</b> On the basis of presented results we suggest that <b>shooting</b> <b>ranges</b> could pose an elevated risk for receptor organisms (Microtus agrestis), although Pb concentrations relatively quickly decreased with distance from backstop berms, which are particularly loaded with Pb...|$|R

5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the <b>shooting</b> <b>range</b> of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the <b>shooting</b> <b>range</b> of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's <b>shooting</b> <b>range.</b> Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, {{with the}} {{cemetery}} fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic, the LSWR agreed {{to build a}} mainline station at Brookwood, along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard, provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster's house for the new station. The new station, called Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station (the suffix was gradually dropped), opened on 1 June 1864. A substantial commuter village grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station, and the station building (on the northern side of the tracks) was enlarged in 1890. In conjunction with these works, a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association's <b>shooting</b> <b>range</b> at Bisley, running west {{to the north of}} the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley.|$|E
