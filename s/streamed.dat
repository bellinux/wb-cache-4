40|$|At {{the moment}} most <b>streaming</b> servers built with only 1 source. Not closed the {{possibility}} that the <b>streaming</b> server can have more than 1 source. The concept of <b>streaming</b> server system that has many sources is called the Multi-source <b>Streaming</b> Server (MSS). To be able to enjoy video <b>streaming</b> from the MSS system is required a terminal access. This terminal access has several sections, that is de-encapsulator, demultiplexer, and displayer block. MSS concept which has several <b>streaming</b> server, before transmit the AV <b>stream</b> will advance to multiplexing AV <b>streams</b> from several <b>streaming</b> server that will be transmitted to the same one link. So one packet AV <b>stream</b> has some AV <b>streams</b> from several <b>streaming</b> servers. Displayer is a video <b>streaming</b> player application that will be designed using the Java Media Framework (JMF). In general, video <b>streaming</b> players applications has facilities like play, pause, and stop, so this application will have the same facilities. Because the MSS system has a lot of <b>streaming</b> servers, then this player application has additional facilities to choose video <b>streaming</b> from <b>streaming</b> server that the user want.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for <b>stream</b> data processing that incorporates a <b>stream</b> database server as a fundamental component. The server operates as the <b>stream</b> control interface between arrays of distributed data <b>stream</b> sources and end-user clients that access and analyze the <b>streams.</b> The underlying framework provides novel <b>stream</b> management and query processing mechanisms to support the online acquisition, management, storage, non-blocking query, and integration of data <b>streams</b> for distributed multi-sensor networks. In this paper, we define our <b>stream</b> model and <b>stream</b> representation for the <b>stream</b> database, and we describe the functionality and implementation of key components of the <b>stream</b> processing framework, including the query processing interface for source <b>streams,</b> the <b>stream</b> manager, the <b>stream</b> buffer manager, nonblocking query execution, and {{a new class of}} join algorithms for joining multiple data <b>streams</b> constrained by a sliding time window. We conduct experiments using real data <b>streams</b> to evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against traditional <b>stream</b> join algorithms. The experiments show significant performance improvements and also demonstrate the flexibility of our system in handling data <b>streams.</b> A multi-sensor network application for the intelligent detection of hazardous materials is presented to illustrate the capabilities of our framework...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines <b>streaming</b> media both as {{a technological}} innovation and cultural practice that co-configures audience and industry. Strategies and tactics provide a theoretical framework for understanding <b>streaming</b> media. <b>Streaming</b> is theorized as a tactic; wherein audiences momentarily buck against the strategic logic of media conglomerates and copyright regimes. However, <b>streaming,</b> concomitantly, is an audience tactic and a strategic logic of an emergent <b>streaming</b> industry. This results in the blurring between first and third party and sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> In this dissertation, I parse out what are the nascent <b>streaming</b> logics within this burgeoning industry and how they constitutively shape and re-shape audiences and traditional broadcasting logics. Five typologies of <b>streaming</b> serve as conceptual tools for deepening our understanding of <b>streaming</b> media and technology. The first is <b>streaming</b> as a recent technological advancement, divided into software and hardware categories. The second conceptual framework is a typology of <b>streaming</b> that divides <b>streaming</b> into first and third party sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> The third is <b>streaming</b> as an emergent industry. The fourth is <b>streaming</b> as a discourse, and the final typology divides <b>streaming</b> based on geography as transnational <b>streaming,</b> national <b>streaming,</b> and diasporic <b>streaming.</b> All of these classifications {{lay the groundwork for}} the further conceptualization of this important and emergent socio-technical practice...|$|R

50|$|In the {{application}} of the Strahler <b>stream</b> order to hydrology, each segment of a <b>stream</b> or river within a river network is treated as a node in a tree, with the next segment downstream as its parent. When two first-order <b>streams</b> come together, they form a second-order <b>stream.</b> When two second-order <b>streams</b> come together, they form a third-order <b>stream.</b> <b>Streams</b> of lower order joining a higher order <b>stream</b> do not change the order of the higher <b>stream.</b> Thus, if a first-order <b>stream</b> joins a second-order <b>stream,</b> it remains a second-order <b>stream.</b> It is not until a second-order <b>stream</b> combines with another second-order <b>stream</b> that it becomes a third-order <b>stream.</b> As with mathematical trees, a segment with index i must be fed by at least 2i &minus; 1 different tributaries of index 1.

The mean <b>stream</b> lengths were calculated using the formula of total <b>stream</b> length of order divided by total number of <b>stream</b> segments of order. The mean <b>stream</b> length is higher in less <b>stream</b> order, and lesser in high <b>stream</b> order is due to variations in slope and topography. The mean <b>stream</b> length is 1622  km in the study area. The mean <b>stream</b> length {{is directly related to}} mean annual runoff; therefore, the highest mean <b>stream</b> length has relatively high mean annual rainfall runoff and relatively low mean annual rainfall runoff in less mean <b>stream</b> length.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 <b>Stream</b> {{temperature}} is a water quality parameter that directly influences {{the quality of}} aquatic habitat, particularly for cold-water species such as Pacific salmonids. Forest harvesting adjacent to a <b>stream</b> can {{increase the amount of}} solar radiation the <b>stream</b> receives, which can elevate <b>stream</b> temperatures and impair aquatic habitat. Oregon Forest Practice Rules mandate that forest operators leave Riparian Management Areas (RMAs) adjacent to <b>streams</b> in order to minimize the water quality impacts from forest harvesting. However, RMAs that contain overstory merchantable conifers are not required for small non-fish-bearing <b>streams</b> in Oregon, thus there is potential for increases in <b>stream</b> temperature to occur in headwater <b>streams</b> after harvesting. There is concern that increases in <b>stream</b> temperatures and changes to onsite processes in non-fish-bearing, headwater <b>streams</b> may propagate downstream and impair habitat in fish-bearing <b>streams.</b> The objectives of the following work are to assess the effects of contemporary forest management practices on <b>stream</b> temperatures of small non-fish-bearing headwater <b>streams</b> and to develop new knowledge regarding the physical processes that control reach-level <b>stream</b> temperature patterns. Summer <b>stream</b> temperatures were measured for five years in six headwater <b>streams</b> in the Hinkle Creek basin in southern Oregon. After four years, four of the <b>streams</b> were harvested and vegetated RMAs were not left between the <b>streams</b> and harvest units. The watersheds of the two remaining <b>streams</b> were not disturbed. Post-harvest <b>stream</b> temperatures were monitored for one year in all six <b>streams.</b> Each harvested <b>stream</b> was paired with one unharvested <b>stream</b> and regression relationships for maximum, minimum and mean daily <b>stream</b> temperatures were developed. Changes to temperatures of harvested <b>streams</b> were detected by comparing the mean pre-harvest regression relationship to the mean post-harvest relationship. Change detection analyses that considered the mean response among all four harvested <b>streams</b> indicated that maximum daily <b>stream</b> temperatures did not increase after harvesting, but that minimum and mean daily temperatures decreased significantly after harvesting. Additionally, diel <b>stream</b> temperature fluctuations were significantly greater one year after harvesting. Pre- and post-harvest surveys of canopy closure in the harvested and unharvested <b>streams</b> were completed in order to compare levels of <b>stream</b> shading before and after harvest. The post-harvest survey quantified canopy closure from remaining overstory vegetation as well as from logging slash that partially covered the harvested <b>streams.</b> The surveys indicated that mean overstory canopy closure in the harvested <b>streams</b> decreased by 84...|$|R
