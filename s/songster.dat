5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main <b>songster</b> and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

25|$|In 1876 Dresser {{secured a}} job as an organist and singer with the Lemon Brothers, a {{traveling}} minstrel group from Marshall, Illinois. Dresser stayed with the group for more than a year, performing as an actor and singer, before they disbanded near the end of 1877. Next, Dresser went to Chicago, where John Austin Hamlin hired him to sing and perform in his traveling shows marketing Wizard Oil, a patent medicine. Dresser composed his first songs while working for Hamlin. They were marketed as the Paul Dresser <b>Songster</b> (a songbook of sheet music) and sold to audiences after his performances.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Songsters</b> {{generally}} {{performed a}} wide variety of folk songs, ballads, dance tunes, reels and minstrel songs. Initially, they were often accompanied by non-singing [...] "musicianers", who often played banjo and fiddle. Later, as the guitar became more widely popular, the <b>songsters</b> often accompanied themselves.|$|R

500|$|Goldfarb was {{a talented}} musician, known {{to this day}} as {{composer}} of popular tunes for the songs [...] "Shalom Aleichem" [...] and [...] "Magein Avot" [...] used in most Ashkenazi synagogues. With his brother Samuel E. Goldfarb, he compiled The Jewish <b>Songster</b> for schoolchildren, the first American collection of Jewish songs. Israel Goldfarb also served as Professor of Liturgical Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1920 to 1944, and in 1949 founded the School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College.|$|E
500|$|The nondescript brown honeyeater has a {{noteworthy}} song, usually {{described in}} superlatives. [...] "A glorious voice, easily the best <b>songster</b> among Australian honeyeaters," [...] is how {{one study of}} West Australian birds noted. [...] "As a singer it has no superior among the honeyeater family, or for that matter, among Australian birds," [...] said another report. It has a clear, rolling, musical call, rendered as sweet-sweet-quarty-quarty, which is very loud for {{the size of the}} bird. Both sexes call, usually early in the morning, though the male calls throughout the day during the breeding season. The alarm call is a harsh ke-ke given several times at short intervals.|$|E
2500|$|One of Bloxam's most {{well-known}} bird collections was the Oahu thrush, which he originally called Turdus woahensis (now Myadestes lanaiensis woahensis). Bloxam's 1825 specimens {{are the only}} ones in existence, since this rather dull olive-brown thrush-like bird was the first bird species in the Hawaiian islands to become extinct. Bloxam recorded that it was common and that its [...] "melodious notes" [...] came from the only <b>songster</b> on the island of Oahu. Another of his scientific discoveries was the Oahu ʻakepa, which he named Fringilla rufa (now Loxops wolstenholmei or L. coccineus wolstenholmei). This bird too is now extinct.|$|E

2500|$|The century {{also saw}} Birmingham {{emerge as the}} centre of a vibrant and {{sophisticated}} culture of popular street literature, as the town's printers produced increasing numbers of the broadsides and chapbooks that formed the primary reading matter of the poor. Cheaply printed and carrying traditional songs, newly written ballads on topical matters, simple folk-tales with wood-cut illustrations, and news – particularly salacious coverage of gruesome crimes, executions, riots and wars – broadsides and chapbooks were sold or exchanged by itinerant chapmen – also called [...] "patterers" [...] or [...] "ballad-mongers" [...] – who often displayed their goods in the street on a small table or pinned to a wall. Although much of this work was by its nature ephemeral and low in literary quality, Birmingham was unusual in that the town's high level of social mobility meant that printers of street literature often overlapped with printers of weightier material, some writers of street literature were highly educated and of respectable social standing, and several writers of Birmingham broadside ballads had a lasting influence on the town's literary culture. Job Nott – probably a pseudonym of Theodore Price of Harborne – was a largely conservative figure who produced {{a wide range of}} pamphlets and broadsides on topical matters, attracting imitators as far afield as Bristol. John Freeth's influence was even greater: nearly 400 of his political ballads were published and distributed nationally in a dozen separate collections between 1766 and 1805, the best-known being his 1790 collection The Political <b>Songster.</b> An outstanding figure in the radical circles of the late-Georgian town, he hosted the Birmingham Book Club at John Freeth's Coffee House, giving him a national political importance and placing him at the heart of Birmingham's developing political self-consciousness during the upheavals of the American Revolution.|$|E

It is possible however--and one willingly supposes so--that Shelley singled out the nightingale for mention, in recognition of the consummate beauty of Keats's Ode to the Nightingale, published in the same volume with Hyperion. The epithet 'lorn' may also be noted in the same connexion; as Keats's Ode terminates with a celebrated passage in which 'forlorn' is the leading word (but not as an epithet for the nightingale itself)-- ...|$|E

Steffani was so taken with Ronalde's voice and whistling (he referred to him as [...] "the Pink of Perfection"), that he disbanded the Silver <b>Songsters</b> (in 1947) and became his personal manager, mentor and chaperone.

5000|$|<b>Songsters</b> had {{a notable}} {{influence}} on blues music, which developed {{from around the}} turn of the 20th century.

Blues singers, in contrast, tended to invent their own lyrics (or recycle those of others) and develop their own tunes and guitar (or sometimes piano) playing styles, singing of their own lives and shared emotional experiences.|$|R
