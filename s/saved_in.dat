5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were <b>saved.</b> <b>In</b> contrast the 1934-S dollar was not <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E

In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot {{was the first one}} to be <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E
5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have <b>saved.</b> <b>In</b> other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E

5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|In January 1833, {{strong winds}} forced {{the old and}} poorly built Jaguaripe aground off Santa Marta beach in the {{southern}} province of Santa Catarina, where it sank. Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio {{and his younger brother}} Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig Vinte e nove de agosto (the same ship he had <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. The last time {{he had been in the}} province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (São Luís) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque Urânia in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig Constança (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).|$|E

Braathens had contacted British Airways, but they had stated {{that they did not}} wish to purchase Braathens. The deal with SAS was initiated by Braathens; they stated that this would allow the two companies to cooperate to eliminate the overcapacity in the domestic market. Because both airlines operated a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, about NOK150 million could be <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> maintenance. The agreement also involved that Malmö Aviation would have to be sold before the take-over. If not, the Braathens family would purchase the airline for NOK1. At the same time, the family-owned companies guaranteed for about NOK1 billion in the Swedish subsidiary.|$|E

On 22 September 2015, Balotelli scored his first goal {{after returning to}} Milan on his third appearance to open the scoring in the 5th minute from a free kick at 25 yards out against Udinese in a 3–2 away win. However, a week later he suffered a groin injury in a 1–0 defeat to Genoa on 27 September, requiring surgery and ruling him out for three months.

On 1 May, he had his penalty <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> a 3–3 home draw against Frosinone, for which he was mocked by opponent Mirko Gori. Balotelli finished the season with only one goal in 20 league appearances, as Milan finished the season in seventh place, once again failing to qualify for Europe following their 1–0 defeat to Juventus in the 2016 Coppa Italia final.|$|E

5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fourth level are found in the second level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fifth level are found in the third level, and the keys that unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{funded by}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local {{supporters}} for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.|$|E

5|$|The Namib Desert Horses were {{originally}} forced {{to compete with}} domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed. Due in part to this competition for limited forage, the horses nearly became extinct. However, they were <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> {{part due to the}} efforts of Jan Coetzer, employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine (CDM or DBCM), mining in part of Sperrgebiet. Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977, when diesel locomotives took over the route. The horses, who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives, were placed in danger when the pumping stopped, with several horses dying of dehydration. Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water, which they did in 1980, installing holding tanks and a water trough. Between 1964 and 1984, population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses, but generally averaged 140 to 160. In 1984, an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses, while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals.|$|E
5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a {{financial}} planner in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, and invest the money they <b>saved</b> <b>in</b> mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E
