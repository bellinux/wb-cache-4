40|$|A special {{humanoid}} {{neck with}} low motion noise requirements yields a cable-driven parallel mechanism {{to imitate the}} rotational motion of a human neck. The fixed base and moving platform of the mechanism are connected by four cables and a column compression spring. The four cables are actuated separately, while the spring can support weight on the moving platform. Although similar mechanisms exist in the literature, the analysis of them is scarce because a flexible spring instead of a rigid kinematic chain is used as the spine. With the <b>springs</b> lateral <b>buckling</b> motion, a new approach must be adopted to solve the kinematics. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the kinematics with the statics to solve them simultaneously. The configuration of the moving platform is parameterized with four parameters, {{one of which is}} considered as parasitic motion. Using the <b>springs</b> lateral <b>buckling</b> equation, we can obtain the parasitic motion and solve the inverse position problem. The optimal design for cable placements is then performed to minimize the actuation force. The method in this paper provides a novel way to analyze parallel mechanisms with a spring spine and it can be applied to other mechanisms with flexible spines. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan.

The system has been successfully used to model a variety of physical processes, such as stiffening <b>springs,</b> beam <b>buckling,</b> nonlinear electronic circuits, superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers, and ionization waves in plasmas. Despite the simplicity of the Duffing oscillator, the dynamical behavior is extremely rich and research is still going on today [32].|$|R

Moreover, for the superelastic materials, the linear relationship between force and displacement is appropriate only in the low-strain region.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} deformation {{shape of a}} cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion was carried out briefly. Deformation shapes at different covered width of lateral explosive were recovered experimentally. Based on the experimental results, a corresponding analytical approach has been undertaken with rigid plastic hinge theory. In the analytical model, the cylindrical shell is divided into end-to-end rigid square bars. Deformation process of the cylindrical shell is described by using the translations and rotations of all rigid square bars. Expressions of the <b>spring</b> force, <b>buckling</b> moment, and deflection angle between adjacent rigid square bars are conducted theoretically. Given the structure parameters of the cylinder {{and the type of}} the lateral explosive charge, deformation processes and shapes are reported and discussed using the analytical approach. A good agreement has been obtained between calculated and experimental results, and thus the analytical approach can be considered as a valuable tool in understanding the deformation mechanism and predicting the deformation shapes of the cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion. Finally, parametric studies are carried out to analyze the effects of deformation shape, including the covered width of the lateral explosive, explosive charge material, and distribution of initial velocity...|$|R
40|$|High flexural-rigid {{cross beams}} {{at the joints}} of a main beam can {{function}} as restraining members to prevent rotation during lateral torsional buckling (LTB). With less flexural-rigid members, joint rotation results in a decrease of the main beam’s LTB critical moment. This paper elucidates the cross beam’s minimum flexural rigidity to prevent the main beam’s joint rotation during torsional buckling. It is assumed that material behaves elastically, the beam’s web doesn’t undergo distortions, and shear forces effects are neglected. The cross-beam’s flexural rigidity is represented by a spiral <b>spring.</b> Under <b>buckling,</b> this <b>spring</b> produces a torque moment, proportional to the joint rotation. The torque will disturb the main beam’s LTB equation system. By adjusting the spring constant, the joint rotation is minimized, thus reducing the torque’s disturbing effect within the equation. By neglecting this effect, the LTB equations at all fields of main beam are identical to the general buckling equations for constant moments. For n cross beams, 4 (n+ 1) integration constants are resulted. By applying the boundary conditions at beam ends and utilizing the geometry and natural boundary conditions at the joints, 4 (n+ 1) homogeneous equations for the integration constant are obtained. By conducting the trial and error method, the critical moment resulting in a zero determinant for the homogeneous equation coefficient matrix is acquired. Then, the LTB first-mode deformation shape can be drawn. The analysis shows that to achieve the critical moment, a main beam having a cross beam located at mid span needs the most optimum (smallest) flexural rigidity of cross beam than when it is in other locations (L/ 2). Observing the first-mode shape, for a certain spring constant value, the rotation at the joint will approach zero...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a finite element {{programme}} for material and geometric nonlinear analysis, has been modified with pre- and post-data processing and eigenvalue solution. More efficient methods to solve elastic and inelastic eigenvalue and eigenvectors {{have been developed}} to deal with stability problems in structures with arbitrary shape, irregular stiffness, loads and boundary conditions. The Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) with the facilities of elastic <b>spring</b> restraints, <b>buckling</b> under coupled loads, different load locations has been developed and programmed by the author. It has been applied to reveal the basic behaviour and the interaction between the modes of light gauge steel members. It has been found that the AISI design approach with elastic bucking stresses obtained using GBT can be used to correctly predict the strength of compression thin-walled columns. Three different types of widely used light gauge steel members, namely rack columns, purlins and decks, have been analyzed using both FEM and GBT. The comparison of results from the numerical analyses and comprehensive tests agrees well. The author has risen to the challenge of complicated buckling problems and a pseudo-plastic design procedure for a continuous purlins and roof decks has been established {{in order to make the}} best us of the materials. Through the highly complex analyses, some important conclusions for composite deck profiles in the wet concrete stage have been obtained. The ECCS and AISI design approaches for bending have been found to be conservative when the deck is subject to plastic buckling or strength failure. The calculation of the ultimate web crippling load without consideration of bending moment is awkward and further light is shed on this topical problem. The influence of dimples in reducing the deck bending resistance mainly depends on the flange slendernes...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for self-excited vibration of an automotive wiper. The self-excited vibration is generated by a stick-slip motion. It is of practical importance to suppress the self-excited vibration of the wiper. To find out modal coupling in the vibration of the wiper, simplified wiper is constructed. Movement of simplified wiper is separated into horizontal and vertical directions to simulate a motion of the actual wiper. The simplified wiper and the actual wiper are used for experiments. Static deformation of a wiper blade is measured. The blade is pressed on a glass surface. The wiper blade shows characteristics of soft-hardening <b>spring</b> involving a <b>buckled</b> deformation. Modal coupling in the self-excited vibration is examined by sweeping the wiper on a rotating glass table with constant angular velocity. Increasing a load pressed on the blade, coupling vibration is generated due to self-excitations along glass surface and parametric movements in vertical direction. The vibration amplitude is suppressed extremely when the load {{is close to the}} buckling load. Moreover, the maximum Lyapnov exponent of the dynamic response shows least number of the modes contributed to the self-excited vibration...|$|R
40|$|Eccentric contractions {{can affect}} musculotendon {{mechanical}} properties and disrupt muscle proprioception, but their behavioral consequences are poorly understood. We tested whether repeated eccentric contractions of plantarflexor muscles of one leg affected the dexterity of either leg. Twenty healthy male subjects (27. 3 +/- 4. 0 yrs) compressed a compliant and slender <b>spring</b> prone to <b>buckling</b> with each isolated leg. The maximal instability they could control (i. e., the maximal average sustained compression force, or lower extremity dexterity force, LEDForce) quantified the dexterity of each leg. We found that eccentric contractions {{did not affect}} LEDForce, but reduced force variability (LEDSD). Surprisingly, LEDForce increased in the non-exposed, contralateral leg. These effects were specific to exposure to eccentric contractions because an effort-matched exposure to walking did not affect leg dexterity. In the exposed leg, eccentric contractions (i) reduced voluntary error corrections during spring compressions (i. e., reduced 0. 5 - 4 Hz power of LEDForce); (ii) did not change spinal excitability (i. e., unaffected H-reflexes); and (iii) changed {{the structure of the}} neural drive to the alpha-motoneuron pool (i. e., reduced EMG power within the 4 - 8 Hz physiological tremor band). These results suggest that repeated eccentric contractions alter the feedback control for dexterity in the exposed leg by reducing muscle spindle sensitivity. Moreover, the unexpected improvement in LEDForce in the non-exposed contralateral leg was likely a consequence of crossed-effects on its spinal and supraspinal feedback control. We discuss the implications of these bilateral effects of unilateral eccentric contractions, their effect on spinal and supraspinal control of dynamic foot-ground interactions, and their potential to facilitate rehabilitation from musculoskeletal and neuromotor impairments...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of beam-web shear buckling and flange buckling {{at the ends}} of steel beams is very commonly observed during full-scale fire tests. This can affect the behaviour of the steel beams, as well as on their adjacent connections, under fire conditions. This phenomenon has not previously been sufficiently investigated and cannot be simulated in high-temperature global frame analysis, which could potentially lead to unrealistic results being used in structural fire engineering design. In this research, a component-based beam-end buckling element has for the first time been created for Class 1 and 2 beams. The beam-end buckling element is composed of nonlinear springs, respectively representing the buckling of beam flange and web, also considering the interaction between these two <b>buckling</b> phenomena. Each <b>spring</b> is able to deal with loading-unloading-reloading force-deformation paths. A significant challenge is to enable the flange <b>buckling</b> <b>spring</b> to deal with post-buckling deformation reversal. The buckling element has been implemented into the structural fire engineering frame analysis software Vulcan, to be used adjacent to existing connection elements in frame modelling. The buckling element has been verified against ABAQUS finite element modelling on isolated beams. It is shown that the newly created component-based buckling element is able to simulate the effects of beam-end shear buckling in the web and local buckling of the bottom-flange, with satisfactory accuracy. The influence of the buckling element on the bolt-row force distribution within the adjacent connection element has been investigated. Analyses using isolated beams indicate that the implementation of the buckling element considerably improves the prediction of connection force resultants. A general observation from numerical studies with and without the buckling element is that beam-end buckling seems to reduce the connection component forces generated at elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1 - 2 % {{of the population}} {{over the age of}} 65. Individuals with PD experience gradual deterioration of dexterous manipulation for activities of daily living, however, current clinical evaluations are mostly subjective and do not quantify changes in dynamic control of fingertip force that is critical for manual dexterity. Thus, {{there is a need to}} develop clinical measures to quantify those changes with aging and disease progression. We investigated the dynamic control of fingertip forces in both hands of 20 individuals with PD (69. 0 ± 7. 4 years) using the Strength-Dexterity test. The test requires low forces (< 3 N) to compress a compliant and slender <b>spring</b> prone to <b>buckling.</b> A maximal level of sustained compression is informative of the greatest instability the person can control, and thus is indicative of the integrity of the neuromuscular system for dexterous manipulation. Miniature sensors recorded fingertip force (F) during maximal sustained compressions. The force variability during sustained compression was quantified in two frequency bands: low (< 4 Hz, F_LF) and high (4 - 12 Hz, F_HF). F_LF characterizes variability in voluntary fluctuations while F_HF characterizes variability in involuntary fluctuations including tremor. The more-affected hand exhibited significantly lower F and lower F_LF than those in the less-affected hand. The more-affected hand showed significant negative correlations between F_LF and the UPDRS motor scores for both total and hand-only, suggesting that greater force variability in the voluntary range was associated with less clinical motor impairment. We conclude the nature of force variability in the voluntary range during this dynamic and dexterous task may be a biomarker of greater motor capability/flexibility/adaptability in PD. This approach may provide a more quantitative clinical assessment of changes of sensorimotor control in individuals with PD...|$|R

Importantly, we found no differences in finger compression force among patients or controls.

In addition, the temporal variability of forces during spring compression shows clearly different dynamics in the clinical populations compared to the controls (p Lastly, we compared dexterity across extremities. We found stronger age (p= 0. 005) and gender (p= 0. 002) effects of leg compression force in 188 healthy subjects who compressed a larger spring with the foot of an isolated leg (73 F, 115 M, 14 - 92 yrs). In 81 subjects who performed tests with all four limbs, we found finger and leg compression force to be significantly correlated (females ρ= 0. 529 p= 0. 004, males ρ= 0. 403 p= 0. 003; 28 F, 53 M, 20 - 85 yrs), but surprisingly found no differences between dominant and non-dominant limbs.
