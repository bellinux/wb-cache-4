5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a <b>short</b> <b>link</b> in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E

30|$|The Minimal Link Condition, {{also known}} as the <b>Shortest</b> <b>Link</b> or <b>Shortest</b> Move, states that derivations with <b>shorter</b> <b>links</b> are {{preferred}} over derivations with longer links.

25|$|SH-63 {{was added}} to the state highway system on November 6, 1935 as a <b>short</b> <b>link</b> highway between Talihina and SH-2. The highway was {{gradually}} extended to its present length between then and 1960. When the current incarnation of SH-1 was established, the middle of SH-63 was turned over to the new highway, leaving SH-63 in two separate parts. The two sections were connected via a concurrency in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} in 1891 a link line was opened between Damanhur and Desouk. The line to Shibin El Kom was {{extended}} south to Minuf {{in the same year}} and reached Ashum in 1896. By then a line across the Nile Delta from a junction north of Talkha on the line to Damietta had reached Biyala. By 1898 this reached Kafr el-Sheikh, completing a more direct route between Damietta and Alexandria. An important extension along {{the west bank of the}} Suez Canal linking Nifisha with Ismaïlia, Al Qantarah West and Port Said was completed in 1904. Thereafter network expansion was slower but two <b>short</b> <b>link</b> lines north of Cairo were completed in 1911 followed by a link between Zagazig and Zifta in 1914.|$|E
500|$|Railway work {{included}} {{the construction of}} a <b>short</b> <b>link</b> from the North London Line to the Cambridge main line, allowing trains which had previously used Broad Street to terminate at Liverpool Street. The station was reconstructed with a single concourse {{at the head of the}} station platforms, and entrances from Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street, as well as a bus interchange in the south west corner. The Broadgate development was constructed between 1985 and 1991, with [...] of office space on the site of the former Broad Street station and above the Liverpool Street tracks. Proceeds from the Broadgate development were used to help fund the station modernisation.|$|E
3000|$|The {{proposed}} {{decision tree}} {{is based on}} several assumptions which {{take into consideration the}} link analysis discussed in Section 3, Equation (1). Notice that the path duration is limited by the <b>shortest</b> <b>link</b> along the whole communication path, so this <b>shortest</b> <b>link</b> determines the quality of the selected route in terms of lifetime.

50|$|The Grashof {{condition}} for a four-bar linkage states: If {{the sum of}} the <b>shortest</b> and longest <b>link</b> of a planar quadrilateral linkage is {{less than or equal to}} {{the sum of the}} remaining two <b>links,</b> then the <b>shortest</b> <b>link</b> can rotate fully with respect to a neighboring link. In other words, the condition is satisfied if S+L ≤ P+Q where S is the <b>shortest</b> <b>link,</b> L is the longest, and P and Q are the other links.|$|R

500|$|The hairpin filter {{is another}} {{structure}} that uses parallel-coupled lines. In this case, {{each pair of}} parallel-coupled lines {{is connected to the}} next pair by a <b>short</b> <b>link.</b> The [...] "U" [...] shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter. In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections. The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity. Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph {{at the top of the}} article.|$|E
2500|$|With the Roman invasion, a {{road network}} was {{constructed}} to connect London to the Channel ports of Dover, Lympne and Richborough. The London–Dover road was Watling Street. These roads are now approximately the A2, B2068, A257, and the A28. The A2 runs through Dartford (A207), Gravesend, Rochester, Canterbury and Dover; the A20 through Eltham, Wrotham, Maidstone, Charing, Ashford. Hythe, Folkestone and Dover; the A21 around Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells {{and on to}} Hastings in East Sussex. In the 1960s, two motorways were built; the M2 from Medway to Faversham, and the M20 from Swanley to Folkestone. Part of the M25 runs through Kent, from Westerham to the Kent and Essex tunnel at Dartford. The Dartford tunnel has been joined by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, together providing four lanes in each direction. The M26 motorway, built in 1980, provides a <b>short</b> <b>link</b> between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near Wrotham. Kent currently has more motorways by distance than any other county in the UK, with sections of the M2, M20, M25 and M26 totalling [...] within the extents of the ceremonial county.|$|E
2500|$|The Mount Keira Ring Track {{provides}} walkers with {{a moderate}} [...] (3–5-hour) round trip. The Ring Track encircles the mountain {{at an average}} height of 250 metres. The walk can be commenced {{from a number of}} locations, including Mount Keira summit, Byarong Park, the Scout Camp and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Ring Track can also be joined from the Mount Pleasant Track, which starts from Parrish Avenue. From Byarong Park, a picnic area with parking and an information bay, access to the Ring Track is via a <b>short</b> <b>link</b> track that runs from the northern perimeter of the picnic area to the entrance of the Girl Guide Camp road. The link track crosses the Guide Camp road and then ascends a short distance through rainforest, before joining the Ring Track. From the junction, two branches of the Ring Track ascend the mountain. The left branch gently climbs the southern flank of Mount Keira, following Mitchells Road to a saddle located at the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The right branch traverses the mountain's eastern flank, before emerging at Geordies Flat on Mount Keira Road. From Geordies Flat, the northern branch of the Ring Track climbs steadily to the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. At this point, walkers can also join the Robertsons Lookout track, a short [...] walk that terminates at a spectacular view that takes in the Scout Camp, Mount Keira and the Illawarra coast. At Geordies Flat, a vehicle width trail leads north to Parrish avenue. Walkers combine this trail with the Ring Track and the Mount Pleasant walking track to complete a loop walk.|$|E
