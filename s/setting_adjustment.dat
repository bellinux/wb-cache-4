L. Donoho and I. M. Johnstone. First continuity and higher derivative of thresholding function {{can be obtained by}} <b>setting</b> <b>adjustment</b> factors, second the difference between the value of the original signal and the one quantized is unlimitedly decreased, finally, according to the noisy signal features and the distributional difference of noise energy, the effective thresholding function can be obtained with different adjustment factors. Objective assessment parameters of de-noising image quality are calculated from the experiment of Matlab simulation, which suggests that the impact of de-noising algorithm with the new thresholding function is better than the traditional soft and hard thresholding de-noising algorithms, furthermore, which lays a good foundation on image enhancement, feature extraction and edge detection.

40|$|Due to its {{combustion}} properties, {{the hydrogen}} {{has a great}} potential in energetic improvement and emission performance of spark ignition (SI) engine. In this respect, the paper presents comparative results of the experimental researches carried on SI single cylinder engine fuelled with gasoline or only hydrogen, at some engine speeds and full load. Direct injection hydrogen fuelled engine power is greater with almost 30 % comparative to gasoline engine due to cycle heat release increasing. The hydrogen direct injection method in the engine cylinder {{at the beginning of}} the compression stroke after the intake valve closed has been chosen to avoid reducing the power output per litre.

30|$|A key {{practical}} {{consideration for}} an ideal nebulizer is its {{ease of use}} in the hospital setting. For intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, the nebulizer should integrate directly into the ventilator circuit, with only minimal need to adjust ventilator settings or remove humidification [27, 52]. However, current-generation nebulizers, regardless of the drug formulation used, require careful attention {{to be paid to}} ventilator settings (e.g., choice of ventilator mode—pressure versus volume-controlled, inspiratory time, inspiratory flow, tidal volume, duty cycle and respiratory rate) to ensure optimal performance [53] and may also necessitate increased sedation of the patient as these settings are altered. Such adjustments can be complex due to the wide variety of modes and settings available, and guidelines advise avoiding heavy sedation if possible [1]. These complexities currently make the use of nebulization technically demanding; in order to optimize this route of administration, standardized aerosolization procedures are required [35]. The increased sedation of patients to enable better synchronization to ventilator settings may also be associated with longer durations of mechanical ventilation; one study reported no statistically significant difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between patients treated with aerosolized antimicrobials compared with those treated with intravenous antimicrobials [35]. If a nebulizer device could be added to the circuit without the need for ventilator <b>setting</b> <b>adjustment,</b> this could minimize delays in treatment and reduce undesirable increases in sedation.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} create {{baseline}} conditions for building energy performance, make a <b>setting</b> <b>adjustment</b> or determine optimal operating parameters, it is often necessary to view a large series of history data from a building control and management system.

40|$|Globalisation and a {{shortage}} of registered nurses in New Zealand have caused {{an increase in the}} number of overseas registered nurses and nurse educators migrating to New Zealand. This phenomenological study explored the experiences of overseas nurse educators teaching in New Zealand using van Manen’s approach to hermeneutic phenomenology. The lived experiences of 17 overseas nurse educators were explored through in-depth interviews, and phenomenological analytical procedures were utilised to bring to light the hidden layers of meaning inherent within these experiences. The study revealed that overseas nurse educators initially experienced a sense of non-belonging in New Zealand, while their separation from their homeland and migration to a new country resulted in a sense of disorientation. They experienced both physical and emotional separation from their loved ones. Integration was the preferred method of adaptation to New Zealand among the study participants. However, they wanted to choose which aspects of the new culture they would adopt and to what extent they would adapt. A lack of preparation and a lack of suitable orientation programmes prolonged the adaptation process of overseas nurse educators.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies on}} {{ventilators}} used for air transport showed significant effects of altitude, {{in particular with}} regard to accuracy of the tidal volume (VT) and breathing frequency. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate transport ventilators under hypobaric conditions. METHODS: We conducted a bench study of 6 transport ventilators in a Comex hypobaric chamber to simulate mild altitude (1, 500 m [4, 920 feet] and 2, 500 m [8, 200 feet]). The ventilators were connected to a test lung to evaluate their accuracy: (1) to deliver a set VT under normal resistance and compliance conditions at FIO 2 0. 6 and 1, (2) to establish a set PEEP (0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H 2 O), and (3) to establish a set inspiratory pressure in pressure controlled mode, (4) at a FIO 2 setting, and (5) and at a frequency setting. RESULTS: Four ventilators kept an average relative error in VT of 40 % error even at 1, 500 m. We found no change in frequency as a function of altitude for any ventilators studied. No clinically important differences were found between all altitudes with the PEEP or inspiratory pressure setting. Although FIO 2 was affected by altitude, the average error did not exceed 11 %, and it is unclear whether this fact is an experimental artifact. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that most of the new transport ventilators tested require no <b>setting</b> <b>adjustment</b> at moderate altitude and are as safe at altitude as at sea level under normal respiratory conditions. Older technologies still deliver more volume with altitude in volumetric mode. Key words: ventilators; hypobaric chamber; altitude; bench study. [Respir Car...|$|E
40|$|Air-conditioning {{settings}} are {{important factors in}} controlling the comfort of passengers on buses. The local bus operators control in-bus air quality and thermal environment by conforming to the prescribed levels stated in published standards. As a result, the {{settings are}} merely adjusted to fulfill the standards, rather than to satisfy the passengers' thermal comfort and air quality. Such "standard-oriented" practices are not appropriate; the passengers' preferences and satisfaction should be emphasized instead. Thus a "comfort-oriented" philosophy should be implemented to achieve a comfortable in-bus commuting environment. In this study, the achievement of a comfortable in-bus environment was examined with emphasis on thermal comfort and air quality. Both the measurement of physical parameters and subjective questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect practical in-bus thermal and air parameters data, as well as subjective satisfaction and sensation votes from the passengers. By analyzing {{the correlation between the}} objective and subjective data, a combined comfort models were developed. The models helped in evaluating the percentage of dissatisfaction under various combinations of passengers' sensation votes towards thermal comfort and air quality. An effective approach integrated the combined comfort model, hardware and software systems and the bus air-conditioning system could effectively control the transient in-bus environment. By processing and analyzing the data from the continuous monitoring system with the combined comfort model, air-conditioning <b>setting</b> <b>adjustment</b> commands could be determined and delivered to the hardware. This system adjusted air-conditioning settings depending on real-time commands along the bus journey. Therefore, a comfortable in-bus air quality and thermal environment could be achieved and efficiently maintained along the bus journey despite dynamic outdoor influences. Moreover, this model can help optimize air-conditioning control by striking a beneficial balance between energy conservation and passengers' satisfaction level.

40|$|Combine {{harvesters}} {{are used}} to gather plants {{from the field and}} separate them into the components of value, the grain and the straw. The optimal utilization of existing combine potential is an inevitable task to maximize harvest efficiency and hence to maximize profit. The only way to optimize the threshing and separation processes during harvest is to adjust the combine settings to existing conditions. Operating permanently at optimal harvest efficiency can only be achieved by an automatic control system. However, for reasons of transparency and due to lack of sensors, the approach in this thesis is a combined development of an interactive and an automatic control system for combine process optimization. The optimization of combine processes is a multi-dimensional and multi-objective optimization problem. The objectives of optimization are the harvest quality parameters. The decision variables, the parameters that can be modified, are the combine settings. Analytical optimization methods require the existence of a model that provides function values in dependence of defined input parameters. A comprehensive quantitative model for the input-output-behavior of the combine does not exist. Alternative optimization methods that handle multi-dimensional and multi-objective optimization problems {{can be found in the}} domain of Artificial Intelligence. In this work, knowledge acquisition was performed in order to obtain expert knowledge on combine process optimization. The result is a knowledge base with six adjustment matrices for different crop and combine types.

A control algorithm has been developed that is also capable of solving multiple issues at the same time, utilizing the acquired expert knowledge. The basic principle to solve the given multi-objective optimization problem is a transformation into one-dimensional single-objective optimization problems which are solved iteratively. Several methods have been developed that are applied sequentially. In simulation, the average improvement from initial settings to optimized settings, achieved by the control algorithm, is between 34. 5 % and 67. 6 %.

We randomized liver transplant patients with renal dysfunction under CNI treatment to either a) receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) up to a dose fo 2 g/day followed by consecutive reduction of CNI (CNI reduction group) or b) to continue their current CNI dose (control group). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were isolated from patient blood at baseline and after conversion to MMF/low dose CNI regimen. The expression of CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 on PBMC and the expression of activation marker was determined by FACS analysis. In in vitro experiments freshly isolated PBMC from healthy volunteers were treated with mycophenolic acid (MPA) (1 up to 10 μM), cyclosporine A (CsA) (25 - 100 ng/mL), tacrolimus (Tac) (2 - 10 ng/mL) and combined CsA/MPA or Tac/MPA. T cell proliferation was measured by carboxfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and FACS analysis. T cell cycle analysis was performed by bromodexoxyuridine staining and FACS. Furthermore activation marker and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) -regulated cytokine expression was analyzed by FACS. The expression of cytokine mRNA was measured by real- time RT PCR. Combined MMF and low dose CNI therapy leads to reduction of percentages of CD 8 + T cells, CD 4 +CD 45 RO+ T cells, CD 3 +CD 56 + T cells and inhibition of activation marker expression. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that 1 μM MPA completely blocks the proliferation of CD 4 and CD 8 T cells. MPA stops the cell cycle of activated T cells at G 0 /G 1 phase and this effect is dose-dependent. Both MPA and CNI inhibit the expression of activation T cell markers and this effect is potentiated by combined exposure to MPA and CNI. MPA has no detectable effect on NFAT-regulated genes such as IL- 2, IL- 4, IFN-γ and their protein expression. Our results suggest that FACS analysis and assessment of cytokine expression of PBMC represent important tools for monitoring and optimizing the immunosuppressive regimen within the liver transplant <b>setting.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> of the MMF dosage by detection of the AUC {{may be required to}} avoid over-immunosuppression.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Exact {{inference}} {{for independent}} binomial outcomes in small samples {{is complicated by}} the presence of a mean-variance relationship that depends on nuisance parameters, discreteness of the outcome space, and departures from normality. Although large sample theory based on Wald, score, and likelihood ratio (LR) tests are well developed, suitable small sample methods are necessary when ``large'' samples are not feasible. Fisher's exact test, which conditions on an ancillary statistic to eliminate nuisance parameters, however its inference based on the hypergeometric distribution is ``exact'' only when a user is willing to base decisions on flipping a biased coin for some outcomes. Thus, in practice, Fisher's exact test tends to be conservative due to the discreteness of the outcome space. To address the various issues that arise with the asymptotic and/or small sample tests, Barnard (1945, 1947) introduced the concept of unconditional exact tests that use exact distributions of a test statistic evaluated over all possible values of the nuisance parameter. For test statistics derived based on asymptotic approximations, these ``unconditional exact tests'' ensure that the realized type 1 error is {{less than or equal to}} the nominal level. On the other hand, an unconditional test based on the conservative Fisher's exact test statistic can better achieve the nominal type 1 error. In fixed sample settings, it has been found that unconditional exact tests are preferred to conditional exact tests (Mehta and Senchaudhuri, 2003). In this thesis we first illustrate the behavior of candidate unconditional exact tests in the fixed sample setting, and then extend the comparisons to the group sequential <b>setting.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> of the fixed sample tests is defined as choosing the critical value that minimizes the conservativeness of the actual type 1 error without exceeding the nominal level of significance. We suggest three methods of using critical values derived from adjusted fixed sample tests to determine the rejection region of the outcome space when testing binomial proportions in a group sequential setting: (1) at the final analysis time only; (2) at analysis times after accrual of more than 50 % of the maximal sample size; and (3) at every analysis time. We consider (frequentist) operating characteristics (Emerson, Kittelson, and Gillen, 2007) when evaluating group sequential designs: overall type 1 error; overall statistical power; average sample number (ASN); stopping probabilities; and error spending function. We find that using the fixed sample critical values is adequate provided they are used at each of the interim analyses. We find relative behavior of Wald, chi square, LR, and Fisher's exact test statistics all depend on the sample size and randomization ratio, as well as the boundary shape function used in the group sequential stopping rule. Owing to its tendency to behave well across a wide variety of settings, we recommend implementation of the unconditional exact test using the adjusted Fisher's exact test statistic at every analysis. Because the absolute behavior of that test varies according to the desired type 1 error, the randomization ratio, and the sample size, we recommend that the operating characteristics for each candidate stopping rule be evaluated explicitly for the chosen unconditional exact test...|$|E
