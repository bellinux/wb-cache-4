40|$|Since {{the genesis}} {{and shape of}} natural {{deep-seated}} cavities within a salt body are insufficiently understood, the current study tries to {{shed some light on}} this topic. To this end, freshwater was pumped slowly through a horizontal borehole in rock salt cores. Owing to fast halite dissolution kinetics, high solubility, and slow inflow rate, halite dissolution took place only in the inflow of the rock salt cylinder. The shape of the created cavities is an approximately <b>symmetrical</b> <b>half</b> cone with a horizontal base facing upward. A conceptual model is presented that is inspired by the experimental results and based on theoretical hydraulic-geochemical considerations, as well as on field observations. It proposes that triangular prism or conically shaped cavities develop within salt under confined conditions, where aggressive water flows upward along a fracture/conduit from an insoluble aquifer into the soluble stratum.

A 30 deg slice of the Bearing Tester was modeled with solid isoparametric elements (CIHEX). Five more slices were generated to form a 180 deg <b>symmetrical</b> <b>half.</b> Each component was modeled separately for two reasons: (1) in the heat transfer version each component required covering with appropriate heat transfer coefficient elements, and (2) for the displacement version each component required independent radial expansion with respect to adjacent components.

30|$|Xianyang {{geothermal}} field {{lies in the}} center of Shaanxi Province. It is about 25  km northwest of Xi’an, the capital of the province. The reservoir is located in the Wei River sedimentary basin, as part of the Guanzhong basin. It is a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>half</b> graben basin, tilted from north to south. The Wei River basin is bounded by the steep Qinling Mountains in the south and the North Mountains from the northern side. Different from the Xiongxian field (Section 3.3), the Xianyang reservoir is composed of porous-type sandstone formation. This formation can be further divided into four stratifications, including the Sanmen, Zhangjiapo, Lantianbahe, and Gaoling layers. The thinner crust and lower depth of Moho boundary (with a depth of 30 to 32  km) enhances the heat conduction process, leading to a high heat flux of about 70  mW/m 2 {{in the vicinity of the}} reservoir. Additionally, various faults and fractures in this field provide pathways for high temperature groundwater. The recharging source of the field is from precipitation in the southern mountains (Pang et al. [2014 b]).|$|R
40|$|Magnetic field dependences of {{critical}} current, resistance, and rectified voltage of asymmetric (half circles of different widths) and <b>symmetrical</b> (<b>half</b> circles of equal widths) aluminum rings were {{measured in the}} temperature region close to the superconducting transition. All these dependences are periodic magnetic field functions with periods corresponding to the flux quantum in the ring.

Shifts of the extrema of the periodic dependences of critical current by a quarter of the flux quantum contradict directly to the results obtained by measuring asymmetric ring resistance oscillations, whose extrema are, as for symmetrical rings, observed at magnetic fluxes equal to an integer and a half of flux quanta.

40|$|International audienceCerium oxide {{films were}} {{deposited}} onto various yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes using supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) {{in a cold}} wall reactor. Deposition of ceria thin films (20 - 240 nm) was carried out via hydrolysis of a Ce precursor at 250 - 300 °C (typically 30 min) in supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2). The as-deposited films were continuous, dense and crystalline. They exhibited some carbon contamination which was eliminated in all cases by postannealing the films at 400 °C. Film microstructure depends on the hydrolysis conditions (water to cerium molar ratio), on the substrate nature (Si wafers or YSZ pellets) and on the YSZ pellet thickness (100 μm or 1 mm). Ceria films were then used as interlayers for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) between the YSZ electrolyte and the Nd 2 NiO 4 +δ cathode layer subsequently deposited.

In part one and two of this study, the 2 D numerical solution of the laminar natural convection of water in six internally finned horizontal annuli has been obtained. The fins {{are attached to the}} external surface of the inner cylinder. Only the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>half</b> of the horizontal annulus with three equally spaced longitudinal divergent solid and porous fins are considered. The parameters of the problem are Rayleigh number, fin height, permeability and porosity of the porous fin, etc. The above parameters are suitably varied to ascertain their effects on fluid flow and heat transfer. The results show that traditional solid fins provide much higher heat transfer rates compared to the porous fins. Part three of this work deals with mixed convective heat transfer (laminar natural and forced convections) of water in a vented annulus. The forced flow conditions are imposed by providing an inlet at the top and an outlet at the bottom. For various parameters of the problem, the average and local Nusselt numbers along the inner cylinder are calculated for water for both aiding and opposing flows. The fourth part of this study deals with numerical modeling of natural convection of nanofluids in a horizontal cylindrical annulus. Simulations are carried out for Cu-water nanofluids. The results, in general, show that nanoparticles systematically decrease the natural convective heat transfer coefficient on the inner cylinder.
