5|$|Although the Grand Fleet {{made several}} sorties {{over the next}} few years it is not known if Agincourt participated in them. On 23April 1918, Agincourt and Hercules were {{stationed}} at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached their normal route so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.|$|E
5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E

On firing, the hedge hopper barrel was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E

They were <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB.

25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger {{up and down on the}} fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E
25|$|Forums {{prefer a}} premise of open and free {{discussion}} and often adopt de facto standards. Most common topics on forums include questions, comparisons, polls of opinion {{as well as}} debates. It {{is not uncommon for}} nonsense or unsocial behavior to sprout as people lose temper, especially if the topic is controversial. Poor understanding of differences in values of the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded aimed at someone's point of view, discussion will usually go <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> into several directions as people question each other's validity, sources and so on. Circular discussion and ambiguity in replies can extend for several tens of posts of a thread eventually ending when everyone gives up or attention spans waver and a more interesting subject takes over. It is not uncommon for debate to end in ad hominem attacks.|$|E

25|$|The cemetery's 'Cross of Sacrifice' {{serves as}} a landmark, but though rising on a ragstone {{platform}} of contrasting Portland stone, it cannot be viewed on the approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk {{at the time the}} war memorial was erected, so they designed the platform screen wall to prevent the cross from being seen from the south. The trust hopes to change this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross to be seen from more directions and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. <b>Slightly</b> <b>off</b> this exact axial alignment, is the small Blitz memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).|$|E
25|$|Bejant is a {{term used}} to refer to first year male students; females being {{described}} as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, students in each year may be identified according to the way they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the shoulders, in the second year it is worn <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> the shoulders. In the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.|$|E
25|$|Orbital decay {{can occur}} due to tidal forces for objects below the {{synchronous}} orbit {{for the body}} they're orbiting. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, {{and as a result}} the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon Phobos is a prime example, and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years.|$|E

25|$|The Mayflower Grandstand is the club's main stand, {{with space}} for about 7,000 spectators. It {{is the oldest}} part of the ground, having been built in 1952. It houses the club's main offices, the boardroom, team {{changing}} rooms and press rooms, and also accommodates executive boxes, which can host functions and are available to supporters on match days. The dugouts, which are made of wood and supplied by the club's sponsors, {{sit in front of}} the Mayflower, with the player tunnel <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> centre going underneath the Mayflower. To the rear of the stand is the Club Shop, selling official merchandise, and the Pyramid Suite, a hospitality area which can cater for up to 170 people. There are two structures overlooking the pitch {{on each side of the}} stand. To the east is a building which contains a hospitality area (the Chisholm Lounge), and a press area, and to the west is a disabled enclosure. There have been plans to replace this stand for a number of years.

25|$|Homer {{relates the}} events of Polypites birth and the attack of the centaurs, when the ritual {{procession}} to gift a girdle in the sanctuary of Artemis is interrupted. While nearing the sanctuary, the procession is set upon by a gang of centaurs, precipitating a brawl, much as had happened at the wedding feast. The first slab of the Centauromachy, BM 526, focuses {{on a pair of}} Greeks clad in mantles and fighting barehanded. Although they face in opposite directions, their poses are nearly identical, differing only in that one, BM 526:2, folds his lower left leg under the thigh as he kneels {{on the back of his}} adversary. On the next slab, BM 524, the goal of the procession, the ritual sanctuary of Artemis, is indicated by a tree hung with a lion or panther skin in thanksgiving for a successful hunt. The Greek (BM 524:1) who defends the two women against the centaur has no attributes save for the weapon that was held in his right hand. The roughly cut form that extends from the bottom of the fist seems to be the stump of a club. Into the top of the fist is fitted a metal club, requiring a stronger anchor than did the bronze swords attached to fists elsewhere. The hole for the club is therefore twice as wide and deep as those used for swords. This club identifies the hero as Theseus. The two victims of the centaur flank a small statue of Artemis. The axis of the statue is <b>slightly</b> <b>off</b> vertical, for it is not fixed to a base but carried by the priestess, BM 524:3. No base is actually seen, and the poses of the two women preclude there being one behind them. The left leg of the woman who gestures with extended arms, BM 524:4, reaches backward below the statue, where the base would be. The woman who holds the statue, BM 524:3, wraps her peplos around part of its back. As the centaur pulls the garment off her proper left shoulder, it passes behind her neck but does not appear between her nude torso and the statue. It reappears in the priestess’s left hand, being drawn from the left, up and to the right. As a result, it must be understood as partially encompassing the lower parts of the statue.|$|E
