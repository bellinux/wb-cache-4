40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural dry-snow slab {{avalanches}} {{start with}} a failure within a weak snow layer. In {{order to understand the}} mechanical behaviour and the failure mechanism, we performed loading experi-ments with homogeneous and layered snow samples under controlled conditions in a cold laboratory. For simulating loading conditions similar to the natural snow pack, we designed and built an apparatus where a <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> can be tilted by a ‘slope angle ’ and is loaded via the gravitational force. The deformation within the <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> was measured optically with a pattern recognition algorithm. Shortly before macroscopic failure (breaking of the whole sample) we observed a concentration of deformation (softening) within the weak layer. Additionally, we measure acoustic emissions during the shear experiments to quantify the microscopic failure (breaking of bonds) in the <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> before the complete failure. Our results support the assumption that the dominating mechanisms for snow deformation are the competing processes of breaking and sintering of bonds between grains...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{bacterial}} and fungal abundances, diversities, conductance {{levels as}} well as total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated in the <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> collected from five different snow occurrences in Beijing between January and March, 2010. The collected <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> were melted and cultured at three different temperatures (4, 26 and 37 °C). The culturable bacterial concentrations were manually counted and the resulting colony forming units (CFUs) at 26 °C were further studied using V 3 region of 16 S rRNA gene-targeted polymerase chain reaction -denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The clone library was constructed after the liquid culturing of <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> at 26 °C. And microscopic method was employed to investigate the fungal diversity in the samples. In addition, outdoor air samples were also collected using mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters and compared with <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> with respect to described characteristics. The results revealed that <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> had bacterial concentrations as much as 16000 CFU/ml for those cultured at 26 °C, and the conductance levels ranged from 5. 6 × 10 (- 6) to 2. 4 × 10 (- 5) S. PCR-DGGE, sequencing and microscopic analysis revealed remarkable bacterial and fungal diversity differences between the <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> and the outdoor air samples. In addition, DGGE banding profiles for the <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> collected were also shown distinctly different from one another.

40|$|Fluorescent Particle Tracking Velocimetry (FPTV) {{measurements}} of the pore-scale water flow through the pore space of a wet-snow sample are presented to demonstrate the applicability of this measurement technique for snow. For the experiments, ice-cooled water seeded with micron sized fluorescent tracer particles is either sprinkled {{on top of a}} <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> to investigate saturated and unsaturated gravity-driven flow or supplied from a reservoir below the <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> to generate upward flow driven by capillary forces. The <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> is illuminated with a laser light sheet and the fluorescent light of the particles transported with the water in the pore space is recorded with a high-speed camera equipped with an optical filter. Tracking algorithms are applied to the images to obtain flow paths and flow velocities. A flow loop found in a pore space for the case of saturated gravity flow together with the tortuosity of the particle trajectories indicate the three-dimensionality of the water flow in wet snow. The average vertical flow velocities in the pore spaces were 11. 2 mm s 1 for the downward saturated gravity flow and 9. 6 mm s 1 for the upward flow that is driven by capillary forces for the limited cases presented as examples of the measurement technique. In the case of unsaturated gravity-driven flow, the average and the maximum flow velocities were found to be 30 times smaller than for the saturated gravity flow. Velocity histograms show that the fraction of the total water flowing against the main flow direction was about 3 – 5 %, and that the horizontal velocities average to zero for both the saturated gravity-driven and the capillary flow...|$|E
40|$|Release of trace gases from surface snow {{on earth}} drives {{atmospheric}} chemistry, {{especially in the}} polar regions. The gas-phase diffusion of methanol and of acetone through the interstitial air of snow was investigated in a well-controlled laboratory study in the temperature range of 223 to 263 K. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how the structure of the snowpack, the interaction of the trace gases with the snow surface, and the grain boundaries influence the diffusion on timescales up to 1 h. The diffusive loss of these two volatile organics into packed snow samples was measured using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The structure of the snow was analysed by means of X-ray-computed micro-tomography. The observed diffusion profiles could be well described based on gas-phase diffusion and the known structure of the <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> at temperatures ≥ 253 K. At colder temperatures, surface interactions start to dominate the diffusive transport. Parameterizing these interactions in terms of adsorption to the solid ice surface, i. e. using temperature-dependent air–ice partitioning coefficients, better described the observed diffusion profiles than the use of air–liquid partitioning coefficients. No changes in the diffusive fluxes were observed by increasing the number of grain boundaries in the <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> by a factor of 7, indicating that for these volatile organic trace gases, uptake into grain boundaries does not play a role on the timescale of diffusion through porous surface snow. For this, a <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> with an artificially high amount of ice grains was produced and the grain boundary surface measured using thin sections. In conclusion, we have shown that the diffusivity can be predicted when the structure of the snowpack and the partitioning of the trace gas to solid ice is known...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature {{and time of}} <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> melting on the measurement of mass concentration and size distribution of black carbon (BC) in snow was evaluated experimentally. In the experiments, fresh (Shirouma) and aged (Hakusan) snow samples were melted at different temperatures or at different time lengths, and the BC mass concentration and size distribution in the melted snow samples were measured using a nebulizer and a single-particle soot photometer (SP 2). In the experiment where melting temperature was varied, the BC mass concentration in the liquid decreased at a melting temperature of 70  °C. This decrease was 8. 0  % for the Shirouma sample and 46. 4  % for the Hakusan sample and depended on BC particle size, with a significant decrease found at BC diameters less than 350  nm. A similar decrease in BC mass concentration was found when the Hakusan <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> that had been melted at 5  °C was heated to 70  °C. The experiment in which melting time was varied indicated that BC mass concentration in the liquid did not change for the Shirouma sample but decreased significantly with a longer melting time for the Hakusan sample (38. 6  %). These results indicate that melting of snow samples at high temperatures or over long time periods can significantly affect the measurement of BC mass and its size distribution, especially for aged snow samples...|$|E

The same organic metal compounds were found in atmospheric aerosols collected at Syowa Station and Mizuho Station, which suggests that these were incorporated into the snow from atmospheric aerosols. The above observation, {{in association with the}} finding that these organic metal compounds also exist in aerosols from the North Pacific {{as well as from the}} Southern Sea, indicates that these compounds are widely distributed in the global atmosphere and further suggests the existence of gaseous organic metal compounds in the air as a precursor of these compounds in the aerosols.

40|$|Cohesion of {{snow and}} its {{adhesion}} to cable surfaces are the decisive factors for wet-snow shedding from power-line cables. Knowing the adhesive strength of snow is essential to predict when snow will shed and what consequences it {{will have on the}} elements of the transmission line. It also appears to be a basic input for simulating wet-snow shedding. Snow adhesion depends on several parameters, among which snow liquid water content and density, and cable surface geometry were examined experimentally. In particular, the adhesion of wet-snow samples to flat surfaces of different roughness, and to stranded cable surfaces was examined in this study. Two series of experiments were conducted to measure shear adhesive strength as well as tensile adhesive strength of snow. Shear adhesive strength was measured with a centrifuge adhesion test device where a <b>snow</b> <b>sample</b> was placed on a beam, which was then rotated with increasing angular frequency until detachment, the angular frequency at detachment being proportional with shear adhesive force and strength. The tensile adhesive tests were carried out with a material test machine on a semi-spherical <b>snow</b> <b>sample.</b> The sample was compressed slowly at a constant speed until it reached a predefined compressive force limit, and then a tensile load was applied until the detachment of snow.

A complete meteorological data set and data from surface <b>snow</b> <b>samples,</b> <b>snow</b> pits, firn cores, and weekly accumulation measurements from a stake array are available. We first investigated the attenuation of the seasonal d 18 O signal due to water vapour diffusion in the snow pack. A comparison of surface <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> and firn cores of different age shows that only one third of the seasonal d 18 O signal of the surface <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> remains in the cores after the first year. No further significant change in the amplitude of the seasonal d 18 O signal is found later. Changes in the seasonal distribution of accumulation can lead to a bias in ice core properties. This is studied on a short time scale, using the available high-time resolution data of accumulation, stable isotope ratios, and air temperature. Mean annual d 18 O values from firn cores are not well correlated to annual mean air temperatures. However, the correlation is improved considerably by weighting the annual mean air temperature by accumulation.

An isotope model was combined with a trajectory model to determine the relative influence of different moisture sources on the mean annual course of the deuterium excess, focusing on the phase lag between δ 18 O and excess d. Whereas the annual course of δ 18 O always shows an austral summer maximum, which clearly depends on local temperature and the annual course of moisture source-area parameters, the deuterium excess of the fresh <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> shows maximum values already in spring. There can be many different reasons for the time lag between δ 18 O and deuterium excess in an ice core, including post-depositional processes {{and changes in the}} moisture source of precipitation.

C_ 2 -C_ 8 dicarboxylic acids showed clear seasonal changes with higher concentration in summer than in winter.

In contrast, the concentrations of C_ 8 and C_ 9 diacids (derived from photochemical oxidation of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids) at Dome Fuji Station were only 3 - 5 times higher than the route samples. This comparison suggests that surface <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> at Dome Fuji Station contained photooxidation products of anthropogenic organic matter, suggesting that the diacids are emitted from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel used at the Station and/or produced in the atmosphere by photooxidation of exhaust gases. On the other hand, concentration ratios of fumaric acid (trans-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) to maleic acid (cis-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) showed higher values in summer than in winter, suggesting that cis to trans isomerization occurs photochemically in the atmosphere and possibly in the snow surface.

Significant correlations exist between the concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in <b>snow</b> <b>samples</b> (p< 0. 001) of Beijing, China. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
