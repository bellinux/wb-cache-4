5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food <b>stuffs</b> for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray <b>stuffs</b> the dog into an umbrella stand.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody <b>stuffs</b> a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} years of {{occupation}} between 400 and 700 AD clearing {{of land for}} agriculture remained relatively small. The years following saw a degree of agricultural intensification between 600 and 1000 AD, {{but there is no}} evidence for clearing on a massive scale. Trade {{played an important role in}} this period for procuring valuable commodities such as glass and additional food <b>stuffs.</b> Faunal assemblages revealed much more of an emphasis on cattle herding in these early years, although not on a large-scale due to the low availability of pastoral lands. Cattle were possibly traded with the interior to procure extra grain <b>stuffs</b> in times of need. In these years, the landscape was covered in riverine forests and savannah.|$|E

The Tillabéri region is 30km from the capital, Niamey, {{on the road to}} the Saharan town of Timbuktu. Unusually severe rainfall destroyed and then rotted the farmers' crops.

40|$|In ‘Essential stuff' (2008) and ‘Stuff' (2009), Kristie Miller {{argues that}} two {{generally}} accepted theses, often formulated as follows, are incompatible: - (Temporal) mereological essentialism for <b>stuff</b> (or matter), {{the thesis that}} any portion of <b>stuff</b> has the same parts at every time it exists. - <b>Stuff</b> composition, the thesis that for any two portions of <b>stuff,</b> there exists a portion of <b>stuff</b> that is their mereological sum (or fusion).

25|$|Buddhist scholar Xuanzang {{passed through}} Kashgar (which he {{referred}} to as Ka-sha) in 644 on his return journey from India to China.

He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen <b>stuffs</b> and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was {{different from that of}} other countries.

In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{anything}} {{can serve as}} a <b>stuffing.</b> Many popular Anglo-American stuffings contain bread or cereals, usually together with vegetables, herbs and spices, and eggs. Middle Eastern vegetable stuffings may be based on seasoned rice, on minced meat, or a combination thereof. Other stuffings may contain only vegetables and herbs. Some types of <b>stuffing</b> contain sausage meat, or forcemeat, while vegetarian stuffings sometimes contain tofu. Roast pork is often accompanied by sage and onion <b>stuffing</b> in England; roast poultry in a Christmas dinner may be <b>stuffed</b> with sweet chestnuts. Oysters are used in one traditional <b>stuffing</b> for Thanksgiving. These may also be combined with mashed potatoes, for a heavy <b>stuffing.</b> Fruits and dried fruits can be added to <b>stuffing</b> including apples, apricots, dried prunes, and raisins. In England, a <b>stuffing</b> is sometimes made of minced pork shoulder seasoned with various ingredients, sage, onion, bread, chestnuts, dried apricots, dried cranberries etc. The <b>stuffing</b> mixture may be cooked separately and served as a side dish. This may still be called <b>stuffing</b> or it may be called dressing.|$|R
25|$|The {{sailing vessel}} was {{always at the}} mercy of the wind for propulsion, and those that did carry oars were placed at a {{disadvantage}} because they were not optimized for oar use. The galley did have disadvantages compared to the sailing vessel though. Their smaller hulls were not able to hold as much cargo and this limited their range as the crews were required to replenish food <b>stuffs</b> more frequently. The low freeboard of the galley meant that in close action with a sailing vessel, the sailing vessel would usually maintain a height advantage. The sailing vessel could also fight more effectively farther out at sea and in rougher wind conditions because of the height of their freeboard.|$|E

Marguerite Monvoisin's lovers, Bertrand and Romani, were arrested in 1681 as suspects. Bertrand was accused of selling poisonous <b>stuffs</b> to Fontanges; while Romani was accused of delivering her gloves contaminated with poison. Defendants pronounced the name of Miss Carnation, a maid to the Marquise de Montespan, however there were no statements to back their claim.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Papantla celebrates Day of the Dead but has some local variations. “Ofrendas” (altars to the dead) {{can be set up}} on tables or on board which are {{suspended}} from the ceiling. The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with palm fronds, bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food <b>stuffs</b> include mole, candy, tamales, local breads and other regional specialties. A glass of water and “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls {{come in the form of}} insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot. During the nights, groups of living children go house to house singing traditional songs.|$|E
