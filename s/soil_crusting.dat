Based on {{the analysis of the}} spectral features of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts,</b> we propose a new biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> index (BSCI) for biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> mapping. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, we examined the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and map biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> Our simulation indicated that Landsat ETM+ data could be used, after atmospheric correction, to detect biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> if 33 % or more of any pixel was accounted for by biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> When the proposed BSCI was applied to the detection of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> in the Gurbantonggut Desert, Xingjiang, China, a Kappa coefficient of 0. 82 and an overall accuracy of 94. 7 % were achieved.

In the study, five pairs of 1 m Ã 5 m plots with slope angles of 5 Â°, 10 Â°, 15 Â°, 20 Â° and 25 Â° respectively, were established in Wangjiagou watershed, which was located at the Loess Plateau, China. Based on the two simulated rainfall events, uncrusted surface prior to the first simulated rainfall event, and crusted surface prior to the second rainfall event were distinguished. The runoff production and soil loss were measured at intervals of 5 min during the simulated events.

With the reference slope angle of 5 Â°, the relative importance of <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> and slope angle in runoff production was calculated.

The array of papers here includes the evolutionary history of terrestrial cyanobacteria (Beraldi-Campesi 2013), environmental factors controlling microbial contributors and nutrient cycling (Barger et al. 2013; Marusenko et al. 2013; BÃ¼del et al. 2013), and small-scale and landscape-scale perspectives of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> (Weber et al. 2013; Dettweiler-Robinson et al. 2013; Peterson 2013; Root et al. 2013). First we present a paper about Earthâs earliest terrestrial ecosystems, dominated by cyanobacteria rather than vascular plants (Beraldi-Campesi 2013 : Early life on land and the first terrestrial ecosystems). We next feature two papers that make use of new cutting-edge technologies to study nitrogen dynamics at the micro-scale inside the <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> (Barger et al. 2013; and Marusenko et al. 2013 : Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria are structured by geography in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> across North American arid lands). A big question is how these organisms survive under the extreme conditions found in deserts. Our next paper, by BÃ¼del et al. (2013), addresses the different carbon fixation strategies of Sonoran desert biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> types [Lichen species dominance and the resulting photosynthetic behavior of Sonoran Desert <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> types (Baja California, Mexico)], which adds {{to our understanding of}} these survival strategies. Among the most fascinating components of deserts are hypolithic organisms (those living underneath translucent rocks) and how small-scale distribution patterns and microclimatic conditions of these organisms compare to soil-inhabiting crusts. This was investigated by Weber et al. (2013); Ecological characterization of soil-inhabiting and hypolithic <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> within the Knersvlakte, South Africa.

We hypothesized that small fossorial rodents such as Mongolian gerbils promote grass establishment and growth by clearing litter and destroying crusts.

After periods of five and ten months, we removed the litter and compared the photosynthetic performance of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> from the two treatments. Litter induced photosynthetic changes in our samples. In both B. argenteum and D. muscorum, biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> that had been covered with litter for ten months had lower rates of gross photosynthesis and lower chlorophyll content than control samples. Similarly in both biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> types, litter reduced the rate of dark respiration. For D. muscorum, the reduction in dark respiration fully compensated for the decrease in gross photosynthesis, resulting in similar values of net photosynthesis in the two treatments. In contrast, for B. argenteum, net photosynthesis was four-times greater in the control than the litter treatment. Also under litter cover, D. muscorum showed three common adaptations to shade conditions: {{a decrease in the}} light compensation point, in the light intensity needed to achieve 95 % of maximal net photosynthesis, and in the chlorophyll a/b ratio. None of these changes was apparent in B. argenteum. Overall, our results indicate that photosynthetic responses to the presence of litter varied among species of the crust biota and that the litter can reduce the photosynthetic capacity of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> These results help to explain field observations of decreases in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> cover and changes in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> composition with increases in litter cover...|$|R
