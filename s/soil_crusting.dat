40|$|Tracking the presence, {{distribution}} and disappearance of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> {{is important for}} ecosystem management of desert regions and provides highly valuable information on desertification and climate change studies in arid environments. Based on {{the analysis of the}} spectral features of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts,</b> we propose a new biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> index (BSCI) for biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> mapping. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, we examined the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and map biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> Our simulation indicated that Landsat ETM+ data could be used, after atmospheric correction, to detect biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> if 33 % or more of any pixel was accounted for by biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> When the proposed BSCI was applied to the detection of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> in the Gurbantonggut Desert, Xingjiang, China, a Kappa coefficient of 0. 82 and an overall accuracy of 94. 7 % were achieved.

In the study, five pairs of 1 m × 5 m plots with slope angles of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 ° respectively, were established in Wangjiagou watershed, which was located at the Loess Plateau, China. Based on the two simulated rainfall events, uncrusted surface prior to the first simulated rainfall event, and crusted surface prior to the second rainfall event were distinguished. The runoff production and soil loss were measured at intervals of 5 min during the simulated events. It indicated that both <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> and slope angle {{played an important role}} in runoff production and soil loss. With the reference slope angle of 5 °, the relative importance of <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> and slope angle in runoff production was calculated. It showed that <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> effect on the total runoff volume decreased from 100 to ∼ 40 %, while slope angle effect increased from 0 to ∼ 60 % with increasing slope angle because <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> less developed on the steeper slopes.

The array of papers here includes the evolutionary history of terrestrial cyanobacteria (Beraldi-Campesi 2013), environmental factors controlling microbial contributors and nutrient cycling (Barger et al. 2013; Marusenko et al. 2013; Büdel et al. 2013), and small-scale and landscape-scale perspectives of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> (Weber et al. 2013; Dettweiler-Robinson et al. 2013; Peterson 2013; Root et al. 2013). First we present a paper about Earth’s earliest terrestrial ecosystems, dominated by cyanobacteria rather than vascular plants (Beraldi-Campesi 2013 : Early life on land and the first terrestrial ecosystems). We next feature two papers that make use of new cutting-edge technologies to study nitrogen dynamics at the micro-scale inside the <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> (Barger et al. 2013; and Marusenko et al. 2013 : Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria are structured by geography in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> across North American arid lands). A big question is how these organisms survive under the extreme conditions found in deserts. Our next paper, by Büdel et al.

Among the most fascinating components of deserts are hypolithic organisms (those living underneath translucent rocks) and how small-scale distribution patterns and microclimatic conditions of these organisms compare to soil-inhabiting crusts. This was investigated by Weber et al. (2013); Ecological characterization of soil-inhabiting and hypolithic <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> within the Knersvlakte, South Africa. Few long-term studies on biological crust communities are available, and so we present data on long-term changes in a biological crust community from the Columbia Basin, U.S.A., by Dettweiler-Robinson et al.

From field observations and the literature, we determined that plant litter and <b>soil</b> <b>crusting</b> were the main factors preventing establishment or growth of the perennial grass Elymus chinensis (Poaceae) on these croplands. We hypothesized that small fossorial rodents such as Mongolian gerbils promote grass establishment and growth by clearing litter and destroying crusts.

As we hypothesized, small rodents increased the patch size of E. chinensis through reduction of litter cover. However, unexpectedly, we could not find significant effects on E. chinensis via crust thickness. Our results suggest that litter removal by the rodents gave E. chinensis suitable space that was free of competitors; this allowed expansion of the E. chinensis patches. Any effect of <b>soil</b> <b>crusting</b> on plant volume could not be explained simply by the variables we used, probably because some other mechanism, such as temporal variation in the crust, was involved.

Litter induced photosynthetic changes in our samples. In both B. argenteum and D. muscorum, biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts</b> that had been covered with litter for ten months had lower rates of gross photosynthesis and lower chlorophyll content than control samples. Similarly in both biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> types, litter reduced the rate of dark respiration. For D. muscorum, the reduction in dark respiration fully compensated for the decrease in gross photosynthesis, resulting in similar values of net photosynthesis in the two treatments. In contrast, for B. argenteum, net photosynthesis was four-times greater in the control than the litter treatment. Also under litter cover, D. muscorum showed three common adaptations to shade conditions: {{a decrease in the}} light compensation point, in the light intensity needed to achieve 95 % of maximal net photosynthesis, and in the chlorophyll a/b ratio. None of these changes was apparent in B. argenteum. Overall, our results indicate that photosynthetic responses to the presence of litter varied among species of the crust biota and that the litter can reduce the photosynthetic capacity of biological <b>soil</b> <b>crusts.</b> These results help to explain field observations of decreases in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> cover and changes in biological <b>soil</b> <b>crust</b> composition with increases in litter cover...|$|R
