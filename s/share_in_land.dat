The place was little better than a wilderness when I first knew it 25 years ago, and it remains a wilderness to-day as far as our efforts are concerned. If we left that district the only permanent evidence of our occupation would be the buildings we have erected for the use of our tax-collecting staff. —Chief Native Commissioner of Kenya, 1925 A feature of all settler societies during the colonial period was the ability of European settlers to obtain for themselves a disproportionate <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> ownership. Kenya was no exception, with the first settlers arriving in 1902 as part of Governor Charles Eliot's plan to have a settler economy pay for the recently completed Uganda Railway. The success of this settler economy would depend heavily on the availability of land, labour and capital, and so, over the next three decades, the colonial government and settlers consolidated their control over Kenyan land, and 'encouraged' native Kenyans to become wage labourers.|$|E

The fundamental objective of the paper is conceptualizing public goods and answer-ing a question whether a public goods delivered by agricultural land is valorized in land prices. The aim {{of the study was}} also to identify the mechanism that makes intrinsic land utility transformed into productivity in monetary units. A conducted research consists in deriving a land rent capitalized in land prices and estimating its <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> value in com-parison with the share of lease fees in the different regions of Poland in years 2000 – 2009. In the authors opinion since accession of Poland to the UE a market has valorized intrinsic utilities of land, whereas the new role of capital and labour is distribution of those utilities in favour of consumers. Given {{the fact that there is}} a lack of Polish scientifi c studies on ag-ricultural areas as a provider of public goods fi ndings of foreign scientists were also used in the research. Since the beginning of human civilization, the land has been creating certain utilities which satisfy human needs. When the dangerous side effects of industrial agricul-ture have occurred intrinsic land utilities are being discovered anew. They have a nature of public goods and constitute a hard core of the sustainable agriculture paradigm. Despit...|$|E

40|$|The author {{deals with}} two {{interconnected}} features of contemporary Hungarian rural family life from {{a historical perspective}} based on fieldwork carried out in Varsány in the early 1970 s and between 2000 and 2005. The first is the intertwining {{of the lives of}} successive generations of families in a period when other segments of Hungarian society were becoming more individualistic. This case puts into question whether economic models of the direction of the flow of goods between generations (linear, altruistic or exchange models) are applicable for this situation. The author suggests that Polányi’s ideas may be of help in understanding this phenomenon. The second is the balance of genders within families. Tatjana Thelen, who did fieldwork in another Hungarian village, Mesterszállás, pointed out a decline in the status of women. She holds the Hungarian policy of privatisation and reprivatisation responsible for it, which followed the great socio-economic and political change from socialism to capitalism in 1990. As a similar decrease in the status of women did not occur in Varsány, the author argues that other factors also should be taken into consideration for analysing such situations, like the role of commuting, education, and women’s <b>share</b> <b>in</b> <b>landed</b> property...|$|R
