In the southeast, the Adriatic Sea connects to the Ionian Sea at the [...] wide Strait of Otranto. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines {{the boundary between the}} Adriatic and the Ionian seas as a line running from the Butrinto River's mouth (latitude 39°44'N) in Albania to the Karagol Cape in Corfu, through this island to the Kephali Cape (these two capes are in latitude 39°45'N), and on to the Santa Maria di Leuca Cape (latitude 39°48'N). It extends [...] from the northwest to the southeast and is [...] wide. It covers [...] and has a volume of [...] The Adriatic extends northwest from 40° to 45°47' north, representing the Mediterranean's northernmost portion. The sea is geographically divided into the Northern Adriatic, Central (or Middle) Adriatic, and Southern Adriatic. The Adriatic Sea drainage basin encompasses , yielding a land–sea ratio of 1.8. The drainage basin's mean elevation is [...] above sea level, with a mean slope of 12.1°. Major rivers discharging into the Adriatic include the Po, Soča, Krka, Neretva, Drin, Bojana, and Vjosë. In the late 19th century, Austria-Hungary established a geodetic network with an elevation benchmark using the average Adriatic Sea level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste, Italy. The benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria, adopted by Yugoslavia, and retained by the states that emerged after its dissolution. In 2016, Slovenia adopted a new elevation benchmark referring to the upgraded tide gauge station in the coastal town of Koper.|$|E
50|$|The {{coastline}} of the Gulf of Maine {{is predominantly}} rocky and scenic; {{the only significant}} coastal developments {{are located in the}} Boston, Portsmouth, Portland and Saint John metropolitan areas. The effects of glaciation are responsible for stripping sedimentary soil away from the coastline, therefore the gulf lacks the sandy beaches found to the south along the Eastern Seaboard. The underwater features of the seabed sculptured during the lower sea levels of the ice ages make the gulf a <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> bounded to the south and east by underwater banks. Georges Bank in particular, on its southern end, protects the Gulf of Maine waters from the Gulf Stream. Gulf of Maine waters are more strongly influenced by the Labrador Current, making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south. Undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of 1,500 feet (500 m) while undersea mountains rise up 800 feet (266 m) from the sea floor, almost reaching the surface in some locations, or even exceeding it, creating islands.|$|E

The additional boundary agreed upon in 1975 consists of 5 points, extending from an end point of the 1968 line. All successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements.

The present contribution explores {{the question of whether}} this body of water may be considered a <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> for the purpose of implementing special governance techniques to enhance environmental protection in the area, as provided for in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The history behind the articles addressing this regime is assayed and the cooperative systems found in several notable enclosed and semi-enclosed seas are discussed in detail. The research concludes that while the Arctic Ocean may not fit the definition of a <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>sea,</b> it nevertheless shares similar properties. Regardless, the special needs of the Arctic Ocean remain, and therefore it is submitted that an analogous system could legitimately be applied mutatis mutandis in the Arctic Ocean. Such a regime would serve as a platform for enhancing environmental protection in the vulnerable and rapidly changing maritime area. For ease of transition, it is recommended that such work be accomplished through or in cooperation with the Arctic Council. ［文摘］北冰洋环境独特且脆弱，本文主要研究是否可将该水域视为半闭海，以便按照 1982 年《联合国海洋法公约》执行用以加强该区域环境保护的特殊治理方法。在分析闭海和半闭海制度有关条款的历史背景，并详细讨论在几个著名闭海和半闭海达成的合作体系后，本研究得出以下结论：虽然北冰洋并不符合半闭海的定义，但却与半闭海有类似的性质。无论如何，北冰洋存在特殊需求，因此本文主张(对闭海和半闭海制度) 进行必要变更，并将变更之后的类似制度合理地适用于北冰洋。此种制度可以作为一个平台，以加强这片脆弱且快速变化海域的环境保护。为了便于过渡，建议此项工作通过北极理事会或与其合作完成...|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop and apply {{ecological}} criteria for selecting marine reserve systems that effectively conserve diadromous species in enclosed and <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>seas.</b> It addressed the problem that, while marine reserves are increasingly being used to conserve biodiversity and restore biological populations, current marine reserve selection criteria and their application do not include functional linkages and external threats which make marine and freshwater ecosystems interdependent. Without explicitly capturing these linkages, marine reserves will fail to protect important elements that maintain marine biodiversity, especially diadromous fish species. The core tenet of the thesis argues that conservation of diadromous species in the marine biodiversity context is not inclusive when these species are being caught or are losing their spawning grounds in freshwater ecosystems beyond marine reserve boundaries. It proposes that functional linkages between freshwater and marine ecosystems, critical for viable diadromous fish populations and their habitats, {{be considered as a}} new criterion in reserve site selection processes, particularly for enclosed and <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>seas.</b> Furthermore, the effects of land-based threats on downstream marine ecosystems should be minimised. Four core principles to guide the application of this new criterion are presented: •Principle 1 : Functional ecological linkages between marine and freshwater ecosystems need to be maintained, while damaged functional linkages need to be restored. •Principle 2 : The life history attributes and critical habitat requirements and migration routes of diadromous species must be explicitly considered. •Principle 3 : Adverse land-based impacts on the ecological condition and integrity of marine reserves must be minimised. •Principle 4 : Strategies for selecting linked marine/freshwater reserves should be compatible with integrated management plans in coastal areas. The new criterion, in combination with the existing criteria used in marine reserve design, was applied using MARXAN reserve selection software, with the southern Caspian Sea selected as a case study. The application of all the criteria to the case study led to the selection of a marine reserve system that spatially linked marine and freshwater ecosystems. The selected reserve system included three major clusters of marine reserve units and 18 major river systems distributed across several biogeographic regions of the southern Caspian Sea. Endangered species’ habitats and ecologically important habitats for diadromous species were explicitly represented in the final reserve system. Areas which were identified as of great significance for traditional fishing communities were excluded from the selected reserve system, thus minimising the social and economic impacts on these communities. To provide access to unprotected areas for fishing and to leave adequate resources for local fisheries; 24. 5 % (411, 142 ha) of the sea was designated as reserve network. The outcome of analysis carried out in this thesis created a marine reserve network with combination of relatively small (100, 000 ha) reserve sites. This study is significant as it is the first attempt at selecting marine reserves in enclosed and <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>seas</b> such as the Caspian Sea which functionally link marine and freshwater ecosystems. The results confirm the need for functional linkages between marine and freshwater ecosystems. The final marine reserve network and protected river systems have the capacity to conserve biodiversity in a spatially linked marine-freshwater reserve network. However, the functional linkages are not limited only to biological linkages (i. e. diadromous species movement) —other aspects such as food and pollutant transfer between terrestrial and marine ecosystems (through runoff) are shown as critical issues in spatially linking freshwater and marine reserve ecosystems. These aspects need to be considered in the selection of reserve systems in enclosed and <b>semi-enclosed</b> <b>seas.</b> The Caspian Sea is a unique asset of global biodiversity and its conservation should be based on sound ecological science rather than economic and political opportunism. This study could be expanded to include trans-boundary management plans to designate an appropriate fraction of the whole Caspian Sea to a marine reserves network. This would represent an important step towards achieving biodiversity conservation for the whole sea and the freshwater ecosystems that feed into the sea...|$|R
