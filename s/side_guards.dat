5000|$|The {{work was}} decided {{to be done in}} two stage, desilting was done on large scale along with removal of Lotus plants and other waste from lake. The work {{included}} repairing of Eastern <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> wall of lake, construction of path way with granite stone paving, widening of 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., road <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> wall and landscaping berms, parking and garden bays on other side of road, fixing decorative lamp, benches, attractive dust bins etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, sprinkler system was provided. For sufficient lighting purpose, four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of lake. Two colored fountains of 15 feet and one white and fountain of 100 feet, as such total three floating fountains were set up in lake [...] The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on South <b>side</b> and <b>guard</b> wall of lake with sand beach on North side was also done in the same phase.|$|R
5000|$|In American and Canadian football, a guard (G) is {{a player}} who lines up between {{the center and the}} tackles on the {{offensive}} line of a football team on the line of scrimmage used primarily for blocking. [...] Right guards (RG) is the term for the guards on the right of the offensive line, while left guards (LG) are on the left <b>side.</b> <b>Guards</b> are to the right or left of the center.|$|E
50|$|A {{body kit}} or bodykit {{is a set}} of {{modified}} body parts or additional components that install on a stock car. Typically composed of front and rear bumpers, side skirts, spoilers, paint jobs, and sometimes front and rear <b>side</b> <b>guards</b> and roof scoops. There are many companies that offer alternatives to the original factory appearance of the vehicle. Body kits components are designed to complement each other and work together as a complete design. Despite this, the 'mix and match' approach is often seen on cars, where the front of one body kit will be matched with the rear of another, for example.|$|E
50|$|The Coroner's report, titled A Report on Cycling Fatalities in Toronto 1986-1996: Recommendations for Reducing Cycling Injuries and Death was {{released}} in 1998. The points of the report that ARC felt were {{the most likely to}} reduce cyclists' injuries and death were revisions to the Highway Traffic Act, in particular that cyclists have the right of way over cars and pedestrians the right of way over cyclists; the creation of comprehensive on-street bike lanes and off-street trails; and <b>side</b> <b>guards</b> on large trucks to reduce the chances of cyclists being 'sucked' in by the large wheels.|$|E
50|$|One {{effective}} press-break {{against the}} 1-3-1 full court press {{is to have}} either the power forward or the center to flash to midcourt and then quickly pass the weak <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> running down the sideline, not allowing the trap to be formed.|$|R
50|$|Taytay Tigre: A short bridge {{constructed}} {{during the}} Spanish colonial period. It is {{commonly known as}} “Taytay Tigre” because of the tiger stone structure made part of its approaches on both <b>sides</b> <b>guarding</b> the bridge before one enters the poblacion.

The living and reception rooms are located at the center area. The side buildings on both <b>sides</b> <b>guard</b> the open courtyard with two stone bases. The roof of the center main hall is taller than the other portions. The reception area is the major entrance to the building. The main gate is placed slightly behind its ordinary position. The side buildings are the living quarters. Rooms were assigned to family members according to their seniority.|$|R
5000|$|Safeties: The {{strong safety}} will line up four to {{four and a}} half yards off the line of {{scrimmage}} and will stand {{directly in front of the}} weak side tackle.

5000|$|Floating bridges were {{historically}} constructed using wood. Pontoons {{were formed}} by simply lashing several barrels together, by rafts of timbers, or by using boats. Each bridge section consisted {{of one or}} more pontoons, which were maneuvered into position and then anchored underwater or on land. The pontoons were linked together using wooden stringers called balks. The balks were covered by a series of cross planks called chesses to form the road surface, and the chesses were secured with <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> rails.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 the two PCP vans were repainted, and it {{is likely}} that around this time, the centre-W logo was {{replaced}} with a W over the genset end of the van, and no white stripe over the west end of the van. At this time, the diaphragms at the west end and the north and south <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> windows were removed, but PCP294 had a buffing plate added above where the diaphragm connection would have been installed at the west end, if that had ever taken place.|$|R
5000|$|The base Miami {{front is}} an [...] "over" [...] front, with a nose tackle shaded weak {{side to the}} center, a {{defensive}} tackle shaded outside the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard,</b> a defensive end shaded outside the tight end, and the weakside end outside the offensive tackle. Each lineman is assigned one gap. Linebackers are stationed about 4 to 4.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. This differs from the old Landry 4-3 defenses, in which linebackers are within 1.5 yards {{of the line of}} scrimmage.|$|R
50|$|Essentially, a power run is {{a running}} play with two lead blockers; the fullback and the {{backside}} offensive guard. A typical blocking scheme for a power run {{is for the}} linemen to down block the man in their inside gap. The fullback will kick out (block) the last man on {{the line of scrimmage}} (an outside linebacker or wide defensive end) and the back <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> will pull and lead up either the guard/tackle hole or the tackle/tight end hole and block the remaining linebacker or defensive back.|$|R
5000|$|Defensive ends: The weak side {{defensive}} end lines up {{one to two}} yards outside the weak offensive tackle. The strong side {{defensive end}} lines up on the outside shoulder of the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard.</b> The object of the weak side defensive end against the run is to protect against reverses and counters. Otherwise on pass plays he goes after the quarterback. The strong side defensive end {{is to make sure}} the offensive guard in front of him does not push him inside and does not get released to block the linebacker.|$|R
500|$|Keeps were {{traditionally}} {{built with}} an entrance at first-floor level, and Rochester's follows this pattern. A forebuilding {{attached to the}} north <b>side</b> <b>guarded</b> the entrance. A stone staircase began {{on the west side}} of the keep before turning and meeting the forebuilding, which could be entered by crossing a drawbridge across a gap [...] wide. There was another entrance in the west of the forebuilding, and at some point a new doorway was knocked through to the keep at the bottom of the drawbridge pit. The original door from the forebuilding into the keep was protected by a portcullis.|$|R

50|$|At the {{northern}} entrance is a porch and Decorated doorway, a good general view {{is at once}} obtained. There is a modern rood screen, a spacious and lofty central lantern, and a reredos with a carved spandrel. The Lady Chapel has lancet windows, foliated ornaments and a groined roof. The tomb of Bishop Booth, the builder of the porch, is in the sixth bay of the nave on the north <b>side,</b> <b>guarded</b> by the only ancient ironwork left in the cathedral. On {{the south side of}} the nave is the Norman font, a circular bowl large enough to allow of the immersion of children.|$|R
50|$|Castillo de Alcaudete is {{a castle}} in Alcaudete, in the {{province}} of Jaén, Spain. The castle was built by the Arabs over the remains of a previous Roman fortification and taken by the Christians in 1085 during the reign of Alfonso VI. For almost three hundred years thereafter, the castle kept changing hands until 1340 when the Christians took it over. The design is polygon in shape, adjusted to the terrain escarpments. The structure is surmounted by six towers, including the Tower of Homage, which has a door on the north <b>side,</b> <b>guarded</b> by two additional towers. The castle is restored and in good condition. It was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural monument in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Owing to this {{theoretical}} stalemate, {{and genuine}} hostility between the North and the South, {{large numbers of}} troops are still stationed along {{both sides of the}} line, each <b>side</b> <b>guarding</b> against potential aggression from the other side. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL; ROK soldiers, however heavily armed, patrol under the aegis of military police, and have memorized each line of the armistice. [...] Sporadic outbreaks of violence have killed over 500 South Korean soldiers, 50 US soldiers and 250 soldiers from DPRK along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Belle Chaise" [...] {{building}} and the lodging wing hosted the administrative section of the abbey. Abbot Richard Turstin built, on the East <b>side,</b> the <b>Guards</b> room (that became the abbey entrance) and a new officiality, where judicial decisions were made (1257).|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the castle lay on the west <b>side,</b> <b>guarded</b> by a gatehouse but no trace of this survives. Round towers are located on the north-west and south-west corners, and in the south-east corner there is a square tower with an additional projecting turret. The south-west and south-east towers have three storeys, with the south-east tower possessing a basement and postern gate which {{could serve as a}} counter-attack during a siege. A large hall lies the south of the castle with great, high windows and scaling ladders. Little remains of the original medieval defences in the outer ward of the castle, although the extensive curtain wall has been upkept and still remains along with a considerable part of the north side, including a semicircular turret and a square tower to the east.|$|R
50|$|The extreme western side, the one {{closest to}} the river, was guarded by Justin, while Martin {{positioned}} himself in the south-western side. The south side was defended by Angilas, Theodore and Philomathius. Angilas is recorded leading a regiment of Moorish peltasts and spearmen, probably meaning they were only armed with shield and lances. Theodore led heavy infantry consisting of Tzani, a recently Christianized tribe living in the mountains above Trapezus, while Philomathius led Isaurian slingers and dart-throwers. The south-eastern <b>side</b> was <b>guarded</b> by Gibrus, who led a combined force of Heruli and Lombards. The extreme eastern <b>side</b> was <b>guarded</b> by Valerian, leading forces from the praetorian prefecture of the East. Their composition is not recorded. Finally, the Byzantine ships were placed {{under the protection of}} Dabragezas the Wend and Elmingir (Elminegeir) the Hun.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, though, Yuan {{was working}} on another {{military}} project—proposing that Yuan Prefecture (原州, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia) -- formerly Tang territory, but now in a no-man's land between Tang and the Tibetan Empire, with neither <b>side</b> <b>guarding</b> it—be rebuilt; that Ma's forces be moved from Jing Prefecture to Yuan Prefecture; and that Guo's forces be moved from Bin Prefecture to Jing Prefecture; and that these posts then be used as bases of further forward advances against the Tibetan Empire. Emperor Daizong consulted with the general Tian Shen'gong (田神功) about this plan, and Tian responded, [...] "Battling and judging the status of enemies is difficult even for well-seasoned generals. Why would Your Imperial Majesty listen to a civilian and put the entire realm's forces under his control?" [...] Emperor Daizong thus tabled Yuan's proposal.|$|R
50|$|Slightly {{splitting}} offensive ends, called flexing, was in {{widespread use}} by Notre Dame's Box {{variation of the}} single-wing. Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Box offense employed a balanced line, which had 3 linemen {{on each side of}} the center. Another Rockne innovation was a shifting backfield that attempted to confuse the defense by moving backs to alternate positions right before the snap.Another variation of the single-wing saw the quarterback move out as a wingback on the weak side. Besides adding different blocking angles for the quarterback, the double-wing formation facilitated the passing game. Stanford had a variation on the double-wing in which the quarterback stayed right behind the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard,</b> while the tailback became the wingback to the weak side. The fullback, being the only deep back left, took all the snaps and directed the plays.|$|R
