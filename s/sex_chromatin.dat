40|$|Eukaryotic nuclei contain {{regions of}} {{differentially}} staining chromatin (heterochromatin), which remain condensed throughout the cell cycle and are largely transcriptionally silent. RNAi knockdown {{of the highly}} conserved heterochromatin protein HP 1 in Drosophila was previously shown to preferentially reduce male viability. Here we report a similar phenotype for the telomeric partner of HP 1, HOAP, and roles for both proteins in regulating the Drosophila sex determination pathway. Specifically, these proteins regulate the critical decision in this pathway, firing of the establishment promoter of the masterswitch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl). Female-specific activation of this promoter, Sxl(Pe), is essential to females, as it provides SXL protein to initiate the productive female-specific splicing of later Sxl transcripts, which are transcribed from the maintenance promoter (Sxl(Pm)) in both sexes. HOAP mutants show inappropriate Sxl(Pe) firing in males and the concomitant inappropriate splicing of Sxl(Pm) -derived transcripts, while females show premature firing of Sxl(Pe). HP 1 mutants, by contrast, display Sxl(Pm) splicing defects in both <b>sexes.</b> <b>Chromatin</b> immunoprecipitation assays show both proteins are associated with Sxl(Pe) sequences. In embryos from HP 1 mutant mothers and Sxl mutant fathers, female viability and RNA polymerase II recruitment to Sxl(Pe) are severely compromised.

Genes in active, inactive, and poised chromatin states exhibited differential responsiveness to ligand-activated nuclear receptors and distinct enrichments for functional gene catego-ries. Sex-biased genes were clustered by chromatin environments and mapped to DNase-hypersensitive sites (DHS) classi-fied by <b>sex</b> bias in <b>chromatin</b> accessibility and enhancer modifications. Results were integrated with genome-wide binding data for five transcription factors implicated in growth hormone-regulated, sex-biased liver gene expression, leading to the following findings. (i) Sex-biased DHS, but not sex-biased genes, are frequently characterized by sex-differential chromatin states, indicating distal regulation. (ii) Trimethylation of histone H 3 at K 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3) is a major sex-biased repressive mark at highly female-biased but not at highly male-biased genes. (iii) FOXA factors are associated with sex-dependent chromatin opening at male-biased but not female-biased regulatory sites. (iv) Sex-biased STAT 5 binding is enriched at sex-biased DHS marked as active enhancers and preferentially targets sex-biased genes with sex-differences in local chromatin marks. (v) The male-biased repressor BCL 6 preferentially targets female-biased genes and regulatory sites in a sex-independent chromatin state. (vi) CUX 2, a female-specific repressor of male-biased genes, also activates strongly female-biased genes, in association with loss of H 3 K 27 me 3 marks. Chromatin states are thus a major determinant of sex-biased chromatin accessibility and gene expression, with FOXA pioneer factors proposed to confer sex-dependent chromatin opening and STAT 5, but not BCL 6, regulating sex...|$|R

40|$|Imprinting is {{well-documented}} in both {{plant and animal}} species. In Drosophila, the Y chromosome is differently modified when transmitted through {{the male and female}} germlines. Here, we report genome-wide gene expression effects resulting from reversed parent-of-origin of the X and Y chromosomes. We found that hundreds of genes are differentially expressed between adult male Drosophila melanogaster that differ in the maternal and paternal origin of the sex chromosomes. Many of the differentially regulated genes are expressed specifically in testis and midgut cells, suggesting that sex chromosome imprinting might globally impact gene expression in these tissues. In contrast, we observed much fewer Y-linked parent-of-origin effects on genome-wide gene expression in females carrying a Y chromosome, indicating that gene expression in females is less sensitive to sex chromosome parent-of-origin. Genes whose expression differs between females inheriting a maternal or paternal Y chromosome also show sex chromosome parent-of-origin effects in males, but the direction of the effects on gene expression (overexpression or underexpression) differ between the sexes. We suggest that passage of <b>sex</b> chromosome <b>chromatin</b> through male meiosis may be required for wild-type function in F 1 progeny, whereas disruption of Y-chromosome function through passage in the female germline likely arises because the chromosome is not adapted to the female germline environment...|$|R
40|$|ATP-dependent {{nucleosome}} remodelers of the CHD family play {{important roles}} in chromatin regulation during development and differentiation. The ubiquitously expressed CHD 3 and CHD 4 proteins are essential for stem cell function and serve to orchestrate gene expression in different developmental settings. By contrast, the closely related CHD 5 is predominantly expressed in neural tissue and its role {{is believed to be}} restricted to neural differentiation. Indeed, loss of CHD 5 contributes to neuroblastoma. In this study, we first demonstrate that CHD 5 is a nucleosome-stimulated ATPase. We then compare CHD 3 / 4 and CHD 5 expression in mouse brain and show that CHD 5 expression is restricted to a subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons whereas CHD 3 / 4 expression is more widespread. We also uncover high levels of CHD 5 expression in testis. CHD 5 is transiently expressed in differentiating germ cells. Expression is first detected in nuclei of postmeiotic round spermatids, reaches a maximum in stage VIII spermatids and then falls to undetectable levels in stage IX spermatids. Surprisingly, CHD 3 / 4 and CHD 5 show complementary expression patterns during spermatogenesis with CHD 3 / 4 levels progressively decreasing as CHD 5 expression increases. In spermatocytes, CHD 3 / 4 localizes to the pseudoautosomal region, the X centromeric region and then spreads into the XY body chromatin. In postmeiotic cells, CHD 5 colocalises with macroH 2 A 1. 2 in association with centromeres and part of the Y chromosome. The subnuclear localisations of CHD 4 and CHD 5 suggest specific roles in regulation of <b>sex</b> chromosome <b>chromatin</b> and pericentromeric chromatin structure prior to the histone-protamine switch...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeterogametic species {{display a}} {{differential}} number of sex chromosomes resulting in imbalanced transcription levels for these chromosomes {{between males and}} females. To correct this disequilibrium, dosage compensation mechanisms involving gene expression and chromatin accessibility regulations have emerged throughout evolution. In insects, these mechanisms have been extensively characterized only in Drosophila but not in insects of agronomical importance. Aphids are indeed major pests {{of a wide range}} of crops. Their remarkable ability to switch from asexual to sexual reproduction during their life cycle largely explains the economic losses they can cause. As heterogametic insects, male aphids are X 0, while females (asexual and sexual) are XX. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic and open chromatin data obtained from whole male and female individuals to evaluate the putative existence of a dosage compensation mechanism involving differential chromatin accessibility of the pea aphid's X chromosome. Transcriptomic analyses first showed X/AA and XX/AA expression ratios for expressed genes close to 1 in males and females, respectively, suggesting dosage compensation in the pea aphid. Analyses of open chromatin data obtained by Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE-seq) revealed a X chromosome chromatin accessibility globally and significantly higher in males than in females, while autosomes' chromatin accessibility is similar between <b>sexes.</b> Moreover, <b>chromatin</b> environment of X-linked genes displaying similar expression levels in males and females-and thus likely to be compensated-is significantly more accessible in males. Our results suggest the existence of an underlying epigenetic mechanism enhancing the X chromosome chromatin accessibility in males to allow X-linked gene dose correction between sexes in the pea aphid, similar to Drosophila. Our study gives new evidence into the comprehension of dosage compensation in link with chromatin biology in insects and newly in a major crop pest, taking benefits from both transcriptomic and open chromatin data...|$|R

5000|$|Fourteen {{years after}} the {{original}} description of the syndrome, 2 groups independently discovered that the buccal mucosal cells of these patients contained an extra chromatin mass, or were chromatin positive. A few years later, Jacobs and Strong found that these chromatin-positive patients had 47 chromosomes, with an extra X chromosome, and were XXY. The extra X chromosome results from either meiotic nondisjunction, in which a chromosome pair fails to separate during meiosis, or from anaphase lag. Anaphase lag might result in a gamete losing a sex chromosome; a chromosome lags and is not incorporated in the new cell in {{the next stage of}} mitosis (anaphase). Such anaphase lag could account for the largest minority of karyotypes, the mosaics XY/XXY and XX/XXY. Eighty percent of these patients have positive <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin,</b> and their karyotypes may vary widely, and with many mosaics.The syndrome in patients with positive chromatin in the buccal mucosa should probably be called Klinefelter's disease. Although these patients have positive female <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin,</b> they are phenotypic males and should never be considered otherwise. The other 20%, whose testes are not small, have XY chromosomes and should be studied further to determine etiology. These patients often have no complaints, and the condition is discovered {{in the course of a}} general physical examination. Sterility and gynecomastia are the most common complaints. It is thought that 5% to 10% of sterile males have this condition. When this disorder is suspected, a buccal smear is the first test to request. If the cells are chromatin positive, the diagnosis is made; testicular biopsy and karyotyping are not necessary. If the buccal mucosa is chromatin negative, further studies are indicated.The extra X chromosome in these men has stimulated much interest, but its function, if any, has not been determined. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a disorder more common in female patients, has been frequently reported in this syndrome, but the association is not statistically significant. The association with leukemia may also be coincidental. Leg ulcers, osteoporosis, and taurodontism occur with greater frequency in these patients than in control subjects, and dermatoglyphic studies have shown characteristic abnormalities.|$|E

50|$|How did {{evolutionary}} non-related genes come {{in close}} proximity in the first place? Either there is a force that brings functionally related genes near to each other, or the genes came near by change. Singer et al. proposed that genes came {{in close proximity}} by random recombination of genome segments. When functionally related genes came {{in close proximity to}} each other, this proximity was conserved. They determined all possible recombination sites between genes of human and mouse. After that, they compared the clustering of the mouse and human genome and looked if recombination had occurred at the potentially recombination sites. It turned out that recombination between genes of the same cluster was very rare. So, as soon as a functional cluster is formed recombination is suppressed by the cell. On sex chromosomes, the amount of clusters is very low in both human and mouse. The authors reasoned this was due to the low rate of chromosomal rearrangements of <b>sex</b> chromosomes. Open <b>chromatin</b> regions are active regions. It is more likely that genes will be transferred to these regions. Genes from organelle and virus genome are inserted more often in these regions. In this way non-homologous genes can be pressed together in a small domain.|$|R

Materials and Methods: 30 normal semen samples were prepared with PureSperm, albumin gradients and alb/PureSperm. All samples were then stained by FISH and chromomycin A 3. The results were compared with SPSS 11. 5 and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: The proportion of X-bearing spermatozoa by PureSperm separation (47. 58 ± 5. 67) and Y-bearing spermatozoa by albumin gradient (46. 13 ± 3. 83) methods were slightly higher than in putative normal sperm samples (1 : 1), but {{there were no significant differences}} in the X- or Y- bearing spermatozoa counts among the three methods. Albumin gradient separation tended to underestimate abnormal spermatozoa compared to PureSperm and combined alb/PureSperm.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: In the leuphotrochozoan {{parasitic}} platyhelminth Schistosoma mansoni, male {{individuals are}} homogametic (ZZ) whereas females are heterogametic (ZW). To elucidate the mechanisms {{that led to}} the emergence of sex chromosomes we compared the genomic sequence and the chromatin structure of male and female individuals. As for many eukaryotes, the lower estimate for the repeat content is 40 %, with an unknown proportion of domesticated repeats. We used massive sequencing to de novo assemble all repeats, and identify unambiguously Z-specific, W-specific and pseudoautosomal regions of the S. mansoni sex chromosomes. RESULTS: We show that 70 - 90 % of S. mansoni W and Z are pseudoautosomal. No female specific gene could be identified. Instead, the W-specific region is composed almost entirely of 36 satellite repeat families, of which 33 were previously unknown. Transcription and chromatin status of female specific repeats are stage specific: for those repeats that are transcribed, transcription is restricted to the larval stages lacking sexual dimorphism. In contrast, in the sexually dimorphic adult stage of the life cycle, no transcription occurs. In addition, the euchromatic character of histone modifications around the W-specific repeats decreases during the life cycle. Recombination repression occurs in this region even if homologous sequences are present on both the Z and W chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Our study provides for the first time evidence for the hypothesis that, at least in organisms with a ZW type of <b>sex</b> chromosomes, repeat-induced <b>chromatin</b> structure changes could indeed be the initial event in sex chromosome emergence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Simultaneous {{determinations}} of DNA {{content in}} cell nuclei and condensed chromatin bodies formed by heterochromatized regions of <b>sex</b> chromosomes (gonosomal <b>chromatin</b> bodies, GCB) {{have been performed}} in two trophoblast cell populations of the East-European field vole Microtus rossiaemeridionalis : in the proliferative population of trophoblast cells of the junctional zone of placenta and in the secondary giant trophoblast cells. One or two GCBs have been observed in trophoblast cell nuclei of all embryos studied (perhaps both male and female). In the proliferative trophoblast cell population characterized by low ploidy levels (2 – 16 c) and in the highly polyploid population of secondary giant trophoblast cells (32 – 256 c) the total DNA content in GCB increased proportionally to the ploidy level. In individual GCBs the DNA content also rose proportionally to the ploidy level in nuclei both with one and with two GCBs in both trophoblast cell populations. Some increase in percentage of nuclei with 2 – 3 GCBs was shown in nuclei of the placenta junctional zone; this may {{be accounted for by}} genome multiplication via uncompleted mitoses. In nuclei of the secondary giant trophoblast cells (16 – 256 c) the number of GCBs did not exceed 2, and the fraction of nuclei with two GCBs did not increase, which suggests the polytene nature of sex chromosomes in these cells. In all classes of ploidy the DNA content in trophoblast cell nuclei with the single GCB was lower than in nuclei with two and more GCBs. This can indicate that the single GCB in many cases does not derive from fusion of two GCBs. The measurements in individual GCBs suggest that different heterochromatized regions of the X- and Y-chromosome may contribute in GCB formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Synaptonemal {{complexes}} (SCs) are zipperlike {{structures that}} are assembled between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. They consist of two axial elements (AEs) (one along {{each of the}} two homologous chromosomes), which, in mature SCs, are connected by numerous transverse filaments along their length. Several proteins involved in the later steps of meiotic recombination most probably function in close association with the AEs of SCs, because the proteins involved in these steps have all been localised along AEs or SCs by immunocytochemical methods. It is not known at which step in meiotic recombination this association with the AEs is established. In order to shed some light on this issue, we analysed the localisation of two proteins that are involved in early steps of meiotic recombination, RAD 50 and MRE 11, relative to AEs and SCs by immunofluorescence labelling of paraffin sections of the mouse testis, using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against RAD 50 and MRE 11, and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SC components. The localisation patterns of MRE 11 and RAD 50 within spermatocytes were very similar. MRE 11 and RAD 50 appeared in high abundance in preleptotene spermatocytes, just before SC components could be detected. From preleptotene until early zygotene they were present throughout the nucleus. In mid and late zygotene, MRE 11 and RAD 50 concentrated in distinct areas; in early pachytene the two proteins had almost disappeared from the nucleus, except from the <b>sex</b> vesicle (the <b>chromatin</b> of the XY bivalent), where they persisted in high abundance until diplotene. We propose that MRE 11 and RAD 50, together with other proteins, prepare chromatin throughout the early meiotic prophase nucleus for the initiation of meiotic recombination.

In female nuclei the ratio between the nuclear DNA content and that of their <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> or heterochromatic bodies remains constant irrespective of the polyploid state of the nucleus. Thus, in polyploid nuclei the heterochromatic bodies double their DNA content with each duplication of the diploid nuclear DNA content. Therefore, it is assumed that the large or multiple heterochromatic bodies of female polyploid nuclei are conjugated or multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> bodies. Some male diploid nuclei show a distinct heterochromatic body whose DNA content is about one-half that of a <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin.</b> About one-half of the polyploid male nuclei have heterochromatic bodies whose DNA content is approximately onehalf of those of female nuclei of the corresponding polyploid class. This would indicate that in male diploid nuclei the single X chromosome sometimes leaves a heterochromatic rest one-half the size of a <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> and in polyploid male nuclei the two or more X's may leave larger heterochromatic bodies. However, many male nuclei, even when polyploid, do not have distinct heterochromatic bodies.

One or two GCBs have been observed in trophoblast cell nuclei of all embryos studied (perhaps both male and female). In the proliferative trophoblast cell population characterized by low ploidy levels (2 – 16 c) and in the highly polyploid population of secondary giant trophoblast cells (32 – 256 c) the total DNA content in GCB increased proportionally to the ploidy level. In individual GCBs the DNA content also rose proportionally to the ploidy level in nuclei both with one and with two GCBs in both trophoblast cell populations. Some increase in percentage of nuclei with 2 – 3 GCBs was shown in nuclei of the placenta junctional zone; this may {{be accounted for by}} genome multiplication via uncompleted mitoses. In nuclei of the secondary giant trophoblast cells (16 – 256 c) the number of GCBs did not exceed 2, and the fraction of nuclei with two GCBs did not increase, which suggests the polytene nature of sex chromosomes in these cells. In all classes of ploidy the DNA content in trophoblast cell nuclei with the single GCB was lower than in nuclei with two and more GCBs. This can indicate that the single GCB in many cases does not derive from fusion of two GCBs. The measurements in individual GCBs suggest that different heterochromatized regions of the X- and Y-chromosome may contribute in GCB formation...|$|R
40|$|Summary. <b>Sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> {{is present}} in 67 to 90 % of the {{ectodermal}} cell nuclei in the female mouse amnion. A similar body is found in 2 to 15 % of these nuclei in the male. This criterion is a reliable indicator of {{the sex of the}} foetus from the 11 th day of gestation onwards. <b>Sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> is found in many of the cell nuclei of females, but is absent from the nuclei of males. In a suitable tissue, {{the presence or absence of}} nuclear <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> is a reliable indicator of the genetic sex of the individual. The nuclei of mouse cells usually contain so much heterochromatin that sex chro¬ matin cannot be detected (Moore, 1966); nevertheless, <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> should be present in suitable tissues, because the behaviour of the X chromosomes in the mouse is similar to that of other species. One X chromosome in each cell of the female mouse is genetically inactive (Lyon 1961), replicates its dna late in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Galton 8 c Holt, 1965), and is hetero-chromatic in the prophase stage of mitosis (Ohno 8 c Hauschka, 1960). These features are associated with the appearance of <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> in other specie...|$|E
40|$|A SEXUAL {{dimorphism}} in resting nuclei {{has been}} described for man and monkey among the primates, and for several species of the orders Carnivora and Artiodactyla. It {{is based on the}} presence of a special chromocentre, known as the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin,</b> in the nuclei of females. Graham and Barr (1952) suggested that the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> may represent heterochromatic regions of the two X-chromosomes that adhere to each other. This hypothesis is strengthened by the meticulous study of chromocentres in epidermal cell nuclei by Sachs and Danon (1956). The literature pertaining to the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> and its clinical application in anomalies of sex development has been ably reviewed by Lennox (1956), Davidson and Smith (1956) and Nelson (1956). Several reports have appeared that deal with the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> of tumour cells and these will be referred to later in the paper. The observations recorded in the present report are a sequel to the study of sex characteristics in nuclei of benign tumours, where the nuclei were found to be like those of normal tissues (Moore and Barr, 1955) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} of Campbell and Price in 1979 that their Unit had diagnosed four subjects with both Klinefelter's syndrome and congenital hypothyroidism raised the suspicion of {{an association between}} the two conditions. This, and the published reports of an XX male, five XXY males, and one mosaic XY/XXY with congenital or acquired forms of hypothyroidism, together with the higher incidence in women {{and the absence of}} sex difference among inherited congenital cases, suggested a possible sex chromosome effect in the aetiology of sporadic hypothyroidism. Various hypotheses can be tested either by examining the frequency of hypothyroidism in <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> positive males or by establishing a higher frequency of <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> positive males among hypothyroid cases than in normal males. We examined 57 boys with hypothyroidism for the presence of <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> and found all to be negative. From this relatively small sample we can only exclude the possibility of a very large (100 fold) difference in frequency between the two populations and therefore more data are needed...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. -The {{presence}} of <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> in a metastatic malignant melanoma from a male patient aged 26 who showed {{no evidence of}} any constitutional chromosome anomaly is described. A possible association between the apparently " female " origin of the tumour and the good response to therapy is considered. TU. '% 1 OTJRS of males, apart from teratomas, do not generally show <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> (Tavares,. 11. 466; Atkin, 1967). We found only one chromatin-positive tumour among 311 non-teratomatous malignant tumours studied by a squash techiiique; this was an oesophageal carcinoma in a patient aged 71 who proved to be an unsuspected case of Klinefelter's syndrome with a 47,XXY karyotype (Atkin and Baker, 1965). The present tumour shows the appearances of <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> in the tumour cells, but studies on the patient's normal cells have revealed no evidence of a constitutional chromosome anomaly. The case is also notable for the good outcome of treatment; the patient is well 41 years after removal of the primary tumou...|$|E
40|$|Gametogenesis is {{a sexually}} dimorphic process {{requiring}} profound differences in germ cell differentiation between the sexes. In mammals, {{the presence of}} heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males creates additional sex-specific challenges, including incomplete X and Y pairing during meiotic prophase. This triggers formation of a heterochromatin domain, the XY body. The XY body disassembles after prophase, but specialized <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> persists, with further modification, through meiosis. Here, we investigate the function of DMRT 7, a mammal-specific protein related to the invertebrate sexual regulators Doublesex and MAB- 3. We find that DMRT 7 preferentially localizes to the XY body in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and is required for male meiosis. In Dmrt 7 mutants, meiotic pairing and recombination appear normal, and a transcriptionally silenced XY body with appropriate chromatin marks is formed, but most germ cells undergo apoptosis during pachynema. A minority of mutant cells can progress to diplonema, {{but many of these}} escaping cells have abnormal <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> lacking histone H 3 K 9 di- and trimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1 b accumulation, modifications that normally occur between pachynema and diplonema. Based on the localization of DMRT 7 to the XY body and the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> defects observed in Dmrt 7 mutants, we conclude that DMRT 7 plays a role in the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> transformation that occurs between pachynem...|$|E
40|$|Studies of mice with Y {{chromosome}} long arm deficiencies {{suggest that}} the male-specific region (MSYq) encodes information required for sperm differentiation and postmeiotic <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> repression (PSCR). Several genes have been identified on MSYq, {{but because they are}} present in more than 40 copies each, their functions cannot be investigated using traditional gene targeting. Here, we generate transgenic mice producing small interfering RNAs that specifically target the transcripts of the MSYq-encoded multicopy gene Sly (Sycp 3 -like Y-linked). Microarray analyses performed on these Slydeficient males and on MSYq-deficient males show a remarkable up-regulation of sex chromosome genes in spermatids. SLY protein colocalizes with the X and Y chromatin in spermatids of normal males, and Sly deficiency leads to defective repressive marks on the <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin,</b> such as reduced levels of the heterochromatin protein CBX 1 and of histone H 3 methylated at lysine 9. Sly-deficient mice, just like MSYq-deficient mice, have severe impairment of sperm differentiation and are near sterile. We propose that their spermiogenesis phenotype is a consequence of the change in spermatid gene expression following Sly deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first successful targeted disruption of the function of a multicopy gene (or of any Y gene). It shows that SLY has a predominant role in PSCR, either via direct interaction with the spermatid <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> or via interaction with <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> protein partners. Sly deficiency is the major underlying cause of the spectrum of anomalies identified 17 y ago in MSYq-deficient males. Our results also {{suggest that the}} expansion o...|$|E

Previous observations {{on a variety of}} invasive tumours of females showed that the presence of more than one <b>sex</b> <b>chromatin</b> body is generally associated with a high chromosome number. The pattern of two or more bodies in near-diploid cells seen in this non-invasive tumour may therefore characterize an intermediate stage of clonal evolution, eventually resulting in malignancy, when the cell line has not yet achieved the ability to invade or metastasize...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sex</b> <b>{{chromatin}}</b> body is an oval or round chromatin mass approximately 1 micron {{in diameter}} lying against the inner {{portion of the}} nuclear membrane.
