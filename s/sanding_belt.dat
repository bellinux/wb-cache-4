50|$|Linish is an {{engineering}} term {{that refers to}} the process of using grinding or belt sanding techniques to improve the flatness of a surface. The flatness may be two-dimensional, i.e. with the view of achieving a flat plate, or one-dimensional, e.g. with the view of achieving a perfectly cylindrical shape. The machine that does this may be called a linisher or a linish grinder. The technique may also be used, with finer grades of grindstone or <b>sanding</b> <b>belt,</b> to polish a surface.|$|E
50|$|A {{belt sander}} is a sander used in shaping and {{finishing}} wood and other materials. It {{consists of an}} electric motor that turns a pair of drums on which a continuous loop of sandpaper is mounted. Belt sanders may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the <b>sanding</b> <b>belt.</b> Stationary belt sanders are sometimes mounted on a work bench, in which case they are called bench sanders. Stationary belt sanders are often combined with a disc sander.|$|E

50|$|In woodworking, {{wide belt}} sanders use platens {{to press the}} sanding paper {{into contact with the}} wood being sanded. The platen sits between two steel rolls which deliver the moving force to the <b>sanding</b> <b>belt.</b> Sanding heads with a platen are used on finish sanding with papers of finer grits, when the coarser ones are {{typically}} used with contact drum type sanding heads. Stock is fed {{into and out of the}} machine on a conveyor belt. Since the abrasive belt creates a substantial pressure on the stock that tends to push the stock toward the infeed, the hold down shoes and rollers hold the workpiece down against the belt while it is moving through the machine in order to ensure uniform contact with the abrasive and continuous movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} analyzes a valley's aeolian landforms in a semi-humid {{region and}} presents {{a model of}} its contemporary evolution. Mainling Valley of the Yarlung Zangbo River on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau {{was chosen as the}} case study for the analysis of morphometric characteristics and the evolution sequence of aeolian landforms via field data and remote sensing images. The aeolian landforms were primarily composed of aeolian <b>sand</b> <b>belts</b> on river terraces and dunes (sheets) on hillside slopes. Three types of aeolian <b>sand</b> <b>belts</b> were identified based on their dune types. In type I belts, an erosive air stream combined with relatively high vegetation cover (10 %) produced sparsely distributed parabolic dunes with a high variability of dune heights; in type II belts, the continual reworking by the erosive air stream in combination with low vegetation cover (3 %) formed more densely distributed barchans and transitional dunes with a moderate variability of dune heights; and in type III belts, the gradual evolution from an erosive sand-laden air stream to a saturated sand-laden air stream in combination with low vegetation cover (2 %) produced the densest crescentic dunefields but with the least variability in dune heights. Dune sizes increase, dune shapes become uniform, and dune distribution becomes close from type I to III belts. Lateral linking and merging of the dunes were also observed within the belts. Together this evidence indicates that an evolution sequence may exist. Aeolian dunefields in the belt appear to evolve from embryonic parabolic dunefields to adolescent barchan dunefields and, subsequently, to mature compound crescentic dunefields. As the aeolian <b>sand</b> <b>belt</b> evolves into the mature stage, sand accumulations {{at the foot of the}} mountain valley can be steps for sand accumulation on valley-side slopes.

40|$|The Upper Tithonian–Valanginian shallow-water carbonates {{outcropping}} in the Palermo Mts (NW Sicily) {{consist of}} several facies associations reflecting different depositional environments of a carbonate rimmed shelf, {{pertaining to the}} Southern Tethyan continental margin. The reconstructed depositional model, based on the sedimentological features, cyclic facies arrangement and biota distribution, shows that a wide protected lagoon, dominated by algae, molluscs and scattered patch reefs, was bordered landward by a tidal flat, where stromatolitic algal mats were cyclically subaerial exposed, and seaward by a marine <b>sand</b> <b>belt</b> and reef complex. Oolitic packstone-grainstone lithofacies, cyclically subjected to subaerial exposure, suggests the occurrence of a barrier island, located nearly to the lagoonal carbonate shoreline, allowing the development of narrow embayments with restricted circulation. In the outer platform, the oolitic lithofacies of the marine <b>sand</b> <b>belt</b> pass landward into the protected lagoon, where washover oolite sands occur, and seaward into a high-energy zone (back-reef apron) gradually merging in the reef complex. In the latter, coral framestone occupied the inner sector (reef flat), while the facies association dominated by boundstone with Ellipsactinia sp. developed in the outer sectors (reef wall), adjacent to the fore-reef and upper slope environments. Stratigraphic evidence, associated with the recognized facies associations, helped to reconstruct the geo-tectonic setting of the carbonate platform, where {{the distribution of the}} depositional facies along the shelf and their extension were influenced by the tectonically-inherited sea bottom topography. In a regime of extensional tectonics, localized and thin succession of high-energy prograding oolite <b>sand</b> <b>belt</b> depositional facies occupied structural highs (footwall uplift), while the largely diffused and thick low energy aggrading peritidal-to-lagoonal depositional facies developed in subsiding hanging wall. The reef complex and the fore-reef depositional facies, exhibiting lateral migration and prograding geometries with clinoforms and downlap stratal terminations, developed on a subsident stepped margin, adjacent to a faulted shelf-break. This morphostructural setting can be comprised in a model, where the tilted and faulted-blocks (inner platform) and stepped margin (outer platform) paleo-topography, inherited from the rifting tectonics, was the most important factor controlling the geometry and depositional architecture of a carbonate platform growing on the Southern Tethyan passive margin...|$|R

40|$|The Pantanal (Brazil) {{is one of}} the world’s largest {{tropical}} wetlands. A {{natural phenomenon}} that encourages more detailed scientific studies on this region is the genesis and behavior of innumerable small lakes and ponds with open-water surfaces on the Nhecolândia region at the Taquarí alluvial fan. In this paper, we suggest a new approach to detect and differentiate lakes among saline and nonsaline using solely remote sensing data and object-based image analysis, which have still been undertaken towards this end. In all experiments the visible and near-infrared bands of the ASTER sensor were used. The methodology involved segmentation steps using the multi-resolution segmentation algorithm available on the Definiens Developer system as well as rule-based classifications and merging of objects. The classification model was structured as s process-tree. Initially, a segmentation and classification step was carried out with the purpose of precise detection and delineation of all lakes. Following, <b>sand</b> <b>belts</b> were detected also through a segmentation and classification process. Finally, the differentiation between saline and non-saline lakes was done based on the criterion of relative border to <b>sand</b> <b>belts.</b> A qualitative analysis of the resulting thematic map indicated a good result. Quantitatively, the error matrix scored an overall accuracy of 73 % as well as a Kappa index of 0. 64. Most of the classification errors were ascribed to intermittent lakes on different drought conditions. The object-based classification approach has proven to be very efficient for the detection of lakes and their differentiation between saline and non-saline in the region of Pantanal of Nhecolândia. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dunes are {{generally}} found in Poland either along the seacoast or inland, mainly in river valleys and on glaciofluvial outwash fans. The {{position of the}} dune fields of the Toruń Basin is unique also {{due to the fact}} that it is dominated by large dune forms, while the western part of the European <b>sand</b> <b>belt</b> is dominated by aeolian coversands. Dunes in the Toruń Basin are found on all terraces and make up vast clusters (complexes). W. Mrózek (1958) delimited there six dune fields. The dunes located in the Toruń Basin take the shape of crescent (parabolic) forms, simple ramparts (longitudinal and transversal) and irregular hilly forms. Additionally, there are numerous vast and plain areas covered with aeolian sand up to 4 – 5 m deep, which contain scattered irregular low dunes. The dunes of the Toruń Basin are mainly built of fine-grained and medium-grained sands which come from the local substratum of fluvioglacial and river deposits. The results of the studies on aeolian deposits carried out in the in Europe indicate that the earliest aeolian series (Older Coversand I, van der Hammen 1971) were deposited as early as Late Pleniglacial. In Poland this series has not been recog-nized, although the river deposits of that age have a larger content of quartz grain abraded in aeolian environment (Kozarski 1990; Manikowska 1991; Goździk 1991). New research claims in the Toruń Basin that the dunes formed chifly in the Younger Dryas, but probably also in the Older Dryas and even in the Preboreal.
