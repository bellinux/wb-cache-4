To understand the transport of methane confined in a nanoscale pore is useful for developing and optimizing some related industry processes.

Many factors, such as temperatures, densities of methane and surface <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>pore,</b> which could affect the transport of methane, were examined in simulations.
