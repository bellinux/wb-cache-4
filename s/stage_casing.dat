50|$|All {{thirteen}} launches {{were made}} from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The first launch (carrying Intelsat 301) on September 18, 1968 was a complete failure when the first stage began suffering abnormal pitch gyrations starting at T+20 seconds. The booster maintained a stable attitude until around T+100 seconds when it pitched over and began to break up from structural loads. As the Delta was also headed back towards land, Range Safety sent the destruct signal at T+108 seconds. The fifth launch on July 25, 1969 (Intelsat 305) suffered a rupture of either the third <b>stage</b> <b>casing</b> or nozzle {{and ended up in}} an unusable orbit. Of the thirteen launches, twelve carried geosynchronous communications satellites. The thirteenth, which was the final flight and {{the only one in the}} M6 configuration, placed Explorer 43 into a highly elliptical orbit.|$|E
50|$|At 12:10 AM EST on {{the night}} of March 2-3, Pioneer 4 lifted from LC-5. This time, the booster {{performed}} almost perfectly so that Pioneer 4 achieved its primary objective (an Earth-Moon trajectory), returned radiation data and provided a valuable tracking exercise. A slightly longer than nominal second stage burn however was enough to induce small trajectory and velocity errors, so that the probe passed within 60,000 km of the Moon's surface (7.2° E, 5.7° S) on 4 March 1959 at 22:25 UT (5:25 p.m. EST) at a speed of 7,230 km/h and was not able to impact as planned. The distance was also not close enough to trigger the photoelectric sensor. The probe continued transmitting radiation data for 82.5 hours, to a distance of 409,000 miles (658,000 km), and reached perihelion on 18 March 1959 at 01:00 UT. The cylindrical fourth <b>stage</b> <b>casing</b> (173 cm long, 15 cm diameter, 4.65 kg) went into orbit with the probe. The communication system had worked well, and it was estimated that signals could have been received out to 680,000 miles (1 million kilometers) had there been enough battery power.|$|E

By this <b>stage,</b> designing <b>casings</b> was no longer sufficient for d2 to maintain a competitive edge, and so the company began to develop its own products and invest in R&D. d2 began to open subsidiaries around Europe, the first in London in 1991, followed by offices in Brussels and Copenhagen. The company began to expand its business beyond the Mac market and target PC users. In 1995, électronique d2 acquired the US company La Cie, a subsidiary of Quantum. LaCie was operating in the same market niche as électronique d2, and the buyout gave d2 a foothold into the North American market. In 1998, {{it was decided to}} adopt the name LaCie as a worldwide brand, dropping the d2 name from its product range (although even today, several products still retain reference to it).|$|R
40|$|Temporary casings are {{regularly}} {{used in the}} construction of rotary bored piles, to support the pile bore in potentially unstable soils and also to prevent water ingress from loose or water logged soils. The preferred method of removal of casing is by pulling with a crawler crane. However, the magnitude of force generated, particularly during the initial <b>stage</b> of <b>casing</b> extraction, is unknown. This paper describes a series of 50 g centrifuge tests designed to model the casing and surrounding soil during extraction by crane. In each test different sized model casings were installed at various embedment depths into a layer of clay overlain by a well-graded sand to provide an array of data. The depth of granular overburden was varied from 60 mm to 120 mm to allow for assessment of the influence of this material on the extraction force whilst the casing sizes modelled 900 mm and 1800 mm prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Turbo-compressors play {{a crucial}} role in the {{operation}} of air-breathing engines and special attention is given to the compressor’s ability to withstand adverse operating conditions. Various methods have been devised in order to enhance compressor stability and increase compressor stall margin, usually with some sacrifice of performance and efficiency. Active methods make use of external devices injecting and/or bleeding air from the compressor duct. Passive methods are primarily based on casing treatments, often involving flow paths into the rotor casing, to affect the behavior of the flow in favorable ways. In either case, it is desirable that the stability enhancing method be as simple as possible and that it keep performance and/or efficiency degradation to a minimum. The present work consists of a CFD analysis performed to evaluate the impact of a novel form of passive stability control on the operation of an axial flow fan <b>stage.</b> The <b>casing</b> treatment consists of “studs,” which are solid structures protruding from the casing into the duct. These structures are located slightly downstream of the fan rotor trailing edge. The stage that is studied in this investigation is the NASA SDT 2 R 4 transonic turbofan. The simulation software used is “Tenasi,” an in-house developed flow solver. Various simulations were conducted of the turbofan operation with and without casing treatment. Measures of performance and efficiency of the turbofan <b>stage</b> with no <b>casing</b> treatment were computed, and the results showed good agreement with available experimental data. The computed results from simulation with casing treatment suggest that protruding studs have the potential to improve the stability of the turbofan. The computed stall margin increase using an initial configuration of protruding studs is about 5. 4 % in terms of mass flow rate, with a decrease in efficiency of about 1. 6 %. The flow-field was investigated through visualizations of flow features in order to understand the mechanisms of flow instabilities and stability enhancement. Other simulations were also carried out using modifications of the original studs to assess further changes in performance...|$|R

50|$|Trichoptera, or Caddisfly, larvae use silk to {{hunt and}} protect {{themselves}} in their aquatic environment. Much like silkworms (B. mori) and other Lepidoptera, this silk protein is excreted by specialized silk glands. The silk’s structure is mostly conserved among many different caddisfly species, {{and can be used}} to bind debris including rocks, sticks, twigs and shells, as well as to build nets for catching prey. Caddisflies, which spend the majority of their life cycle in the larval <b>stage,</b> need these <b>casings</b> to protect their underbellies and pupate. Caddisfly silk is very strong and durable.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there have been}} major changes in casing design {{requirements}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry. The changes were necessary to withstand the loads and stresses from the unconventional reservoir. However, there had been numerous reports of casing failure, indicating that the current casing design for the unconventional wells might not be adequate, resulting in a higher-than-expected failure rate in the production strings. Many factors are considered in casing design, as it goes through different stages of well completion and production. For this reason, it is difficult to address the cause of the failure. This study is carried out using statistical analysis methods to identify the most influential factors leading to the casing failure, and recommend {{what can be done to}} improve casing design by using the data analysis method. This study focuses on a dataset from the Granite Wash play located in Texas and Oklahoma. Statistical analysis methods, including basic descriptive analysis method and logistic regression method, are employed to analyze the correlation between the failed wells and the possible factors contributing to the failure. The data analysis shows four main factors: casing size, average water used per fracture stage, average proppant used per fracture <b>stage</b> and <b>casing</b> weight, which are correlated to the casing failure in this study region. The study concludes that data analysis can be employed in making an improvement in casing design for the wells that experience higher than usual rate of casing failure. By iii following the recommendations on using data analysis, the causes of the casing failures can be found which can be used for the casing design improvement...|$|R
40|$|Shell has {{developed}} a novel mono-diameter well concept {{for oil and gas}} wells as opposed to the traditional telescopic well design. A Mono- diameter well contains multiple casing sections with the same internal diameter. This is achieved by expansion of the casing sections concerned using an expansion cone. Since the well is drilled in <b>stages</b> and <b>casings</b> are inserted to support the open hole, an overlap section between two consecutive (expandable) casings exists which has to be expanded. When the cone enters the overlap section, the expansion force increases dramatically due to the expansion of two casings, cured cement and formation layers. When the cone finalizes the expansion of the overlap section it pops out, the expansion force vanishes and the cone accelerates upwards and it generates an empty volume to be filled by the well fluid (mud). As a result of this, fluid starts to flow through the drill pipe, around the cone and the fluid volume below the cone starts to decompress. This induces a surge pressure wave traveling upwards and a swab pressure wave in the expanded casing traveling downwards. If the pressure difference between outside and inside of the expanded casing exceeds the collapse rating of the casing, the casing will collapse which leads to the loss of the concerned well section. Repair of such a failure costs time and money, therefore this swab pressure must be well predicted to enable the installation process to be designed such that this collapse can be avoided. A model of fully coupled fluid-structure interaction between cone and the well fluid is built for calculating the swab pressure propagating downward and surge pressure propagating upward resulted from transient process occurring after cone pops out. This model has shown an effective tool for predicting the swabbing pressure in field deployments performed lately in Gulf of Mexico and according to its output the suitable cone is selected {{in order to avoid the}} casing collapse.

40|$|Development of casing {{treatment}} geometries {{which will}} enhance the stable operating envelope of the compressor stage without sacrificing the efficiency is a great challenge for the designers. Bend skewed casing treatment with relatively lower porosities {{in the presence of}} plenum chamber is proven to be capable of improving the stall margin and gain in the compressor stage efficiency compared to other conventional casing treatments. Experimental investigations presented in this paper show very encouraging results with substantial improvement in the stable margin of the compressor stage with increase in the stage efficiency. The three bend skewed casing treatments designed for the experimental evaluations have porosities of 21 %, 33 % and 45 %. The steady and transient performances of these three casing treatment geometries are evaluated at two axial extensions of 20 % and 40 %. Flow survey at the rotor exit shows distinct behaviors of the aerodynamic parameters in the tip region at near stall flow condition. The unsteady velocity measurements are performed with hot wire probe in the tip region ahead of the rotor leading edge to capture the fluctuations in the inlet axial velocity and the results are presented at the stall flow condition. The presence of the casing treatment changes the stalling behavior of the compressor <b>stage.</b> Highest porosity <b>casing</b> treatment results in 40. 62 % improvement in the stall margin with 0. 88 % improvement in the compressor stage efficiency at 20 % axial extension.

40|$|LectureLecture 10 : Main air {{compressors}} used for air separation units (ASU) applications have a suction at ambient conditions and deliver air to a pressure range between 5. 6 ~ 6. 5 bara. Therefore, {{the performances of}} the compressor are greatly affected by the seasonal variation of ambient conditions (winter/summer conditions). Since the compressor must be sized for the maximum volume flow i. e. in the ?summer? conditions, it results that when the seasonal difference is significant (i. e > 15 ?C) <b>casing,</b> <b>stages</b> {{as well as the}} cooler design must be oversized. Therefore, during ?average day? the compressor runs always at off design condition, hence compromising efficiency. One method to mitigate the impact of such large variations of ambient conditions is to have an inlet cooler which can operate to keep the inlet temperature (and therefore volume flow) below a certain limit during summer. In this paper, a study is presented where different types of cooling technologies are applied in inline isotherm (intercooled) compressors. In particular, a ?passive? and ?active? cooling method is described and investigated. The first method does not require additional power (except for pumping the water in the inlet cooler, but the effort is minimal) but the cooling effect is dependent on ambient conditions. Consequently, the inlet air can only be chilled to wet bulb temperature. The second method overcomes the limitation of ?passive? cooling but requires significant power consumption to drive the refrigeration (mechanical or adsorption) chiller. The result is that the ?passive? cooling method is most attractive and is most beneficial since it requires nearly no extra power and results in an optimal compressor design. The calculated benefit is up to 1 % in total compression power compared to a conventional system without inlet cooling. This system has also the advantage of being very flexible since the inlet cooling can be switched on only during summer and left with no influence during other periods of the year...|$|R
