40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis analyzes the political discourse on <b>skilled</b> labour <b>migration</b> in Germany between 2005 and 2009 and investigates how and why <b>skilled</b> labour <b>migration</b> polices are negotiated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular the thesis highlights the significance of underlying policy maker motives within the policy formation process of Germany s 2009 Action Programme on <b>Skilled</b> Labour <b>Migration</b> {{as well as their}} ultimate imprint on the legislation. The critical discourse analysis of parliamentary debate in Germany between 2005 and 2009 in conjunction with interviews with relevant national policy makers, institutional actors, labour market stakeholder, and independent policy advisors reveals that there is a significant discrepancy between policy maker intent in regards to <b>skilled</b> labour <b>migration</b> legislation and the stated intent of the 2009 Action Programme. While the stated aim of the Action Programme is to facilitate and promote <b>skilled</b> labour <b>migration</b> to Germany, the analysis of relevant political debate and the stakeholder interviews reveals that German policy makers are primarily motivated to protect and promote preferential labour market access for domestic workers {{while at the same time}} restricting undesired labour migration to Germany. As a result, the policy measures of the 2009 Action Programme on <b>Skilled</b> Labour <b>Migration</b> have a strong protectionist and restrictionist emphasis. Moreover, the thesis reveals that the complex and multilayered power-negotiations over <b>skilled</b> labour <b>migration</b> legislation between the various policy makers, institutional actors, and labour market stakeholders are largely shaped and framed by domestic political considerations. Notwithstanding the widely acknowledged global competition over skilled workers and the need for German labour market to maintain competitive within the global economy, immigration policy makers in Germany are primarily motivated by factors that are firmly embedded within the national political sphere and that aim to control, limit, and restrict territorial access of foreign workers into the national labour market. This in turn highlights the need for migration scholars to reposition and re-conceptualize the role of the nation-state and as an active agent in shaping international labour migration flows...|$|R

2500|$|According to the Commonwealth Treasury, {{immigration}} {{can reduce}} {{the average age of}} the Australian population: [...] "The level of net overseas migration is important: net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population. Currently, around 85 per cent of migrants are aged under 40 when they migrate to Australia, compared to around 55 per cent for the resident population." [...] Ross Gittins, an economics columnist at Fairfax Media, has said that the Government's focus on <b>skilled</b> <b>migration</b> has in fact reduced the average age of migrants. [...] "More than half are aged 15 to 34, compared with 28 per cent of our population. Only 2 per cent of permanent immigrants are 65 or older, compared with 13 per cent of our population."

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} {{a fundamental change in}} the character of much international <b>migration.</b> <b>Skilled</b> migrants have become a major component of most population flows and a majority in some cases. New forms of international labour migration and new historical and geographical contexts of international skill transfer, therefore require new frameworks for analysis. The main thrust of this research is to apply, extend and adapt a `migration channels' framework within the specific geographical context of Scotland's <b>skilled</b> international <b>migration</b> system. The concept of migration channels is founded on the observation that fewer and fewer international migrants themselves directly obtain jobs, work permits or residence visas. Increasingly, international skill transfers are regulated and manipulated by intermediary agencies. Identification and analysis of migration channels is therefore important since they {{play a key role in}} explaining firstly, which persons from the large pool of potential migrants are selected for migration, and, secondly, how a highly <b>skilled</b> international <b>migration</b> system is controlled and directed. A main aim of this research is to identify and understand the international migration processes operating in the Scottish context of <b>skilled</b> international <b>migration.</b> These processes are examined in relation to the differential selectivity and `control' each represents, with regard to the characteristics of the migrants involved with them, and the characteristics of their migration history.

40|$|Migration {{policy in}} Australia has always {{emphasized}} the permanent settlement of skilled migrants. It {{is only in}} the last ten years, since the introduction of the temporary business entry (long-stay) 457 visa in 1996, that <b>skilled</b> temporary <b>migration</b> has become an increasingly important element of international migration to Australia. This paper examines the Asia-Pacific region as a source of <b>skilled</b> temporary <b>migration</b> to Australia. This is based on an examination of trend statistics on visa grants and temporary residents by country of origin published by the Department of Immigration. Following this overview, the paper compares skilled temporary migrants from Asia-Pacific countries with those from non-Asia-Pacific countries to investigate whether the Asia-Pacific migrants are selective of particular demographic or human capital characteristics. This analysis is based on data from a survey of 457 visa holders that was conducted by the authors in 2004. The paper also compares the reasons for migration, employment situation and return migration/permanent residence intentions of migrants from Asia-Pacific countries with those of migrants from non-Asia-Pacific countries. The paper concludes with a discussion of the human resource and policy implications of the findings from these analyses for the Asia-Pacific sending countries and for Australia.

40|$|This is an {{additional}} contribution to the large body of literature developed {{in the area of}} economics of <b>skilled</b> labor <b>migration.</b> It focuses on two major objectives that are the determinants of the migration and its likely impacts on developing economies. Within the framework of the new economics of <b>skilled</b> labor <b>migration,</b> this research has attempted to test empirically the relevance of some components of the most recent new economic models of <b>skilled</b> labor <b>migration.</b> Using available data from international organizations (World Bank, OECD, UNESCO…) and others, in both regressions analyzes and economic simulations, hypotheses have been tested and directions of empirical results identified for larger policy discussions. The theoretical models that have been given priority in these empirical investigations are mainly those of Beine & al, Stark (2005) & al, N. Duc Thanh (2004) and M. Schiff (2005). A major focus has been placed on the models suggested by Duc Thanh (2004) where useful specifications of the functional forms were made. This selected framework uses the similarities that have been observed between this model and that of Stark and Schiff. The empirical results that have been obtained confirm the role of relative wages, the availability of better opportunities such as jobs, the importance of the living conditions as well as the existence of more attractive working conditions in destination countries relative to source economies. Concerning the estimation of the impacts of <b>skilled</b> labor <b>migrations</b> for both developed and developing economies, the specifications have followed Beine, Stark and Duc Thanh models with special emphasis placed on this latter. Given the dynamic nature of Beine’s model and with the limits on the available time series, significant empirical results are obtained and tests of Beine’s propositions achieved. The regressions results using the subcomponent of the knowledge economic index have shown significantly the effects of both domestic education and the attractiveness of foreign relative wages as major determinants that support the explanation of the level of knowledge added by the tertiary sector in each economy. In the sense of these estimations, it appears clearly that any economy is under two major opposite effects. On one hand, there is the relative share of investment in education that affects positively the human capital formation in any country but with higher impact in developing economies. On the other hand, there is the magnitude of the relative wages that negatively affect the performance of developing economies as measured by the subcomponent of the knowledge economic index. These results have been first confirmed through regression analysis. These preliminary findings suggest that local, national, regional and international economic policies consider the new theoretical and empirical trends shown so far by these results. ...|$|R
