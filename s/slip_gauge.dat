40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented {{of a low}} cost approach to the measurement of two and three dimensional objects using a flatbed scanner and image analysis software. Conventional measurement using relatively low cost instruments such as micrometers and vernier callipers can be time consuming and requires operator skills which result in higher overall costs. The increasing resolution and decreasing prices of flatbed scanners introduces the possibility of their use as a low cost alternative to traditional manual measuring. To investigate this, a simple dimensional measurement technique was developed using an unmodified, then a modified, flatbed scanner, a standard PC, and software. A dimensional accuracy of ± 0. 05 mm was achieved with a modified flatbed scanner system for <b>slip</b> <b>gauge</b> samples of nominal thickness 10 mm and 5 mm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} surface roughness (smooth and rough) and surface condition (ponded and optimum wet) on the bending capacity of precast prestressed hollow core slabs with in-situ concrete toppings {{by a series of}} full-scale experimental tests. Interface slip was also measured throughout the test to observe the composite behaviour of the test specimens. The tests result show that the ultimate bending capacity for the ponded condition for the smooth and rough surfaces was 3 to 5 % less than that of the optimum wet even though they were still higher than the calculated values. A slip of 0. 08 mm was observed for the smooth-ponded specimen. It was later found that by roughening the top surface of the precast prestressed hollow core slab, full composite action can be achieved if the interface slip is reduced or eliminated. A theoretical method to predict the deflection with partial interaction is also presented in this paper based on the experimental strain gradient. From the theoretical approach, the findings suggest that an interface slip still may had occurred near the mid-span region although it was not detected by the <b>slip</b> <b>gauge</b> located {{at both ends of the}} specime...|$|E

5000|$|Gauge blocks (also {{known as}} gage blocks, Johansson <b>gauges,</b> <b>slip</b> <b>gauges,</b> or Jo blocks) are {{a system for}} {{producing}} precision lengths. The individual gauge block is a metal or ceramic block that has been precision ground and lapped to a specific thickness. Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks {{with a range of}} standard lengths. In use, the blocks are stacked to make up a desired length.|$|R
40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} signal {{has been}} generated in air, using a capacitive transducer {{to produce a}} broad bandwidth transient signal. This was then focused using an off-axis parabolic mirror {{onto the surface of}} solid materials. The reflected signal was detected in terms of received amplitude and time of arrival, and images formed of the surface profile by scanning the focal region over metallic surfaces. Measurements of small steps formed from <b>slip</b> <b>gauges</b> have shown that 5 mum vertical features can be detected. The field of the transducer assembly has been measured with a miniature detector, and the width of the focal region studied. Scans of the surfaces of coins are used to illustrate the technique for non-contact surface profiling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Hilger & Watts gauge-block {{interferometer}} {{was designed}} and manufactured commercially in the 1950 s. The instrument uses isotope lamps as wavelength standards to perform absolute length calibration of <b>gauge</b> blocks (<b>slip</b> <b>gauges)</b> up to 100 mm in length, to an accuracy of approximately 1 ppm. It is entirely manually operated. In {{order to make the}} instrument more suitable for the modern laboratory, new hardware has been added, and a customized software package developed to automate the measurement process. This paper shows how interferograms may be imaged successfully at each of the eight available wavelengths, and the critical fringe fraction measurement automated, ensuring an accuracy better than ± 0. 05 fringe. To demonstrate the validity of the new system, representative data are presented alongside data obtained using the traditional method and from an external accredited laboratory...|$|R
40|$|October, 1966 was the {{starting}} date of "Quality and Reliability Year" for British Industry. The author believes that, after the design stage, the greatest contribution to quality and reliability lies {{in being able}} to maintain close dimensional control during the manufacturing process. This investigation was carried out with the intention of providing the engineering industries in the Teesside area with a realistic picture of the accuracy of engineering measurements carried out in the workshops and inspection departments of the respective individual firms. The results follow the general pattern set by two similar investigations carried out by the National Physical Laboratory, (N. P. L.), some years ago, but indicate a wider spread of individual errors about the mean size, and correspondingly larger standard deviation. It also indicates that very few firms in the area possess much more sophisticated equipment than micrometers, dial <b>gauges,</b> and <b>slip</b> <b>gauges,</b> and even these are, in the main, neglected and badly maintained. Optical instruments are almost non-existent. The operatives estimation of their accuracy of measurement varies from the N. P. L. findings in that a number are more optimistic, but in general there is a wider and more uniform spread of opinion. The firm's assessments of their employees' capabilities also tend to be optimistic, and in some cases suggest that they do not possess a great deal of knowledge about the ability of their workmen. Another disturbing aspect is the comparison between standard deviation and the tolerances laid down in B. S. 1916, "Limits and Fits for Engineering". This shows that either the tolerances specified by the British Standard are unrealistic, or that industry in this area has difficulty in working to tolerances closer than I. T. 7. The investigation has shown that working conditions, and the training of operatives in principles of metrology, leave much to be desired, although the latter point appears to be being remedied since the investigation took place...|$|R
40|$|Equipment leak {{standards}} {{are designed to}} control emissions of VOCs and VHAPs from regulated equipment {{through the application of}} work practices and equipment practices. The work practice most commonly applied to control equipment leaks is the LDAR program, which is discussed in detail in Section 2. 2. 4. 2. Subsequent chapters address the monitoring, recordkeeping. and reporting requirements of implementing a LDAR program under NSPS or NESHAP standards. In this chapter, regulated equipment is reviewed to illustrate how monitoring programs are applied to specific pieces of equipment action, and special canned-motor and diaphragm pumps (US. �PA, 1990). Chemicals transferred by pumps can leak at the point of contact between the moving shaft and stationary casing. To isolate the pump's interior from the atmosphere. all pumps, except the seal-less type (canned-motor and diaphragm), require a seal {{at the point where the}} shaft penetrates the housing. The most commonly used seals in these pumps are packed and mechanical (US. EPA. 1980 a). Equipment practices include the use of specific types of components, equipment design standards or specifications, and operational standards for certain types of equipment. Equipment practices are evaluated using performance standards that provide a basis for monitoring or substantiating the effectiveness of such control practices. Equipment practices, briefty summarized in Section 2. 2. 4. 3, are addressed in greater detail in this chapter. A general set of equipment is covered by all of the equipment leak standards. Some equipment is covered only by specific standards. For example, product accumulator vessels are covered only by the equipment leak standards for benzene. Also, the vinyl chloride fugitive emission standards cover additional sources (loading and unloading lines, agitators, <b>slip</b> <b>gauges,</b> opening of equipment. and inprocess wastewater). Except for agitaton, however, the emissions from these sources generally are not considered "equipment leaks. " The equipment leak standards also identify requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices that may be used to comply with the regulations...|$|R
40|$|In {{classical}} gravity {{deviations from}} the predictions of the Einstein theory are often discussed {{within the framework of}} the conformal Newtonian gauge, where scalar perturbations are described by two potentials φ and ψ. In this paper we use the above gauge to explore possible cosmological consequences of a running Newton’s constant G(✷), as suggested by the nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point scenario arising from the quantum field-theoretic treatment of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant term. Here we focus on the effects of a scale-dependent coupling on the so-called gravitational slip functions η = ψ/φ − 1, whose classical general relativity value is zero. Starting from a set of manifestly covariant but nonlocal effective field equations derived earlier, we compute the leading corrections in the potentials φ and ψ for a nonrelativistic, pressureless fluid. After providing an estimate for the quantity η, we then focus on a comparison with results obtained in a previous paper on matter density perturbations in the synchronous gauge, which gave an estimate for the growth index parameter γ, also in the presence of a running G. Our results indicate that, in the present framework and for a given G(✷), the corrections tend to be significantly larger in magnitude for the perturbation growth exponents than for the conformal Newtonian <b>gauge</b> <b>slip</b> function...|$|R
40|$|The Seminar {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a modern undergraduate and graduate curriculum in Manufacturing Engineering. The Seminar encompasses the following major items: 1. Preparatory work 2. Curriculum work 3. Suitably-equipped laboratories to support curriculum 4. Implementation 	 1. Preparatory work: At the onset of the development activity, a significant amount of preparatory leg work needs to be performed before moving into the implementation stages. This is characterized as a discovery phase the purpose of which is to determine, qualitatively and quantitatively, the inputs necessary to determine the curriculum configuration. 	 2. Curriculum work: Course materials and under-graduate and graduate student exchange The curriculum is envisioned to include complete course work. Also proposed is a mechanism by which the mobility of undergraduate students to foreign universities is facilitated and supported. 3 Suitable experiments and laboratories: Once the curriculum has been agreed upon, the details of the supporting laboratory component of this curriculum should be developed: • Agree on the complimentary experiments to be offered • Develop outlines and suggested outcomes of these labs • Identify the necessary equipment to populate these labs • Determine suitable vendors of these equipment and place bids • Install, train, and prepare lab instructions for equipment • Develop lab component instructions: manuals, lab sessions, experiments, etc. 		 4.
