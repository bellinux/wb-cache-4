50|$|Originally {{the line}} used GER Class G15/LNER Class Y6 0-4-0T tram engines, which in {{accordance}} with Board of Trade regulations had <b>sideplates</b> and cowcatchers. These were replaced by more powerful 0-6-0T GER Class C53/LNER Class J70 and later by Drewry 0-6-0DM (Class 04) shunters. One coach survives.|$|R
50|$|The {{final version}} of these top-break {{double-action}} 38's was the Perfected Model. This version used a top break with a <b>sideplate</b> thumb latch and was made from 1909 until 1920 {{for a total of}} 59,400 revolvers. This model was used by Floyd Allen in a courthouse escape attempt in 1913.|$|R
50|$|Toby {{is based}} on a J70 tram engine from the Great Eastern Railway (GER Class C53). His cowcatchers and <b>sideplates</b> allow him to run on {{roadside}} tramways, which other engines are not allowed to do for safety reasons.

Modified M1919A4s had the designation [...] "Machine Gun, 7.62mm / Mk 21 Mod 0" [...] stamped on the receiver <b>sideplate</b> in 1/4-inch lettering. The replacement barrels had [...] "7.62mm NATO-G" [...] stamped {{on them in}} 1/8-inch letters to differentiate them from M1919A4 or M60 barrels; the letter G indicated it used a grooved barrel bushing.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of two different}} steel beam to column connec-tions known as SidePlateTM and a new proposed connection by seismic loading and progressive collapse were investigated in this research. Seismic performance evaluated included consideration of interstory drift angles and flexural strengths based on 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions while investigation of progressive collapse was conducted through satisfaction of acceptance criteria by rotational capacities of the connections provided in UFC 4 - 023 - 03 guideline. The results indicated that both <b>SidePlate</b> and the new proposed moment connection were capable of achieving adequate rotational capacity and developing full inelastic capacity of the connecting beam. Also, an excellent performance was exhibited by the con-nections in terms of keeping the plastic hinges away from the connection and exceeding interstory drift angle of 0. 06 rad with-out fracture developments in beam flange groove-welded joints. Based on results, {{it was concluded that}} the <b>SidePlate</b> and the new proposed connection possess sufficient stiffness, strength and ductility to be classified as rigid, full-strength and ductile connections...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{distribution}} {{data are}} provided for a supersonic rectangular inlet at subsonic speeds. Variations in cowl and ramp geometry as well as <b>sideplate</b> sweep were investigated. Tests {{were made in the}} Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel and the Langley high speed 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel for Mach numbers of 0. 6, 0. 7, and 0. 8. Angles of attack investigated were 0 deg, 4 deg, and 8 deg for a range of mass flow ratios...|$|R
50|$|Several {{modifications}} to the original design, such as an improved extractor and bolt; a screw to retain the <b>sideplate</b> instead of a spring-loaded catch; and a new grip design extending {{the full length of}} the backstrap to the frame were made. The original grips were made of Trolit, a checkered plastic material similar to Bakelite. It was, however, prone to chipping and warping, and the majority of new 1910/21 models was fitted with checkered wooden grips.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} method {{originally developed}} for three-dimensional supersonic inlet flow calculations is extended {{and applied to}} the study of two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows associated with arbitrary propulsion systems. The method is based on the forward spatial marching solution of a reduced form of the three-dimensional steady Navier-Stokes equations in which streamwise pressure gradients are retained in both the subsonic and supersonic regions. The present paper briefly describes the analysis and then shows three applications. In the first application, a wall transpiration study has been performed for the two-dimensional shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction flow field with application to an inlet configuration. The second application treats a rectangular high speed inlet with a swept <b>sideplate</b> including the effects of <b>sideplate</b> spillage. Finally, the method is utilized to analyze the interaction of an under-expanded supersonic jet with an ambient flow. Computed results are examined and compared with available experimental measurements. It is demonstrated that the present numerical method is capable of numerically simulating complex two- and three-dimensional flows relevant to hypersonic propulsion systems in a manner which both shows good agreement with data when such data is available, and which shows the complex flow features in the absence of data...|$|R
40|$|Static {{pressure}} distributions {{and dark}} central ground interferometry {{are used to}} document the flow on a flap over a range of Reynolds numbers and deflection angles. The pressure profiles and interferograms are analyzed to distinguish laminar, transitional and turbulent flows in attached, incipient and separated cases. <b>Sideplates</b> are used to compare two and three dimensional effects. Data is also presented for extended flaps used to isolate {{the effect of the}} trailing edge expansion. The issues of unsteadiness and hysteresis are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{disastrous}} {{consequences of}} the partial collapse of the Ronan Point apartment in 1968 and Northridge earthquake in 1994, exposed the vulnerability of steel moment frames subjected to extreme loading. The reports of these two catastrophic events revealed the significant role of beam to column connection where the damage was mainly formed in this area. In this research, the performance of three different steel beam to column connections known as <b>SidePlate,</b> reduced beam section (RBS) and a new proposed “saddlebag” connection subjected to cyclic and progressive collapse experimentally and numerically were investigated. The main objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the adequacy of the new proposed connection to resist extreme loading compared to <b>SidePlate</b> and RBS. Seismic performance evaluation was focused on the interstory drift angles based on 2010 AISC seismic provisions. In the other hand, investigation of progressive collapse was associated with satisfaction of acceptance criteria by rotational capacities of the connections provided in UFC 4 - 023 - 03 guideline. The results indicated that the new proposed connection was capable of achieving adequate rotational capacity of 0. 2 radians, two times bigger than acceptance criteria, and developing full inelastic capacity of the connecting beams during the progressive collapse analysis. In addition, an excellent cyclic performance was demonstrated by the proposed connection as plastic hinges only appeared in the connected beams at the interstory drift angle of 0. 06 radians, 1. 5 times bigger than acceptance criteria. The seismic assessment also revealed that the proposed saddlebag connection possess adequate energy dissipation capacity attained by stable hysteretic behaviour into the inelastic range. The study also concluded that <b>SidePlate</b> provide adequate performance as it develop 0. 2 radians of plastic hinge rotation angle and 0. 06 radians of interstory drift angle to resist progressive collapse and cyclic loading respectively. However, RBS connection showed vulnerable performance to resist seismic and progressive collapse loading where tensile stress mainly appear at the groove welding...|$|R
40|$|Gold-plated {{stainless-steel}} <b>sideplates,</b> {{part of a}} JPL Galileo spacecraft electronic-relay assembly, exhibited blistering after {{resistance spot}} welding. Unacceptable relays had heavy nonuniform gold electrodeposited layers with thicknesses 4. 5 - 11. 5 microns. SEM and metallographic investigations indicated much higher heat input generated during the resistance spot welding in unacceptable relays. The attributes of acceptable welded relays are contrasted with unacceptable relays; the possible mechanism of laminar formation of polymeric material in the gold plating is discussed; and some recommendations are provided to prevent similar problems...|$|R

5000|$|Mavis is an 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical {{shunting}} engine. She {{belongs to}} the Ffarquhar Quarry Co. rather than the Fat Controller, and works mainly shunting stone trucks in their quarry. [...] She sometimes brings Toby's trucks down the line when he is busy. She is painted black, with yellow-and-black [...] "hazard" [...] stripes on her radiator and cab back. Mavis {{is based on a}} BR Class 04, some of which were fitted with the <b>sideplates</b> and cow-catcher for use on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway, the same line that Toby came from. She was built and arrived on Sodor in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1980, {{after three}} years of {{development}} the Dan Wesson company introduced a large-framed revolver in [...]44 Magnum/Special caliber, intended for hunters and target shooters (especially metal plate or silhouette target competitions). Designed for extended use with full-power magnum loads, the new Model 44 used a larger and stronger frame than the Smith & Wesson Model 29 (M44 weight was 48 ounces with a 4-inch barrel), and featured a solid frame without a separate <b>sideplate,</b> which also increased strength. [...] In addition to the one-piece frame, the Model 44 incorporated other new features designed to increase accuracy, such as broached rifling and choke-bored barrels.|$|R
50|$|Chain wear, {{often called}} chain stretch, becomes {{an issue with}} {{extensive}} cycling. The wear is removal of material from the bushings and pins (or half-bushings, in the Sedis design) rather than elongation of the <b>sideplates.</b> The tension created by pedaling is insufficient to cause the latter. Because the spacing from link to link on a worn chain is longer than the 1/2 in specification, those links will not precisely fit the spaces between teeth on the sprockets, resulting in increased wear on the sprockets and possibly chain skip on derailleur drivetrains, in which pedaling tension causes the chain to slide up {{over the tops of}} the sprocket teeth and skip to the next alignment, that reduces power transfer and makes pedaling uncomfortable.|$|R

The Fat Controller, urgently needing to rectify this, is discussing the fitting of these, when Thomas remarks that [...] "everyone will laugh...they'll say I look like a tram". The Fat Controller (the [...] "stout gentleman") remembered Toby immediately and arranged for him to come to Sodor. Toby arrives with his coach, Henrietta, and became a friend of Thomas after Toby rings his bell and frightens the policeman.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or Sliding Screw Fixation {{is a type}} of {{orthopaedic}} implant designed for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a lag screw (inserted into the neck of the femur), a <b>sideplate</b> and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|R

50|$|As {{built the}} {{locomotives}} were originally numbered in the 300-series as F310-319, following {{on from the}} last of the S class diesel locomotives, S309, which entered service in February 1958, seven years after the arrival of the first F class locomotives. However, VR then placed a second order for another eight S class locomotives for use on the new North East standard gauge line which were delivered starting in November 1960. In order to vacate the 300-series numbers for the new mainline diesels, all F class locomotives were renumbered into the 200-series on in late May 1958 as F201-211. Unlike their British and Dutch counterparts, the F class locomotives were also later fitted with <b>sideplates</b> covering the side rods and wheel cranks. This modification was made to prevent staff from getting tangled up in the rods and cranks.|$|R
