25|$|An ongoing {{problem for}} creationists is the {{presence}} of impact craters on nearly all Solar System objects, which is consistent with scientific explanations of solar system origins but creates insuperable problems for young Earth claims. Creationists Harold <b>Slusher</b> and Richard Mandock, along with Glenn Morton (who later repudiated this claim) asserted that impact craters on the Moon are subject to rock flow, and so cannot be more than a few thousand years old. While some creationist astronomers assert that different phases of meteoritic bombardment of the Solar System occurred during creation week and during the subsequent Great Flood, others regard this as unsupported by the evidence and call for further research.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, Frazil <b>slush</b> {{variation}} {{mechanism and}} {{a method of}} frazil <b>slush</b> variation estimation on ice-covered river are studied. This study did develop a frazil <b>slush</b> generation, transport and accumulation calculation model. The continuous input values of this model are air temperature, wind velocity, sunshine duration, snowfall depth and water level. We carried out field observation of frazil <b>slush</b> accumulation using the ADCP and the SWIP. It was shown that the calculation model built by this study can reproduce the frazil <b>slush</b> variation of the real river. The increase of frazil <b>slush</b> transport, the increase of frazil <b>slush</b> generation and the upstream frazil <b>slush</b> accumulation volume are important values when considering frazil <b>slush</b> blockage of water intakes...|$|R

2500|$|With {{the coming}} of American {{settlers}} following the Mexican-American War, a small settlement called [...] "The Corners" [...] emerged, named {{because it was the}} place where roads from Pacheco and Lafayette met.

The first town settler was William <b>Slusher,</b> who built a dwelling on the bank of Walnut Creek, which was called [...] "Nuts Creek" [...] by the Americans in 1849. In the year 1855, Milo Hough of Lafayette built the hotel named [...] "Walnut Creek House" [...] in the corners. A blacksmith shop and a store soon joined the hotel, and a year later, Hiram Penniman (who built Shadelands Ranch) laid out the town site and realigned the Main Street of today. Two decades later, the community changed its name from The Corners to Walnut Creek.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Nike (whose {{presence}} {{competed with}} official sponsor Reebok) {{set up a}} prominent pop-up store near the athletes' village, selling merchandise with slogans parodying those of the Olympics and attacking its values. Response to the campaign was negative and backfired, as [...] "athletes were very proud {{to be at the}} Olympics and likely to be uncomfortable when their shoe sponsor says they have failed unless they win a gold medal". Whilst discussing Nike's ambush campaign, IOC and USOC marketing directors Michael Payne and John Krimsky got into a verbal dispute with Howard <b>Slusher,</b> a subordinate of Nike co-founder Phil Knight. After the IOC threatened to have athletes denounce the company, pull accreditation for its employees, and ban the display of its logos on equipment, Nike agreed to retract most of its negative material. Nike eventually served as the official sportswear supplier of the 2000 Summer Olympics on short notice after Reebok unexpectedly pulled out.|$|E
2500|$|Creationism is {{rejected}} by nearly all scientists, {{with more than}} 45 science organizations having criticized creationism as not science. Professor Massimo Pigliucci, a professor of ecology and evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, has criticized ICR for professing to present the same science as that taught in secular universities {{while at the same}} time requiring students and faculty to sign a statement of faith to ICR's fundamentalist religious mission, most notably in affirming conformity in all its work to Biblical doctrine. Pigliucci notes that any research conducted within the ICR's policy framework is prescribed at the outset by Biblical literalism, and thus antithetical to the methods and framework used by scientists. As examples, Pigliucci cites ICR scientist Harold <b>Slusher</b> resorting to non-Euclidean and non-Einsteinian explanations of light travel to reconcile the vast distances light travels in space with the brief timescale given in young earth creationism, and the association adopted by the ICR between the second principle of thermodynamics and the Bible's account of the fall of Adam. Pigliucci further claimed that [...] "some of the historical claims found in the ICR museum are also stunning and show how easily ideology gets the better of accuracy." ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{perspective}} of mass savings related to future launchers, the use of <b>slush</b> hydrogen as propellant is attractive. Due to its higher density, the use of <b>slush</b> hydrogen {{could lead to the}} mass reduction of propellant and the utilisation of smaller tanks. However, the use of <b>slush</b> hydrogen in rocket engines presents different challenges. The first one is the production of <b>slush</b> hydrogen. Other aspects are the problems induced by the use of <b>slush</b> in a propulsion system: <b>slush</b> flow in pipes and singularities, design of a compatible turbopump and injection of <b>slush</b> in a combustion chamber. In order to prepare numerical tools for supporting future technical activities, ISA has undertaken a large effort {{in the direction of the}} modelling of <b>slush</b> hydrogen flows. The work has been split in two parts: the engineering modelling for <b>slush</b> flows in pipe lines and the preparation of more advanced models. At first, an extensive review of the available studies on this topic reported in the literature has been undertaken. Then, an engineering model has been selected and incorporated in a numerical tool. The different issues in term of modelling related to <b>slush</b> hydrogen have been identified and a potential model for future computational fluid dynamics calculations has been selected...|$|R

50|$|<b>Slush,</b> {{also called}} <b>slush</b> ice, is a slurry mixture of small ice {{crystals}} (e.g., snow) and liquid water. In the natural environment, <b>slush</b> forms when ice or snow melts. This often mixes with dirt and other materials, {{resulting in a}} gray or muddy brown color. Often, solid ice or snow will block the drainage of fluid water from slushy areas, so <b>slush</b> often goes through multiple freeze/thaw cycles before completely disappearing. In areas where road salt is used to clear roadways, <b>slush</b> forms at lower temperatures than it would ordinarily, and only in salted areas; this can produce {{a number of different}} consistencies over the same geographical area.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the frazil <b>slush</b> {{generation}} mechanism on ice-covered rivers. This study developed a frazil <b>slush</b> generation calculation model which targeted skim ice, frazil ice, snow fall and anchor ice.

We carried out field observations at a location where frazil <b>slush</b> floats on the water surface, recording data with a camera. It was shown that the calculation model generated by this study can reproduce the frazil <b>slush</b> generation of the real river.
