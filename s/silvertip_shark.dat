40|$|Understanding how sharks use {{coral reefs}} is {{essential}} for assessing risk of exposure to fisheries, habitat loss, and climate change. Despite a wide Indo-Pacific distribution, {{little is known about}} the spatial ecology of <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), compromising the ability to effectively manage their populations. We examined the residency and movements of <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 VR 2 W acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Twenty-seven individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored from 70 to 731 d. Residency index to the study site ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 97, with a mean residency (+/- SD) of 0. 57 +/- 0. 26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (> 71 %) moved regularly between reefs. <b>Silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> on coral reefs. <b>Silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the GBR than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches...|$|R
5|$|The <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> {{is caught}} by {{commercial}} and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are {{sold on the}} export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks {{are known to be}} taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of pelagic fisheries, where it is often finned at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area. It {{is believed to have been}} extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in many other parts of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark.</b> At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark.</b> Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are quite}} mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks,</b> using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|R

5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> {{consists}} {{primarily of}} bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> {{is widely}} but not {{continuously}} {{distributed in the}} tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the western Indian Ocean, this species occurs from the Red Sea to South Africa, including Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Aldabra Group, Mauritius, and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific, it is known from off southern Japan to northern Australia, including Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Guam, Palau, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Phoenix Islands, and Tahiti. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from southern Baja California to Colombia, including the Cocos, Galapagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. Its presence in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea is unconfirmed.|$|E

The maximum reported weight is 162.2 kg. Females are larger than males.|$|R
500|$|Blacktip sharks have a timid {{disposition}} {{and consistently}} lose out to Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> (C. albimarginatus) of equal size when competing for food. If threatened or challenged, they may perform an agonistic display: the shark swims towards the threat {{and then turns}} away, while rolling from side to side, lowering its pectoral fins, tilting its head and tail upwards, and making sideways biting motions. The entire sequence lasts around 25 seconds. This behavior {{is similar to the}} actions of a shark attempting to move a sharksucker; [...] one of these behaviors possibly is derived from the other.|$|R
5|$|The <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> is {{a robust}} and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. There are 12–14 tooth rows {{on each side}} of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. There is a ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.|$|E

500|$|The <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> was {{originally}} described as Carcharias albimarginatus by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea). The name was later changed to the currently valid Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Latin albi meaning [...] "white", and marginatus meaning [...] "to enclose with a border", in reference to the distinct white fin margins. In 1960, a -long immature male caught off Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea was designated as the type specimen. Based on similarities in morphology, tooth shape, and vertebral characters, Garrick (1982) proposed the grey reef shark as the closest relative of the <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark.</b> This interpretation was corroborated by Lavery (1992), based on allozyme data.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the grey}} reef <b>shark,</b> <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> {{sometimes}} perform a stereotypical threat display if pursued by divers, warning {{that it is}} prepared to attack. The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of , before turning and charging towards the perceived threat. At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and [...] "shivers". The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the [...] "shivering" [...] may serve to emphasize its white fin markings. If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.|$|R
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|R

Muscular and hepatic Hg concentrations increased with increased body length. However, these increases were more prominent in the liver than in the muscle samples, and appeared to occur after maturation. Hepatic Zn and Cu concentrations decreased during the growth stage, and then increased concomitantly thereafter with increases in Cd burden. Hepatic Fe concentration from males increased proportionally with increases in body length, whereas no increase was observed in samples from females, probably due to the mother-to-embryo transfer of Fe. The δ 13 C values tended to decrease with increases in body length, whereas no decrease in the δ 15 N values was observed...|$|R
500|$|Residing off {{continental}} coastlines {{from the}} surf zone {{to the outer}} continental shelf and adjacent oceanic waters, the dusky shark occupies an intermediate habitat that overlaps with its more specialized relatives, such as the inshore sandbar shark, the pelagic silky shark (C. falciformis) and oceanic whitetip shark, the deepwater bignose shark, and the islandic Galapagos shark and <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> (C. albimarginatus).

500|$|Potential predators of {{the silky}} shark include larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod Gnathia trimaculata, the copepod Kroeyerina cortezensis, and the {{tapeworms}} Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus and Phyllobothrium sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), {{and have been}} known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25grey reef sharks (C.amblyrhynchos) and a lone <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> (C.albimarginatus).

500|$|Like other requiem sharks, the <b>silvertip</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous; {{once the}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the {{depleted}} yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother delivers nourishment. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating and parturition both occur in summer. Courtship involves the male biting the female to hold her for copulation; one female observed had {{the tip of her}} first dorsal fin bitten off from such activity. Females bear litters of one to 11 (usually five or six) young after a gestation period of about one year, on a biennial cycle. The newborns have been reported to measure [...] and [...] long by different authors, and are found in shallower water than adults. The growth rate is highly variable in the wild: Kato and Hernandez (1967) reported juvenile silvertip sharks grow an average of , or 5.3% of their body length, per year, with some individuals growing as much as , 30.1% of their body length) per year and others showing negative [...] "growth". Males have been reported to be sexually mature at [...] or [...] long, and females at [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), and {{possibly}} also <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), though they usually occur at depths {{greater than those}} favored by whitetip reef sharks. An [...] long whitetip reef shark has also {{been found in the}} stomach of a giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity. Known parasites of the whitetip reef shark include the copepod Paralebion elongatus and the praniza (parasitic) larvae of the isopod Gnathia grandilaris. While resting during the day, these sharks have been observed being cleaned by the wrasse Bodianus diplotaenia and the goby Elacatinus puncticulatus. Unusually, there is also a report of seven whitetip reef sharks adopting a cleaning posture (mouth agape and gills flared) {{in the midst of a}} swarm of non-cleaning hyperiid amphipods; the mechanical stimulation from the moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms.|$|R
40|$|Although marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are a common}} conservation strategy, these areas are often designed with little prior knowledge of the spatial behaviour of the species {{they are designed to}} protect. Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (∼ 14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of ∼ 250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef...|$|R
40|$|At least {{fourteen}} {{species of}} sharks {{live in the}} Marine Protected Area of Isla del Coco National Park (ICNP), some are resident species such as the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus); others are migratory and visit the National Park throughout the year, e. g. the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). Between March 2010 and August 2012 six expeditions out to the ICNP were carried, during this period 25 night trips (from 18 : 00 to 22 : 00 hr) for shark tagging were conducted in the Wafer and Chatham bays. During those trips, 185 sharks were analyzed: 81. 1 % were whitetip reef sharks (T. obesus), 16. 7 % were blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus), 1. 1 % were blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and 1. 1 % were <b>silvertip</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus albimarginatus). The most common species in Bahía Chatham was T. obesus, while the most common one in Bahía Wafer was C. limbatus, which represented 80. 9 % and 80. 5 % of the total sharks caught, respectively. Regarding T. obesus, a sex ratio of 1. 2 males per female was estimated (X 2 = 0. 09; p= 0. 17); in turn a sex ratio of 1. 01 males per female was observed (X 2 = 0. 04; p= 0. 79) for C. limbatus. The average total length for T. obesus and C. limbatus was 103. 66 ± 13. 91 cm and 76. 58 ± 14. 56 cm respectively; suggesting that black tip sharks use those bays during immature stages. The results show an interspecific spatial segregation {{of the most common}} resident sharks at ICNP, apparently the clear waters and the coral cover of Chatham Bay are preferred by T. obesus; while the turbid waters of the Genio River mouth are preferred by C. limbatusEn el Parque Nacional Isla del Coco (PNIC) habitan al menos catorce especies de tiburones, algunas especies son residentes como el tiburón punta blanca de arrecife (Triaenodon obesus), mientras otras son migratorias.

Entre marzo del 2010 y agosto del 2012 se realizaron seis expediciones al PNIC, durante las cuales se hicieron 25 recorridos nocturnos (entre las 18 : 00 - 22 : 00 hr) para el marcaje de tiburones. Durante los recorridos se analizaron 185 tiburones, de los cuales el 81. 1 % fueron tiburones punta blanca de arrecife (T. obesus), 16. 7 % tiburones punta negra (Carcharhinus limbatus), 1. 1 % tiburones punta negra de arrecife (Carcharhinus melanopterus) y 1. 1 % tiburones punta plateada (Carcharhinus albimarginatus). A su vez más el 80. 9 % y 80. 5 % de los tiburones T. obesus y C. limbatus se capturaron en Bahía Chatham y Bahía Wafer, respectivamente. Las capturas en los recorridos revelan que el 39. 2 % de los organismos se analizaron entre las 19 : 00 y 20 : 00 hr. Los resultados muestran una segregación espacial interespecífica de las especies más comunes en el PNIC.
