5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new fractional currency notes were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had <b>single</b> <b>sided</b> specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E

25|$|Number of DRAM Devices: The {{number of}} chips is a {{multiple}} of 8 for non-ECC modules and {{a multiple of}} 9 for ECC modules. Chips can occupy one side (<b>single</b> <b>sided)</b> or both sides (dual sided) of the module. The maximum number of chips per DDR module is 36 (9×4) for ECC and 32 (8x4) for non-ECC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Single</b> <b>sided</b> disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a <b>single</b> <b>sided</b> disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Suzanne" [...] was {{released}} over 40 {{years after it}} was recorded. The B-side is [...] "Monk Time". The song originated as a [...] "time consumer" [...] instrumental called [...] "Paradox" [...] composed by Eddie Shaw and Dave Day. The Monks' managers took notice and pushed them to take to a harder direction. [...] "Pretty Suzanne" [...] was first recorded in 1965 as a demo. This early 1966 recording was recorded at Tonstudio Pfanz near Hamburg. Martin Christoph of Red Lounge Records discovered a <b>single</b> <b>sided</b> acetate of the 1966 recording in 2007, and it later {{was released}} as a bonus track on the 2009 Light in the Attic reissue of Black Monk Time and as a single released by Red Lounge Records.|$|E
500|$|The DVD {{was shot}} in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 on a <b>single</b> <b>sided,</b> double layered disc, with the image being {{enhanced}} for 16×9 televisions. The black-and-white visuals had mixed a lot of visual styles according to Jacobson, and had grains and erratic focus. The non-concert color sequences followed the same style, but the performance sequences were in high definition. Backgrounds were dark and Jacobson noted that the color black appeared taut and full, while the few low-light bits came across well. The 5.1 surround sound was mostly utilized during the live performance sequences. The live CD consisted of two pre-recorded tracks, [...] "The Beast Within" [...] and [...] "Hollywood". There are 12deleted scenes, spanning a total of 15minutes and 38seconds; scenes include Madonna on a bike, working with vocal coach Joan Leder, affinity for French and comical sequences featuring Price and musician Steve Sidelnyk. The cover was a shot of Madonna from her performance of [...] "Frozen" [...] on the show, and the packaging included a 20-page booklet.|$|E

2500|$|... 1972: <b>Single</b> <b>sided</b> supply op-amps being produced. A <b>single</b> <b>sided</b> supply op-amp is {{one where}} the input and output {{voltages}} can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing {{to be at least}} two volts above it. [...] The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.|$|E

2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a <b>single</b> <b>sided</b> front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|E
