This altitude alert, designed to warn the pilots of an inadvertent deviation from the <b>selected</b> <b>altitude,</b> went unnoticed by the crew.

40|$|Abstract: The optical {{spectrograph}} {{and infrared}} imager system (OSIRIS) {{on board the}} Odin spacecraft is designed to retrieve altitude profiles of terrestrial atmospheric minor species by observing limb-radiance profiles. The grating optical spectrograph (OS) obtains spectra of scattered sunlight over the range 280 – 800 nm with a spectral resolution of approximately 1 nm. The Odin spacecraft performs a repetitive vertical limb scan to sweep the OS 1 km vertical field of view over <b>selected</b> <b>altitude</b> ranges from approximately 10 to 100 km. The terrestrial absorption features that are superimposed on the scattered solar spectrum are monitored to derive the minor species altitude profiles. The spectrograph also detects the airglow, {{which can be used}} to study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The other part of OSIRIS is a three-channel infrared imager (IRI) that uses linear array detectors to image the vertical limb radiance over an altitude range of approximately 100 km. The IRI observes both scattered sunlight and the airglow emissions from the oxygen infrared atmospheric band at 1. 27 µm and the OH (3 - 1) Meinel band at 1. 53 µm. A tomographic inversion technique is used with a series of these vertical images to derive the two-dimensional distribution of the emissions within the orbit plane...|$|E

40|$|An {{engineering}} model (EM) is under development {{that describes the}} propagation of a rocket exhaust plume after the nozzle exit. The aim of this EM is to allow a fast analysis {{of the structure of}} the plume and the exhaust species within the plume. The characteristics of the plume depend highly on the ambient conditions, which vary depending on the altitude. In particular, the ambient pressure plays a significant role. Therefore, the properties of the plume need to be investigated across multiple altitudes. CFD calculations have been performed for a few <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes</b> and several launchers.

50|$|To {{the left}} and right of the {{attitude}} indicator are usually the airspeed and altitude indicators, respectively. The airspeed indicator displays the speed of the aircraft in knots, while the altitude indicator displays the aircraft's altitude above mean sea level (AMSL). These measurements are conducted through the aircraft's pitot system, which tracks air pressure measurements. As in the PFD's attitude indicator, these systems are merely displayed data from the underlying mechanical systems, and do not contain any mechanical parts (unlike an aircraft's airspeed indicator and altimeter). Both of these indicators are usually presented as vertical “tapes”, which scroll up and down as altitude and airspeed change. Both indicators may often have “bugs”, that is, indicators that show various important speeds and altitudes, such as V speeds calculated by a flight management system, do-not-exceed speeds for the current configuration, stall speeds, <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes</b> and airspeeds for the autopilot, and so on.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{calibrations}} of a fixed hemispherical flow angle-of-attack and angle-of-sideslip sensor {{were made}} from Mach numbers of 0. 5 to 1. 8.

The hemispherical flow-direction sensor measured differential pressure at two angle-of-attack ports and two angle-of-sideslip ports in diametrically opposed positions. Stagnation pressure was measured at a center port. The results of these tests showed that the calibration curves for the hemispherical flow-direction sensor were linear for angles of attack up to 13 deg. The overall uncertainty in determining angle of attack from these curves was plus or minus 0. 35 deg or less. A Mach number position error calibration curve was also obtained for the hemispherical flow-direction sensor.

40|$|The {{photochemical}} {{theory of}} {{processes in the}} lower ionosphere is very complicated and up to now it is not completely developed. Therefore introduction of the effective coefficients determining the total speed of several important reactions has been widely adopted when modeling the D-region of the ionosphere. Experimental opportunities for obtaining effective recombination coefficients are rather limited. One of the methods to estimate effective recombination coefficients uses the phenomenon of a solar eclipse. The basis of this method {{is the idea of}} Appleton about similarity of the behavior of the linear inductive circuit and variations of the electron concentration in the ionosphere on a fixed height {{in the absence of the}} transport processes, the change in the rate of formation of electrons in time and the disappearance of free electrons due to recombination. By analogy with the time constant of the electric circuit Appleton called the reaction of the ionosphere on the process of ionization in the ionosphere as "sluggishness" with a characteristic time constant τ, which is also called the "relaxation time" or "time constant of the ionosphere". During 11 August 1999, 1 August 2008, 11 June 2011, 20 March 2015 solar eclipses at the partial reflection facility of the observatory "Tumanny" (69. 0 N, 35. 7 E) observations of the amplitudes of reflections of ordinary and extraordinary waves have been carried out. Using the obtained data the two-dimensional (time, height) distribution of the electron density ne at altitudes of the D-region ionosphere has been calculated. This has made it possible to obtain the behavior of the electron concentration in time at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes</b> (temporal profiles of electron density at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes).</b> Using the obtained experimental profiles, the effective recombination coefficients on the heights of the D-region ionosphere have been evaluated. Transport processes of plasma (for example, propagation of acoustic-gravity waves, vertical motion) during eclipses have influenced on the behavior of the temporal profiles of the electron concentration at altitudes of the D-region ionosphere. This has led to the fact that on some heights of the D-region ionosphere determination of effective recombination coefficient became impossibl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aircraft {{designed}} for high-altitude long endurance missions using solar cell power use very low wing loading design and fly at low speeds to minimize power requirements. Hence, the Helios aircraft flight days {{are limited to}} runway wind speeds below 10 knots and wind speeds aloft which are less than its maximum cruise speed (near 20 knots true airspeed at sea level and 50 knots near 50, 000 feet altitude). Its low wing loading combines with structural flexibility to produce noticeable responses to turbulence. As {{a result of an}} in-flight mishap on June 26 th 2003 comparisons of wind conditions that day with previous flight days were accomplished. This paper reviews the details of the low altitude wind profiles measured on June 26 th at Lihue on the south-east coast of Kauai, at the U. S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility on the west coast of Kauai and in-situ winds measured by Helios along its flight track. Winds measured on other flight days are also compared at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Relative findings are discussed with respect to wind-induced turbulence in the trade wind wake of Kauai. 1...|$|R

By using horizontal observations at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes,</b> the distributions {{of ice water}} content (IWC), particle habits, and particle size spectrum parameters were investigated. The cloud cases were characterized by high IWC values due {{to the existence of}} embedded convective cells. Liquid water contents were rather low with the maxima of less than 0. 3 [*]g[*]m− 3 and the general values of less than 0. 1 [*]g[*]m− 3. The occurrence of large dendritic crystals as well as rimed capped columns and branched crystals indicated that ice seeding from the above cloud layer (6 [*]km altitude or above) contributed significantly to both high ice crystal number concentrations and IWCs. Horizontal observations at selected levels suggested the general decreasing trend of IWC with decreasing temperature only in part of the cloud layers but not throughout the cold layer of the multilayered stratiform clouds. Both exponential and gamma functions were used to characterize the particle size spectrum parameters. The slope parameter values of exponential distributions were primarily in the range of 103 – 104 [*]m− 1.

Flight profile and engine information from the piloted simulation were coupled with the NASA Langley Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP) to estimate jet engine noise and to propagate the resulting source noise to ground observer stations. A baseline aircraft configuration, which also incorporated different levels of projected improvements in low-speed high-lift aerodynamic performance, was simulated to investigate effects of increased lift and lift-to-drag ratio on takeoff noise levels. Simulated takeoff flights were performed with the pilots following a specified procedure in which either a single thrust cutback was performed at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes</b> ranging from 400 to 2000 ft, or a multiple-cutback procedure was performed where thrust was reduced by a two-step process.

40|$|Swifts, Apus apus, {{spend the}} night aloft and this offers an {{opportunity}} to test the degree of adaptability of bird orientation and flight to different ecological situations. We predicted the swifts' behaviour by assuming that they are adapted to minimize energy expenditure during the nocturnal flight and during a compensatory homing flight if they become displaced by wind. We tested the predictions by recording the swifts' altitudes, speeds and directions under different wind conditions with tracking radar; we found an agreement between predictions and observations for orientation behaviour, but not for altitude and speed regulation. The swifts orientated consistently into the head wind, with angular concentration increasing with increasing wind speed. However, contrary to our predictions, they did not <b>select</b> <b>altitudes</b> with slow or moderate winds, nor did they increase their airspeed distinctly when flying into strong head winds. A {{possible explanation is that}} their head-wind orientation is sufficient to keep nocturnal displacement from their home area within tolerable limits, leaving flight altitude to be determined by other factors (correlated with temperature), and airspeed to show only a marginal increase in strong winds. The swifts were often moving "backwards", heading straight into the wind but being overpowered by wind speeds exceeding their airspeed. The regular occurrence of such flights is probably uniquely associated with the swifts' remarkable habit of roosting on the wing...|$|R

40|$|A new {{parameterization}} for atmospheric {{transmission and}} O 2 photodissociation in the Schumann-Runge band region {{has been developed}} and tested with a 1 D radiative-photochemical model. The parameterization {{is based on the}} O 2 -column along the line of sight to the Sun and the local temperature. Line-by-line calculations have served as a benchmark for testing this method and several other, commonly used, parameterizations. The comparisons suggest that differences between the line-by-line calculations and currently accepted parameterizations can be reduced significantly by using the new method, particularly at large solar zenith angles. The production rate of O-atoms computed with this method shows less than 6 % deviation compared to the line-by-line calculations at any altitude, all solar zenith angles and in all seasons. The largest errors are found toward the shorter wavelengths in the Schumann-Runge region at low altitudes. Transmittance is approximated to better than 4 % at any altitude and/or solar zenith angle. The total O-production rate above 20 km is approximated to better than 2 %. The new parameterization is easily implemented in existing photochemical models and in many cases it may simply replace the existing algorithm. The computational effort exceeds that of other parameterizations but in view of the total computation time needed for the actual calculation of the parameterized Schumann-Runge bands this should not lead to significant performance degeneration. The first 14 coefficients of the parameterization are included in this study. Both the complete sets of coefficients and a simple algorithm can be obtained by contacting the authors. A photochemical model study shows the largest effect of the parameterization method is on odd hydrogen concentrations. Subsequent interaction with an odd oxygen family causes differences in the ozone concentrations between the different parameterizations of more than 10 % at <b>selected</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Although it is already established that deficiencies in the treatment of Schumann-Runge band absorption are unlikely to explain the current underestimation of ozone concentration at the stratopause in a variety of photochemical models, this study does show that the choice of parameterization has a large impact on the accuracy of the results at large solar zenith angles and in different seasons...|$|R
