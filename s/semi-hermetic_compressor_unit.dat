40|$|The {{classical}} substances as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) used {{as working}} fluids in the vapour compression plants {{have to be}} replaced by new substances because of their ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is non-toxic, non-flammable, has zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential as refrigerant. Referring to a transcritical CO 2 cycle working as a classical ‘‘splitsystem’’ to cool air in residential applications, the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performances using an internal heat exchanger. The experimental plant employs a <b>semi-hermetic</b> <b>compressor,</b> plate-finned tube type heat exchangers, a back pressure valve electronically controlled and an expansion valve. Besides it is possible to control the flash gas produced in the liquid receiver thanks to another <b>semi-hermetic</b> <b>compressor</b> linked to an inverter. An increase of the coefficient of performance has been found using the internal heat exchanger. The comparison of the coefficients of performance of two cycles, working with and without the internal heat exchanger, is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Typically in hermetic, {{and most}} <b>semi-hermetic</b> <b>compressors</b> (sometimes known as {{accessible}} hermetic compressors), the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the refrigerant system. The motor is hermetic {{and is designed}} to operate, and be cooled by, the refrigerant being compressed. The obvious disadvantage of hermetic motor compressors is that the motor drive cannot be maintained in situ, and the entire compressor must be removed if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt out windings can contaminate whole refrigeration systems requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the refrigerant replaced.|$|R

40|$|A recent {{trend to}} spread the use of CO 2 {{refrigeration}} cycles in warm {{regions of the world}} is to combine a CO 2 cycle with another one using a high performance refrigerant. Two alternatives are being considered: cascade and mechanical subcooling systems. Both respond to a similar configuration of the refrigeration cycle, they being based on the use of two compressors and same number of heat exchangers. However, the compressor, heat exchanger sizes and energy performance differ a lot between them. This work, using experimental relations for CO 2 and R 1234 yf <b>semi-hermetic</b> <b>compressors</b> analyzes in depth both alternatives under the warm climate of Spain. In general, it was concluded that the CO 2 refrigeration solution with mechanical subcooling would cover all the conditions with high overall energy efficiency, thus it being recommended for further extension of the CO 2 refrigeration applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units.</b> Traditionally, {{the operation of}} refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure. Due {{to the lack of}} scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, it is difficult to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.
