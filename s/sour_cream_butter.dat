2500|$|As a garnish to meat {{dishes in}} the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root {{vegetables}} (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and [...] "soaked" [...] (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries.

40|$|An {{increased}} demand during recent years for sweet <b>cream</b> <b>butter</b> emphasizes {{the question as}} to its flavor and keeping qualities as compared with ripened <b>cream</b> <b>butter,</b> and the desirability of manufacturing still more of the sweet cream product. Merchants who are primarily interested in fancy butter are possibly to some extent responsible for creating this {{increased demand}} for sweet <b>cream</b> <b>butter,</b> altho it has been recognized for some years that this product has better keeping qualities than <b>butter</b> churned from <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> and is therefore better suited for cold storing.

5000|$|Lazy varenyky (книдлі, ліниві вареники, ленивые вареники) in Russian and Ukrainian cuisine are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made {{by mixing}} tvoroh (curd cheese) with egg and flour into quick dough.

The dumplings are then quickly boiled in salted water and served with <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> or melted <b>butter.</b> The name [...] "lazy varenyky" [...] {{faithfully}} reflects the very quick preparation time of the dish: It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes from assembling the simple ingredients to serving the cooked dumplings. Lazy varenyky differ from standard varenyky {{in the same way}} that Italian gnocchi differ from ravioli or tortellini: these are fluffy solid dumplings, not stuffed pockets of dough.

40|$|Lactococcus lactis plays a {{critical}} role in food, dairy and health sectors. In food and dairy industries, it is found in production processes of various fermented products such as sausages, pickled vegetables, beverages such as beer and wine, breads, soymilk kefir, <b>sour</b> milk, <b>butter,</b> <b>cream,</b> fresh cheese and different types of cheeses, like Cheddar, Colby, Cottage cheese, Camembert, cream cheese, Roquefort and Brie. Additionally, there is an increasing interest towards the possible health benefits of the probiotic activity of this organism which generally is species and strain specific and depends upon the survival in gastrointestinal tract with sufficient number. Certain strains have the ability to produce antimicrobial peptide called nisin which exhibits preservative potential. Therefore, application of bacteriocinogenic Lactococcus lactis in food and dairy sectors to preserve foods as a natural way and contributing health promoting attributes due to probiotic activity would definitely fulfil today’s consumer demands. This paper aimed to review the adaptation, antibiotic resistance, therapeutic and preservation potential of bacteriocinogenic and probiotic Lactococcus lactis...|$|R
