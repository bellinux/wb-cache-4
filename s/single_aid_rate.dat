40|$|Consequences of EU {{enlargement}} {{for regional}} policy in East Germany EU enlargement {{will change the}} status of regions currently assisted by EU regional policy. A number of regions will probably lose their status as “Objective 1 Region” and will hence have to exist without EU regional policy funding. Furthermore {{it has to be}} assumed that the EU will additionally reduce the maximal permitted regional <b>aid</b> <b>rate</b> for investment in the same regions. Most regions in the East German Länder will be affected by these changes. A “phasing out” of such Objective 1 Regions could ease the adjustment pressures. In anticipating to the probable reduction of the regional <b>aid</b> <b>rate</b> for investment, the development of infrastructure should already today be intensified in order to alleviate locational disadvantages as far as possible. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid in reducing poverty through its impact on human development indicators. We use a dataset of both bilateral aid and NGO aid flows. Our results show that NGO aid reduces infant mortality and does so more effectively than official bilateral aid. The impact on illiteracy is less significant. We also test whether foreign aid reduces government efforts in achieving developmental goals and find mixed evidence of a substitution effect.

40|$|Households who save in {{anticipation}} of their child’s college expenses reduce their child’s eligibility for financial aid. The penalty of reduced financial aid eligibility acts as an implicit tax on household assets. At the same time, the federal algorithm used to compute the financial aid {{does not take into}} consideration the assets accumulated in retirement accounts or as home equity. Households can diminish their marginal financial <b>aid</b> tax <b>rates</b> by moving funds into retirement accounts or by increasing their home equity. Using the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigates the effect of the college financial aid rules on household portfolio choices. Our results show that households who have higher marginal financial <b>aid</b> tax <b>rates</b> have higher retirement assets and home equity compared to their taxable financial assets. However, the marginal financial <b>aid</b> tax <b>rate</b> does not have a significant adverse effect on the amount of taxable financial assets...|$|R

40|$|Binaural {{beamforming}} using {{signals from}} both {{left and right}} hearing aids offers greater potential for noise reduction than using signals from a <b>single</b> <b>aid.</b> However, wireless transmission of data imposes power constraints. Since most modern hearing aids have multiple microphones and are capable of spatial filtering, it is of interest to study the conditions when a binaural system offers significant improvements over a multi-microphone monaural system, and the situations when the noise reduction benefits are only marginal. An intelligent transmission scheme could then be designed such that signals are exchanged between the hearing aids only when the benefits are significant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract � In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{teaching}} and learning of parallel processing through performance analysis using a software tool called Prober. This tool is a functional and performance analyzer of parallel programs that we proposed and developed during an undergraduate research project. Our teaching and learning approach consists of a practical class where students receive explanations about some concepts of parallel processing {{and the use of the}} tool. They do some oriented and simple performance tests on parallel programs and analyze their results using Prober as a <b>single</b> <b>aid</b> tool. Finally, students answer a self-assessment questionnaire about their formation, their knowledge of parallel processing concepts and also about the usability of Prober. Our main goal is to show that students can learn concepts of parallel processing in a clearer, faster and more efficient way using our approach...|$|R
