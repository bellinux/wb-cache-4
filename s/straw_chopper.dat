40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the entire}} {{structure}} and operating {{principles of the}} toss feeding typed stalk baler are introduced. The baler is mainly consisted of collecting, feeding, compression and knotting component. A Y-shaped <b>straw</b> <b>chopper</b> blade {{is used in the}} collecting. A combination component of auger and toss machine is adopted in the feeding system. The sliding block of compressor is driven by rod-crank mechanism. Structure analysis shows that the toss feeding typed straw baling machine has advantages of simple structure, high efficiency and low manufacturing cost. At the same time, the structural analysis provides an important theoretical basis for further optimal design of baling machine...|$|E
40|$|In studies {{concerning}} the use, as an fuel for agricultural tractors, of {{the mixture of}} diesel  with vegetable oil, it must be verified the economic viability regarding its use as renewable fuels and the performance of agricultural machinery in the field. Therefore, it was evaluated the economic viability and performance of an agricultural tractor, fueled with diesel fuel and the diesel mixture with sunflower oil. The assay was conducted at the Universidade Estadual de Maringá Experimental Farm, in Maringá Paraná, Brazil. It was used an MF 275 agricultural tractor, coupled to a horizontal <b>straw</b> <b>chopper.</b> It was used B S 10 diesel (100 %) and a mixture of diesel (80 %) with sunflower oil (20 %). The mechanized set was subjected to three travel speeds (3. 00; 4. 00; 5. 00 km h- 1) into two workload conditions, with load (CC) and without load (SC). It was used the experimental design in strips, with four replications, in a factorial scheme 2 x 3 x 2. The data was submitted to the tests (variance analyses) F and Tukey at the level of 5 % of probability. The engine consumption did not differ between the tested fuels. The tractor with load presented a higher wheel  slip. The tractor fueled with the diesel mixture with sunflower oil had a higher cost per hour...|$|E

40|$|Farmers in Bangladesh {{are very}} {{interested}} to produce more milk products and beef to meet rising consumer demand. Small and medium livestock farmers have between 10 and 30 cows or beef cattle. A major constraint {{to the expansion of}} dairy holdings and beef production in Bangladesh is the scarcity of quality fodder, especially during the dry winter season (Haque et al., 2008). Straw from paddy rice is the main source of fodder for livestock in Bangladesh, but has being abundant and low quality (Haque et al., 2008). Napier grass, fodder maize, para, jambo grass, triticale and lathyrus are all grown as higher quality fresh fodder supplements to rice straw. These fodders are normally fed to cattle in the form of whole fresh or dried stems and leaves, and commonly 15 to 20 per cent of the material is refused and wasted. To reduce wastage, some farmers are trying to chop straw and other fodders by hand for their cattle but this is slow, laborious and costly. To overcome the problem, the Power <b>Straw</b> and Fodder <b>Chopper</b> (PSFC) was developed in 2006 and commercialized. This short paper describes the PSFC, its uses, initial experiences with its promotion and marketing by the Pilot Program on Increasing the Availability of Quality Fodder for Dairy Production in Bangladesh (PPIAQFDP) funded by DANIDA...|$|R
