5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s old {{ammunition}} <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> the D-1 {{were removed from}} the Soviet inventory. The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, {{but it is not clear}} whether that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E
5|$|To prepare {{these forces}} the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) {{increased}} the call-up age range and recruited from Eastern European countries controlled by German forces, increasing manpower on the Western Front from roughly 400,000 {{to just over}} 1 million soldiers. Hastily organized into new divisions, these infantrymen lacked training and sometimes even weapons. Despite an immense German effort {{in the face of}} intense Allied bombing to build the necessary <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> the offensive, there were shortages of fuel, ammunition, weapons and manpower by the scheduled date of the counterattack. Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often deficient in manpower.|$|E
5|$|Bavaro married Susan Downes in 1987. The {{couple have}} three children. His wife {{attended}} Seton Hall Law School for one year, but later transferred to Harvard Law School, where she achieved {{a degree in}} Law, and is currently a teacher of European History at St. John's Preparatory School. After his retirement they lived in Naples, Florida for three years. They currently reside in Boxford, Massachusetts, near Bavaro's hometown of Danvers. After his playing career, Bavaro worked as a sales trader for an equity block-trading firm, where he traded large blocks of <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> institutions and hedge funds. He pursued a career in this field {{at the suggestion of}} his former Giants teammate Phil McConkey, who worked for the same company as Bavaro. In 2007, Bavaro was appointed Vice President of DesignCentrix, a premiere Chicago exhibit house. Bavaro is also an avid golfer who considers the sport his favorite pastime.|$|E

5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> {{the construction of the}} Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> human consumption.|$|E
5|$|WHO first {{recommended}} {{destruction of}} the virus in 1986 and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> specific research purposes. Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed {{to respond to a}} smallpox outbreak. Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests; however, a 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by WHO concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks. The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program.|$|E

25|$|These {{changes are}} one cause for declining fish <b>stocks.</b> <b>For</b> example, the {{northern}} anchovy, Engraulis mordax, was until the 1980s quite {{abundant in the}} Low Salinity Zone, until its range in the estuary became restricted to the Central and South Bays. This is probably due to a behavioral response following {{the introduction of the}} Amur River (Potamocorbula amurensis) clam and the subsequent decline in plankton availability.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to measure the}} marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in initial public offerings (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their <b>stocks</b> <b>for</b> {{a period of three}} years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied {{to the idea of}} human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing <b>stocks,</b> <b>for</b> example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded <b>stocks,</b> <b>for</b> which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.|$|E
25|$|Canada's {{economy is}} {{closely linked to}} that of the United States, and {{economic}} conditions south of the border tend to quickly make their way north. Canada's stock markets were especially hard hit by the collapse in high-tech <b>stocks.</b> <b>For</b> much of the 1990s the rapid rise of the TSX had almost wholly been attributed to two stocks: Nortel and BCE. Both companies were hard hit by the downturn, especially Nortel, which was forced to lay off much of its workforce. The events of September 11 also hurt the Canadian stock markets and were especially devastating to the already troubled airline sector.|$|E
