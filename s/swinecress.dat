40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>swinecress</b> grass feeding on, {{volatile}} constituents of cow milk were investigated. Volatiles from milk and <b>swinecress</b> grass {{were separated by}} simultaneous distillation-extraction under reduced pressure and analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Off-flavored indicated the higher concentrations in aldehydes, terpenes, hydrocarbons and miscellaneous volatiles including 6 sulfur containing compounds, on the contraryï¼Œ the lower concentrations in fatty acids, ketones and lactones. It was supposed that he alteration of volatile composition {{was caused by the}} inhibitory actions of benzyl isothiocyanate on microbial and/or enzymatic activities in the rumen of cows. The isothiocyanate comprised 19 % of total amount of volatiles from <b>swinecress</b> grass...|$|E
