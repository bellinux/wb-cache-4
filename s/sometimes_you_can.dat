One of these early versions was later released under the title [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] as a bonus track on the UK and Japanese promotional releases of the experimental 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1 by Passengers, a side project by U2 and Eno, as well as a B-side on some versions of the [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] single. [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] is an instrumental track and was described by The Edge as a [...] "crazy" [...] mix. He added [...] "'Bottoms' was done in Japan, and we just built on that mix. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> end up with something completely distinctive." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E

They {{must find a way}} to galvanize their neighbors, or it could be the end for Jellyfish Fields forever." [...] It was promoted as SpongeBob's campaign to save the jellyfish. Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make it funny, <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get a message across [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance".

You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> listen to something many, many times and still not have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E

She also stated that {{the last three weeks}} before the show, she works out twice a day. The interview got negative reviews on the media and was mentioned in CNN's Anderson Cooper's [...] "Ridiculist". Shortly afterwards, Lima defended herself in an {{interview with}} E!, [...] "I know it's very intense but... I just have an athlete's mind and I appreciate doing this thing," [...] she said.

2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E

5000|$|Son, never trust {{a man who}} doesn't drink because he's {{probably}} a self-righteous sort, a man who thinks he knows right from wrong all the time. Some of them are good men, but {{in the name of}} goodness, they cause most of the suffering in the world. They're the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never trust a man who drinks but refuses to get drunk. They're usually afraid of something deep down inside, either that they're a coward or a fool or mean and violent. You can't trust a man who's afraid of himself. But <b>sometimes,</b> son, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trust a man who occasionally kneels before a toilet. The chances are that he is learning something about humility and his natural human foolishness, about how to survive himself.
