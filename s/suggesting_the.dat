5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the First World War, Henry Cowell composed a number of piano pieces featuring tone clusters and direct manipulation of the piano's strings.

30|$|The 1 H-NMR {{spectrum}} of compound (1) showed the following characteristic chemical shifts (DMSO as a solvent): the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 2.212  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the protons of the CH 3 group, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 6.029  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of CH of the isoxazole ring, the multiplet signal at δ[*]=[*] 6.743 to 7.768  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the protons of two aromatic benzene rings, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 8.764  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the CH[*]=[*]N group, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 9.352  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the NH group, and the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 10.525  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the OH group.|$|R
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is severe; and scores of 6 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R

5|$|Various {{dates for}} the burial of the hoard have been proposed, largely derived from {{considerations}} regarding {{the origin of}} the objects themselves and their manner of burial, though the inscription has also been an important factor (see below). Taylor suggests a range from 210 to 250. In more recent studies, scholars have proposed slightly later dates, with supporters of the Athanaric theory <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> end of the 4th century, the date also proposed by Constantinescu, and Tomescu <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> early 5th century.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
40|$|An online {{copy of a}} 1863 French book, The Scientific and Industrial Year (English {{translation}} of the title), that predates other historically significant writings about fingerprints <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> use of iodine stains to reproduce papillary lines of <b>the</b> skin and <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of identifying suspects by touch.

5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|Although Carnivàle {{is set in}} the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have {{visions and}} dreams <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> story began much earlier.

5|$|Another {{tropical}} depression formed east of Guam on July21. It tracked westward, passing near the island on July23, and later shifted {{more to the}} west-northwest. On July26, a ship reported a low pressure of , indicating that the system was a typhoon. The system later passed between the Philippines and Taiwan as it entered the South China Sea, but no land areas reported strong winds, <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> typhoon was either very small or had weakened from its peak. On July29, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Shantou in southeastern China, quickly dissipating.|$|E

5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Cremations {{dated to}} the middle Saxon period have been {{discovered}} near the junction of High Dyke with Chapel Lane.

5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says that he made 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He also notes a row of pits <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> place of the spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from}} the Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll.

The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54billion in revenue, US$111million in net earnings, and 1billion users. No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post <b>suggesting</b> <b>the</b> possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E

It was suggested that the project would be funded by Saudi Salafi groups.

5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time.

5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals.
