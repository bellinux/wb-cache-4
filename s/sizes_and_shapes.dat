5|$|All the motifs {{can vary}} {{considerably}} in appearance {{according to the}} weaver. Colours, <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in the photographs above. To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud.

50|$|Areas 1 and 2 receive dense inputs from BA 3b. The {{projection}} from 3b to 1 primarily relays texture information; {{the projection}} to area 2 emphasizes <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> Lesions confined to these areas produce predictable dysfunction in texture, <b>size,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> discrimination.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of {{the human}} vagina are of great importance in medicine and surgery; {{there appears to be}} no one way, however, to characterize the vagina's <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> In addition to variations in <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> from individual to individual, a single woman's vagina can vary substantially in <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> during sexual arousal and sexual intercourse. Parity is associated with a significant increase in the length of the vaginal fornix. The potential effect of parity may be via stretching and elongation of the birth canal at the time of vaginal birth.|$|R
5|$|The first {{remains were}} found in a bonebed {{discovered}} in 1989, which produced numerous ribs and vertebrae from the back and tail, {{as well as many}} limb bones, but no skull material aside from one tooth. Four osteoderms of different <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> were also recovered from this bonebed. This material comes from several different individuals. Since 1989, more material has been uncovered in the same region of France, including a relatively complete skeleton with some elements of the skull and lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> that enable oxygen to reach {{and carbon dioxide}} to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E
5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when the child of a cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{invention}} of the printing press, books began to be manufactured in large numbers. As paper began to be produced in bulk, page <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> were increasingly determined by the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of mould which was most practical for producers. As pages became more standardized, so did the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of margins. In general, margins in books have grown smaller over time. The wide margins common during the Renaissance have given way to much narrower proportions. However, there is still much variation depending on the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> purpose of the book.|$|R
50|$|Whitworth's method {{involves}} {{using the}} plates {{of the same}} <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> The only way for this method to work is using square or circle plates of same <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> The {{reason for this is}} because of twist especially if it is made of cast iron.|$|R
40|$|Information about <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of {{particles}} produced in various manu-facturing processes {{is very important}} for process and product development because design of downstream processes as well as final product properties strongly depend on these geometrical particle attributes. However, recovery of particle <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> information in situ during crystallisation processes has been a major challenge. The focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) provides the chord length distribution (CLD) of a population {{of particles}} in a suspension flowing close to the sensor window. Recovery of <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> information from the CLD requires a model relating particle <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> to its CLD as well as solving the corresponding inverse problem.

5|$|For the game's characters, the {{developers}} {{intended to keep}} the comical looks from the previous games, but they decided to update their appearances with realistic materials and textures {{to take advantage of}} the more powerful level of graphics capabilities of seventh-generation consoles. The designers first drew character sketches to determine the characters' looks and clothing, creating a main and an alternate outfit for each character, which were then made into reference artwork. Afterward, low-level meshes for each character were created, with details added with Zbrush, resulting in characters that, before being scaled down for the game environment, had more than six million polygons. Textures and pixel shaders were added using the team's previous work on Tony Hawk's Project 8 to match the style of earlier Guitar Hero games. Unlike the Tony Hawk games, each character in the game was given a unique skeleton to match their variations in <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes,</b> allowing the animators to create unique moves for individual characters. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. Slash, Tom Morello, and Bret Michaels, each performing one or more songs from their past recordings. All three were brought into the game using motion capture from the Motion Analysis Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

40|$|Many {{properties}} of fines and fillers {{are dependent on}} their <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> This review is on the literature on <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> characterization of fines and fillers. It takes into account measurement techniques of particle width, length, equivalent diameter, area, and shape/morphology. The advantages and limitations of different methods are discussed. Measurement of other particles properties, e. g., optical, chemical or rheological, {{were not included in}} the review. <b>Size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> characterization methods can be roughly divided into gravimetric and non-gravimetric methods. Gravimetric measurements methods account for all particles in the sample, but give only indicative <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> information. Non-gravimetric methods usually give more direct <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> information, but only account for particles larger than the resolution of the instrument. Additionally, measuring both larger and smaller particles simultaneously is rarely possible. An implication is that current analysers fail to measure a larger share of the sample, for example fibrils, which have a high impact on product properties. Of the reviewed measurement techniques, flow microscopy had the highest potential. Based on instruments found in other application areas, possible developments for flow microscopes include multiwavelength illumination and sensors, fluorescent staining, and hydrodynamic focusing.

25|$|Protoceratops was a quadrupedal dinosaur {{that was}} {{partially}} characterized by its distinctive neck frill {{at the back}} of its skull. The frill itself contained two large parietal fenestrae (holes in the frill), while its cheeks had large jugal bones. The exact size and shape of the neck frill varied by individual; some specimens had short, compact frills, while others had frills nearly half the length of the skull. The frill consists mostly of the parietal bone and partially of the squamosal. Some researchers, including Peter Dodson attribute the different <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> of these bones to sexual dimorphism, as well as the age of the specimen, at the time of death.|$|E
