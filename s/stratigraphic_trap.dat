50|$|Petroleum geologists broadly {{classify}} traps {{into three}} categories {{that are based on}} their geological characteristics: the structural trap, the <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap</b> and the far less common hydrodynamic trap.

50|$|A {{salt dome}} {{is a type}} of {{structural}} dome formed when a thick bed of evaporite minerals (mainly salt, or halite) found at depth intrudes vertically into surrounding rock strata, forming a diapir.

Thus, all the thick shales in the highstand system tracts in well A, well B and wells C of the Chiadu field have potential to be excellent source rock. The rapid facies changes between successive system tracts provide potential <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps.</b> Reservoir stratification and continuity vary greatly between system tracts, and this enhanced the development of <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> in the study area.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> {{are formed}} {{as a result of}} lateral and {{vertical}} variations in the thickness, texture, porosity or lithology of the reservoir rock. Examples of this type of trap are an unconformity trap, a lens trap and a reef trap.|$|R
50|$|The gas and {{condensate}} {{is contained}} within Cretaceous formations {{in the deepest}} part of the Denver Basin, where the rocks were subject to enough heat and pressure to generate oil and gas from organic material in the rock. The field is a <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap,</b> basin-centered gas field. Most of the gas-producing formations are considered tight gas, having low natural permeability. Although the field today is in the deepest part of the basin, an unconformity {{at the base of}} the Pierre Shale shows that the field is on an early paleohigh active in the Middle Cretaceous.|$|E
5000|$|In general, organic sediments {{buried in}} depths of 1,000 m to 6,000 m (at {{temperatures}} of 60 °C to 150 °C) generate oil, while sediments buried deeper and at higher temperatures generate natural gas. The deeper the source, the [...] "drier" [...] the gas (that is, {{the smaller the}} proportion of condensates in the gas). Because both {{oil and natural gas}} are lighter than water, they tend to rise from their sources until they either seep to the surface or are trapped by a non-permeable <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap.</b> They can be extracted from the trap by drilling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> {{created and}} {{preserved}} on the unconfined {{slope of the}} ances-tral Mississippi submarine fan in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico {{have been found to}} contain substantial nd profitable hydrocarbon reserves. Nearly 2 trillion cubic feet of gas (350 million barrels of oil equivalent) have been produced in the last 13 years in less than 1400 feet (425 m) of water. Drilling results have yielded 31 fields from 45 drilled prospects for a success rate of 69 %. The main phase of exploration lasted eight years. The first 3 D survey in 1994 sparked amajor increase in drilling and success rates until the last field was discovered in 2001. This play has now essentially been exhausted ofsizeable opportunities. The underlying Mesozoic section sources hydrocarbons to the play for middle Miocene slope sands. The unconfined (non mini-basin) slope sands are turbidites and debris flows that were deposited between 5 and 25 miles (8 and 40 km) from their coeval shelf margins. <b>Stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> in this environment are created at the margins of the levees as they interfinger with slope shales. Additional geometric modifications of the <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> result from post-depositional erosion or 'cannibalization'. The erosion left 'monadnocks', or remnant patches of porous sands, that are encased in low permeability shales. Turbidit...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{productive}} {{geologic unit}} is the Cretaceous-age Woodbine Formation, a regional petroleum-bearing unit {{which had been}} known since {{the early part of}} the 20th century. This sandstone unit was deposited during a period when East Texas was a shallow sea, approximately 100 million years ago. During a subsequent period it was uplifted, eroded, and then covered again by the sea, which this time deposited a layer of impermeable chalk, creating a <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap</b> - a situation where oil, which is lighter than water and migrates upwards, reaches a point where it can move no farther, and pools. The source rock for the oil in East Texas is the overlying Eagle Ford Shale.|$|E
50|$|Traps for {{conventional}} hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks {{result from a}} combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap</b> is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.|$|E
50|$|At Elm Coulee, the Middle Bakken is a {{dolomite}} {{sandwiched between}} the Upper and Lower Shales. The shales are very rich in organic material, {{and the oil}} generated from them expanded from the shales upon reaching thermal maturity, migrating into this Middle Bakken zone. The field is exploited via horizontal drilling technology by perforating the productive rocks parallel to the beds, rather than through a vertical well perpendicular to the relatively thin Bakken formation. At Elm Coulee Field, the Bakken is only about 45 feet (15 m) thick and lies at depths of 8,500 to 10,500 feet (2,600-3,200 m), but horizontal wells penetrate 3,000 to 10,000 feet (900-3,000 m) of the reservoir rock, a porous dolomite of Devonian age that probably originated as a large carbonate bank on the western flank of the basin. The field is a <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Bolivar Coastal Field, BCF, on {{the eastern}} shore of Lake Maracaibo {{produces}} from Miocene sandstones and Eocene sandstones. West of Maracaibo, the La Paz Field produces from Cretaceous limestones, and oil is found in the <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> of Boscan, Los Claros and the Urdaneta fields.|$|R
50|$|The South Belridge Field is a southeast-plunging anticline, {{in which}} the oil has {{collected}} in pools in structural traps sealed by both above-lying impermeable units as well as tar seals. Most of the oil has pooled in the Tulare Formation, of Pleistocene age, and in the Diatomite Formation, of Pliocene−Miocene age. The oil itself probably originated in the underlying Monterey Formation, migrating upward to structural and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> over time.|$|R
5000|$|The Cat Canyon {{field is}} one of several in the Santa Maria Basin in which the Monterey Formation is both the primary source rock and the primary {{reservoir}} rock. Deposited in Miocene time, approximately 6 to 16 million years ago, the rock is rich in organic carbon - averaging 3.5%, but ranging from 1 to 20% - and has aged sufficiently to allow the organic detritus to evolve into oil, mostly heavy and with high sulfur content. Another possible source rock other than the Monterey is the Rincon Formation, which underlies the Monterey {{in some parts of the}} oil field. [...] Oil produced from these source rocks has migrated upwards, forming reservoirs in both structural and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps.</b> The Cat Canyon field shows both types of trapping mechanisms. In the West Area, oil is present in the overlying Sisquoc Formation in several sand units, in <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>traps</b> - pinched out within less-permeable units - while deeper oil is trapped in the structural trap of the faulted Las Flores anticline, within the fractured shale of the Monterey Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Fruitvale Field is in a {{sedimentary}} basin {{in which the}} beds dip slightly to the west. The topmost sedimentary unit, the Kern River Formation, is young - of Pleistocene age - and not oil-bearing. Underneath this alluvial layer, which is over 3000 ft thick, and over millions of years, oil has collected {{in a series of}} structural traps, typically where an oil-bearing unit is topped by an impermeable one, and blocked up-dip by another impermeable structure placed there by faulting. The most productive geologic formations, from top to bottom, include the Pliocene Etchegoin Formation, Pliocene-Miocene Chanac Formation, the Miocene 42-O Sand, and the Miocene Santa Margarita Formation. Many of these formations are productive oil-bearing units elsewhere in the Central Valley, for their geographic coverage is wide, and many structural and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>trap</b> types exist throughout the province.|$|E
