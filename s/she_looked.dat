5|$|Born to Tammye and Mike Harris in Cocoa Beach, Florida, Ashlyn {{was raised}} with her older brother, Chris. Growing up, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{up to her}} brother and {{frequently}} joined him and his friends skateboarding and surfing. Until the age of 14, she played club soccer with the boys teams. She first played for the Palm Bay Rangers and South Brevard United before playing for the Seminole Ice girls team. In 2003, Harris won the state championship with the U-17 Indialantic Force.|$|E
5|$|Marie Krøyer (1867–1940) {{came from}} an {{affluent}} German family who had moved to Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E
60|$|Nancy (who has a fine appetite) <b>looked</b> pleased. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> pleased, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> nice. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> nice, I chuck {{her under}} the chin. It isn't immorality--it's only habit.|$|R

"Well," [...] said Paul, [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> {{at a man}} {{she says}} haughtily 'Nevermore,' and if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> {{at herself in the}} looking-glass she says disdainfully 'Nevermore,' and if she thinks back she says it in disgust, and if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> forward <b>she</b> says it cynically." ...|$|R

5|$|Marlohe {{had secured}} the role after two auditions for {{director}} Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> to Xenia Onatopp {{as a point}} of inspiration for her performance. Distancing herself from the Bond girl title, she interpreted the character as more modern and realistic. Media commentators characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close attention paid to the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E
5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} been outside Salic laws. The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Welles had met stage actress Ruth Warrick {{while visiting}} New York on {{a break from}} Hollywood and remembered her as {{a good fit for}} Emily Norton Kane, later saying that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> the part. Warrick told Carringer that she was struck by the {{extraordinary}} resemblance between herself and Welles's mother when she saw a photograph of Beatrice Ives Welles. She characterized her own personal relationship with Welles as motherly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't <b>she</b> <b>look</b> like Rubens' second wife?" [...] cried Athelny. [...] "Wouldn't <b>she</b> <b>look</b> splendid in a seventeenth-century costume? That's {{the sort}} of wife to marry, my boy. Look at her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> stands <b>looking</b> out at {{the same}} stars without a word. They are {{beginning}} to pale, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> as if their coldness froze her.|$|R

5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E
5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then Mrs. Drury {{should never}} {{come out of}} the scullery. I am sure <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> as if her station was to black the kettles!' cried Gilbert, with some {{domestic}} confusion in his indignation.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> to left, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> to right, and in {{the midst}} she sees [...] A little pool of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees; [...] Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels, [...] And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.|$|R
60|$|Every now {{and again}} <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> towards the door and listens: then turns to the open window. And I notice that each time <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back; but each time she turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen.|$|R
5|$|McCarthy {{established}} {{a bond with}} the powerful Kennedy family, which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became {{a close friend of}} Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, Patricia and Eunice. It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy's first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim has been acknowledged by Robert's wife and Kathleen's mother Ethel, though Kathleen later claimed that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at her christening certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an {{executive}} {{editor for the}} French journal Paris Match. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued {{to live in the}} same house for another six years to raise their daughter together. Galante moved across the street and the two remained close, even after the finalization of the divorce in 1979. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. After studying law at the Université de Droit de Nanterre School of Law, she worked as a journalist in France and the United States. Since 1956, deHavilland has lived in the same three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris.|$|E

25|$|On September 18, 1932, a {{woman was}} hiking below the Hollywoodland sign, when she found a female shoe, purse and jacket that, unbeknown to her, belonged to Entwistle.

The woman reported her findings to the Los Angeles police and laid {{the items on the}} steps of the Hollywood police station.|$|E
25|$|Maria Nikolaievna was {{brave and}} inventive, {{appreciated}} novelty, and was almost {{indifferent to the}} opinion of high society. She was lively, energetic, talented and impulsive.

Like him <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> serious and severe. Her stare also brought to mind her father’s formidable gaze.|$|E
