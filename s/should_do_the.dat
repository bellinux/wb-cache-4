5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
25|$|David Geffen persuaded Mel Brooks to {{turn his}} movie into a stage musical. When Brooks met with Jerry Herman to discuss their working together, Herman declined, telling Brooks that he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job himself, as {{he was a good}} songwriter. Brooks then asked Thomas Meehan to join him in writing the book for the stage. Brooks persuaded Mike Ockrent and his wife Susan Stroman to join the {{creative}} team as director and choreographer. After Ockrent's death in 1999, Stroman agreed to continue as both director and choreographer.|$|E
25|$|The shot of Petersen {{running along}} the top of the {{dividers}} between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.|$|E

25|$|The {{leader of}} Islington borough council, Margaret Hodge, had chaired {{the meeting of}} the Labour london boroughs in June 1984 at which the {{strategy}} of setting no rate had been decided upon, and according to Ken Livingstone, claimed to have come up with the idea. Hodge was one of the public leaders of the campaign and on the evening of Thursday 7 March the council organised a people's festival in the civic auditorium while the council formally voted not to set a rate. On 22 April the council published the results of an opinion poll it had commissioned which showed that 57% of people in Islington supported the council in the struggle, with 20% supporting the Government. Asked what the council <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> poll found 37% wanted the council to continue not to set a rate, 27% wanted the council to resign and force an election on the issue, and 21% wanted the council to set a legal rate.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation 3 version's {{critical}} review scores suffered {{because of the}} technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast, 1UP.com staff members agreed {{that a significant number}} of the frame rate problems had been resolved, but not all of them. They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that [...] "if you own both , you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> 360" [...] version. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation, though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box.|$|E

However, he also dismissed the lyrical content and said that Spears sounds [...] "bored [...] {{as is the case}} with most of her recent work." [...] Michael Cragg of British newspaper The Guardian called it [...] "decent enough." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone referred to the song as [...] "prime Britney" [...] and stated that it [...] "promises great things for her album." [...] Jim Cantiello of MTV felt the use of pick-up lines was silly, but praised the beat and the vocals, while calling the breakdown [...] "awesome".

[...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Latin music, this Spanish music...

Amos Barshad of New York magazine described [...] "1+1" [...] as [...] "a big grand love ballad". Andy Kellman of Allmusic picked [...] "1+1" [...] {{as one of the}} album's top songs, describing it as [...] "a sparse and placid vocal showcase, [...] fades in with a somber guitar line, throws up occasional and brief spikes in energy, and slowly recedes." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound commented that in contrast to the geometry taught at school, there is something interesting in [...] "1+1"; he further wrote that ballad focuses on Beyoncé's [...] "amazing vocal range" [...] as it is not upbeat like most of her previous offerings. Leah Collins of Canada's Dose described the song as a [...] "melodramatic soul ballad". A reporter from The Huffington Post stated that [...] "1+1" [...] is a departure from [...] "Run the World (Girls)", noting that Beyoncé [...] "replac the defiance of [...] with devotion" [...] ". He added that {{it is one of the}} first representations that [...] "Beyoncé is keeping her promise that a whole new array of sounds will make their way into 4." [...] Similarly, Rap-Up favored the track stating that [...] "If 'Run the World (Girls)' wasn't your thing, this <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> trick."

2500|$|In an interview, Carranza {{described}} the recording process for The Bedlam in Goliath stating {{that no more}} than three takes an hour were recorded, as a way to soak in what was recorded and to hear the differences, which in turn improved the general mood and atmosphere of the album's creation. Elaborating on the method, Carranza stated that [...] "when van Gogh was around he wasn't just painting, painting, painting. I'm sure he took a step back once in a while.

2500|$|Today cover-ups by Japan {{and other}} {{countries}} such as the United Kingdom are slowly exposed as more thorough investigations are conducted. The reason for the cover-up was because the British government wanted {{to end the war}} crimes trial early in order to maintain good relations with Japan {{to prevent the spread of}} communism. Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes. Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies, who was a child in Germany when the Nazis rose to power, has stated in response to Prime Minister Abe's visits to Yasukuni Shrine, [...] "Unlike Japan, [...] faced their past, came to terms with it and learned from it.

2500|$|As the Marine Corps grew to {{its maximum}} size, Marine {{aviation}} also peaked at 5 air wings, 31 aircraft groups and 145 flying squadrons.

After being dissatisfied with Navy air support at the Battle of Tarawa, General Holland Smith recommended that Marines <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job, put into effect at New Georgia.
