The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In {{the course of the}} start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} each control factor can be {{determined}} from the value of delta and the percentage contribution, based on which Tables  5, 6, 7 and 8 show that factor X (location of the applied loads) has the largest delta and the percentage contribution, and thus has the most significant influence (Rank 1) on the peak load, vertical deformation, shear stresses, and compressive normal stresses. From the <b>same</b> <b>Tables,</b> {{it was observed that}} factor H/B (ratio between width and depth of the notch) is the most significant control factor affecting the compressive strain, tensile strain, and compressive normal stresses. From the <b>same</b> <b>tables,</b> it is obvious that factor NP (position of the notch) has the weakest effect on the peak load, compressive strain, tensile strain, shear stresses, and tensile normal stresses.|$|R

5|$|On 30 May 2010—the fifth {{anniversary of}} Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, 21, {{died at the}} Hotel TAC, in the Miraflores District of Lima, Peru. On 2 June, a hotel {{employee}} found her beaten body in Room 309, which had been registered in Van der Sloot's name. He had departed from the hotel without returning the room key and left the television running. A tennis racquet, identified by the coroner as a possible homicide weapon, was recovered from the room. A hotel guest and an employee came forward to say they saw Van der Sloot and the victim entering the hotel room together, and the police obtained video of the two playing cards at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> the night before at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima. Van der Sloot had entered Peru via Colombia on 14 May 2010 to attend the Latin American Poker Tour.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Middle Ages {{discussed}} {{the issue of}} people eating milk and meat at the <b>same</b> <b>table.</b> Jacob ben Asher suggested that each individual should eat from different tablecloths, while Moses Isserles argued that a large and obviously unusual item should be placed between the individuals, as a reminder to avoid sharing the foods. Later rabbinic writers pointed out exceptions to the rule. Chaim ibn Attar, an 18th-century kabbalist, ruled that sitting at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> as a non-Jew eating non-kosher food was permissible; Yechiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-century rabbi, argued that the risk was sufficiently reduced if individuals sat far enough apart {{that the only way}} to share food was to leave the table.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the {{partitioned}} data {{is to be}} preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the <b>same</b> <b>table,</b> one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on {{the story behind the}} data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E
25|$|Ancillary {{operations}} {{included the}} Orson Welles Film School, a photo shop, a record store, a bookstore and The Restaurant at the Orson Welles, aka the Orson Welles Restaurant.

Bery, who later wrote Another Season Cookbook: Recipes for Every Season from the Chef/Owner of Boston’s Another Season Restaurant (Globe Pequot, 1986). In his autobiography, comedian Jay Leno notes that he performed in the Orson Welles Restaurant during his early days as a stand-up comic. After the Welles Restaurant closed, the two-level space became Chi-Chi's, part of the Mexican restaurant chain.|$|E

During the crucial 1948 elections that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Genco Russo and Calogero Vizzini sat at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In 1950 when Genco Russo's oldest son married, Don Calò Vizzini was a witness at the ceremony, just as the Christian Democrat president of the Sicilian Regional Assembly, Rosario Lanza. He became a local Christian-democrat leader and town councillor in the 1960. In 1962 {{he was forced to}} step down after he was denounced in the press.|$|E
25|$|Companies A, B, C, and D – {{the tank}} line companies, both medium and light, all {{followed}} the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> of organization. Each company {{consisted of a}} headquarters section which, along with a small headquarters staff, also included two tanks (one for the company commander {{and one for the}} executive officer); and three five-tank platoons. The medium tank companies were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while the light tank company was equipped with M5 Stuart tanks. All four companies had their own maintenance section, which included an M32 Tank Recovery Vehicle, built on a Sherman chassis. Because the Stuart carried a 4-man crew versus a 5-man crew on the Sherman, it had a somewhat smaller personnel strength than the medium tank companies. For the Normandy landings, Companies B and C were equipped with DD tanks. As virtually all these tanks were lost during the assault on D-Day, they were replaced with conventional M4 Shermans as soon as the battalion began receiving replacement equipment.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting, in particular, transmits {{infection}} effectively, {{and appears}} to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% {{of the people at}} the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table {{on the other side of}} the restaurant, the attack rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.|$|E

25|$|George Orson Welles {{was born}} May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He {{was named after}} his {{paternal}} great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story {{of the source of}} his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), {{and the two of them}} sat at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.|$|E
500|$|The rapid {{advancement}} {{and personal}} arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably {{have led to}} his unpopularity, {{but the fact of}} his race made all emotions run hotter against him. [...] Racialism was a scourge of the age; it went hand in hand with belief in the appropriateness of Britain's global dominion. [...] For a dark-skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen's white servants was all but intolerable, for him to eat at the <b>same</b> <b>table</b> as them, to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage. [...] Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household. [...] Race hatred was intolerable to her, and the [...] "dear good Munshi" [...] deserving of nothing but respect.|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} <b>same</b> <b>table.</b> The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E
