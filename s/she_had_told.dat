5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E

After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle. She then became a Christian, married her boyfriend Jon, started and completed a course in cosmetology, left the sex industry, and became a hairdresser all by September 1999. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E

5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up {{to her in the}} Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear before her eyes. As it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E

25|$|Some {{two weeks}} after the incident, police closed the case, {{concluding}} that she made up the whole thing. Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Robert Kaliňák declared that none of Malina's claims could be confirmed.

25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly {{that she}} wanted to go and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
25|$|The RCMP on October 23 {{released}} security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau's movements {{across the}} Parliament Hill precinct.

At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's mother had told the RCMP that {{he wanted to go to}} Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who {{witnessed}} the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the prosecutor that the man she saw {{the night of the}} murder was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly tried to get her to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her answer would hurt their case.|$|E

25|$|When around forty manga {{chapters}} {{had been}} published, Arakawa {{said that as}} the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase {{the pace of the}} narrative. To avoid making some chapters less entertaining than others, unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed. The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in Monthly Shōnen Gangan to include all the story content she wanted to add. Some characters' appearances were limited in some chapters. At first, Arakawa thought the series would last twenty-one volumes but the length increased to twenty-seven. Serialization finished after nine years, and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> everything she wanted with the manga.|$|E
25|$|The third tale, Guardian of the Solar System, {{finds the}} house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert's final wish, gives him {{the ability to do}} almost anything, {{although}} it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in a new version of her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she has no idea what happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels lost in this new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The murder {{investigation}} began in 1988 after Wood's ex-husband, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> about the murders, {{went to the}} police. Detectives for the Walker Police Department extensively questioned Cathy Wood {{in a series of}} interviews. She incrementally leaked out her version of the homicides, portraying Graham as the mastermind and hands-on killer. The investigation led to the exhumation of two nursing home victims who had not been cremated. But when medical examination failed to reveal physical evidence of homicide, not entirely unusual in a smothering case, the county medical examiner nevertheless ruled the deaths homicides, basing it on the interviews Wood had given to the police. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Wood and Graham. On December 4–5, 1988, Graham and Wood were arrested and charged with two murders. Wood was apprehended in Walker; Graham in Tyler, Texas.|$|E
