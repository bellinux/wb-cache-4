50|$|Wasini Island lies in {{southeast}} Kenya 3 km {{off the coast}} of the Indian Ocean, 75 km south of Mombasa, and 3 km opposite the harbour of the village Shimoni. It is approximately 7 km long and 3 km across. The island has only footpaths of sharp old coral or sand. There are no autocars, carts or bicycles. Cargo is transported by foot or by a wheelbarrow with a <b>solid</b> <b>tyre.</b> Transport is over the paths, or via the beaches, mainly consisting of coral and only passable with low tide, or by boat over the sea. Before 1963, in the British colonial time, there was an airstrip in the lagoon situated longitudinal south on the island; only small parts of tarmac are reminders of this history.|$|E

5000|$|In 1920 Trojan in Britain {{made its}} first series of six cars from a works in Croydon and the final revised {{production}} version was shown at the 1922 London Motor Show. An agreement was reached with Leyland Motors to produce the cars at their Kingston upon Thames factory where work on reconditioning ex RAF wartime trucks was running down. This arrangement would continue until 1928 when Leyland wanted factory space for truck production. During the nearly seven years of the agreement 11,000 cars and 6700 vans were made. The car known as the Trojan Utility Car went onto the market at £230, reducing to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and transmission below the seats. This is a similar idea to the chassis-less design of the contemporary 1922 Italian Lancia Lambda luxury car. The transmission used a chain to drive the <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> shod wheels.

40|$|Purpose: In this work, {{a finite}} element model of a <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> was {{constructed}} to simulate the loading condition. The <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> being modeled constitutes of three rubber layers with different properties and steel wires. Onlyhyperelastic property is considerd for the rubbers. The validation of FE prediction against experimental resultswas undertaken. An example of how arrangement of rubber layers in <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> can affect the distribution ofstrain energy density and deflection under loading was also carried out using FE analysisDesign/methodology/approach: A {{finite element model}} of a <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> was constructed to simulate the staticcompressive loading condition. The <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> being modeled constitutes of three types of rubber of componentsand steel wiresFindings: The 3 D FE model for static loading analysis of <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> constructed in this study can give reasonablygood prediction of load-deflection behaviour of a real <b>solid</b> <b>tyre.</b> It can also be deduced that the distributions ofanalysis parameters such as strain energy density and Von Mises stress given by the FE analysis are acceptableand {{can be used to}} improve the design of solid tyres. The tyre made entirely with the rubber of the samehyperelastic property as the tread layer can give more flexible deformation and thus more comfortable ride withlesser risk to damage due to heat generation. Practical implications: Finite element analysis, as has been demonstrated, can be used to predict theperformance of the <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> when such variations are made. The results from finite element anaysis can be usedto determine the optimum thickness of each layer for green tyre (unvulcatised tyre) buildingOriginality/value: In the <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturing point of view, improving the load bearing performance bychanging thickness of each <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> layer or make a variation in layers arrangement is the least problematicand can be done effectively without changing the mould or rubber compounds...|$|E
30|$|The wheel {{tracking}} test {{is capable of}} generating the maximum shear stress and the maximum bending stress that occur when a moving wheel is either slightly offset from or directly over a crack, respectively. This produces mode I and mode II cracking. The {{wheel tracking}} machine was located in a temperature controlled room, which allows the effect of temperature on SAMI performance to be studied. The wheel tracker consists of a reciprocating table which moves forwards and backwards with a frequency of 0.8  Hz under the loaded wheel with a travel length of 225  mm. The <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> fitted to the wheel has an outside diameter of 200  mm and width of 50  mm. The test replicates {{what happens when a}} cracked pavement overlaid with and without interlayers (SAMIs) is trafficked.|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} {{of the waste}} tyres {{represents one of the}} most difficult global problems ever encountered. Pyrolysis of waste tyre is considered as an alternative process for recovering some of the value in waste tyres. The process is very energy intensive. There will be 30 - 40 weight % <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> char produced; hence the process economy depends strongly on its application and market value. In this study, the tyre char was investigated as an adsorbent to remove lead from aqueous solution. The maximum lead adsorption capacity was 135 mg/g at pH of 5. At low pH (3. 75), the external surface became negatively charged, resulted in a higher lead adsorption. The adsorption mechanism was quite complex, and three possible mechanisms were identified, including ion exchange, surface complex formation and adsorption. The isotherm was best fitted with Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm with a Langmuir monolayer capacity of 135. 5 mg/g. The experimental data were analysed using adsorption kinetic models and the pseudo-first order equation was found to be the best fit equation for the adsorption of lead ions onto the tyre char...|$|E

50|$|From sunset to dawn {{a curfew}} was enforced. No lights were {{supposed}} to be visible. Windows which couldn’t be obscured with thick double curtains or full shutters, had to be blacked out. During the daytime, certain vehicles, such as doctors’ cars were allowed on the roads, but fuel was scarce. Some shop-keepers used vans running on gasogene to transport supplies, but the engines were weak. Even horses for wagons and carriages were difficult to find, as many had been requisitioned for use by the German Army. There were steam trains in limited circulation. People walked or used bicycles with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> since it was impossible to find any inner tubes. Therefore, there was,very little traffic on the roads.|$|R

The [...] "Mohmand blockade" [...] involved British armoured cars patrolling unpaved tracks between blockhouses. Maintenance of the cars was difficult as the ship carrying spares had been torpedoed. They were armed with a single Vickers machine gun. Although the four-wheel drive with independent transmission and wide range of gears should have been an advantage, the narrow <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> negated that and running at more than 12 mph caused problems with engine bearings.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1920s and 30s travel became easier, as a {{few people}} {{acquired}} motor-cycles, and cars and bus services were developed. Orange-coloured buses of United Automobile Services pioneered the route along the A140 until they were absorbed by Eastern Counties Omnibus Company in 1931. The Eastern Counties service was five buses daily, including Sundays. Lower Tasburgh was served by the buses of Mr Trudgil of Pulham St Mary. One bus ran each way on Wednesdays and Fridays, with two return journeys on Saturdays.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the influence of some parameters on the ride comfort of a forklift a lot of measurements are done on a forklift with different tyres and seats and are evaluated for comfort. A simulation model is also developed and used to investigate the influence of these parameters. The correlation between simulation and test run results is good. The results are that <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> are more comfortable than pneumatic ones because of their high damping. The negative influence of higher stiffness is less than the positive influence of higher damping. For the simulation it seems also that the influence of the horizontal tyre stiffness and damping can be neglected and the seat characteristic can be linearised for a general investigation...|$|R
