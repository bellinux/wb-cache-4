40|$|A {{prototype}} on-line bond {{inspection system}} for Al/Al-Sn/Al/steel strips is introduced to detect bond defects {{that occur in}} the cold roll bonding (CRB) process of strips. The transmitting and receiving ElectroMagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) probes inspect 100 % material volume whilst the strip is processed continuously. The inspection signals are processed in real-time and are stored for post-processing. Serial production strips with good bond as well as with defects along the bond line were inspected for rigorous testing of the prototype machine. The inspection results were statistically analysed to determine an alarm threshold for serial inspection. The most important results are that the guided waves are sensitive enough for practical non-destructive testing (NDT) to detect all bond defects with only 0. 5 % false alarm rate, which nowadays can only be detected with a destructive peel-off test. The detection of all kinds of bond defects would lead to unreasonable levels of scrap due to false alarms. The application of this prototype EMAT inspection system to an industrial <b>strip</b> <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> shows that on-line detection of significant defects in CRBed Al/AlSn/Al/steel strips in a harsh serial production environment is possible. Design improvements are proposed to address the issues that occurred during inspection trials to design a more robust mechanical machine for the industrialisation of an EMAT inspection system...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we tried}} to improve a given {{stochastic}} <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> which is perfectly balanced. By introducing flexibility to a stochastic <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> we could achieve the benefit of resource pooling. When we apply pri-ority sequencing to the flexible <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> we could attain additional improvement in reducing mean throughput time. The ratio of improvement from flexibility is shown to be amazingly large by using heavy traffic ap-proximation. We also considered the set-up time loss due to flexibility and derived the appropriate range for flexibility and set-up time. The result of this paper implies that we should consider the alternative of introducing flexibility to a processing system {{rather than trying to}} optimally allocate each segments of jobs and get a balanced <b>processing</b> <b>line.</b> ...|$|R

The THPN model is a hybrid type, where P/RML is the discrete part and WMR with RM is the continuous part. The reprocessing starts after the piece fails the quality test.

The samples were collected along the <b>processing</b> <b>lines</b> of these dairy products and analyzed for antibiotic residues (streptomycin, penicillin-G and tetracycline). The mean residual levels for cheese was; streptomycin (0. 00400. 0018), penicillin-G (0. 00620. 0026) and tetracycline (0. 00230. 0008), while levels in yoghurt was; streptomycin (0. 00140. 0010), penicillin-G (0. 00170. 0017) and tetracycline (0. 00110. 0071). Penicillin-G exceeded Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) in raw milk and cheese for 4 out of the 5 processors. In yoghurt processing only powdered milk for processor F exceeded MRLs for penicillin-G.

40|$|Abstract]: Continuous <b>processing</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} in various {{manufacturing}} industries including aluminium, paper and steel. Common processes include annealing, pickling, metal coating, hot dip galvanizing, and painting. A standard design feature incorporated by continuous <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> manufacturers is the inclusion of an accumulator at the entry and exits points of the processing section to ensure its continuous operation. Continuous <b>processing</b> of <b>strip</b> and product quality are key performance targets for operating continuous <b>processing</b> <b>lines.</b> Uncontrolled tension transients in the strip will normally result in poor product quality which {{can be attributed to}} poor performance from an accumulator control system. Thus, the optimal method of controlling an accumulator in a continuous <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> is a significant and important issue. This dissertation presents an analysis of methods for controlling an accumulator to minimise potential sources of disturbance. The analysis included modelling the accumulator dynamics and simulation with popular industrial control methods. Initially a base case was established using a proportional + integral + derivative controller (PID), which is the current standard for industrial control. The base case was used as the benchmark prior to simulation and analysis of alternative or less conventional industrial controllers. A key emphasis of this dissertation is an association to a real world problem. The project results suggest that the classical PID controller is more suited to this application than the alternatives included in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the biofilm-forming capacity {{and the production}} of quorum signals in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from a food production environment, and the possible correlation between both phenotypes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-eight Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from equipment and working surfaces in a raw vegetable <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> and tested for biofilm-forming capacity using an in vitro microplate assay. All isolates showed significantly higher biofilm-forming capacity than Escherichia coli laboratory strain DH 5 alpha, which was included as a negative control, and differed up to 56 -fold in relative biofilm-forming capacity. Various assays based on reporter bacteria were used to detect quorum signals produced by the isolates. Twenty-six isolates produced autoinducer- 2, five isolates produced N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and none produced the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. CONCLUSIONS: No correlation was found between in vitro biofilm-forming capacity and production of quorum signalling molecules among the 68 strains isolated from the raw vegetable <b>processing</b> <b>line.</b> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several recent studies have shown a role of AHL-based quorum sensing in biofilm formation of specific Gram-negative bacterial strains. The current work shows that production of AHL and other quorum signals is not widespread in Gram-negative isolates from a raw vegetable <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> and is not a general requirement for biofilm formation, at least in vitro. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Over the years, {{there have}} been {{considerable}} increases in the consumption of frozen poultry foods across Nigeria. Little {{attention has been paid}} to the microbial quality of these foods and hence constitutes a threat to public health. The contamination levels (Enterobacteriaceae and Listeria counts) and the presence of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria along the <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> of sale of frozen poultry foods were assayed in retail outlets. Methodology and results: Bacteriological counts and bacterial isolation were carried out using standard plate methods, while the direct slide agglutination technique was utilized for serology. Bacteriological assay revealed extremely high counts (Listeria count (LC) : 7. 784 Â± 1. 109 - 9. 586 Â± 0. 016 log cfu/cm 2; Enterobacteriaceae count (EC) : 7. 151 Â± 0. 213 - 9. 318 Â± 0. 161 log cfu/cm 2), higher than stipulated by International Food Standard Agencies. The highest count for EC (9. 318 Â± 0. 161 log cfu/cm 2) and LC 9. 586 Â± 0. 016 log cfu/cm 2) was from the weighing scale and processing table. Averagely, LC (8. 598 Â± 0. 733 log cfu/cm 2) was higher than EC (8. 145 Â± 0. 936 log cfu/cm 2). Weighing scale had counts significantly different (p < 0. 05) from all others for EC. But there were no significant differences in LC. Weighing scale and meat tables were critical control points (CCPs) in the <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> for sale of frozen poultry meats in the retail outlets.
