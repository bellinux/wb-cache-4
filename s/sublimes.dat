5|$|The high {{temperature}} stability, low vapor pressure, {{good wear resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (<b>sublimes</b> at ~360°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.|$|E

The by-products (such as PaOCl3) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which <b>sublimes</b> in vacuum at 400°C; {{it can also}} be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400°C.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon <b>sublimes</b> at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead <b>sublimes</b> to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.|$|E

Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{panorama}} was what {{it came to be}} associated with, namely, by redefining the <b>sublime</b> to incorporate the material.

The <b>sublime</b> became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity.

5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic <b>sublimes</b> at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine <b>sublimes</b> less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it <b>sublimes</b> at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This essay {{explores the}} {{aesthetics}} of the <b>sublime</b> in Edgar Allan Poe’s short stories in order to clarify how Poe’s <b>sublime</b> is {{moving away from the}} Romantic conception of the <b>sublime.</b> Through Poe’s imaginative writing – his way of presenting impressive, yet disturbing, portraits of the human experience of horror – his work deals not only with aspects of the <b>sublime</b> but is also largely influenced by elements of the uncanny. In order to make the <b>sublime</b> experience possible it seems that Poe, through his usage of the uncanny, illustrates an environment that allows for his <b>sublime</b> to be experienced. However, while the uncanny seems to drive Poe´s narrative over the edge, it is the perversity of the narrators that allows for the <b>sublime</b> experience. This takes the subjective <b>sublime</b> of Romantic author´s such as Wordsworth and Kant even further, as the <b>sublime</b> experience is dependent upon certain traits of an individual...|$|R

25|$|The {{literary}} sublime, {{as well as}} the philosophical, aesthetic <b>sublimes,</b> {{is inherently}} connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature. More authors began to connect the natural sublime to an internalized emotion of terror. Authors began to see the sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror and awe) as representative of the changing political and cultural climate of the times. They began to incorporate more aspects of the sublime into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts. In this way, the sublime particularly appealed to the Romantics.|$|E
25|$|Silicon crystallises {{in a giant}} {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond cubic lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon <b>sublimes</b> (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E

25|$|If metal nitrates are {{prepared}} from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, {{a range of}} covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is {{because there is a}} thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous copper nitrate, are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate <b>sublimes</b> in vacuum at only 40°C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours.
