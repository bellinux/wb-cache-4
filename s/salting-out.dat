The interactions with salts are related to their ability to act as water structure makers (<b>salting-out)</b> or water structure breakers (salting-in). <b>Salting-out</b> salts increase the self-hydration of water through hydrogen bonding and reduce the hydration of the copolymers, thus reducing the critical micelle temperature and critical micelle concentration. Salting-in electrolytes reduce the water self-hydration and increase the polymer hydration, therefore increasing the critical micelle temperature and critical micelle concentration. The different salts have been categorized by the Hofmeister series according to their ‘salting-out’ power. Different phase diagrams characterizing all these transitions have been constructed for most poloxamers using a great variety of experimental techniques (e.g. SAXS, Differential scanning calorimetry, viscosity measurements, light scattering).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Salting-out</b> of {{proteins}} was discov-ered {{in the nineteenth}} century and is widely used for protein separation and crystallization. It is gen-erally believed that <b>salting-out</b> occurs because at high concentrations salts and the protein compete for solvation water. Debye and Kirkwood suggested ideas for explaining <b>salting-out</b> (Debeye and Mac-Aulay, Physik Z; 1925; 131 : 22 – 29; Kirkwood, In: Pro-teins, amino acids and peptides as ions and dipolar ions. New York: Reinhold; 1943. p 586 – 622). How-ever, a quantitative theory has not been developed, and such a theory is presented here. It is built on Kirkwood’s idea that a salt ion has a repulsive interactionwith an image charge inside a lowdielec-tric cavity. Explicit treatment is given for the effect of other salt ions on the interaction between a salt ion and its image charge. When combined with the Debye-Hückel effect of salts on the solvation energy of protein charges (i. e., salting-in), the characteris-tic curve of protein solubility versus salt concentra-tion is obtained. The theory yields a direct link between the <b>salting-out</b> effect and surface tension and is able to provide rationalizations for the effects of salt on the folding stability of several proteins...|$|E

Methacrylic acid copolymer and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAL) were selected as NP polymer and emulsifying agent, respec-tively. <b>Salting-out</b> and emulsification-diffusion NP batches were pre-pared modifying the PVAL content in the aqueous phase. For nano-precipitation, NP were produced with variation of the polymer con-tent and type of solvent in the organic phase. Results. For <b>salting-out</b> and emulsification-diffusion, NP formation was discussed in terms of the emulsification theory. The nanoemul-sion obtained during NP preparation was visualized by scanning elec-tron microscopy. Aqueous and organic phases used for NP prepara-tion were characterized by their viscosity and surface tension.

40|$|Model {{compound}} {{studies in}} the literature show how Hofmeister ion interactions affect protein stability. Although model compound results are typically obtained as <b>salting-out</b> constants, {{they can be used}} to find out how the interactions affect protein stability. The null point in the Hofmeister series, which divides protein denaturants from stabilizers, arises from opposite interactions with different classes of groups: Hofmeister ions salt out nonpolar groups and salt in the peptide group. Theories of how Hofmeister ion interactions work need to begin by explaining the mechanisms of these two classes of interactions. <b>Salting-out</b> nonpolar groups has been explained by the cavity model, but its use is controversial. When applied to model compound data, the cavity model 1) uses surface tension increments to predict the observed values of the <b>salting-out</b> constants, within a factor of 3, and 2) predicts that the <b>salting-out</b> constant should increase with the number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic side chain of an amino acid, as observed. The mechanism of interaction between Hofmeister ions and the peptide group is not well understood, and it is controversial whether this interaction is ion-specific, or whether it is nonspecific and the apparent specificity resides in interactions with nearby nonpolar groups. A nonspecific salting-in interaction is known to occur between simple ions and dipolar molecules; it depends on ionic strength, not on position in the Hofmeister series. A theory by Kirkwood predicts the strength of this interaction and indicates that it depends on the first power of the ionic strength. Ions interact with proteins in various ways besides the Hofmeister ion interactions discussed here, especially by charge interactions. Much of what is known about these interactions comes from studies by Serge Timasheff and his co-workers.

40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{to the study of}} hydration of polymeric ions in relation to that of analogous simple ions have been made as follows: In {{the first part of the}} thesis, information in sought regarding the hydration of polyions by evaluating the degree of dielectric saturation near the charged particles. Previously, this had been done only in the ease of isolated simple ions assumed to be point charges. Since the ionic atmosphere can never be removed from the polyions, even in very dilute solutions, the simple electrostatic field cannot be used in the evaluation of the extent of dielectric saturation. The dielectric constant has therefore been obtained directly as a function of the distance from the polyion from a solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and previously published relations between dielectric constant and field intensity. The solutions have been obtained by numerical methods using a digital electronic computer. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved by this method for the following models: simple ions, cylindrical polyions, spherical polyions and planar colloidal ions. The relative degrees of dielectric saturation were calculated and related to the relative extents of primary hydration for the different ionic models. The effect of dielectric saturation on the field and potential functions is also discussed for the various ion models. The second part of the thesis deals with solvent electrostriction and the determination of <b>salting-out</b> by polyelectrolytes. In order to interpret the experimental data obtained on the <b>salting-out</b> of non-electrolytes (argon, ethylene, d- 1 leucine and benzamide) by polyelectrolytes (sodium polyphosphates, potassium polymethacrylate and poly- 4 -vinyl-N-n-butylpyridinium bromide), it was first found necessary to modify the existing <b>salting-out</b> theories for simple ions and a proposed theory for polymeric ions, by taking into account the effect of dielectric saturation of the solvent near the ions. Such effects are shown to be important in determining <b>salting-out</b> constants and, in fact, lead to the recognition of the necessity for taking into account the specific structure (e. g. effective radius) of the primary hydration shell. Other modifications to the theory are also suggested. In the modified <b>salting-out</b> theory referred to above, the radius of the primary hydration shell in required. The third part of the thesis therefore describes the evaluation of this parameter from experimentally measured apparent molar volumes for simple and polymeric ions. The significance of these apparent molar volumes in relation to the hydration of this polymeric and simple ions is also discussed...|$|E

The approach, based on classical molecular force fields, offers an alternative to more heavily parametrized methods...|$|E
30|$|In the {{extraction}} methods, due to <b>salting-out</b> effect, the solubility of metal chelates in aqueous solutions decreases with increasing ionic strength. Thus, for this purpose, extraction efficiency was {{investigated by the}} addition of varying concentrations of NaNO 3 and NaClO 4 salts from 0 to 10  %. Increasing the salt concentration had no significant effect on extraction efficiency, perhaps because of the dual effects of salt addition in USAEME: one involves increasing the volume of the extracted phase, which decreases the enrichment factor, and the other is the <b>salting-out</b> effect that increases the enrichment factor (Zeini Jahromi et al. 2007 and Bidari et al. 2007). These two effects cancel each other out; therefore, the enrichment factor is nearly constant by increasing the amount of the salts, and {{the extraction}} experiments were carried out without additional salt.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of ammonium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium chlorides and sulfates on {{the extraction of}} catechol and hydroquinone with diethyl and diisopropyl ether was studied. All the salts investigated in this study largely increased the extraction efficiency of both catechol and hydroquinone from aqueous solutions, magnesium salts being the most efficient <b>salting-out</b> agents. The extraction efficiency {{in the presence of}} magnesium salts in comparison to the extraction efficiencies from the salt-free aqueous solutions increased from 14 %, in the case of catechol extraction with diethyl ether, up to about 90 %, in the case of hydroquinone extraction with diisopropyl ether. The extraction from spiked urine samples proved that investigation of <b>salting-out</b> effect in aqueous solutions {{could be used as a}} good model system for the reliable choice of optimal conditions for catechol and hydroquinone extraction from real samples...|$|E
