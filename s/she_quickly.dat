5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club.

In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where <b>she</b> <b>quickly</b> became a star pupil.|$|E

In 1916, the ship was placed in reserve, though <b>she</b> <b>quickly</b> returned to service when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. During the war, she trained naval personnel; while cruising off the eastern coast of the United States in September 1918, she struck a naval mine laid by a German U-boat. The extensive damage required lengthy repairs that kept her out of service {{for the rest of the}} war. She helped to return American soldiers from Europe in 1919 before resuming her training ship duties in 192021, before being decommissioned in December 1921 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} {{on the night}} of 8 April, Group 5, with Blücher in the lead, passed the outer ring of Norwegian coastal batteries.
