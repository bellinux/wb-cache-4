5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> {{her head}} rested on her hand, while Jones is {{seated on the}} floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} mysterious man holding a briefcase, walking down a futuristic hallway. As the music starts, the girls start dancing in a dark office with lights {{flashing}} in the background. As the chorus starts, the girls start shooting laser beams from their fingers, and dance to the song. The girls teleport into the futuristic labyrinth, looking for {{the man with the}} briefcase. Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song, whilst in several different hallways. During the second chorus, the girls continue to search for him without any luck.

The girls find the office entrance, with CCTV footage catching them enter the room.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> a {{backdrop}} of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E

25|$|The task {{most often}} given to Gaston by Prunelle is to sort {{and answer the}} mail, presumably sent by readers. This often builds up to a mountain-like backlog, which Gaston often {{attempts}} to dispose of in creative ways, for instance stuffing a homemade <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> it. In a similar vein, Gaston was briefly {{put in charge of}} the reference library: at first he arranged the books into a maze and charged his colleagues for admission, and later he simply piled them up, dug a cave in the middle and settled there with his pets, a radio and a stove to sleep all day.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the global}} war, the first peacetime ball at Rideau Hall was held for President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, after which life within the {{household}} returned to normal. The transition from war to peace was marked by the appointment as governor general of the Viscount Alexander, whose son, Brian, reportedly used the portraits of former governors general throughout the hall as targets for his water pistol. During Alexander's tenure, Government House's first post-war Canadian royal visitors were the heiress presumptive to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who came in late 1951 and, amongst other activities, took part in a square dance in the ballroom (replete with checked shirts). Churchill, once again Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, returned to Rideau Hall in January of the next year, where, sprawled on a <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> a cigar {{in one hand and a}} brandy in the other, he persuaded Alexander to join the British Cabinet.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna in a studio, {{lying on a}} <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> {{headphones}} on her ears composing a song, following a sequence in which she sings {{in front of a}} microphone, which alternates with those of her receiving instructions from the director. She then appears in front of a background of bright lights, representing the sun-lit sky, and also in a scene of her kissing a man behind glass on which water falls. The video ends with an air view of open umbrellas covering the entire floor. Madonna introduced another completely new persona for the video. She wore a wig which provides [...] "a waif-like cap of short black hair with spiky bangs." [...] She also removed her trademark mole and got her eyebrows back, which had been virtually invisible in her previous videos. The look took inspirations from Paris in the 1940s, cabaret singer Édith Piaf and ingenues in general. Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons provided the minimalist black clothes in the video, while the ethereal white clothes was designed by Vivienne Westwood.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts out}} showing Little Italy, {{an icon of}} the Madonna and Child, and then Gaga riding a Vespa. The first twenty seconds are mainly full of camera shots of {{different}} men, Gaga, and the city. The singer roams around with some friends, laughing and joking in a restaurant, while she stands on the seat. Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and waking up to reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for {{a man in a}} house while dancing. She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone. The two harlequin Great Danes who appear at the start of her [...] "Poker Face" [...] music video, also appear in this one. Finally she lies on a <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> her legs up on the man. One of the last scene shows her in a yellow dress made of flowers and wearing a yellow watch while singing to the song with a unique hairstyle which shows her hair pulled up and folded over. Then the camera quickly goes back to her in bed.|$|E
500|$|After searching, Madonna {{chose to}} work with Babyface, whose {{previous}} collaborations with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. Through him, she met with then upcoming young producer from Atlanta called Dallas Austin, who had become famous {{for his work on}} girl group TLC's debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992). Together they composed two songs for the album, [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary". The former was originally produced in its demo form by Pettibone, under the name [...] "Something's Coming Over Me", however Austin reworked the demo and made it a different song musically. On September 27, 1994, the song was released as the lead single from Bedtime Stories. The cover art of the single showed a new look for Madonna, with blonde hair and style compared to the look of 1930s American actress, Jean Harlow. Shot by photographer Patrick Demarchelier in black-and-white, the image showed the singer slouched on a <b>sofa</b> <b>with</b> her dress down and revealing her translucent brassiere. Unusual for the mid-1990s, Madonna talked about the new single on the Internet leaving an audio message for her fans, as well as a snippet of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} edit of {{the music}} video begins with a message to those fans that sent in their videos; [...] "Thank you {{to all those who}} chose to share their stories with the world." [...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of me about my race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the <b>sofa,</b> <b>with</b> tears in her eyes, as they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in well-developed fires, the burning behavior of furniture under flashover should be studied. Full-scale burning {{tests on the}} heat release rates of furniture under flashover with oxygen calorimetry will be reported in this article. Nine tests on <b>sofas</b> <b>with</b> and without the treatment of fire retardant, wood desks, and the fire source itself to start the burning were carried out. The heat release rate, oxygen concentration, thermal radiative heat fluxes at floor level, and air temperatures at some selected positions were measured.
