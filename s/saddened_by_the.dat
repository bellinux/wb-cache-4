5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties {{to be carried out}} without interfering with his parish work.

This period of Heber's life was <b>saddened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London.
