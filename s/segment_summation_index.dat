30|$|The {{last term}} of (1 a), the single summation, {{describes}} {{the influence of}} bending via edge cells on the CPG voltages v_ij. We use the Kronecker delta function δ_im to indicate that bending only occurs at <b>segment</b> m. The <b>summation</b> <b>index</b> s indicates whether input is from the edge cell on the left (s = 1) or right (s = 2) side. The parameter α_f is the strength of forcing and the parameters G_f^sj are used to indicate the relative strength of forcing on different cells in segment m. For simplicity, we assume that G_f^sj = 1 for all the edge cell connections shown in Fig.  1 and G_f^sj= 0 otherwise. The parameter V_syn,ec^sj is the synaptic reversal potential for the connection from the edge cell on side s to cell j; V_syn,ec^sj is 1 for the ipsilateral connections, which are excitatory, and − 1 for the contralateral connections, which are inhibitory. For an edge cell connection, the input to the threshold function h is the voltage v_ec^s(θ_f), which is defined by (1 b) and (1 d).|$|R
