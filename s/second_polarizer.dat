5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed and in theory no light is transmitted, though again practically speaking no polarizer is perfect and the transmission is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in colour). If a transparent object is placed between the crossed polarizers, any polarization effects present in the sample (such as birefringence) will be shown as an increase in transmission. This effect is used in polarimetry to measure the optical activity of a sample.|$|E
2500|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} is emitted by a light source and linearly polarized by a polarizer. It can pass through an optional compensator (retarder, quarter wave plate) and falls onto the sample. After reflection the radiation passes a compensator (optional) and a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> {{which is called}} an analyzer, and falls into the detector. Instead of the compensators, some ellipsometers use a phase-modulator {{in the path of}} the incident light beam. Ellipsometry is a specular optical technique (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). The incident and the reflected beam span the plane of incidence. [...] Light which is polarized parallel to this plane is named p-polarized (p-polarised). A polarization direction perpendicular is called s-polarized (s-polarised), accordingly. The [...] "s" [...] is contributed from the German [...] "senkrecht" [...] (perpendicular).|$|E

2500|$|Each pixel of an LCD {{typically}} {{consists of}} a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the [...] liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the <b>second</b> (crossed) <b>polarizer.</b> Before an electric field is applied, {{the orientation of the}} liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules {{in the center of the}} layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray. [...] Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.|$|R

The tunable laser sources were installed in the ante-room outside the Raytheon clean room where the VIIRS sensor was located. The output from the tunable lasers was fiber-coupled into a 1 -m diameter Spectralon integrating sphere source positioned {{in front of the}} VIIRS sensor’s Earth-view port and VIIRS Absolute Spectral Responsivity (ASR) measurements were made. In a <b>second</b> configuration, a <b>polarizer</b> was placed between the source and the VIIRS entrance port and polarization sensitivity testing was done. In this work, we present details of the T-SIRCUS calibration system, including a new automated tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) system, achievable radiances with the 1 -m Spectralon integrating sphere, and an uncertainty budget for the integrating sphere radiance. An approach to extend the dynamic range of out-of-band measurements using a recently develop Flat Plate Illuminator will be introduced.

50|$|A {{monochromatic}} light source, usually a laser, is shot through a polarizer {{and into a}} sample. The scattered light then goes through a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> where it is collected by a photomultiplier and the resulting image is projected onto a screen. This {{is known as a}} speckle pattern (Figure 1).All of the molecules in the solution are being hit with the light and all of the molecules diffract the light in all directions. The diffracted light from all of the molecules can either interfere constructively (light regions) or destructively (dark regions). This process is repeated at short time intervals and the resulting set of speckle patterns are analyzed by an autocorrelator that compares the intensity of light at each spot over time. The polarizers can be set up in two geometrical configurations. One is a vertical/vertical (VV) geometry, where the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> allows light through that is {{in the same direction as}} the primary polarizer. In vertical/horizontal (VH) geometry the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> allows light not in same direction as the incident light.|$|E

50|$|The {{reflected}} light will travel {{back to the}} beam splitter and pass through a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> which eliminates scattered light, before reaching the detector (usually a CCD camera) in order to form the final picture.

50|$|Many {{crystals}} {{are naturally}} birefringent, but isotropic {{materials such as}} plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This can be utilized in the determination of stresses in structures using photoelasticity. The birefringent material is then placed between crossed polarizers. A change in birefringence will alter the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E

50|$|Polarimeters measure this {{by passing}} {{monochromatic}} {{light through the}} first of two polarising plates, creating a polarized beam. This first plate is known as the polarizer. This beam is then rotated as it passes through the sample. After passing through the sample, a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> known as the analyzer, rotates either via manual rotation or automatic detection of the angle. When the analyzer is rotated such that all the light or no light can pass through, then one can find the angle of rotation which is equal to the angle by which the analyser was rotated(θ) in the former case or (90-θ) in the latter case.|$|E

On its way to the detector, the light passes through a second polarized filter. This second filter is oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the polarization of the original light beam. The first polarizer can be placed in the laser’s path between the incoming light and the sample, and the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> between the light coming off of the sample and the detector.

50|$|In the OFF state, i.e., when no {{electrical}} {{field is}} applied, a twisted configuration (aka helical structure or helix) of nematic liquid crystal molecules is formed between two glass plates, G in the figure, which {{are separated by}} several spacers and coated with transparent electrodes, E1 and E2. The electrodes themselves are coated with alignment layers (not shown) that precisely twist the liquid crystal by 90° when no external field is present (left diagram). If a light source with the proper polarization (about half) shines {{on the front of}} the LCD, the light will pass through the first polarizer, P2 and into the liquid crystal, where it is rotated by the helical structure. The light is then properly polarized to pass through the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> P1, set at 90° to the first. The light then passes through the back of the cell and the image, I, appears transparent.|$|E
50|$|The {{light source}} needs to produce high {{intensity}} light, {{as a lot}} of light will be lost by the beam splitter and the sample itself. Different wavelengths result in different IRM images; Bereiter-Hahn and colleagues showed that for their PtK 2 cells, light with a wavelength of 546 nm resulted in better contrast than blue light with a wavelength of 436 nm. There have been many refinements to the basic theory of IRM, most of which increase the efficiency and yield of the image formation. By placing polarizers and a quarter wave plate between the beam splitter and the specimen, the linear polarized light can be converted into circular polarized light and afterwards be converted back to linear polarized light, which increases the efficiency of the system. The circular polarizer article discusses this process in detail. Furthermore, by including a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer,</b> which is rotated 90° compared to the first polarizer, stray light can be prevented from reaching the detector, increasing the signal to noise ratio (see Figure 2 of Verschueren).|$|E

The three polarizers are oriented at 45 ° to the vertical direction, while the LC director of the LCR devices is vertically oriented. The advantage of using LCR devices is that the LO filter can be tuned to different wavelengths [29, 30]. And if combined {{with other types of}} filters is able to provide narrowband multispectral tunable filters [31].|$|E
40|$|An on-chip {{optical sensor}} for the {{detection}} of refractive index changes has a substrate body made of lithium niobate in which a monomode birefringent waveguide is provided along the X or Y kerf axis of the sliced lithium niobate crystal. Said crystal stretches between two end faces of the substrate body and along its surface, whereby a lateral boundary surface of the waveguide is brought into contact with a measuring fluid. Laser radiation is applied to a coupling surface and a light detector is applied with the measuring signal received by reflection or transmission from a corresponding coupling surface. The impinging laser radiation is linear polarized by a first polarizer twisted in the plane of the end face by a predefined angle, preferably by 45 degrees, in relation to the Z axis, and the emerging laser radiation applied to the coupling surface is linear polarized by a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> twisted in the plane of the end face also by a predefined angle, preferably by 55 degrees, in re lation to the Z axis.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the experimental methods of determining stress-strain state of elements and structures with {{a brief description of}} the essence of each method. The authors focus mostly on polarization-optical method for determining stresses in the translucent optical sensing models made of epoxy resins. Physical component of the method is described in the article and a simple diagram of a circular polariscope is presented, as well as an example of the resulting interference pattern in illuminated monochromatic light. A polariscope, in its most general definition, consists of two polarizers. The polarizers sandwich a material or object of interest, and allows one to view the changes of the polarity of light passing through the material or object. Since we are unable to perceive the polarity of light with the naked eye, we are forced to use polariscopes to view the changes in polarity caused by the temporary birefringence of our photoelastic materials. A polariscope is constructed of two polarizers, each set perpendicular to the path of light transmitted through the setup. The first polarizer is called the "polarizer", and the <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> is called the "analyzer". The method how the polarizer works is quite simple: unpolarized light enters the polariscope through the polarizer, which allows through only the light of its orientation. This light then passes through the material under observation, and experiences some change in polarity. Finally, this light reaches the analyzer, which, like the polarizer, only lets the light of its orientation through...|$|E
40|$|From {{wristwatches}} to {{the most}} advanced computer systems on earth, liquid crystals have {{made their way into}} every aspect of our lives. Since liquid crystals have been introduced to the industry there has been a great demand to reduce their energy consumption. This document shows the final research project performed by the Society of Physics Students at UCCS. The research was done in an effort to find new ways of reducing the energy consumption of such devices. Over the past year the Society of Physics Students created a mixture of BaTiO 3 and liquid crystal 13739, applied it to several polarized cells and tested to see an increase in the dielectric anisotropy and in turn a reduction of the Freedericksz Transition Voltage in the liquid crystal cell. Through the support of the SPS national organization {{and the use of the}} UCCS Liquid Crystal Research Lab, it was shown that the use of the ferroelectric nanoparticle, BaTiO 3, while suspended in a liquid crystal matrix shows a significant increase in the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal cell. Background One of the most common applications of liquid crystals is their use in liquid crystal displays. The structure of the simplest one is shown in Figure 1. In normal state, light goes through a polarizer, a twisted liquid crystal cell, a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> and an RGB filter and comes to a viewer’s eye (Figure 1, top).

40|$|Traditionally, birefringent, double refracting {{crystals}} and, more commonly, sheet polarizers {{based on}} oriented polymers comprising dichroic additives are employed to generate linearly polarised light. Nowadays, these sheet polarizers {{are widely used}} in flat panel displays where they serve a dual purpose; a first polarizer is used to generate linearly polarised light and a <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> (analyser) generates visual perception of the switching of the polarisation direction of the light by electro-optical cells containing a twisted nematic or super twisted nematic material. A dichroic polarizer which generates perfectly, linearly polarised light absorbs at least {{fifty percent of the}} incident, unpolarized light and this light is transferred into thermal energy. Consequently, the brightness of flat panel displays is limited by the polarizers and the polarizers exhibit excessive heating when used in combination with high intensity light sources (e. g. in projection displays). These limitations of dichroic polarizers have triggered an extensive research effort into new optical components to produce linearly polarised light. Here we introduce uniaxially oriented, polymer blend sheet-polarisers that allow for the generation and analysis of polarised light through anisotropic scattering. By proper selection of materials and processing conditions, phase-segregated polymer blends are produced in which the refractive index of the dispersed phase matches the ordinary refractive index perpendicular to the orientation direction of a birefringent continuous phase, while, simultaneously, a large mismatch exists between the refractive indices parallel to that orientation direction. The refractive index mismatch leads to a scattering of light polarized in this direction and an opaque (white) appearance. The other polarization direction encounters equal refractive indices between the two phases and will therefore be transmitted resulting in a transparent appearance. Thus polarizers are produced based on the selective scattering of one polarization direction with contrast ratios exceeding 1750 in direct transmittance; which, in specific configurations, allow for the recycling of the unwanted (scattered) polarization direction to enhance the efficiency to produce linearly polarized light...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} optical changes {{associated with}} crustacean nerve stimulation using birefringent and large angle scattered light. Improved detection schemes disclosed high temporal {{structure of the}} optical signals and allowed further investigations of biophysical mechanisms responsible for such changes. Most studies of physiological activity in neuronal tissue use techniques that measure the electrical behavior or ionic permeability of the nerve, such as voltage or ion sensitive dyes injected into cells, or invasive electric recording apparatus. While these techniques provide high resolution, they are detrimental to tissue and do not easily lend themselves to clinical applications in humans. Electrical and chemical components of neural excitation evoke physical responses observed through changes in scattered and absorbed light. This method is suited for in-vivo applications. Intrinsic optical changes have shown themselves to be multifaceted in nature and point to several different physiological processes that occur with different time courses during neural excitation. Fast changes occur concomitantly with electrical events, and slow changes parallel metabolic events including changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Previous experiments with isolated crustacean nerves {{have been used to}} study the biophysical mechanisms of fast optical changes. However, they have been confounded by multiple superimposed action potentials which make it difficult to discriminate the temporal signatures of individual optical responses. Often many averages were needed to adequately resolve the signal. More recently, optical signals have been observed in single trials. Initially large angle scattering measurements were used to record these events with much of the signal coming from cellular swelling associated with water influx during activation. By exploiting the birefringent properties derived from the molecular stiucture of nerve membranes, signals appear larger with a greater contrast, but direct comparison of birefringent and 90 {sup o} scattering signals has not been reported. New developments in computer and optical technology allow optical recording with higher temporal resolution than could be achieved previously. This has led us to undertake more detailed studies of the biophysical mechanisms underlying these transient changes. Optimization of this technology in conjunction with other technical developments presents a path to noninvasive dynamic clinical observation of optical responses. To conduct these optical recordings, we placed dissected leg, claw and ventral cord nerves from crayfish and lobster in a recording chamber constructed from black Delrin. The chamber consisted of several wells situated perpendicularly to the long axis of the nerve that could beelectrically isolated for stimulating and recording electrical activation, and a window in the center for optical measurements. To measure the birefringence from the nerve, light from a 120 W halogen bulb was focused onto the nerve from below the window through a 10 X microscope objective and polarized at a 45 degree angle with respect to the long axis of the nerve bundle. A <b>second</b> <b>polarizer</b> turned 90 degrees with respect to the first polarizer was placed on top of the chamber and excluded direct source illumination, passing only birefringent light from the nerve. A large area photodiode placed directly on top of the polarizer detected the magnitude of the birefringent light. To measure light scattered 90 degrees by the nerve, a short length of image conduit placed perpendicularly to the nerve directed large angle scattered light from the nerve to a second photodiode. The output of each photodiode was amplified by a first stage amplifier which produced a DC level output, and was coupled to an AC amplifier (0. 3 Hz High Pass) with a gain of 1000 to optimally record changes across time...|$|E
