40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of sulphur feed content on <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> and excretion by pig. The sulphur content of 76 different feedstuffs commonly used to formulate pig diets was evaluated from INRA‐AFZ database. Total sulphur content varied between 0. 5 and 15. 3 g S/kg dry matter. For most of the feedstuffs, protein sulphur contributed to most of the sulphur content. However, inorganic sulphur was also found at a high level in some feedstuffs, especially in by‐products from industrial process. In vivo experiments were conducted on fattening pigs individually housed in metabolic cages for collection of excreta. Eleven experimental diets, mainly based on wheat and on soybean meal, were compared. They differed by their protein content and the incorporation of feedstuffs with different total sulphur content (wheat, dried distiller’s grains with solubles, sugar beet pulp or rapeseed meal). Sulphur supply varied between 3. 1 and 8. 3 g S/pig/day. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> by animals was not affected by the diet and amounted to 1. 1 g S/pig/day on average. Sulphur excretion was highly affected by the diet and varied from 1. 5 to 6. 9 g/pig/day. Sulphur digestibility was 79 % on average and urinary sulphur excretion represented 55 % of intake. Sulphur was excreted as 100 % sulphate speciation form in urine, 50 % in faeces and 90 % in slurry. The results from this study indicate the feed composition may have a marked effect on sulphur excretion, with a specific contribution of some feedstuffs with high inorganic sulphur content...|$|E

The SO 2 concentration is 3696  mg/N m 3 at the bed temperature of 950  °C. It is mainly because, at low temperature, the self-desulphurization efficiency by the alkali metal in the fuel {{is higher than}} the sulphur release with the increase of temperature. On the contrary, at the higher bed temperature, the <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> rate will decrease because of the decomposition of sulphate while the sulphur release rate increases.

40|$|Reducing SO 2 {{emission}} {{from power}} plants {{is one of}} the main issues for the environmental protection. One of the advantages of the CFB combustion technology of coal is in situ SO 2 capture by added sorbents, usually uncalcined limestone (CaCO 3). In this theoretical study effects of operational parameters such as sorbent particle diameter, Ca/S molar ratio and superficial velocity on SO 2 emission have been estimated using a previously developed dynamic 2 D model for CFBCs. In the model, the unreacted shrinking core model has been adopted for desulphurization. As a result of this study; it is observed that operational bed velocity has positive effect on SO 2 emission.

40|$|Sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants in five Swedish pulp and paper mills has been burned together with wood in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. The sludge was either mechanically dewatered or pre-dried. The mechanically dewatered sludge had to be fed with a pump, but the pre-dried sludge could be fed by the fuel feed system normally used for coal, wood chips or wood pellets. In parallel to the combustion tests in the CFB boiler the sludges were also investigated as single fuels in a small laboratory FB. The Swedish {{pulp and paper industry}} produces three major fractions of sludge: pure fibre sludge, sludge produced by employing a precipitation species like ironaluminiumsulphate, and finally, sludge subjected to biological cleaning. The way of production of the sludge influences its content of, for example, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine, but the composition of the sludge is also influenced by the pulp and paper process. The present measurements show that the concentrations of nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine in the sludge have a great impact on the corresponding gaseous emissions from combustion. Actions to prevent these emissions could be necessary, depending on the origin of the sludge and treatment process used. In the present project all sludges were burned with wood-pellets as the main fuel under identical operating conditions, typical for a CFB boiler. Wood pellets were chosen as a well defined, low-polluting fuel that makes comparison of emissions from the sludges clear. Co-combustion with wood-pellets has the advantage of enabling operation also with wet sludges that cannot be used as single fuels without pre-drying. No actions were taken to improve <b>sulphur</b> and chlorine <b>retention,</b> by for example adding limestone. From a combustion point of view the co-combustion works well with low levels of carbon monoxide present in the flue gas and no light hydrocarbons...|$|R

The <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> capacity results showed the superior performance of the iron oxide/SBA- 15 composite (401 mg S g 1 Fe 2 O 3) {{in comparison with the}} zinc oxide/SBA- 15 composite (53 mg S g 1 ZnO), both these sorbents being much more efficient than the commercial sorbent (6 mg S g 1 ZnO). The different sorption behaviour was discussed in terms {{of the nature of the}} nanocomposites where: (i) the mesostructure of the support was retained with a high surface area and pore volume; (ii) the zinc oxide phase was incorporated inside the SBA- 15 channels as a thin amorphous homogeneous layer while the iron oxide was dispersed in form of small maghemite crystallites; and (iii) significant interactions occurred between the silica matrix and the zinc oxide phase. Remarkable differences in the regeneration behaviour of the exhaust sorbents were revealed by temperature-programmed experiments under an oxidizing atmosphere. After regeneration, the sorption properties of the zinc oxide/SBA- 15 composite appeared to be enhanced compared to the commercial sorbent. Incomplete recovery of the sorption activity was observed for the regenerated iron oxide/SBA- 15 sorbent, whose performance remained far better than that of the ZnO-based one, either fresh or regenerated. In view of its higher <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> capacity and appropriate regeneration temperature (T # 350 C), the iron oxide/SBA- 15 composite is a promising material for the design of advanced sorbents for a thermally efficient H 2 S removal process from hot gas streams...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. Sulphur dioxide (S 02) is an {{atmospheric}} pollutant {{that has the}} ability to negatively impact on local vegetation, farming activities and human health. South Africa's coal fired power stations release this pollutant into the atmosphere during the combustion of coal. Current coal fired power stations operating in South Africa are not required to install any form of S 02 removal equipment however, the new Air Quality Act to be implemented in South Africa could change this situation. The use of Fluidised Bed Technology with the addition of limestone or dolomite (sorbent) {{has the ability to}} absorb and convert S 02 from a gaseous phase into a solid phase for easy disposal. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate potential commercial sorbent sources in South Africa that could potentially be used for the reduction of S 02 released into the atmosphere during fluidised bed combustion of coal. Eight commercially mined sorbents within a two hundred kilometre radius of large economically mineable coalfields were selected. The study was divided into two parts in order to identify any possible links between the physical and chemical composition of the sorbents and their performance under fluidised bed combustion conditions. In Part 1, the chemical composition of the sorbents was determined by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. The sorbents hardness property was determined by Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) testing. The physical structure of the sorbent was analysed by both Petrographical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of the original/parent sorbents. In Part 2, S 02 absorption capability by the sorbents was determined through batch tests conducted in a 1. 6 m high stainless steel, 10 kW electrically heated Atmospheric Fluidised Bed Reactor (AFBR). Three different bed temperatures (800, 850 and 900 °C) and three different particle size ranges (425 - 500, 600 - 710 and 850 -lOOOllm) were tested for each of the eight sorbents. The highest Maximum <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Retention</b> for all of the sorbents was found to occur at a temperature of 850 °C and at the smallest particle size tested, 425 - 500 llm. The best desulphurisation sorbent of the eight sorbents tested was found to be Sorb 1 with a S 02 Maximum <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Retention</b> of 92. 30 % and a Removal Efficiency of 84. 54 %. Additional tests were also performed on the sorbents to get a better understanding of their desulphurisation ability. For the area calculation on the performance test graphs, it was found that the sorbent that produced the best S 02 removal efficiency was not necessarily the sorbent that had the highest maximum <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention.</b> For varying quantities of sorbent added to the AFBR, it was found that each sorbent had an optimum quantity that produced the best removal efficiency. However, for desulphurisation beyond certain limits any further increase in the amount of sorbent added to the AFBR resulted only in a marginal increase in the sorbent's S 02 removal. The calcium and magnesium composition of the sorbents was found to have no noticeable influence on the sorbents ability to reduce S 02. The silica and inherent moisture content of the sorbent showed signs whereby an increase in their compositions produced an increase in desulphurisation. The Hardgrove Grindability Index of the sorbents indicated that the softer the sorbent, the better the S 02 reduction. The petrographical analysis performed on the eight sorbents showed no obvious reason for the difference between the sorbents ability to remove S 02...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOxy-fuel {{combustion}} {{consists in}} burning a fuel {{with a mixture}} of nearly pure oxygen and a CO 2 -rich recycled flue gas resulting in a product flue gas from the boiler containing mainly CO 2 and H 2 O. In this work, the effect of combustion temperature and flue gas recycle composition on pollutant emissions and on the sulfation process, in order to optimize the SO 2 retention in circulating fluidized beds (CFBC), were analyzed. The experimental work was carried out with an anthracite coal in a 3 kWth continuous bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) combustor operating in oxy-fuel conditions. It was found that in oxy-combustion conditions in BFB an increase of combustor temperature produced an increase on NO emission and a decrease in the CO and N 2 O emissions. The optimum temperature to reach the highest <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> was at 900 - 925 °C. Flue gas recirculation was simulated by mixing different gases (CO 2, SO 2, NO, and steam) in different concentrations. It was observed that SO 2 recycle produced an increase on the sulfur retention {{as a consequence of the}} higher SO 2 concentration existing in the bed. About 65 % of the recycled NO was reduced to N 2, being the NO converted to N 2 O lower than 5 vol. %. Wet recycle produced an important reduction on NO emission in comparison with dry recycle...|$|E

Thermal conversion efficiencies, the retention of sulphur and the conversion of fuel nitrogen to NH 3 were determined fbr various oxygen-to-carbon ratios (equivalence ratios between 0. 58 and 0. 82), with and without limestone in the bed. The conversion efficiency increased with increasing equivalence ratio, while the conversion of fuel-nitrogen to NH 3 decreased with increasing equivalence ratio. The sulphur conversion without the addition of limestone increased with increasing equivalence ratio. As expected, the presence of limestone in the bed led to increased <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention,</b> more so at {{the high and low}} ends than at intermediate values of the range Of equivalence ratios. In addition, limestone adversely affected thermal conversion efficiency and increased the conversion of fuel-nitrogen. The low calorific value (LCV) fuel gas, produced by the AFBG, was combusted in a cyclone combustor at atmospheric pressure. Stable combustion of the LCV fuel gas was possible down to a calorific value of 1. 57 MJ/m(n) (3). The combustion efficiency in the atmospheric topping combustor varied between 98. 72 and 99. 96 %.

40|$|As {{a result}} of 27 series of tests, it was {{concluded}} that the maximum reduction of NOx emissions occurred when the <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> was also at its highest, so emphasising the important role that CaSO 4 plays as a catalyst in pollution-reducing reactions. Although the minimal emissions of both SO 2 and NOx (at 85 and 45 ppm, respectively) presently recorded occurred at a bed temperature of 800 Â°C, under two-stage combustion and a low oxygen-in-the-flue concentration (= 2 %), the combustion efficiency under these conditions was relatively low (at 72 Â· 9 % without limestone and 84 Â· 5 % with limestone added to the fluidised bed). Optimal conditions for achieving maximum combustion efficiency and minimum pollutant emission occurred at the highest bed-temperature (= 1000 Â°C) employed, under two-stage combustion conditions for a moderately high (~ 4 %) oxygen-in-the-flue concentration. Under these conditions, the CaS, formed from the lime in the substoichiometric bed, was completely oxidised to CaSO 4 by the moderately high O 2 concentrations in the freeboard, so optimising the reductions of both the NOx and SO 2 emissions. The addition of limestone was found to increase the combustion efficiency by just under 3 %, to a maximum of 91 Â· 3 %, under these conditions. Further, the presence of limestone (which gave an added Ca:S mole ratio of 2), resulted in reductions in the NOx emissions of 83 % (i. e. from 283 to 47 ppm) and in the SO 2 emission of 74 % (i. e. from 455 to 117 ppm). Both the NOx and SO 2 emissions were greatly reduced by this addition of limestone, under most operating conditions. The magnitude of the reduction varied according to the bed's temperature, e. g. at a bed temperature of 800 Â°C, under two-stage conditions, the NOx emissions were reduced by 71 % and teh SO 2 emission by 76 %, provided sufficient limestone was added to the bed to give a 2 : 1 Ca:S ratio. Similarly, the use of recycled gas, to achieve bed attemperation during these tests, led not only to a reduction in the NOx emissions of 33 %, compared with only 15 % achieved in previous experiments, but also to a 26 % reduction in the SO 2 emission. The latter was {{a direct result of the}} increased residence time for SO 2 gas in the contact with the limestone/ash particles within the combustor. When burning S. A. Duff with: (i) the exhaust-gas recycled back to the bed; (ii) limestone added to the bed (to give a Ca:S mole ratio of 2); and (iii) the fluidised bed operated at a relatively high bed-temperature (~ 1000 Â°C) under two-stage combustion conditions with a 4 % concentration of O 2 -in-the-flue; then a 90 % overall reduction in NOx emissions (compared with those occurring under oxidising conditions with no limestone added) and a <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> of 74 % were achieved. Larger sulphur retentions ensued by reducing the bed temperature to 800 Â°C and using lower oxygen-in-the-flue concentrations (~ 2 %), but this occurred to the detriment of the combustion efficiency. Nevertheless, the lower bed-temperature of ~ 800 Â°C was needed to avoid the formation of clinker when burning a low-ash fusion coal, such as Maryport smalls. By contrast, the use of a high bed-temperature (~ 1000 Â°C) with low values of the oxygen-in-the-flue concentration, resulted in no sulphur retention; all the CaS being partially oxidised to SO 2 under these operating conditions, with or without limestone present. ...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{experienced}} {{with the land}} fill disposal of highly corrosive acid tar wastes mean that alternative, less environmentally damaging methods of disposal must be employed. The incineration of acid tars, although possessing several advantages over landfill disposal, can lead to unacceptably high SO 2 -emission concentrations in the flue gases unless precautions are taken. However, such incinerations have been achieved successfully in the present tests with a two-stage fluidised-bed combustor: the attained combustion efficiencies were high (at around 99 %). The use of a fluidised-bed combustor for burning acid tar requires that limestone {{be added to the}} bed material in order to provide some degree of sulphur capture. The sensitivity of the SO 2 emission to the limestone concentration (as indicated by the Ca: S mole ratio) fell as the Ca: S ratio was increased. At a Ca: S mole ratio of 4 : 1, 91 % <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> was achieved. During this test, 340 kg/h acid tar was pumped into the bed and burnt there successfully with 98 kg/h coal: the bed's temperature and height, and the excess oxygen-in-flue concentration were kept constant. Ultimately, average SO 2 emission-levels (in the flue gas) of around 417 ppm were thereby achieved; i. e., well below the 600 ppm SO 2 -emission limit stipulated by the Commission of the European Communities. Nevertheless, the fluctuations in the SO 2 emissions meant that a slightly higher Ca: S ratio of 5 : 1 was recommended {{in order to ensure that}} the emission levels were consistently below the required limit, i. e., such that 97 % of all the mean 48 -hourly values would not exceed 110 % of the stipulated emission limit. ...|$|E

None of the patients studied had an increase in the nonprotein nitrogen in the blood. It has been shown that these patients do well on a high protein diet and that they may lose their edema under such conditions. When treated with such a diet they retain large quantities of nitrogen even when given in the form of crystalline urea (1).

This paper {{is focused on the}} analysis of fuel-N emissions in fluidized bed combustion systems. Experiments were carried out in a bubbling fluidized bed unit in the temperature interval 850 - 950 ºC. Different coals (anthracite, bituminous and lignite) were used as fuels and different sorbents were employed for in-bed <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention.</b> In the experiments, NO, N 2 O and NO 2 were measured. NO 2 was not detected in any of the operating conditions. The influence of temperature on NO and N 2 O emissions was the same as in conventional combustion: NO emission increased as temperature increased while N 2 O emission decreased. Nevertheless, the total fuel-N conversion to nitrogenous species seemed to be lower than in combustion with air. As in air-firing combustion, the highest levels of NO and N 2 O were registered with the highest rank coals. The Ca-sorbent was found to have a key role on NO reduction via catalytic reaction and this catalytic effect seemed not to be affected by the high CO 2 levels present in oxy-fuel combustion. Also, the moisture content in the coal affected the NO formation, which decreased 2 with an increase in the coal moisture content. A similar effect was observed by increasing the oxygen concentration fed to the combustor.

40|$|In-situ Gasification Chemical-Looping Combustion (iG-CLC) burning coal is {{achieving}} a great interest {{due to the}} possibility of using low cost oxygen carriers such as CaSO 4. The Limestone Chemical Looping Combustion process (LCL-CTM) registered by Alstom Power Inc. proposes the use of a continuous CaCO 3 feeding together with coal to produce CaSO 4 as an oxygen carrier via <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention.</b> The operation is similar to what happens in a circulating fluidized bed boiler burning coal. In the present research work, the study of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations together with mass and enthalpy balances have been carried out for a CLC system in order to investigate whether the LCL-CTM process is a promising and energy efficient option to carry out the coal combustion with CO 2 capture and in-situ desulphurisation. So, no limitations were found to transfer the required oxygen from air to fuel using sulphated limestone as oxygen carrier for whatever coal used. However, coals with sulphur content above 1 wt. % are advisable to perform this process. In addition, no drawback referred to thermal integration in the system has been detected. Thus, operation at 950 ºC in the fuel reactor to avoid SO 2 release via side reactions, and 1000 ºC in the air reactor is feasible. Likewise, experimental tests have been performed in a thermogravimetric analyser to analyse the capability of a limestone to be sulphated and to transfer oxygen. A value of the oxygen transport capacity of about 16. 7 wt. % was obtained. This value is four times higher than that of others typical inexpensive oxygen carriers published in literature.

Increased amount of sulphur in manure {{can result in}} toxicity and odour problems during storage as well as potential inhibition problems in case of anaerobic digestion treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the behaviour of different sulphur feed contents on pig excretion via faeces and urine, to evaluate the speciation of sulphur forms excreted and to determine further behaviour of sulphur in pig slurry during anaerobic storage. The sulphurs content of 76 different raw materials usually used to formulate pig feeding diets was measured and classified. Total sulphurs content varied between 0. 5 to 10 gS. kg- 1 of dry material. For most of these raw materials, total sulphur content was correlated with sulphur amino acid composition. Then, two experiments were conducted with ﬁnishing castrated male pigs (n= 10; n= 20) randomized and individually housed in metabolic cages which allowed precise control for feed alimentation and excretion collection. Ten experimental diets based on wheat and on soybean meal were compared. They differed by the incorporation of different raw materials with different total S content (wheat malt, beets pulp or rapeseed meal). Total crude protein content for all formulations tested varied between 16. 5 and 20 %. Trials were realised during 20 days with 10 days dedicated for new feed adaptation followed by 10 days when urine and faeces were individually collected. At the end of the experimental procedure, the feed, faeces and urine collected for each studied pig were analysed for total solids, volatile solids, total sulphur and sulphate. Feed sulphur content varied between 1. 6 and 4. 1 g. kg- 1 of total solids. For all experiments, <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention</b> by animals was close to 25 % of the total ingested S whereas 75 % was excreted. Sulphurs were excreted as 100 % sulphate speciation form in urine and 50 % sulphate in faeces. With this dataset, sulphurs concentrations as sulphates in fresh pig slurries were determined and ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 7 gS. kg- 1 depending on the feed formulation. Behaviour of sulphate content of fresh pig slurry was studied with spiking raw pig slurry with different amounts of sulphate (0 to 2 gS. kg- 1) and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids). Kinetics of sulphate consumption and sulphide apparition were measured. In anaerobic storage condition of pig's slurries, added sulphate was consumed within 3 weeks by a first order kinetics reaction to form solely sulphides.

40|$|The {{circulating}} {{fluidized bed}} (CFB) boiler {{is suitable for}} combustion of fuels with strong heterogeneity and/or with high sulphur content, such as biomass, municipal solid waste and coal with high content of sulphur. Further development of new boilers is ongoing and demands investigation of the complex phenomena governing CFB boilers. A method for modelling CFB boilers are macroscopic models, which are, to a varying extent, based on experimental data. A comprehensive macroscopic model considers fluid dynamics, combustion and heat transfer, but in this thesis only fluid dynamics is considered. In focus is modelling of vertical solids distribution in the riser, critical for heat transfer, corrosion and <b>sulphur</b> <b>retention.</b> Experimental data of solids concentration, through measurements of pressure differ-ences, has been obtained from a down-scaled cold model of a 125 MWe CFB boiler. The model was built in collaboration between BHEL and IIT Madras. Due to severe leakages in the model {{it was not possible}} to conduct any experiments with copper as bed material, which was necessary to simulate the boiler. However, experiments with silica sand were performed, but its larger particle size introduced problems since its particle terminal velocity is considerable higher than copper, which the capacity of the fan was dimensioned for. This implied very low recirculation. From experimental data a relation between superficial gas velocity and vertical solids concentration profile in splash zone can be observed. It is also evident that two solids decay constants is necessary to describe the profile. However, models available in literature give a poor prediction of the solids concentration in the investigated unit. Measured data from the bottom bed scatter much and the solids concentration in the transport zone is low, which make it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding these zones. Fluid dynamic models for different zones in a CFB are combined into one model for the entire CFB loop. The model describing the riser is validated against Turow 235 MWe and Zibo 135 MWe. The data from Zibo was fitting available model with two decay constants well. The 125 MWe BHEL boiler is modeled, but due to lack of data for validation purposes and more detailed bed material properties, it is difficult to conduct a proper modelling. In general it is concluded that a model with two decay constants is necessary to describe vertical solids distribution in a CFB unit and that further studies of the top solids concentration (or the fraction of cluster phase at the bottom bed surface) is needed to increase the usefulness of the model. Another conclusion drawn is that differences between different model predictions and experimental data are large and that more studies of vertical solids concentration, including units with non constant cross-sectional area is needed.
