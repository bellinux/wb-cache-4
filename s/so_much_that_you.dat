The song's official remix features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe, while rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri also recorded a remix to the song. While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You". Regarding the lyrics, Rihanna said, [...] "When you're {{in love with}} someone, even though they keep hurting you, you're so naive and you love them <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> put all the negative behind even though you keep getting hurt." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Loving You No More" [...] first leaked {{under the}} title [...] "Hurt" [...] on November 13, 2009. After being {{announced}} as the second single from Last Train to Paris on August 26, 2010, the mastered version of the song was leaked. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the meaning behind the song, commenting, [...] "The concept of the song is about when you love somebody <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> forget about yourself. You love them more than you love yourself." [...] The song's official remix, released on October 22, 2010, features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe. Producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri also remixed the song with rap vocals from him, which was unveiled on September 29, 2010. The group performed the song on one occasion, during their takeover of 106 & Park to promote the album, on December 16, 2010.|$|E
500|$|The single, [...] "Say I", is an {{inspirational}} and motivational record; Milian {{wanted to make}} a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was [...] "way more an urban record than anything I've ever done." [...] The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was [...] "a very real message. It pertained to his life." [...] The track, [...] "Twisted", {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking someone <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> [...] "can't even go about [...] day in a normal way". Milian compared the urban vibe of both tracks and said they were huge records, [...] "where the music is just big and the hook is just big and you can’t help but sing [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy {{claimed that}} [...] " [...] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical {{attitude}} can't ignore {{the truth of}} the situation they're all in." [...] Perry defined the role as [...] "someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." [...] Her casting was assessed by Perry as [...] "full of energy" [...] and [...] "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [...] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't understand why she is the way she is." [...] Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of [...] ) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly.

500|$|... "Zooropa" [...] is set amongst neon {{signs of}} a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song's introduction, {{background}} voices ask, [...] "What do you want?" [...] In response to the question, the lyrics {{in the first three}} verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, [...] "Better by design", [...] "Be all that you can be", and [...] "Vorsprung durch technik". Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to [...] "signify the emptiness of modern, godless life". In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / And I have no map". [...] "Babyface" [...] is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. [...] "Lemon", inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, [...] "A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close". The lyrics to [...] "Numb" [...] are a series of [...] "don't" [...] commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, [...] "that sense that you were getting bombarded with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
