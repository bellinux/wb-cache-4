Consideration is given to both theoretical and practical insights into {{the relative merits of}} competitive tendering and negotiation approaches in such situations. The limited literature on the topic is reviewed and insights and lessons identified.

Executives in these industries consider process acquisition to be a critical phase in implementing the firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive strategy.;The acquisition of a {{process technology}} or physical facility requires the firm to perform a series of technical activities of Process Research, Process Development and Process Manufacture. The existing management literature views the firm as having the option of performing any number of these activities internally or via a <b>supplier</b> <b>market.</b> The particular combination {{can be viewed as}} the facility or process acquisition mode used by the firm and expresses relative dependence of the firm on the <b>supplier</b> <b>market</b> as opposed to its own internal resources to acquire process technology.;This research accepts the basic notions expressed in the literature and tries to expand on them by asking and answering some fundamental questions: (1) Does the range of acquisition activities recognized by the literature fit the practice framework of managers? (2) How do firms depend on their own resources, the <b>supplier</b> <b>market</b> and their parent companies to acquire process technology? (3) What factors can be used to explain the pattern of dependence demonstrated by firms?;The research generated some specific propositions that were tested using data generated on the Canadian Petroleum Refining Industry. The research methodology involved in depth, semi-structured interviews with seventeen executives in the industry. Data were collected in six firms and on fifteen different acquisition cases.;The results of the research show that managers recognize a larger range of technical activities in practice than exists in theory and that the range varies as between new technology generation and acquisition of existing technology. The results further showed that firms use a limited number of acquisition modes and that they tend to delegate activities, whose outcome is more certain, to the supplier industry. There was limited dependence on parent companies. Futhermore, the results show that the pattern of dependence on the three technology sources [...] Internal, Suppliers, Parents [...] can be explained by three factors: (1) how far downstream from research the activity is located, (2) how innovative is the facility or process technology and (3) how strong the firm (subsidiary) is technologically...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - In {{the current}} customer-centred {{business}} environment, organisations are adopting market-oriented behaviour {{in an effort}} to enhance their value creation and delivery capabilities. This study seeks to investigate whether <b>supplier</b> <b>market</b> orientation leads to the creation of superior supplier perceived value and organisational performance. It is contended that supplier perceived value creation mediates the relationship between market orientation and business performance. Design/methodology/approach - A model was developed that places supplier perceived value creation as a mediator of the relationship between market orientation and business performance. The model was tested using structural equation modelling on 244 fresh produce suppliers interviewed in face-to-face interviews. Findings - The results indicate that, whilst customer orientation enhances supplier perceived value creation, competitor orientation and interfunctional coordination were negatively associated with it. Supplier perceived value creation had a mediating effect on the link between market orientation and business performance. Additionally, supplier perceived value creation had a negative effect on financial performance, but was positively related to marketing performance. Practical implications - The study indicates that not all market orientation components lead to positive effects on business performance. For some organisations market orientation can actually reduce business performance. Thus managers should specifically be careful to implement customer orientation as a way of enhancing business performance as the costs may outweigh the benefits. Originality/value - Limited work has investigated the role of supplier perceived value creation and research has called for empirical work on mediators of the market orientation-business performance link.

40|$|We {{simulate}} competitive benchmark {{wholesale prices}} for electricity in California {{during the summer}} of 2000, taking account of changes in gas prices, demand, and imports during this time period. We also examine the impact of changes in the prices of NOx emissions permits on the competitive benchmark prices for electricity. The competitive benchmark prices are compared to actual prices. A significant fraction of the changes in wholesale electricity prices in California during Summer 2000 can be explained by these four factors. The impact of higher NOx permit prices, and their interaction with reduced imports into California, have a particularly large impact on competitive benchmark prices. However, during June, July and August a large unexplained difference between actual prices and competitive benchmark prices remains. We attribute this difference to <b>supplier</b> <b>market</b> power and related market imperfections. We then examine whether there is evidence of strategic behavior by suppliers during the highest priced hours during the summer.

40|$|This Article {{calls for}} a {{move to a new}} phase in courts’ attitudes toward {{consumer}} contracts. Currently, courts applying the unconscionability doctrine to consumer contracts focus on the characteristics of the parties and the transaction. We suggest that rather than examining each consumer contract in isolation, courts should inquire whether there is competition, or potential competition, over contracts in the <b>supplier’s</b> <b>market.</b> As we show, competition over contracts is different from competition over products or services. In order to assess the degree of competition, or potential competition, over contracts, courts should look at the particular features of the <b>supplier’s</b> <b>market</b> identified in this Article, as well as examine the potential strategic interaction among competitors. We argue that when competition, or the threat of such competition, over consumer contracts is sufficiently strong, these contracts should be deemed efficient and fair, and courts should not strike down clauses incorporated into such contracts. Interestingly, and counterintuitively, this conclusion holds even when consumers are uninformed. We offer workable guidelines for courts as to how they could implement the market-based approach proposed in this Article and demonstrate how this approach could produce outcomes opposite to, but fairer and more efficient, than the ones courts conventionally adopt or legal scholars offer. We also identify oppressive techniques suppliers employ in their contracts with consumers that are currently ignored completely by courts and are expected to survive even vigorous competition over contracts. We suggest that courts should be particularly suspicious of such oppressive techniques and scrutinize them with special care...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a price-theoretic model of integration decisions {{and show that}} these choices may adversely affect consumers, {{even in the absence}} of monopoly power in supply and product markets. Integration is costly to implement but is effective at coordinating production decisions. The price of output helps to determine the organizational form chosen: there is an inverted-U relation between the degree of integration and product prices. Moreover, organizational choices affect output: integration is more productive than non-integration at low prices, and less productive at high prices. Since shocks to industries affect product prices, reorganizations are likely to take place in coordinated fashion and be industry specific, consistent with the evidence. Since the price range in which integration maximizes productivity generally differs from the one in which it maximizes managerial welfare, organizational choices will often be second-best inefficient. We show that there are instances in which entry of low-cost suppliers can hurt consumers by changing the terms of trade in the <b>supplier</b> <b>market,</b> thereby inducing reorganizations that raise prices. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Protection of {{intellectual}} property rights is a vital aspect for the future automotive <b>supplier</b> <b>market,</b> in particular for the aftersales market for ECUs. Computer security can deliver the required protection mechanisms and sustain the according business models. We propose an approach to facilitate the rigorous checking of components for originality in a vehicle. In our system model, a security controller receives special messages (i. e., the authenticity heartbeat signal) from relevant ECUs and it performs subsequent authentication and plausibility checks. As a result, the security controller can tell, if the current setup of components in the vehicle is original. We evaluate our authentication architecture for the Battery Management System (BMS) of a hybrid car. Here, the security controller detects reliably, if the BMS is an original component, and whether an attacker has modified the operational limits of the battery. In this paper, we reason that an effective copy protection scheme needs to fuse relevant information from different sources. Therefore, various security techniques have to be combined in a sound architectural approach. The distinctive feature of our architecture is that it takes into account application–specific knowledge of the real–time entities under control. I...|$|E
