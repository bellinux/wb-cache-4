5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E

The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields.

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E
5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> straw.|$|E

40|$|The {{microcrystalline}} cellulose {{is an important}} ingredient in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. In this study, the {{microcrystalline cellulose}}, obtained from the <b>stalk</b> <b>of</b> Sorghum caudatum was evaluated for its physical and tableting characteristics {{with a view to}} assessing its usefulness in pharmaceutical tableting. The microcrystalline cellulose, obtained from the <b>stalk</b> <b>of</b> Sorghum caudatum, obtained by sodium hydroxide delignification followed by sodium hypochlorite bleaching and acid hydrolysis was examined for its physicochemical and tableting properties in comparison with those of the well-known commercial microcrystalline cellulose grade, Avicel PH 101. The extraction yield of this microcrystalline cellulose, obtained from the <b>stalk</b> <b>of</b> Sorghum caudatum was approximately 19 %. The cellulose material was composed of irregularly shaped fibrous cellulose particles and had a moisture content of 6. 2 % and total ash of 0. 28 %. The true density was 1. 46. The flow indices showed that the microcrystalline cellulose, obtained from the <b>stalk</b> <b>of</b> Sorghum caudatum flowed poorly. The hydration, swelling and moisture sorption capacities were 3. 9, 85 and 24 %, respectively. Tablets resulting from these cellulose materials were found to be without surface defects, sufficiently hard and having disintegration time within 15 min.

25|$|This apogamous {{reproduction}} {{is thought to}} account for the formation of the one suspected hybrid descendant of A.×trudellii. This specimen was collected in 1961 on a sandstone cliff at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park, and identified as A.pinnatifidum ×trudellii. This was hypothesized to be a pentaploid formed from spores of A.pinnatifidum and apogamous triploid spores of A.×trudellii, but this was not cytologically verified. The presumed hybrid has oblong pinnae, on <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> intermediate length between its two parents. They are more widely spaced on the frond than in either parent.|$|E

25|$|Sciarid flies {{are common}} pests of {{mushroom}} houses and of plants grown in protected culture, for example herbs, where the warm and moist conditions favour their rapid development. In commercial mushroom houses, sciarid fly larvae tunnel into the <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> the mushrooms, and feeding damage can sever developing mycelium, causing mushrooms to become brown and leathery. Their faeces may also prevent the mycelium from colonising the casing layer, severely reducing yields. As a pest of plants, sciarid larvae {{feed on the}} root system. In both industries, adult sciarid flies are a nuisance pest that can result in crop rejection if high numbers {{are present in the}} growing area.|$|E
25|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NORstains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NORstaining highlights the satellites and <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> acrocentric chromosomes.|$|E
