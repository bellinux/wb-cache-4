25|$|Israeli {{occupation}} of southern Lebanon took place after Israel invaded Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War and subsequently retained its forces {{to support the}} Christian South Lebanon Army in Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and allied Free Lebanon Army Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon, including the capital of Beirut, amid the hostilities of the wider Lebanese Civil War. Later, Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between 1983 and 1985, but remained in partial control of the border region known as the South Lebanon <b>Security</b> <b>Belt,</b> initially in coordination with the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State, which executed a limited authority over portions of southern Lebanon until 1984, and later with the South Lebanon Army (transformed from Free Lebanon Army), until the year 2000.

Israel invaded Lebanon in response to Fatah attacks in Israel in March 1978, occupying most of the area south of the Litani River, and resulting in the evacuation of at least 100,000 Lebanese, as well as approximately 2,000 deaths.|$|E

However, since belt microphones are not installed on fixed positions, also a variety of drawbacks arises. The paper presents an overview about the pros and cons and shows dedicated signal enhancement schemes for this microphone type.|$|R

The ISIL operatives blew up a police station south of Samara overnight, killing several policemen, before they advanced on the city in pick-up trucks, raiding checkpoints along the way. They entered the city from the east and west and quickly captured the municipality building, university and the two largest mosques. The insurgents had reached to within 2 km from the Al-Askari Mosque, which was defended by three <b>security</b> <b>belts.</b> Militants targeted command centres near the shrine. Soon, government reinforcements were sent from Baghdad and the military managed to regain control of the city, pushing militant forces out of Samarra. 12 policemen and several civilians were killed in the fighting, while an army official claimed 80 militants also died.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{situation}} of the frequent failures of mine belt conveyor during operation, a model was used to evaluate the safety of mine belt conveyor. Based on the foundation of collecting and analyzing a large quantity of fault information of belt conveyor in the nationwide coal mine, the fault tree model of belt conveyor has been built, then the safety evaluation index system was established by analyzing and removing some secondary indicators. Furthermore, the weighted value of safety evaluation indexs was determined by analytic hierarchy process(AHP), and the single factor fuzzy evaluation matrix was constructed by experts grading method. Additionally, the model was applied in evaluating the <b>security</b> of <b>belt</b> conveyor in Nanliang coal mine. The results shows the security level is recognized to the “general”, which means that this model can be adopted widely in evaluating the safety of mine belt conveyor...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Gemayel in September 1982, Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following Israel's role in the Phalangist-perpetrated Sabra and Shatila massacre, of mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, and Israeli popular disillusionment with the war {{would lead to a}} gradual withdrawal from Beirut to the areas claimed by the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State in southern Lebanon (later to become the South Lebanon <b>security</b> <b>belt),</b> which was initiated following the 17 May Agreement and Syria's change of attitude towards the PLO. After Israeli forces withdrew from most of Lebanon, the War of the Camps broke out between Lebanese factions, the remains of the PLO and Syria, in which Syria fought its former Palestinian allies. At the same time, Shi'a militant groups began consolidating and waging a low-intensity guerrilla war over the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to 15 years of low-scale armed conflict. The Lebanese Civil War would continue until 1990, at which point Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon.|$|E

As a former Mayor and security expert, Hawkins participated in television and radio discussions of school violence and gun control in January 2013.

40|$|AbstractDORA {{stands for}} “Door to Door Information for Passengers and Airports” and targets on {{seamless}} integration of air mobility {{in the overall}} urban and regional transport systems. Integrating real time data and incident information of both transport modes in one information system the DORA closes the information gap between air transport and landside transportation. The overall goal of the DORA project activities is to optimise and reduce the total travel time, taking into account origins and final destinations of the travels {{and make sure that}} even in case of land traffic disruptions and critical situations at the airports the passengers arrive at the airport in time to complete all necessary clearance procedures before entering the plane. The DORA system is based on two innovations: A cross-modal incident management and information system to ensure the accessibility of airports at all times. This system is based on the cooperation of all transport operators to manage disturbances in the airport bound public transport system and road traffic based on pre-defined action plans and information strategies. The second pillar is a multimodal mobile information service for air passengers. This DORA app helps passengers to plan their trip to the airport, to find the shortest way in the terminals and provides passengers with the trip recommendation on how to travel from the destination airport to their final destination. The third pillar is the exploring of technologies for time efficient procedures in the terminal. Special emphasis is put on detection of waiting times at check-ins or security checks and indoor routing and navigation technologies to improve the service quality in the terminal. DORA will be a seamless solution through considering scheduled and real time services of all flight connection and urban transport modes and terminal proceedings (luggage <b>belt,</b> <b>security</b> gate, departure gates), The system will integrate services for a door-to-door journey planning, booking and ticketing for landside transport with strategic compliancy (with static and dynamic control strategies) of operator and municipalities, as well as online trip monitoring...|$|R
