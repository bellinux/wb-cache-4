Admiral d'Estaing took command of a squadron of thirteen ships {{of the line and}} four frigates in Toulon. Marseillois was assigned to this fleet, the first active service <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see.</b> The fleet set sail on 18 April 1778, crossed Gibraltar on 16 May, and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Delaware River on 8 July.|$|E
25|$|Gleason met dancer Genevieve Halford {{when they}} were working in vaudeville, and they started to date. Halford wanted to marry but Gleason {{was not ready to}} settle down. She said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> other men if they did not marry. One evening when Gleason went onstage at the Club Miami in Newark, New Jersey, he saw Halford in the front row with a date. At the end of his show, Gleason went to the table and {{proposed}} to Halford in front of her date. They were married on September 20, 1936.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met {{two days}} after the murder with family members {{representing}} Sarowar and Runi, along with their son, and she told them that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> to it that their son would educated {{and there would be no}} impunity in the couple's case and justice would be quick. The Prime Minister later criticised journalists for carrying out demonstrations and at other times praised them for raising awareness. In a widely repeated quote in connection with the case, she said the government could not protect everyone by posting a guard outside their bedrooms. She also told party members that more journalists were killed when her political opponents were in power.|$|E
60|$|If she {{had looked}} at him as he said those few words, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> what he thought of her in his face. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen,</b> {{innocent}} as he was in this world's knowledge, that he knew the priceless value, the all-ennobling virtue, of a woman who speaks the truth. But she had no courage to look at him--no courage to raise her eyes from her lap.|$|R
60|$|But if {{that was}} {{the truth of the matter}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have looked and behaved {{differently}} in court--quite differently. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have been looking for him. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> him....|$|R

25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> him at home.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Narud later reappeared in Heart of the Swarm after former UED Vice Admiral Alexei Stukov {{contacted}} Kerrigan with {{a message}} {{to seek out the}} Skygeirr Station research facility orbiting Ketill IV. Upon her arrival at the facility, Stukov explained to Kerrigan that Skygeirr housed the Dominion's primary Hybrid research and development laboratory, and that [...] "Emil Narud" [...] was actually an ancient shapeshifter in the employment of a fallen Xel'Naga named Amon. After the Zerg swarm breached the interior of the facility and began attacking the Hybrids within, Narud made his initial appearance, broadcasting a message throughout the facility to inform Kerrigan that she was not welcome in the station. After the Swarm breached the lowest level, Narud personally moved to kill Kerrigan by driving a null zone towards the Queen of Blades. When the null zone attack failed, Narud retreated inside a Xel'Naga temple dedicated to Amon. In a showdown with Kerrigan, Narud taunted the Queen of Blades by using his shapeshifting abilities – first morphing into Jim Raynor, and then into Kerrigan's own human form, in which he wounded Kerrigan with a psi blade similar to that wielded by the Protoss. Kerrigan gained the upper hand in the end, impaling Narud with her wing-spikes. With his dying breath, Narud proclaimed that Amon had been resurrected and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> him soon.|$|E

500|$|Upon Poppy's {{return in}} 2011, she and Jodie were widely {{known as a}} [...] "double act". Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury welcomed Poppy's return, observing that [...] "Walford needs all the humour it can get these days". The Daily Mail Jaci Stephen loved Poppy and Jodie's scenes: [...] "Great girls, {{excellent}} pairing and very funny. More, please!" [...] In the Daily Mirror, Jennifer Rodger called them a [...] "refreshing change", and Tony Stewart deemed them [...] "The daftest girls in Soapland and probably the funniest". Stewart {{was one of several}} critics to express displeasure over their axing, describing it as [...] "a shame". Jane Simon and Brian McIver of the Daily Record described them as [...] "an adorable female double act [...] E20's answer to 2 Shoes", and wrote of their departure, [...] "apparently there just isn't enough room for sunny, funny, glass-half-full types in Walford". The Sun Colin Robertson noted that Jodie, Poppy and Norman Simmonds (George Layton), who was axed {{at the same time as}} the duo, were EastEnders [...] "three funniest characters"; a critic writing for The Huffington Post [...] suggested that they had [...] "injected some humour into the famously gloomy soap". The Daily Mirror Rodger said that she was [...] "sad" [...] that the duo had left, saying that she [...] "found their scenes together hilarious", hoping that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> both Bright and Babbington in a new show together. Bright stated that during her main stint in 2011, she received mail telling her saying how much fans liked the double act between Poppy and Jodie, and that they were a [...] "breath of fresh air".|$|E
500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|Curt accompanies Steve, last year's {{high school}} student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop. In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a {{beautiful}} blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees {{en route to the}} dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say [...] "I love you" [...] before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing. It turns out to be [...] "The Blonde" [...] who says she knows him and maybe <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> him cruising the coming night. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided {{to go to college and}} will be leaving that morning.|$|E

2500|$|On April 29, McAllister's {{attorney}} Robert Honecker {{accompanied her}} to visit Markoff {{in jail and}} said that the couple's August 14 wedding plans were [...] "dismantled".

2500|$|In {{an article}} in Billboard {{magazine}} dated 12 July, Sony BMG Australia CEO Denis Handlin suggested that once Goodrem had finished promotional duties in the USA for Delta, attention would be shifted to the UK {{and the rest of}} Europe.

However, the album ended up not being released in the UK and Europe other than as an import or download.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his father's defeat and humiliation, Iyasu himself fled to Afar. After {{years on the}} run, Iyasu was later {{captured}} by Dejazmach Gugsa Araya Selassie, the son whom Zewditu's first husband had fathered by another woman. Gugsa Araya was rewarded with the title of Ras from his former stepmother, and with Princess Yeshashework Yilma, the niece of Tafari Makonnen, as his bride. [...] When Iyasu was captured, a tearful Empress Zewditu pleaded that he be kept in a special house {{on the grounds of}} the palace, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> to his care and he could receive religious counsel. She found Ras Tafari and Fitawrari Hapte Giorgis to be unbendingly opposed, and so gave up. She did, however, ensure that special favorite foods and a constant supply of clothing and small luxuries reached Iyasu at his place of arrest in Sellale.|$|E

2500|$|What most distressed Hobhouse was {{the sufferings}} of the undernourished children. Diseases such as measles, bronchitis, pneumonia, {{dysentery}} and typhoid had invaded the camp with fatal results. The very few tents were not enough to house {{the one or more}} sick persons, most of them children. In the collection Stemme uit die Verlede (Voices from the Past), she recalled the plight of Lizzie van Zyl (c. 1894 – 9 May 1901), the daughter of a Boer combatant who refused to surrender. The girl died at the Bloemfontein camp. According to Hobhouse, the girl was treated harshly and placed on the lowest rations. After a month, she was moved to the new hospital about 50 kilometres away from the concentration camp, suffering from starvation. Unable to speak English, she was labelled an [...] "idiot" [...] by the hospital staff, who were unable to understand her. One day she started calling for her mother. An Afrikaner woman, Mrs Botha, went over to comfort her and to tell her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> her mother again, but [...] "was brusquely interrupted by one of the nurses who told her not to interfere with the child as she was a nuisance." ...|$|E
