5|$|The goal of {{computer}} forensics is {{to explain the}} current state of a digital artifact; such as a computer system, <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> or electronic document. The discipline usually covers computers, embedded systems (digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> {{for music and}} video games. NEC {{had been the first}} to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived towards the end of that year.|$|E

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy <b>storage</b> <b>medium.</b> His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{approach is}} used in the design of a battery-supercapacitor energy storage system for a wind farm. The design exploits the technical merits of the two energy <b>storage</b> <b>mediums,</b> in terms of the differences in their specific power and energy densities, and their ability to accommodate different rates of change in the charging/discharging powers. By treating the input wind power as random and using a proposed coordinated power flows control strategy for the battery and the supercapacitor, the approach evaluates the energy storage capacities, the corresponding expected life cycle cost/year of the <b>storage</b> <b>mediums,</b> and the expected cost/year of unmet power dispatch. A computational procedure is then developed for the design of a least-cost/year hybrid energy storage system to realize wind power dispatch at a specified confidence level...|$|R

25|$|The Binson Echorec, {{another popular}} unit, used a {{rotating}} magnetic drum or disc (not entirely unlike {{those used in}} modern hard disk drives) as its <b>storage</b> <b>medium.</b> This provided an advantage over tape, as the durable drums were able to last for many years with little deterioration in the audio quality.|$|E

50|$|As {{there is}} only a fixed amount of space on a console by default, {{developers}} do still have to be mindful of the amount of space they can take up, especially if the install is compulsory.

25|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{developed}} as an electrical energy <b>storage</b> <b>medium.</b> Hydrogen is produced, then compressed or liquefied, cryogenicly stored at −252.882°C, and then converted back to electrical energy or heat.

40|$|Today {{agriculture}} {{sector has}} a big contribution {{to the development of}} economy for many countries. Irrigation is a method which supplies amount of water required in proper time to the cropped land and contributes to the increases of agriculture productivity. Using diesel pump to deliver water to the place of use causes problems both in terms of profitability and environmental perspectives. Higher price of diesel increases operation costs of diesel water pumping system thereby reducing the incomes. In addition the use of diesel pump emits a huge amount of CO 2 emissions which cause global warming. A possible solution to those problems is to use solar energy, a source of energy which is environmental friend and available for free. The main target of this thesis is to design and optimize a cost effective PVWPs considering three alternatives with tank storage, battery storage and a system without <b>storages</b> <b>medium.</b> The two areas in Eastern province of Rwanda were taken as case study to grow coffee and cassava with five hectares each. To run simulations, different tools have been used. Those includes CROPWAT to determine water requirements for two crops; MS Excel to design a PVWPs directly connected to irrigation system, make economic analysis, evaluate CO 2 emissions and calculate other parameters. Furthermore in PVsyst software the design and simulation for PVWPs with <b>storages</b> <b>medium</b> has been carried out.   Results showed that using PVWPs directly connected to irrigation system is the most profitable way when compared to the rest two alternatives.   They also showed that systems designed to irrigate coffee becomes the most profitable due to huge amount of electricity surplus and higher price per kilogram of coffee. Finally fully replacement of DWPs results in annual reduction of CO 2 emissions by 6. 6 tonnes.
