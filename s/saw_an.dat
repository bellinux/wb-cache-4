50|$|Insanity is an {{inability}} {{to come to terms}} with reality. Don Quixote was definitely insane, because he couldn't come to terms.

Where other people <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> filthy country hostel, he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> castle! Where other people <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> flock of sheep, he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> mighty army! Where other people <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> windmill, he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> dragon. Yes, Don Quixote was a crazy old fool. But, you know, he was more honest about his dream than most people, and for that, I honor him.|$|R
