The model allows us to characterize cooperation networks - networks in which each seller cooperates (by providing high quality goods) with every buyer that is connected to her. To this end, we provide conditions under which: [1] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate depend only on her beliefs with respect to her local neighborhood - a subnetwork that includes <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> and is of a size that is independent {{of the size of the}} entire network; and [2] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate can be calculated as if the network was a random tree with <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> at its root. Our characterization sheds light on the welfare costs of relying only on repeated interactions for sustaining cooperation, and on how to mitigate such costs.

An evidence of a transaction is generated by wireless PKI (WPKI) mechanism such that B and S cannot repudiate sending and receiving the purchase order respectively. Broker generates a mobile agent for B which carries en-crypted purchase order to S. A trusted third party (TTP) acts as a lightweight notary for evidence generations. One advantage of this agent-based non-repudiation proto-col is to reduce inconvenience for mobile clients such as connection time and search for suitable merchant servers, etc.; it provides necessary security mechanisms for fair mobile payment transactions...|$|R

After that we propose two new cryptographic Vickrey auction schemes that involve, apart from the bidders and the <b>seller</b> <b>S,</b> an auction authority A so that unless S and A collude the outcome of auctions will be correct, and moreover, S will not get any information about the bids, while A will receive bid statistics. The simple variant of our scheme is based on standard cryptographic primitives and is flexible and efficient to implement. The advanced variant is based on a coin-extractable homomorphic public-key cryptosystem. It reduces the trust requirements on A by making A's actions verifiable. Further extensions make it possible to decrease damage that colluding S and A can do. The communication complexity between the S and A in medium-size auctions is at least one order of magnitude less than in the Naor-Pinkas-Sumner scheme that was the only previously known secure Vickrey auction scheme without threshold trust.
