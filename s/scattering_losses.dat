That is, the <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> should not exceed 2. 5 x 10 {sup {minus} 5 } per surface. Establishing requirements for optical and structural surface cleanliness needs consideration of both particulate and organic thin-film cleanliness. Both forms of cleanliness may be specified using guidelines specified in Military Standard 1246 C and are referred to as cleanliness Levels. This Military Standard is described briefly and displayed in tables and charts. The presence of organic thin-films on structural surfaces is of particular concern if the contaminated surface is near solgel coated optics (solgel coatings provide an antireflection (AR) quality); or the optic is in a vacuum. In a vacuum, organic contaminant molecules have a much high probability of transporting from their source to a solgel-coated optic and thereby result in the rapid change in the transmission of the antireflection coating. Optical surface cleanliness can be rapidly degraded if a clean optic is exposed to any atmosphere containing an aerosol of small particles. The use of cleanrooms, as described in Federal Standard 209 C, minimizes the settling of particulate contaminants and is described using charts and tables.

This map provides an effective methodology to reduce roughness scattering, which we used to develop two fabrication technologies. Loss reduction from 32 dB/cm to 0. 8 dB/cm is achieved for [delta]n = 2. 0. This is the lowest loss ever achieved for a single-mode, high An system.

Our best PolySi/Si 02 waveguide shows additional 10 dB/cm loss, coming mainly from the top surface roughness due to grain boundary grooving. compared to a Si/Si 02 waveguide. Compact high An routing devices such as round bends, Y-splitters, and Multi-Mode Interference (MMI) splitters are fabricated and tested. We show that single-mode waveguide bends exhibit μm size bending with low loss and single-mode splitters show splitting with good uniformity. MMis show advantages over equivalent Y-splitter based structures in terms of size and loss. Our MMI design led to the fabrication of the smallest optical 1 x 16 fanout ever built. High Transmission Cavity (HTC) based bends, splitters, and resonators, that are compatible with an anisotropic etching technique, are demonstrated.
