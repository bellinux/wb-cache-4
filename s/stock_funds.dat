40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} market volatility and monthly mutual fund cash flows. We find that bond fund investors {{in the period of}} 1984 through 1998 do not respond to past stock market volatility at the aggregate level after we take into account the persistency of volatility over time and the relation between risks and returns. On the other hand, <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> investors respond negatively to concurrent and past long term (semi-annual and annual) market volatility. <b>Stock</b> <b>fund</b> investors' volatility timing behavior explains why fund managers decrease market exposure during periods of high market volatility. We also find that the negative relation between <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> flows and market volatility is not entirely driven by the persistency of volatility over time or the relation between risks and returns. Using semi-variance of daily stock market returns, we find no evidence that investors are only concerned about downside volatility. Both upside volatility and downside volatility have negative impact on subsequent <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> flows. We also find that <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> flows in our sample period have strong positive impact on the subsequent market...|$|R

He used a similar procedure to Benartzi and Thaler's experiment about savings allocations to elicit the naïve diversification bias of each individual subject. Respondents were asked to make two hypothetical decisions. In the first decision, respondents had to allocate their savings to five funds, of which four were <b>stock</b> <b>funds.</b> In the second decision, respondents had to allocate their savings to five funds, of which four were fixed-income funds. The results replicate the original finding that respondents were way more likely to invest in stocks when the proportion of <b>stock</b> <b>funds</b> was larger. In addition, several individual difference scales were measured. Only differences in focus on intuition correlate with the naïve diversification bias. The more investors use intuitive judgments, the more they display the naïve diversification bias.|$|E
