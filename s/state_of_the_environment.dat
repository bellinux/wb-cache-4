The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> around {{the most popular}} parts of the Mont Blanc massif, {{and the need for}} {{visitors}} to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons scope is larger {{than that of a}} regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.|$|E

Consequently, New Zealand is in {{the bottom half of}} the OECD in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP and greenhouse gas emissions per capita.

40|$|AbstractFrom <b>the</b> {{perspective}} <b>of</b> an agent, <b>the</b> input/output behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{in which}} it is embedded can be described as a dynamical system. Inputs correspond to the actions executable by the agent in making transitions between <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Outputs correspond to the perceptual information available to the agent in particular <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> We view dynamical system identification as inference of deterministic finite-state automata from sequences <b>of</b> input/output pairs. <b>The</b> agent can influence <b>the</b> sequence <b>of</b> input/output pairs it is presented by pursuing a strategy for exploring <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> We identify two sorts of perceptual errors: errors in perceiving <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> a <b>state</b> and errors in perceiving the inputs actually carried out in making a transition from one state to another.

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{have been}} {{an integral part of}} the project, and have been of decisive significance for the choice of alignment and determination of the design. Environmental considerations were the reason why Great Belt A/S established an environmental monitoring programme in 1988, and initiated co-operation with authorities and external consultants on the definition of environmental concerns during the construction work and the professional requirements to the monitoring programme. This co-operation issued in a report published at the beginning of 1997 on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> in the Great Belt. The conclusion of the report was that the marine environment was at least as good as before construction work began.|$|E
25|$|After the {{inevitable}} cooling of marketing hype, object libraries {{continue to be}} used in both object-oriented programming and distributed information systems. Class libraries are the rough OOP equivalent of older types of code libraries. They contain classes, which describe characteristics and define actions (methods) that involve objects. Class libraries are used to create , or objects with their characteristics set to specific values. In some OOP languages, like Java, the distinction is clear, with the classes often contained in library files (like Java's JAR file format) and the instantiated objects residing only in memory (although potentially able to be made persistent in separate files). In others, like Smalltalk, the class libraries are merely the starting point for a system image that includes the entire <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> classes and all instantiated objects.|$|E
25|$|Subjective {{estimates}} of an individual's SA {{may also be}} made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained external experts). These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because {{more information about the}} true <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on performing the task (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, observers are forced to rely more on operators' observable actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using performance and behavioral measures of SA, as described next.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to {{increasing}} public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator James E.

The 1962 publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson alerted {{the public about the}} detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M.

In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.|$|E

500|$|Sleaford is the {{principal}} market town in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire. The civil parish includes the hamlet of Holdingham to the north east and the village of Quarrington to the south east, both of which merge with the town. The County Council's <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> Report (1994) found that roughly three-quarters of Lincolnshire is low-lying, with much of it near sea-level; Sleaford lies approximately 43 feet (13 m) above sea level close to Lincoln Cliff, a Limestone scarp running north–south through Lindsey and Kesteven. The bedrock under the western half of the town belongs to the Great Oolite Group of Jurassic Sandstone, Limestone and Argillaceous rocks formed 168−165 million years ago; Kellaways and Oxford Clay formations, dated to 165–156 million years ago, underlie the eastern half. Alluvium deposits are found along the Slea's course, and Fen sand and gravel are found {{to the east and}} south. The county's agricultural land is generally of [...] "very good" [...] quality; as a result, intensive arable and vegetable farming is predominant and pastoral farming declined {{over the course of the}} 20th century. Sleaford is on the edge of the Fens, a low-lying region of the East of England which, before drainage from the 17th to the 20th centuries, were marshy and liable to flooding.
