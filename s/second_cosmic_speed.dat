40|$|We {{show that}} quantum decoherence, {{in the context}} of {{observational}} cosmology, can be connected to the cosmic dark energy. The decoherence signature could be characterized by the existence of quantum entanglement between cosmological eras. As a consequence, the Von Neumann entropy related to the entanglement process, can be compared to the thermodynamical entropy in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The corresponding cosmological models are compatible with the current observational bounds being able to reproduce viable equations of state without introducing a priori any cosmological constant. In doing so, we investigate two cases, corresponding to two suitable cosmic volumes, V∝ a^ 3 and V∝ H^- 3, and find two models which fairly well approximate the current <b>cosmic</b> <b>speed</b> up. The existence of dark energy can be therefore reinterpreted as a quantum signature of entanglement, showing that the cosmological constant represents a limiting case of a more complicated model derived from the quantum decoherence.

FMU is located in Fukushima city, and is 57 km (35 miles) away from northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. This paper presents three types of radiation survey undertaken through the unprecedented accidents at the campus and the hospital of FMU. First, a group of interested people immediately began radiation surveillance; the group members were assembled from the faculty members of " Life Sciences and Social Medicine" and " Human and Natural Sciences. " Second, the present author, regardless of the earthquake, had serially observed natural radiations such as gamma radiation in air with NaI scintillation counter, atmospheric radon with Lucas cell, and <b>second</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays with NaI scintillation.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{statistical}} thermodynamics {{tells us the}} equipartition law of energy does not hold {{in the limit of}} very low temperatures. It is found the Debye model is very successful in explaining the experimental results for most of the solid objects. Motivated by this fact, we modify the entropic force formula which is proposed very recently. Since the Unruh temperature is proportional to the strength of gravitational field, so the modified entropic force formula is an extension of the Newtonian gravity to weak field. On the contrary, General Relativity extends Newtonian gravity to strong field case. Corresponding to Debye temperature, there exists a Debye acceleration g_D. It is found the Debye acceleration is g_D= 10 ^{- 15 }N kg^{- 1 }. This acceleration is very much smaller than the gravitational acceleration 10 ^{- 4 }N kg^{- 1 } which is felt by the Neptune and the gravitational acceleration 10 ^{- 10 }N kg^{- 1 } felt by the Sun. Therefore, the modified entropic force can be very well approximated by the Newtonian gravity in the solar system and in the Galaxy.

As a first exploratory analysis, we then try fitting the Milky Way rotation curve using its visible components only in order to see whether the HL modified potential can be an alternative to the dark matter framework. This turns out not to be the case so that we argue that dark matter is still needed, but the amount of dark matter and the dark halo density profile have to be revised according to the new HL potential.
