40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the edge-partition problem, {{which is a}} graph theoretic problem arising {{in the design of}} <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Networks.</b> The deterministic edge-partition problem considers an undirected graph with weighted edges, and simultaneously assigns nodes and edges to subgraphs such that each edge appears in exactly one subgraph, and such that no edge is assigned to a subgraph unless both of its incident nodes are also assigned to that subgraph. Additionally, there are limitations on the number of nodes and on the sum of edge weights that can be assigned to each subgraph. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the edge-partition problem in which we assign nodes to subgraphs in a first stage, realize a set of edge weights from a finite set of alternatives, and then assign edges to subgraphs. We first prescribe a two-stage cutting plane approach with integer variables in both stages, and examine computational difficulties associated with the proposed cutting planes. As an alternative, we prescribe a hybrid integer programming/constraint programming algorithm capable of solving a suite of test instances within practical computational limits...|$|E

The number of SONET ADMs required {{by a set of}} traffic streams is determined by the routing and wavelength assignment of the traffic streams. Previous works took as input the traffic streams with routings given a priori and developed various heuristics for wavelength assignment to minimize the SONET ADM costs. However, little was known about the performance guarantees of these heuristics. This paper contributes mainly in two aspects. First, in addition to the traffic streams with pre-specified routing, this paper also studies minimizing the ADM requirement by traffic streams without given routings, a problem which is shown to be NP-hard. Several heuristics for integrated routing and wavelength assignment are proposed to minimize the SONET ADM costs. Second, the approximation ratios of those heuristics for wavelength assignment only and those heuristics for integrated routing and wavelength assignment are analyzed.

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine aspects related to network {{synchronization}} distribution and the cascading of timing elements.

The particular choices for synchronization distribution network architectures are now being evaluated and are demonstrating that they can indeed have a profound effect on the overall service performance levels that will be delivered to the customer. The salient aspects of these concerns reduce to the following: (1) identifying that the devil is in the details of the timing element specifications and the distribution of timing information (i. e., small design choices can have a large performance impact); (2) developing a standardized method of performance verification that will yield unambiguous results; and (3) presentation of those results.

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{development of}} the internet or other wide band access technologies such as DSL, FTTH has driven the {{development of the}} high-capacity optical networks from research laboratories into commercial deployment such as <b>Synchronous</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> or Synchronous digital hierarchy. In the first generation, optics is used only in transmission, and all switching and other intelligent functions are handled in electronics. Now people are seeing the deployment of the 2 nd generation optical networks, where some of the routing, switching and intelligence are handled optically. In this network, data is carried from its source to its destination in optical form, without undergoing any optical-to-electrical conversion so that the electronic devices will not limit the speed. In this network, both of the two current primary techniques for data multiplexing i. e. wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) are used including all optical devices such as wavelength converters, all optical switches, optical add/drop multiplexer, 2 R, 3 R and etc [...] //　This thesis introduces two novel devices for all optical processing by using multiple quantum well (MQW) electroabsorption modulators (EAM) for high-speed telecommunication: wavelength converters and all optical switches. The reasons why the EAM is used to replace the traditional semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) are short recovery time under reverse bias (possible to be < 10 ps), high stability, no amplified-spontaneous emission (ASE), and easy integration with other devices, especially, lasers. Moreover, we chose InGaAlAs as the core layer material in our devices due to its merits of large refractive index ratio between waveguide and cladding layer, large conduction band offset suitable for uncooled operation, and large spectral range. //　The proposed wavelength conversion is based on the optical nonlinear polarization rotation in an EAM. Nowadays, most of the EAM-based wavelength conversion is using cross-absorption modulation (XAM) due to its simple configuration. However, XAM suffers from the large input power, typically larger than 15 dBm. In order to reduce the input power, we investigated the cross-phase modulation (XPM) for TE mode and TM mode, and the polarization rotation. In the static wavelength conversion experiment, we demonstrated that the input powers for π phase shift are only 5 dBm for upward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1560 nm) and 8 dBm for downward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1550 nm), and the extinction ratios are 34 dB and 31 dB respectively. 10 Gb/s dynamic wavelength conversion has also been demonstrated. Further simulation shows that the narrowing of the quantum well and compressive strain of MQW enhance the polarization rotation, thus reducing the required input power for saturation state. Higher speed operation is also possible by using higher reverse and optimizing the RF response. //　For all optical switches, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration with EAM on the MZI arms is proposed. On account of the low relaxation time of EAM, no push-pull operation is needed. Moreover, compared to SOA, EAM has no current injection, so lower heating and low power consumption can be achieved. //　The main challenge of our MZI-EAM device is the monolithic integration of the EAM and other passive waveguide. Due to large insertion loss of EAM and no gain devices in the whole structure, etch and regrowth method is chosen to reduce the total insertion loss by optimizing the active and passive regions individually. Till now, etch and regrowth technology has been well developed for InGaAsP material, but for Al-containing material, it still remains a challenge, especially for ex-situ cleaning procedure. The difficulty arises from the formation of stable Al-Oxides due to the often inevitable air-exposure of the InGaAlAs core layer during device processing, which degrades the crystal quality grown at the interface and causes large scattering loss. We optimized the growth conditions by MOVPE and processing procedures for both one-step regrowth and two-step regrowth and obtained good connection at the interface of the passive waveguide and active EAM region, with high coupling efficiency and low coupling loss (0. 21 dB/facet). //　Another big issue of the EAM-based all optical switch is the large insertion loss. This is mainly due to the large absorption of EAM and scattering in the waveguide. High mesa structure is superior for small size, but suffering from the significant scattering loss at the sidewall. Ridge structure has much lower loss, but has longer S-bend and multimode interferometer (MMI). Moreover, the doping profile in the cladding layer has also influence on the total loss. 報告番号: 甲 22283; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6488 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{high-speed}} wavelength-division-multiplexed <b>synchronous</b> <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> (SONET) ring networks, {{the terminal}} equipment {{costs associated with}} electronic multiplexing can be predominantly high. Placing a wavelength add–drop multiplexer (WADM) at each network node allows certain wavelengths to optically bypass the node without being electronically terminated. This approach can effectively reduce the total equipment cost if connections and channels are appropriately assigned in traffic grooming. In this paper, we present a series of wavelength optimization and wavelength assignment algorithms with the objective to optimize the number of required SONET add–drop multiplexers and yet minimizes the number of wavelengths in both unidirectional and bidirectional rings under an arbitrary grooming factor. In our analysis, we have considered both uniform and general nonuniform all-to-all network traffic. As a simple model for realistic traffic patterns, a special case of nonuniform traffic, distance-dependent traffic, is analyzed in detail. Significant ADM savings are observed for different traffic scenarios using our proposed algorithms.

Moreover, the traffic pattern of the <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> changes from time to time. How to develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for traffic grooming is an important issue. In this paper, two cases (best fit and full fit) for handling reconfigurable SONET over WDM networks are proposed. For each approach, an integer linear programming model and heuristic algorithms (TS- 1 and TS- 2, based on the tabu search method) are given. The results demonstrate that the TS- 1 algorithm can yield better solutions but has a greater running time than the greedy algorithm for the best fit case. For the full fit case, the tabu search heuristic yields competitive results compared with an earlier simulated annealing based method and it is more stable for the dynamic case.
