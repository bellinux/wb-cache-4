40|$|We have {{investigated}} the relationship between lamellipodium protrusion and forward translocation of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> in the rapidly moving keratocyte. It is first shown that the trailing, ellipsoidal <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> rotates during translocation. This was indicated by {{the rotation of the}} nucleus and the movement of cytoplasmic organelles, as well as of exogenously added beads used as markers. Activated or Con A-coated fluorescent beads that were overrun by cells were commonly endocytosed and rotated with the internal organelles. Alternatively, beads applied {{to the rear of the}} <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> via a micropipette adhered to the dorsal cell surface and also moved forward, indicating that both exterior and underlying cortical elements participated in rotation. Manipulation of keratocytes with microneedles demonstrated that pushing or restraining the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> in the direction of locomotion, and squeezing it against the substrate, which temporarily increased the intracellular pressure, did not effect the rate of lamellipodium protrusion. Rotation and translocation of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> continued momentarily after arrest of lamellipodium protrusion by cytochalasin B, indicating that these processes were not directly dependent on actin polymerization. The <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> was commonly flanked by phase-dense "axles," extending from the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> into the lamellipodium. Phalloidin staining showed these to be comprised of actin bundles that splayed forward into the flanks of the lamellipodium. Disruption of the bundles on one side of the nucleus by traumatic microinjection resulted in rapid retraction of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> in the opposite direction, indicating that the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> was under lateral contractile stress. Myosin II, which colocalizes with the actin bundles, presumably provides the basis of tension generation across and traction of the <b>cell</b> <b>body.</b> We propose that the basis of coupling between lamellipodium protrusion and translocation of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> is a flow of actin filaments from the front, where they are nucleated and engage in protrusion, to the rear, where they collaborate with myosin in contraction. Myosin-dependent force is presumably transmitted from the ends of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> into the flanks of the lamellipodium via the actin bundles.

40|$|External {{mechanical}} loading of cells aligns cytoskeletal stress fibres {{in the direction}} of principle strains and localises paxillin to the mechanosensing region. If the osteocyte <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> can indeed directly sense matrix strains, then cytoskeletal alignment and distribution of paxillin in osteocytes in situ will bear alignment to the different {{mechanical loading}} patterns in fibulae and calvariae. We used confocal microscopy to visualise the immunofluorescence-labelled actin cytoskeleton in viable osteocytes and paxillin distribution in fixated osteocytes in situ. In fibular osteocyte <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> actin cytoskeleton and nuclei were elongated and aligned parallel to the principal (longitudinal) mechanical loading direction.

The combined level of <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and neuropil labelling was higher in the ICd than the other two subdivisions. Labelling in the ICc and ICx was stronger in the dorsal than the ventral regions. In spite of regional differences, no defined boundaries were formed between different areas.

40|$|Abstract Background When spinal motor axons are injured, the nucleolus, nucleus and <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> of {{the injured}} cell transiently {{increase}} in size, the nucleus becomes more eccentrically placed, {{and the organization of}} polyribosomes into Nissl bodies is temporarily disrupted. The mechanisms for these classical morphological responses to axotomy have not been satisfactorily explained. Results In this study we address the role of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> cytoskeleton in these structural changes. We show that the cytoskeleton of uninjured lumbar motor neuron <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> maintains nucleolar, nuclear and <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> size and nuclear position. When isolated, the relatively insoluble <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> cytoskeleton contains Nissl bodies and lipofuscin granules. After axotomy, protein labeling increases markedly and the cytoskeleton enlarges, increasing nucleolar, nuclear and <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> size, as well as nuclear eccentricity. Nearly all of the protein mass that accumulates in the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> after axotomy appears {{to be added to the}} cytoskeleton. Conclusion We conclude that axotomy causes the conjugate enlargement of the nucleolus, nucleus and <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and increases nuclear eccentricity in spinal motor neurons by adding protein to the cytoskeleton. The change in nuclear position, we propose, occurs when cytoskeletal elements of the axon cannot enter the shortened axon and "dam up" between the nucleus and axon hillock. As a consequence, we suggest that Nissl body-free axonal cytoskeleton accumulates between the nucleus and axon, displaces Nissl body-containing cytoskeleton, and produces central chromatolysis in that region of the cell. </p...|$|R

40|$|Fertilization in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is {{initiated}} when gametes of opposite mating types {{adhere to}} each other via adhesion molecules (agglutinins) on their flagella.

In the studies reported here we describe methods for purification of mt+ <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> agglutinins by use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography (molecular sieve, ion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction), and sucrose gradient centrifugation. About 90 % of the total agglutinins were associated with the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and the remainder were on the flagella. <b>Cell</b> <b>body</b> agglutinins were indistinguishable from mt+ flagellar agglutinins by SDS-PAGE, elution properties on a hydrophobic interaction column, and in sedimentation properties on sucrose gradients. The nonadhesiveness of <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> suggested that the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> agglutinins would be intracellular, but our results are not consistent with this interpretation. We have demonstrated that brief trypsin treatment of deflagellated gametes destroyed all of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> agglutinins and, in addition, we showed that the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> agglutinins were accessible to surface iodination. These results indicated that C. reinhardtii agglutinins have a novel cellular disposition: active agglutinins, representing approximately 10 % of the total cellular agglutinins, are found only on the flagella, whereas the remaining 90 % of these molecules are on the external surface of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> plasma membrane in a nonfunctional form.

40|$|Osteocytes {{with long}} {{dendritic}} processes {{are known to}} sense mechanical loading, which is essential for bone remodeling. There has been a long-standing debate with regard to which part(s) of osteocyte, the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> versus the dendritic process, acts as a mechanical sensor. To address this question experimentally, we used a transwell filter system that differentiates the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> from the dendritic processes. Mechanical loading was applied to either the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> or the dendrites, and the osteocyte’s response was observed through connexin 43 hemichannel opening. The hemichannels located on the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> were induced to open when mechanical loading was applied to either the dendritic processes or the <b>cell</b> <b>body.</b> However, no significant hemichannel activity in the dendrites was detected when either part of the cell was mechanically stimulated. Disruption of the glycocalyx by hyaluronidase on the dendrite side alone is sufficient to diminish a dendrite’s ability to induce the opening of hemichannels on the <b>cell</b> <b>body,</b> while hyaluronidase has no such effect when applied to the <b>cell</b> <b>body.</b> Importantly, hyaluronidase treatment to the dendrite side resulted in formation of poor integrin attachments with the reduced ability of the dendrites to form integrin attachments {{on the underside of}} the transwell filter. Together, our study suggests that the glycocalyx of the osteocyte dendritic process is required for forming strong integrin attachments. These integrin attachments probably serve as the mechanotransducers that transmit the mechanical signals to the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> leading to the opening of hemichannels, which permits rapid exchange of factors important for bone remodeling...|$|R

Although polymerization along the leading edge appears to drive protrusion, the behavior of sperm tethered to the substrate showed that an additional force is required to pull the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> forward. To examine the mechanism of <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> movement, we used pH to uncouple cytoskeletal polymerization and depolymerization. In sperm treated with pH 6. 75 buffer, protrusion of the leading edge slowed dramatically while both cytoskeletal disassembly {{at the base of the}} lamellipodium and <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> retraction continued. At pH 6. 35, the cytoskeleton pulled away from the leading edge and receded through the lamellipodium as its disassembly at the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> continued. The cytoskeleton disassembled rapidly and completely in cells treated at pH 5. 5, but reformed when the cells were washed with physiological buffer. Cytoskeletal reassembly occurred at the lamellipodial margin and caused membrane protrusion, but the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> did not move until the cytoskeleton was rebuilt and depolymerization resumed.

In {{a random sample of}} 400 Aβ deposits, 88 % were closely associated with one or more neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> The frequency distribution of (Aβ) deposits which were associated with 0, 1, 2, [...] .,n neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> deviated significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting a degree of clustering of the neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> In addition, the frequency of Aβ deposits declined exponentially as the number of associated neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> increased. Aβ deposit area was positively correlated with the frequency of associated neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> the degree of correlation being greater for pyramidal cells than smaller neurons. These data suggested: (1) the number of closely adjacent neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> which simultaneously secrete Aβ was an important factor {{determining the}} size of an Aβ deposit and (2) the exponential decline in larger Aβ deposits reflects the low probability that larger numbers of adjacent neurons will secrete Aβ simultaneously to form a deposit. © 1995...|$|R
