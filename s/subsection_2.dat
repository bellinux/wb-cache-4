The changes {{were to be}} implemented {{by virtue of the}} Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, which amended the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. Part II of the act (henceforth referred to as 'PVSaCA') deals with the amendments to the manner in which House of Commons constituencies are formed by the individual boundary commissions. Each commission was obliged to make a final report to the Secretary of State before 1 October 2013 (by virtue of Section 10, Clause 3, which amends <b>Subsection</b> <b>2</b> of Section 3 of the 1986 Act).|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Montana voters {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} which greatly expanded the state's treatment of water and water rights. Article IX, Section 3, Subsection 1 recognized and confirmed all existing water rights. <b>Subsection</b> <b>2</b> reiterated the 1889 constitution's wording, with only minor and non-substantive changes. Subsection 3, however, established state ownership of all waters (atmospheric and ground, as well as surface) within the state, declared them available solely {{for the use of}} the people, and declared that appropriation of water must be for beneficial purposes. Subsection 4 required the state to administer, control, and regulate water rights, and to establish a centralized record of such rights. At no time did the 1971 constitutional convention recognize the control over Native American water rights exercised by the federal government under Winters and Powers.|$|E

40|$|We {{start the}} general {{structure}} theory of not necessarily semisimple finite tensor categories, generalizing {{the results in}} the semisimple case (i. e. for fusion categories), obtained recently in our joint work with D. Nikshych. In particular, we generalize to the categorical setting the Hopf and quasi-Hopf algebra freeness theorems due to Nichols-Zoeller and Schauenburg, respectively. We also give categorical versions {{of the theory of}} distinguished group-like elements in a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, of Lorenz's result on degeneracy of the Cartan matrix, and of the absence of primitive elements in a finite dimensional Hopf algebra in zero characteristic. We also develop the theory of module categories and dual categories for not necessarily semisimple finite tensor categories; the crucial new notion here is that of an exact module category. Finally, we classify indecomposable exact module categories over the simplest finite tensor categories, such as representations of a finite group in positive characteristic, representations of a finite supergroup, and representations of the Taft Hopf algebra.

40|$|The merger {{provisions}} of the Competition Act proclaimed on June 19, 1986 are similar in with section 7 of the Clayton Act and the decisions of U. S. Courts in antitrust merger cases.

The author discusses the meaning of <b>subsection</b> 92 (<b>2)</b> of the Competition Act and the relevance of the "structure-conduct-performance paradigm" to horizontal merger analysis in the Canadian context. The author proceeds to a comparative analysis of the U. S. and Canadian antitrust regimes. The meaning of <b>subsection</b> 92 (<b>2)</b> remains unsettled since the Competition Tribunal has not yet made a decision on the merits in a contested merger.
