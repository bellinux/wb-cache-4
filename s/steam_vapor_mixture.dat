Our MEMS-based electronic nose is composed of a microcantilever sensor array with seven individual sensors used for vapor detection and an artificial neural network (ANN) for the pattern recognition. A set of custom vapor generators generated reproducible <b>vapor</b> <b>mixtures</b> in different compositions for training and testing of the neural network.

40|$|Microbes {{survive for}} an {{extended}} period of time on fomites. With new strains of pathogens constantly emerging, it is important to understand their survival and spread and to evaluate the efficiency of new disinfection methods. The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of pathogens on fomites, and evaluate different disinfection methods (household bleach and <b>steam</b> <b>vapor).</b> Fomites were sampled in a variety of environments for the presence of pathogens including methicillin intermediate- and resistant- Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Penecillium brevi-compactum, Alternaria alternata and novel H 1 N 1 influenza A. Samples were assayed using both cultural and genetic techniques to determine the microbial occurrence. In disinfection studies, samples were collected before and after disinfectant application. <b>Steam</b> <b>vapor</b> was effective at reducing microbial occurrence by> 90 % with a minimal contact time of 10 - 20 seconds on hospital fomites. The material and shape of the surface had an effect on the reduction rate, due to access of the disinfecting agent. In addition, low levels of initial contamination limited the reduction rate. Many surfaces had a starting contamination level of less than 3 log 10 and after disinfection the contamination levels, in 69 % of the samples, were at or near the limit of detection. This suggests a higher reduction is feasible. Household bleach reduced the presence of mold spores and mycelium by > 99 % on gypsum-wall board. Reduction rates were influenced by the growth stage of mold, with the mycelium requiring additional disinfectant application to achieve the 99 % reduction rate. Novel H 1 N 1 influenza A was not recovered on any surfaces in day care facilities and elementary schools. This is consistent with previous studies looking at H 1 N 1 influenza occurrence in similar environments, though it is different from H 3 N 2 influenza A studies. Survival differences among varying influenza strains are expected to have an impact on pathogen spread and human health risks. Differences can be quantitatively evaluated and used to develop more advanced risk assessment models. <b>Steam</b> <b>vapor</b> and household bleach are effective at reducing risks of pathogens in the environment and are critical interventions in an overall strategy to minimize exposure and prevent disease...|$|R
