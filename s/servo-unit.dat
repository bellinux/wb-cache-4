50|$|While {{the cockpit}} is {{typically}} equipped with dual flight controls for two-man operations, the Dauphin {{can be readily}} flown by a single pilot while operating under instrument flight rules; this was achieved in part by avionics such as the 4-axis Dual Digital Automatic Flight Control System (older production aircraft use a 3-axis flight control system with integrated autopilot instead) to reduce crew workload. The principle flight control system are connected {{to a total of}} 3 dual-chamber primary servo-units for cyclical and collective pitch control, and a single dual-chamber rear <b>servo-unit</b> for tail rotor pitch control. Other major avionics include 10.4-inch multi-mission touch screen displays, weather radar, global positioning system (GPS) receiver, traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), automatic voice alarm device (AVAD), health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), quick access records for helicopter flight data management, and digital audio communication system (DACS).|$|E
