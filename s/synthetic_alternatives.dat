50|$|After an {{extensive}} {{career in the}} pharmaceutical retail sector, Michael {{came to the conclusion}} that bio-identical hormones (Hormones matching chemicals that the body produces) must be better than using <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternatives</b> to treat disorders. To prove this, he devoted his further career to the understanding of the role and effectiveness of bio-identical hormones. Once convinced that bio-identical hormones were superior over their <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternatives,</b> he started the company Lawley Pharmaceuticals in 1995 to manufacture pharmaceutical grade bio-identical hormone creams for use by pharmacies, doctors, and hospitals.|$|E

50|$|The raw {{material}} for bone china is about 50% bone ash derived from animal bones. These bones undergo multiple processing stages during which all meat is removed and the bone is completely cleaned. Once cleaned, the bone is heated to about 1000 °C (1832 °F) so that all additional organic material {{is removed from the}} bone and the bone becomes sterilized. Lastly, the newly sterilized bone is ground with water into fine particles which {{can be used as a}} {{raw material}} for bone china. Bone ash plays an important role in the creation of bone china, as the phosphate of the bone generates beta tricalcium phosphate, and other compounds from the bone create a calcium crystal called anorthite. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>alternatives</b> dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate are used as substitutes for bone ash. Most bone china are produced with <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternatives</b> rather than bone ash.|$|E

5000|$|Though the fishes {{prefer to}} spawn among fine leaved plants, one {{problem that the}} aquarist faces {{in this regard is}} that the {{majority}} of fine leaved plants available in the aquarium prefer high light levels (Cabomba is a particular case in point) while the rummy-nose tetra prefers to spawn under subdued lighting conditions. Workarounds for this include the use of Java moss (a plant that thrives even in very low light levels, and is an ideal spawning medium for many fishes) or the use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternatives</b> ("spawning mops" [...] made of nylon are typically deployed where a suitable natural plant is unavailable).|$|E
50|$|Recently, the guayule {{plant has}} seen {{a small but growing}} {{resurgence}} in research and agriculture due to its hypoallergenic properties. While Hevea-derived rubber contains proteins that can cause severe allergic reactions in a few people, guayule does not. With the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, the surge in rubber glove usage revealed how many people were allergic to latex (about 10% of health care workers, according to OSHA), and thereby created a niche market for guayule. There are <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternatives</b> for medical device products, but they are not as stretchable as natural rubber. Guayule performs like Hevea but contains none of the proteins that cause latex allergies.|$|E

2500|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} of unmodified ECT was fracture or dislocation {{of the long}} bones, caused by {{the violence of the}} muscular contractions during the convulsion. In the 1940s psychiatrists began to experiment with curare, the muscle-paralysing South American poison, in order to modify the convulsions. The introduction in 1951 of succinylcholine, a safer <b>synthetic</b> <b>alternative</b> to curare, led to the more widespread use of modified ECT. A short-acting anaesthetic was usually given in addition to the muscle relaxant in order to spare patients the terrifying feeling of suffocation that can be experienced with muscle relaxants.|$|R
