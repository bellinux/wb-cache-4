40|$|Drilling a stack made {{of carbon}} fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) {{material}} and aluminum or titanium, which is typical in the aircraft industry, is investigated for improved performance and economy. Using the same drill {{under the same}} process parameters to make holes in both materials requires compromising {{the quality of the}} holes and the drilling performance in the CFRP or in the metal layer. One way to overcome this need to compromise is to change the process parameters during drilling and to use the most suitable parameters for each material. This is possible when the thickness of each layer is known. This is not the case with large airplane parts with changing profiles in which the thickness of the different material layers varies along the profile. The current investigation presents a method based on an acoustic emission signal for identifying the transition point between materials and the point of entrance and exit from each material during the drilling process. Find ing those points from the acoustic emission signal in real time was achieved by applying a novel pattern analysis algorithm using real drilling tests results. The proposed method can be used to change the process parameters and correctly adapt them to the material being drilled. Two types of drills were used in the experiments, a standard carbide drill and a carbide <b>stepped</b> <b>drill.</b> In both cases the proposed method showed good results, although using a <b>stepped</b> <b>drill</b> allows more time to make changes in the process parameters...|$|R

40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, burr removal {{is a very}} important part of the manufacturing process. Stacks of material on sections of an aircraft are assembled and drilled by hand. Due to extensive burr formation the sheets must be destacked so that burrs can be removed and then the stacks are reassembled and fastened together. If burrs are minimized in the drilling process, this would reduce the necessity for the sheets to be destacked and deburred. One approach to minimizing burrs is to lower the thrust force in drilling through suitable modification of the drill geometry such as the use of a <b>step</b> <b>drill.</b> Although prior researchers have analyzed different drill geometries such as step drills and their effect on hole exit burr formation in the drilling process through experimentation, no work has been reported on modeling and analysis of step drilling forces and their relationship to burr formation as a function of the <b>step</b> <b>drill</b> geometry parameters. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the modeling of the thrust force and torque for step drills and analyzes their relationship with burr size as a function of the <b>step</b> <b>drill</b> geometry parameters. In the first step, a mechanistic model for thrust and torque in drilling is implemented for a standard twist drill. This mechanistic model is then adapted to predict the thrust and torque for a <b>step</b> <b>drill.</b> Subsequently, experiments are performed to validate the mechanistic model and to evaluate burr formation with standard and step drills. The influence of thrust and torque on hole exit burr formation is analyzed for different <b>step</b> <b>drill</b> geometries and experimental feeds and speeds. The results show that the predicted thrust and torque values for both drill geometries are in good agreement with measured values, although the torque model consistently underpredicts. For standard drill geometry in the calibration tests, the average error in the thrust prediction is 7. 09 % and the average error in the torque prediction is - 18. 05 %. In validation tests, the average error for predicted thrust is 2. 29 % and the average error for predicted torque is - 18. 46 %. For the <b>step</b> <b>drill</b> model the average error in thrust is 0. 72 % while the average error in torque is - 8. 72 %. In addition, a reduction in the predicted thrust force for a <b>step</b> <b>drill</b> relative to the standard twist drill is found to correlate well with a reduction in the measured burr size. However, further reduction in the thrust force by varying the step angle and diameter ratio do not correlate well with the measured burr size. Likely reasons for these results are presented in this thesis. MSCommittee Chair: Shreyes Melkote; Committee Member: Steven Danyluk; Committee Member: Steven Lian...|$|E

In the present study, regression model were developed to predict surface roughness in drilling MDF panels with carbide step drills. In the development of predictive models, drilling parameters of spindle speed, feed rate and drill diameter were considered as model variables. For this purpose, Taguchi’s design of experiments was carried out in order to collect surface roughness value.
