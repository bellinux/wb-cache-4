5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler. The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR <b>Sport</b> <b>car</b> after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
25|$|For 1982, {{endurance}} <b>sport</b> <b>car</b> racing {{entered a}} rejuvenated phrase {{with the coming}} of Group C; the BRDC and l'Automobile Club de l'Ouest instituted a joint Silverstone/Le Mans Challenge Trophy. The trophy eventually went to Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell in a Porsche 956, but at Silverstone they could not make maximum use of the fuel allowance and victory went to the Lancia LC1 of Riccardo Patrese and Michele Alboreto. The winning car completed the 240 laps at a speed of 128.5mph, with the second-place car three laps adrift, that of Ickx/Bell. The final podium place went to the Joest Racing Porsche 936C Turbo of Bob Wollek/Jean-Michel Martin/Philippe Martin.|$|E
25|$|The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) field {{consisted}} of four manufacturers (Aston Martin, Ford, Ferrari and Porsche), while the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) entrants {{consisted of}} six teams: Aston Martin Racing, AF Corse, KCMG, Larbre Compétition, Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing and Gulf Racing. Aston Martin Racing made {{changes to the}} driver line-ups in their No. 95 and No. 97 entries. Darren Turner {{was moved to the}} No. 97 car alongside Richie Stanaway, while Nicki Thiim and Marco Sørensen remained in the team's No. 95 entry as a two-person crew. The driver change was necessitated to give the team an increased chance of winning the World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers. Jonathan Adam and Fernando Rees remained under contract with Aston Martin but were not slated to take part in any other races in the year; the former concentrated on sharing a TF <b>Sport</b> <b>car</b> with Derek Johnson in the British GT Championship. Paolo Ruberti returned to compete in the No. 50 Larbre Compétition car after missing the 24 Hours of Le Mans due to injury.|$|E

25|$|It was a non-Grand Prix year at Brands in 1983, but the Marlboro Daily Mail Race of Champions was {{successfully}} staged on 10 April, notwithstanding {{the fact it}} was only a week before the French Grand Prix and clashed with a tyre test at Paul Ricard. It was also the last non-championship F1 race to be held in the sport's history. It was won by the reigning world champion Keke Rosberg in the Williams FW08, who narrowly beat Danny Sullivan in his Tyrrell. Meanwhile, former world champion Alan Jones finished third in his last drive for Arrows. To bring some real excitement, noise and spectacle back into British motor racing, the BRSCC invented Thundersports. The new series had its debut on Easter Monday and the country's first major <b>sport</b> <b>car</b> race since the mid-1970s was a resounding success. Then, the year turned into a Grand Prix one after all; following the cancellation of the proposed New York Grand Prix, John Webb lobbied FISA in company with the RAC MSA and was granted the opportunity to run the Grand Prix d’Europe on 25 September, thus giving Britain its second Grand Prix that season.|$|E
25|$|The fifth (and final) {{full course}} yellow {{was shown to}} allow marshals to remove the debris from Jani's car. All of the cars elected to make pit stops during the full course yellow period. Bernhard took over Webber's driving duties in the No. 1 Porsche and {{remained}} the leader at the restart six minutes later. The No. 2 Porsche was shown a black and orange flag, requiring it to make a pit stop for repairs to its left-rear corner, and reemerged in fourth position. Second-placed LMP2 driver Bruno Senna went into gravel and grass but rejoined without any significant damage. Bernhard maintained his lead throughout {{the remainder of the}} event and took the first victory of the season for the No. 1 Porsche, and its first since the 2015 6 Hours of Shanghai. The No. 8 Audi finished in second, ahead of the team's No. 7 car in third. The No. 36 Signatech Alpine car of Menzes, Lapierre, and Richelmi secured the victory in the LMP2 category, and their third consecutive victory of the year, 16 seconds ahead of second-placed No. 43 RGR <b>Sport</b> <b>car,</b> AF Corse's No. 51 Ferrari in the LMGTE Pro class clinched its first victory of the season, the first of Calado's career and the 13th for Bruni, followed in second place by teammates, Bird and Rigon, who was 47 seconds adrift at the finish. Upon taking the lead from KCMG and holding it for the last 48 laps, Lamy, Lauda and Dalla Lana clinched Aston Martin's second victory in the LMGTE Am category, ahead of Perrodo, Collard and Agias in the No. 83 AF Corse car. KCMG's No. 78 Porsche initially finished second but was disqualified when it was discovered that the car's minimum ride height was not compliant with the regulations.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} was. People reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and <b>Sport</b> <b>Car</b> Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E
