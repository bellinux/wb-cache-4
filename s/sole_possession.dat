5|$|In {{the month}} of July, Davis had three home runs robbed from him, {{more than any other}} Major Leaguer the entire year. On July 28 against the Atlanta Braves, Davis hit two home runs and drove in 5 runs. It was his tenth career multi-home run game and third of the 2015 season. On July 30, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his 25th home run of the year, which {{happened}} to be his 83rd career home run at Oriole Park, which gave him <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of 6th place on the stadium's all-time home run list. On August 5, Davis hit his sixth career grand slam and second of the season in the tenth inning in a game against the Oakland Athletics, which helped lift Baltimore to a 7-3 victory. Ten days later, Davis hit a walk-off solo home run against the A's in Baltimore. It was his second home run of the night and number thirty-four on the year. On September 3, Davis hit a walk off solo home run to help the O's end a six-game losing skid. It was his thirty-eighth of the year. It was also his 152nd with the Orioles, giving him <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of eleventh place on the franchise's all-time list. The home run also happened to be his 90th career home run at OPACY, now giving him <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of fourth on the stadium's all-time list. On September 4, Davis became the first Orioles player to have back-to-back multi-home run games since 2009. In addition, he became the first Orioles player ever with multiple 40-home-run seasons (hit 53 in 2013). That game, against Toronto, became his sixth multi-homer game of the year and the thirteenth of his career. Davis led the majors in home runs with 47. This made Davis the only Orioles hitter to ever have two seasons with 40+ homers (53 in 2013 & 47 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|In postseason play, Parker {{yielded a}} 20-point {{performance}} in the semifinals of the 2014 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament against NC State on March 15, which marked his 17th such effort and moved him into <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of second place on the ACC freshman list, ahead of Marbury. In the March 16 championship game against Virginia, Parker posted his 18th 20-point game, which was one short of Anderson's ACC freshman record. Parker and the team, ranked No. 3 in the Midwest region, ended the season {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Tournament with a loss to No. 14 Mercer. Parker set the Duke record for freshman scoring average (19.1) and became the first freshman to lead the team in both scoring and rebounding.|$|E

50|$|A skilled {{writer and}} sculptor, van Zeller's artwork {{can be seen}} in churches {{throughout}} Britain and the United States. Many of his written works focused on responses to suffering, including Suffering: The Catholic Answer and The Mystery of Suffering; afflicted with illness for much of his life, he maintained an optimistic worldview. His 1966 autobiography, entitled One Foot in the Cradle, discusses his experiences serving in the monastery as well as his close friendship with Monsignor Ronald Knox, who would later dedicate one of his books to van Zeller.

5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters that he had a feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{returned}} from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four {{home runs in}} three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, {{the first time the}} Yankees had not been in <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire {{for the first time in}} Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.|$|E
50|$|All of the Tora-san movies had {{the same}} basic plot with some minor variations. Kuruma Torajirō (or Tora-san), a {{traveling}} salesman whose <b>sole</b> <b>possessions</b> include only {{the contents of a}} small suitcase, the clothes on his back and some pocket money, wanders from town to town peddling his wares. He yearns to return to his home in Shibamata, Katsushika, Tokyo.

Tatsuzō and Tsune run a traditional sweets (Dango) shop in Shibamata. The film often begins with Tora-san dreaming of doing grand deeds, anxious to be worthy of his family, usually resulting in disappointment and subsequent awakening.|$|R

Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns.

5|$|Following {{the rivalry}} game win, Cincinnati played the Pittsburgh Panthers {{in a game}} for control of {{first place in the}} Big East. In front of a record crowd at Cincinnati's home field, the Bearcats claimed first place with a 28–21 win. Heading into its game against the Syracuse Orange, Cincinnati was assured at least a share of the Big East Championship, but a 30–10 win over Syracuse gave the Bearcats <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of the championship, the first Big East title in school history. After {{clinching}} the Big East Championship and a bid to a BCS bowl, Cincinnati ended the regular season with a game in Hawaii against the Hawaii Warriors. Despite trailing for much of the game, the Bearcats scored 19 unanswered points and ended the regular season with a 29–24 victory. Already assured a BCS berth by virtue of their Big East championship, on December 7, 2008, the Bearcats were selected to participate in the 2009 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Houk {{was chosen}} to replace Stengel. During the 1961 season, both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and the pair {{attracted}} much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow {{out of the race}} in mid-September with 54 home runs. Maris continued, though, and on October 1, {{the final day of the}} season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept, as the Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams). MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later, giving Maris <b>sole</b> <b>possession</b> of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire. The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise's 19th World Series. The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. Maris won another AL MVP Award, while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award, having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees. New York returned to the World Series in 1962, facing the San Francisco Giants. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.|$|E
