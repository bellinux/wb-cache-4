500|$|The {{symmetrical}} 15-bay three-storey south front {{overlooking the}} pond {{is the work}} of Leoni. [...] Although Leoni had been influenced by the works and principles of Palladio, both Pevsner and the authors of the citation in the National Heritage List for England agree that the design of this front is more Baroque than Palladian. The bottom storey is rusticated with arched windows, and the other storeys are smooth with rectangular windows. The middle three bays consist of a portico of which the lowest storey has three arches. Above this arise four giant fluted Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment. Standing on the pediment are three lead statues, of Neptune, Venus and Pan. The pediment partly hides Wyatt's blind balustraded ashlar attic block. The other bays are separated by plain Ionic pilasters and the end three bays on each side protrude slightly. [...] The nine-bay three-storey east front is mostly Elizabethan in style and has Wyatt's single-storey extension protruding from its centre. The courtyard was remodelled by Leoni, who gave it a rusticated cloister on all sides. Above the cloister the architecture differs on the four sides although all the windows on the first (piano nobile) floor have pediments. On the west side is a one-bay centrepiece with a window between two Doric pilasters; on the south and north are three windows with four similar pilasters; and on the east front is the grand entrance with a portal in a Tuscan aedicule. This entrance is {{between the first and second}} storeys and is approached by <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> of stairs with iron balusters, which were made in 1734 [...] by John Gardom of Baslow, Derbyshire. [...] In the centre of the courtyard is an Italian Renaissance well-head, surrounded by chequered pink and white stone, simulating marble.|$|E
2500|$|The Tarxien phase {{marks the}} peak of the temple civilisation. This phase is named after the temple-complex at Tarxien, a couple of {{kilometres}} inland from the Grand Harbour. To it belong the last two stages {{in the development of the}} temple plan. The western temple at Ġgantija represents, along with other units in Tarxien, Ħaġar Qim and L-Imnajdra, the penultimate stage in development, that is, the introduction of a shallow niche instead of an apse at the far end of the temple. The final stage is testified in only one temple, the central unit at Tarxien, with its three <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> of apses. [...] The Temple culture reached its climax in this period, both in terms of the craftsmanship of pottery, as well as in sculptural decoration, both free-standing and in relief.|$|E
60|$|Roebuck Ramsden {{is in his}} study, {{opening the}} morning letters. The study, handsomely and solidly furnished, proclaims the man of means. Not a speck of dust is visible: {{it is clear that}} {{there are at least two}} housemaids and a parlormaid downstairs, and a {{housekeeper}} upstairs who does not let them spare elbow-grease. Even the top of Roebuck's head is polished: on a sunshiny day he could heliograph his orders to distant camps by merely nodding. In no other respect, however, does he suggest the military man. It is in active civil life that men get his broad air of importance, his dignified expectation of deference, his determinate mouth disarmed and refined since the hour of his success by the withdrawal of opposition and the concession of comfort and precedence and power. He is more than a highly respectable man: he is marked out as a president of highly respectable men, a chairman among directors, an alderman among councillors, a mayor among aldermen. Four tufts of iron-grey hair, which will soon be as white as isinglass, and are in other respects not at all unlike it, grow in two <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> above his ears and at the angles of his spreading jaws. He wears a black frock coat, a white waistcoat (it is bright spring weather), and trousers, neither black nor perceptibly blue, of one of those indefinitely mixed hues which the modern clothier has produced to harmonize with the religions of respectable men. He has not been out of doors yet to-day; so he still wears his slippers, his boots being ready for him on the hearthrug. Surmising that he has no valet, and seeing that he has no secretary with a shorthand notebook and a typewriter, one meditates on how little our great burgess domesticity has been disturbed by new fashions and methods, or by the enterprise of the railway and hotel companies which sell you a Saturday to Monday of life at Folkestone as a real gentleman for two guineas, first class fares both ways included.|$|E

50|$|The gun used {{multiple}} propellant charges placed {{along the}} barrel's length and timed to fire {{as soon as}} the projectile passed them in order to provide an additional boost. Solid-fuel rocket boosters were used instead of explosive charges because of their greater suitability and ease of use. These were arranged in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> {{along the length of the}} barrel, angled to project their thrust against the base of the projectile as it passed. This layout spawned the German codename Tausendfüßler ("millipede"). The barrel and side chambers were designed as identical sections to simplify production and allow damaged sections to be replaced. The entire gun would use multiple such sections bolted together. The smoothbore gun fired a fin-stabilized shell that depended upon aerodynamic forces rather than gyroscopic forces to prevent tumbling (distinct from conventional rifled weapons which cause the projectile to spin); this resulted in a lower drag coefficient.|$|E

Externally it bears the curved sting, the hypodermic aculeus or venom-injecting barb. It is equipped with various sensory hairs, as the sting cannot be guided visually.

50|$|The {{leaves of}} D. purpusii look like long (80 to 160 cm.) {{feathers}} sprouting {{from the top}} of the trunk at odd angles. They are compound, and can be flat or keel-shaped, and are a dark, lusterless gray-green. Each leaf is composed of a rachis with between 150 and 260 narrow (about 7 - 12 cm. long, 8 - 10 mm. wide), inserted leaflets attached. The leaflets are arranged along the somewhat flattened rachis in matching <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> without alteration. They do not grow perfectly perpendicular to their rachis, but point up and away from the petiole, all at approximately the same angle (this can be 120 degrees, 180 degrees, or any angle in between).

5000|$|The {{government}} had been aware {{for some time}} that the immigration facilities at William Street were inadequate for their needs. The decision to acquire the land at Kangaroo Point was justified by the need to provide [...] "pleasant surroundings" [...] for those who were recently arrived in the colony. The pattern of immigration fluctuated wildly over the years and the period immediately preceding the construction of the Kangaroo Point depot, immigration had been at an all-time high. William Peter Clark, the successful tenderer for the work, ran into a series of difficulties with the construction which resulted in almost a year's delay in the completion. The interior layout was designed by William Hodgen and arranged in a manner typical of institutional buildings of the time. Married quarters were in the form of separate cubicles on the ground level, and single quarters (segregated by gender, and in dormitory form) on the upper level. <b>Symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> of laundry and privy facilities were ranged {{to the rear of the}} building.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the mosque}} was {{intended}} to include a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of domed mausoleums flanking a prayer hall; this ambition was curbed when {{the dome of the}} second mausoleum was not completed. On either side of the prayer hall are funerary chambers, housing the Sultan and his son in one and female members of the Sultan's family in the other. The Sultan's chamber has a domed ceiling, as originally planned, while the women's chamber has a plain flat ceiling. This dome is a reduced copy of Faraj's twin domes; because of the large size of the mosque, the dome appears disproportionately small in its setting.|$|R

50|$|In praying mantises, {{ultrasound}} avoidance {{behaviors are}} non-directional turns or power dives {{that are very}} effective in preventing capture by bats.

A bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of auditory interneurons, 501-T3, accurately track the ultrasonic calls {{during the early stages}} of a bat attack. Because 501-T3 stops firing just before the evasive response starts, it may be involved in triggering the behavior. The praying mantis ear first appeared ca. 120 million years ago, predating the appearance of echolocating bats by ca. 50 million years, so its original function must be different from its current one.|$|R
