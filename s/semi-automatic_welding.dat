40|$|Alloy steel {{materials}} are predominantly {{used in the}} manufacturing of headers in thermal power plant boilers. Generally the hand hole pipe and dish end component are provided in the header for the inspecting the inner surface of the header. Conventionally the welding of dish end with hand hole pipe of the header is carried out using manual GTAW welding process for root pass and manual SAW welding process for filler passes which is a time consuming process. Thus it is substituted with a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> process i. e., STT- root pass followed by the pulsed GMAW for filler passes through a newly designed welding positioner. This <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> process optimizes the cycle time and increases the productivity rate. Also the new welding process – STT and P-GMAW is established by following optimization technique of Taguchi’s orthogonal array method and ensuring the weld quality performance through X-Radiography, mechanical tests impact test and hardness test.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the mechanism of the dramatic increase of impact toughness at low temperatures after post-weld heat treatment on weld joints. In this study, weld joints using two <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> consumables were fabricated by flux cored arc welding with subsequent PWHT at 660 °C for 65 min and 195 min, respectively. Tests of the tensile and yield strength, microhardness and impact toughness, were carried out. The microstructure was inspected by optical, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy in addition to compositional analysis using energy dispersive spectrometry. PWHT was observed to result in grain coarsening, sub-grain structure formation and decrease of the dislocation density. The increase of impact toughness is attributed to the relieved thermal stress, the inclusions and precipitations, softening of the structure, dislocation recovery and sub-grain structure...|$|E
40|$|Under this {{contract}} {{members of the}} MSU high energy physics group constructed a full-scale Pressurized Drift Tube Chamber intended for the GEM muon system at the SSC. They achieved a position resolution of < 90 {mu} over the full 5 m{sup 2 } area of the detector. This resolution satisfied the GEM resolution requirements of < 100 {mu} by a comfortable margin. Based on their SSC work they developed a new technique for creating wire supports in drift tubes with an overall placement accuracy of < 20 {mu}. This technique requires only simple jigging and can be duplicated and operated at low cost. Also, they participated {{in the design and}} testing of a hadron calorimeter prototype for GEM. This work lead the authors to develop a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> machine to fuse together two plastic optical fibers. Copies of this machine are currently in use in the CDF endplug upgrade at Fermilab and additional copies are used widely in calorimeter and fiber-tracker construction...|$|E
30|$|In this mode, the arc is used at {{the range}} of the {{globular}} arc current but with short arc length. This enables the arc to work under the weld pool surface (a so-called ‘buried arc’) and take advantage of the arc pressure of the shielded CO 2 to trap spatter. According to Nishiguchi et al. (1975), the buried arc welding technique is capable of achieving higher welding speeds and filler metal deposition rates than a globular arc. Weld speed can reach 2, 540  mm/min and clean-up is minimal (Lienert et al. 2011). Stol et al. (2006) studied the use of buried arc GMAW for seam welds. The buried arc approach has great potential for use in the automotive, railroad, and marine industries for welding subassemblies. An example application is welding of edges and sides of aluminium parts as an alternative to GMAW. Controlled globular arc mode can be used for fillet or seam welds in lap or T-joints and square groove butt joints. It is suitable for the mechanized welding of thin section material at high speeds and can be used in fully mechanized or automatic gas metal arc welding. It is also used in the welding of pipe cylinders. A buried arc can be used in car applications in butt welding for the body and <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> for the frame and body (Kielhorn et al. 2001; Aoki et al. 2003; Kah et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Surface welding is the {{dominant}} maintenance way to prolong exploitation life of damaged parts. Also, by properly choice of welding technology, {{it is possible to}} get improved structure, with dominant properties comparing to the original part. In that way, new layer becomes area of future crack initiation, that in turn will delay its initiation and provide secure and reliable exploatation. In this paper, high-carbon steel, which is used for rail production, is surfaced by <b>semi-automatic</b> arc <b>welding</b> process, using self-shielded and flux-cored wires, with different alloying concepts. Microstructures of surface welded layers show that obtained layers are more similar to the new rail steel generationbainitic steel, than original pearlitic base metal, in both cases. In this paper is also shown that multipass surface welding does not produce classic heat affected zone, i. e. its structure is improved and it is not a critical place in weldment...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to {{being one of the}} highest strength non-heat treatable aluminium alloys, magnesium-alloyed wrought aluminium 5083 displays excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. Aluminium alloy 6061, alloyed with magnesium and silicon, displays high strength, excellent formability, adequate weldability and good corrosion resistance. These aluminium alloys find application in the ship building and transport industries where 5083 is often joined to 6061 to produce welded structures such as complex I-beams and semi-hollow or hollow channels. This project aimed at characterizing the hardness, tensile properties, corrosion behaviour and fatigue properties (in air and in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution) of aluminium 5083 and 6061 in the as-received and welded conditions. Plates of 5083 -H 111 and 6061 -T 651 aluminium, prepared with double-V or square butt joint preparations, were joined using semi-automatic or fully automatic pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW). The pulsed GMAW process allows close control over the welding arc and facilitates the use of lower average heat inputs, thereby improving the bead appearance and mechanical properties. During this investigation, three filler wires were evaluated, namely magnesium-alloyed ER 5183 and ER 5356 aluminium, and silicon-alloyed ER 4043. Hardness measurements revealed a decrease in hardness in the weld metal of the 5083 -H 111 welds. Dressed welds failed in the weld metal during transverse tensile testing, whereas undressed (as-welded) specimens failed at the weld toe or weld root due to the stress concentration introduced by the weld geometry. Significant softening, attributed to the partial dissolution and coarsening of strengthening precipitates and recrystallization during welding, was observed in the heat-affected zones of the 6061 -T 651 welds. During tensile testing, failure occurred in the heat-affected zone of all 6061 welds. Welding reduced the room temperature fatigue life of all specimens tested. In the 5083 welds, fatigue cracks initiated preferentially at gas pores, lack-of-fusion type defects and second phase particles in dressed welds, and at the stress concentration presented by the weld toes or the weld root in undressed welds. In 6061 welds, failure occurred preferentially in the softened heat-affected zone of the welds. As a result of improved control over the weld profile and a lower incidence of weld defects, fully automatic <b>welds</b> consistently outperformed <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welds</b> during fatigue testing. The presence of a corrosive environment (a 3. 5 % NaCl solution in this investigation) during fatigue testing reduced the fatigue properties of all the samples tested. Corrosion pits formed preferentially at second phase particles or weld defects, and reduced the overall fatigue life by accelerating fatigue crack initiation.

50|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{commonly}} called MIG (for metal/inert-gas), is a <b>semi-automatic</b> or automatic <b>welding</b> process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and filler metal, along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the weld site from contamination. Constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current alternating current are used as well. With continuously fed filler electrodes, GMAW offers relatively high welding speeds; however the more complicated equipment reduces convenience and versatility {{in comparison to the}} SMAW process. Originally developed for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon economically applied to steels. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry for its quality, versatility and speed. Because of the need to maintain a stable shroud of shielding gas around the weld site, it can be problematic to use the GMAW process in areas of high air movement such as outdoors.|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the effective use of <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>welding</b> and made studies　of a simple automatic apparatus which was fixed together from a semi-automatic welder and other machine parts. In the present paper， we report on the practical usage of a new apparatus which performs an automatic weaving process making use of an automobile wiper. 　Through the experiments satisfactory results were obtained that this apparatus can be used with good results for automatic flat position welding. A summary of the results is given below : 一 　　（ 1 ）A　straight　bead　penetrates　deeply　in　the　center　of　the　weld，but　shows a tendency of increasing incomplete penetration or overlap on the extreme sides of the bead. With a weaved bead uiform penetration can be obtained. 　（ 2 ）Good welding win be performed under comparatively high current and high torch speed， and with the increase of the weaving cycles defects becomes few. 　But when it goes beyond proportions， lack of fusion， incomplete penetration and slag inclusion will easily be caused. 　　　（ 3 ）The appearance of the bead is better in the foreward process than in the backward process. 　　　（ 4 ）The proper welding conditions for this apparatus must be thought within the following limits : the current is 180 〜 200 A， the voltage is 24 〜 27 V， the torch speed is 13 〜 17 cm/min and the weaving cycle is 40 c/min. 　　　（ 5 ）The appearance　of beads and the strength of joints are the best when the proportion of gas mixture is CO_ 2 8. 0 十Ar 2. 0 ［l/min］.
