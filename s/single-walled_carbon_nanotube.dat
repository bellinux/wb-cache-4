50|$|Combining the {{physical}} and chemical characteristics of conjugated polymers with the high conductivity along the tube axis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provides {{a great deal of}} incentive to disperse CNTs into the photoactive layer in order to obtain more efficient OPV devices. The interpenetrating bulk donor-acceptor heterojunction in these devices can achieve charge separation and collection because of the existence of a bicontinuous network. Along this network, electrons and holes can travel toward their respective contacts through the electron acceptor and the polymer hole donor. Photovoltaic efficiency enhancement is proposed to be due to the introduction of internal polymer/nanotube junctions within the polymer matrix. The high electric field at these junctions can split up the excitons, while the <b>single-walled</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> (SWCNT) can act as a pathway for the electrons.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{synthesis}} of polyaniline yields granular morphology. However, if the conventional reaction is seeded by 1-4 mg (seed quantities) of added pre-synthesized polyaniline nanofibers, (nanofiber seeds could be prepared from interfacial polymerization) the bulk morphology changes dramatically from granular to nano-fibrillar. Furthermore,increased capacitance values {{were observed in}} polyaniline nanofibers synthesized by the nanofiber seeding approach. Oxidative polymerization can be also seeded by other nanostructure materials such as vanadium pentoxide nanofibers, where V2O5 nanofibers (i) Rapidly initiate fibrillar polymer growth (ii) Slowly dissolve in aq. 1.0 M HCl, which eliminates template removal steps. Hence only catalytic amounts (4mg) V2O5 nanofibers are needed prior to onset of polymerization, which significantly change the bulk morphology of the polymer precipitate. Moreover, <b>single-walled</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> and nano fibrous hexapeptide can be also used as templating seeds.
