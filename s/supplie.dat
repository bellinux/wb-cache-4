500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbishs {{sound is}} highly {{influenced}} by the traditional guitar pop of British bands such as the Kinks, the Jam, the Small Faces and the Who. The album's songs explore a number of styles—punk rock ("Advert"), neo-psychedelia ("Chemical World"), and vaudeville music-hall ("Sunday Sunday"). Opening track [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] is, according to NME, [...] "quintessential Blur. Damon, perennially bored, never stops singing, and Graham [...] <b>supplie</b> his usual immaculate guitar accompaniment". While [...] "Oily Water" [...] harked back to the baggy sound of Leisure, NME described [...] "Intermission" [...] as [...] "a pub piano knees-up that rinky-dinks along then gets frazzled in guitars and speeded-up drums". Most of the songs on the album are melodic and lushly produced, often supplemented by a brass section, string arrangements and backing vocals. To offer contrast to the classicist songwriting, Allmusic noted that [...] "Coxon's guitar tears each song open, either with unpredictable melodic lines or layers of translucent, hypnotic effects, and his work creates great tension with Alex James' kinetic bass".|$|E

[...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.

[...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?

[...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.

[...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their <b>supplie</b> [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E

[...] To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. [...] O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand [...] Before my Judge, either to undergoe [...] My self the total Crime, or to accuse [...] My other self, the partner of my life; [...] Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, [...] I should conceal, and not expose to blame [...] 130 [...] By my complaint; but strict necessitie [...] Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, [...] Least on my head both sin and punishment, [...] However insupportable, be all [...] Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou [...] Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. [...] This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, [...] And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, [...] So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, [...] That from her hand I could suspect no ill, [...] 140 [...] And what she did, whatever in it self, [...] Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; [...] Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.

[...] Which when the Lord God heard, without delay [...] To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd [...] Serpent though brute, unable to transferre [...] The Guilt on him who made him instrument [...] Of mischief, and polluted from the end [...] Of his Creation; justly then accurst, [...] As vitiated in Nature: more to know [...] Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) [...] 170 [...] Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last [...] To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, [...] Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: [...] And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. [...] Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst [...] Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; [...] Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, [...] And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. [...] Between Thee and the Woman I will put [...] Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; [...] 180 [...] Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. [...] So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd [...] When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, [...] Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, [...] Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave [...] Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht [...] In open shew, and with ascention bright [...] Captivity led captive through the Aire, [...] The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, [...] Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; [...] 190 [...] Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, [...] And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. [...] Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie [...] By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring [...] In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will [...] Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. [...] On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. [...] Because thou hast heark'nd {{to the voice of}} thy Wife, [...] And eaten of the Tree concerning which [...] I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, [...] 200 [...] Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow [...] Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; [...] Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth [...] Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, [...] In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, [...] Till thou return unto the ground, for thou [...] Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, [...] For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. [...] So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, [...] And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day [...] 210 [...] Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood [...] Before him naked to the aire, that now [...] Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin [...] Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, [...] As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now [...] As Father of his Familie he clad [...] Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, [...] Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; [...] And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: [...] Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins [...] 220 [...] Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more [...] Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, [...] Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. [...] To him with swift ascent he up returnd, [...] Into his blissful bosom reassum'd [...] In glory as of old, to him appeas'd [...] All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man [...] Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. [...] Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, [...] Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, [...] 230 [...] In counterview within the Gates, that now [...] Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame [...] Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, [...] Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. [...] O Son, why sit we here each other viewing [...] Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives [...] In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides [...] For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be [...] But that success attends him; if mishap, [...] Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n [...] 240 [...] By his Avenger, since no place like this [...] Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. [...] Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, [...] Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large [...] Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, [...] Or sympathie, or som connatural force [...] Powerful at greatest distance to unite [...] With secret amity things of like kinde [...] By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade [...] Inseparable must with mee along: [...] 250 [...] For Death from Sin no power can separate. [...] But least the difficultie of passing back [...] Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe [...] Impassable, impervious, let us try [...] Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine [...] Not unagreeable, to found a path [...] Over this Maine from Hell to that new World [...] Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument [...] Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, [...] Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, [...] 260 [...] Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. [...] Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn [...] By this new felt attraction and instinct. [...] Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. [...] Goe whither Fate and inclination strong [...] Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre [...] The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw [...] Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste [...] The savour of Death from all things there that live: [...] Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest [...] 270 [...] Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. [...] So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell [...] Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock [...] Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, [...] Against the day of Battel, to a Field, [...] Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd [...] With sent of living Carcasses design'd [...] For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. [...] So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd [...] His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, [...] 280 [...] Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. [...] Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste [...] Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark [...] Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) [...] Hovering upon the Waters; what they met [...] Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea [...] Tost up and down, together crowded drove [...] From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. [...] As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse [...] Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive [...] 290 [...] Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way [...] Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich [...] Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle [...] Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, [...] As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm [...] As Delos floating once; the rest his look [...] Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, [...] And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, [...] Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach [...] They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on [...] 300 [...] Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge [...] Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall [...] Immoveable of this now fenceless world [...] Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, [...] Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. [...] So, if great things to small may be compar'd, [...] Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, [...] From Susa his Memnonian Palace high [...] Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont [...] Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, [...] 310 [...] And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. [...] Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art [...] Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock [...] Over the vext Abyss, following the track [...] Of Satan, to the selfsame place where hee [...] First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe [...] From out of Chaos to the outside bare [...] Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant [...] And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made [...] And durable; and now in little space [...] 320 [...] The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n [...] And of this World, and on the left hand Hell [...] With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes [...] In sight, to each of these three places led. [...] And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, [...] To Paradise first tending, when behold [...] Satan in likeness of an Angel bright [...] Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing [...] His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: [...] Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear [...] 330 [...] Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. [...] Hee, after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk [...] Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape [...] To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act [...] By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded [...] Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought [...] Vain covertures; but when he saw descend [...] The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd [...] Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun [...] The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth [...] 340 [...] Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd [...] By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire [...] Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, [...] Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood [...] Not instant, but of future time. With joy [...] And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, [...] And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot [...] Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't [...] Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. [...] Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight [...] 350 [...] Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. [...] Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire [...] Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. [...] O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, [...] Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, [...] Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: [...] For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, [...] My Heart, which by a secret harmonie [...] Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, [...] That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks [...] 360 [...] Now also evidence, but straight I felt [...] Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt [...] That I must after thee with this thy Son; [...] Such fatal consequence unites us three: [...] Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, [...] Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure [...] Detain from following thy illustrious track. [...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. [...] Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. [...] Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, [...] High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race [...] Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, [...] Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) [...] Amply have merited of me, of all [...] Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore [...] Triumphal with triumphal act have met, [...] 390 [...] Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm [...] Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent [...] Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I [...] Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease [...] To my associate Powers, them to acquaint [...] With these successes, and with them rejoyce, [...] You two this way, among those numerous Orbs [...] All yours, right down to Paradise descend; [...] There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth [...] Dominion exercise and in the Aire, [...] 400 [...] Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, [...] Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. [...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee [...] I had persisted happie, had not thy pride [...] And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, [...] Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd [...] Not to be trusted, longing to be seen [...] Though by the Devil himself, him overweening [...] To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting [...] Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, [...] 880 [...] To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, [...] Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, [...] And understood not all was but a shew [...] Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib [...] Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, [...] More to the part sinister from me drawn, [...] Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie [...] To my just number found. O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound. [...] He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve [...] Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, [...] 910 [...] And tresses all disorderd, at his feet [...] Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught [...] His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. [...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice. [...] If care of our descent perplex us most, [...] Which must be born to certain woe, devourd [...] 980 [...] By Death at last, and miserable it is [...] To be to others cause of misery, [...] Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring [...] Into this cursed World a woful Race, [...] That after wretched Life must be at last [...] Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power [...] It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent [...] The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. [...] Childless thou art, Childless remaine: [...] So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two [...] 990 [...] Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. [...] But if thou judge it hard and difficult, [...] Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain [...] From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, [...] And with desire to languish without hope, [...] Before the present object languishing [...] With like desire, which would be miserie [...] And torment less then none of what we dread, [...] Then both our selves and Seed at once to free [...] From what we fear for both, let us make short, [...] 1000 [...] Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply [...] With our own hands his Office on our selves; [...] Why stand we longer shivering under feares, [...] That shew no end but Death, and have the power, [...] Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, [...] Destruction with destruction to destroy. [...] She ended heer, or vehement despaire [...] Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts [...] Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. [...] But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, [...] 1010 [...] To better hopes his more attentive minde [...] Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. [...] Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems [...] To argue in thee somthing more sublime [...] And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; [...] But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes [...] That excellence thought in thee, and implies, [...] Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret [...] For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. [...] Or if thou covet death, as utmost end [...] 1020 [...] Of miserie, so thinking to evade [...] The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God [...] Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so [...] To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death [...] So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine [...] We are by doom to pay; rather such acts [...] Of contumacie will provoke the highest [...] To make death in us live: Then let us seek [...] Som safer resolution, which methinks [...] I have in view, calling to minde with heed [...] 1030 [...] Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise [...] The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless [...] Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe [...] Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd [...] Against us this deceit: to crush his head [...] Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost [...] By death brought on our selves, or childless days [...] Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe [...] Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee [...] Instead shall double ours upon our heads.

Remember with what mild [...] And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd [...] Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected [...] Immediate dissolution, which we thought [...] Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee [...] 1050 [...] Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, [...] And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, [...] Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope [...] Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne [...] My bread; what harm?
