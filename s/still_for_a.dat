5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to <b>Still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first {{down at the}} Tech 33-yard line. On the next play, Druckenmiller {{completed a}} long pass to tight end Bryan Jennings, who carried the ball 41 yards. Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman for a first down. On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with <b>Still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to <b>Still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards forward with a run up the middle. This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled the snap and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs, and Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E

He was the most generous of patrons—to writers and scholars, artists and craftsmen. Finally, he was an excellent Emperor: a competent, conscientious and hard-working administrator and an inspired picker of men, whose appointments to military, naval, ecclesiastical, civil and academic posts were both imaginative and successful. He did much to develop higher education and took a special interest in the administration of justice.|$|E
25|$|The daguerreotypes {{were not}} without drawbacks, however. The main {{difficulty}} {{was that they}} could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one {{of two or more}} people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.|$|E

500|$|Kublai Khan did not {{conquer the}} Song dynasty in South China until 1279, so Tibet was a {{component}} of the early Mongol Empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of China under the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). Van Praag writes that this conquest [...] "marked the end of independent China," [...] which was then incorporated into the Yuan dynasty that ruled China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, parts of Siberia and Upper Burma. Morris Rossabi, a professor of Asian history at Queens College, City University of New York, writes that [...] "Khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the Emperor of China. Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he <b>still,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, claimed universal rule", and yet [...] "despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan". Thus, with such limited acceptance of his position as Great Khan, Kublai Khan increasingly became identified with China and sought support as Emperor of China.|$|E

[...] In her first book, Paint A 'Licious, she was both the painter and photographer as well as the arranger who conceived the scenes. [...] Paint A 'Licious had a theme of helping people achieve their fantasies. [...] Among the works included were one called 'It's a Stretch but You've Still Got It,' which shows an old woman in a pink tutu doing the splits on a golden stage, {{with the help of an}} assistant painted to blend into the curtains and 'No Sweat' which shows an overweight woman happily leading an aerobics class with her body painted so that she appears 30 pounds slimmer.

2500|$|The catcher {{can help}} his pitcher get more strike {{calls from the}} umpire by using a {{technique}} called [...] "framing".

When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second or two so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).|$|E

I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face.

But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
