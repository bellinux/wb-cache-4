The following results were achieved: the overall level of resiliency and factors 1, 3, 4 was not significantly different in the compared groups. <b>Socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> youths significantly differed from the controls in perseverance, determination in action and a sense of support from the school.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of social {{maladjustment}} at age 11 on adult employment probability. Social maladjustment is measured according to the British Social Adjustment Guide score provided by the National Child Development Study that also provides information on cohort-members both in childhood and adulthood, including current employment status and past working history. The econometric method consists in a dynamic probit model with unobserved heterogeneity accounting for true state dependence and initial conditions problem. Consistently with the previous literature, we find that social maladjustment during childhood determines a lower employment probability in adulthood. This result holds also after controlling for true state dependence and past working history. Interestingly, the adult employment probability of <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> children is prone to greater variability according to life experiences than that of socially adjusted children. We find that being employed in the previous period, education, young-adulthood working experiences and, for females, early working experiences increases the adult employment probability for all cohort-members. However the positive effect is stronger for <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> children and, overall, investment in higher education seems to be relevant. This suggests that interventions during life development for <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> children could be important to reduce inequality in adult employment probability. ...|$|R

40|$|PREVIOUS {{reviews of}} the {{literature}} on the <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> child have tended to deal with the field as if it were co-extensive with juvenile de linquency. This may have come about because of (a) the abundance of studies in the area of personal and social development which capitalized on the relative accessibility and social importance of groups whose members had been defined as delinquent by judicial procedures, and (b) the ten dency to regard delinquency as a manifestation of disorganization in society as reflected in the activities of juveniles. Shaw and McKay (101), for example, suggested in 1942 that a high proportion of delinquency in children was due to the social conditions in which they were brought up. They pointed to the high intercorrelation between juvenile delinquency and a number of conditions that reflected the presence of a general basic factor which they termed "social disorganization. " The present chapter on the <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> child gives considerable attention to studies dealing with a major current research problem, namely, criterion research leading to better definition of the nature and scope of the concept itself. For the present, social maladjustment may be regarded as representing a congeries of disorders in psychosocial development. The term is thus used here both to refer to disorders in which emotional or personal aspects are prominent and disorders which involve interactive relationships. The literature has been sampled in terms of its bearing on deviant forms of psychosocial development, including juvenile delinquency, but not primarily in terms of juvenile delinquency. Because of the large number of pertinent studies which have appeared in the nine years since the last summary, especially following the close of World War II, no effort is made to present a chronologically representative account. Those trends are emphasized which have emerged as dominant research interests in the period beginning July 1949. Readers who are interested in systematic re views of the field of juvenile delinquency as such may refer to the recent works by Mihanovich (74) and by Tappan (109). Those interested in the processes whereby social disorganization bears upon the individual's pat tern of adjustment may refer to Bloch's (6) recent volume...|$|R

Probably the most difficult area of "exceptionality," to define and explain neatly, is that of the <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> and the emotionally disturbed child. A social and/or emotional problem, primarily one of degree, is usually defined as a moderate to marked reduction in to a child's behavioral freedom, which in turn reduces his ability to function effectively in learning or working with others. Because of its vagueness, the term "emotionally disturbed" is extremely hard to understand, and therefore, some prefer to use "maladaptation" or "maladjustment.

The exceptional child suffers from placement in a regular classroom environment; his ability to concentrate and learn is extremely limited.

The Social Information Processing Model (Crick & Dodge, 1994) has frequently been used to conceptualise the difficulties <b>socially</b> <b>maladjusted</b> children experience, with one proposal being that they selectively attend to hostile or threatening cues in the environment. This study attempted to addresses weaknesses in the traditional methodology used to assess the model's applicability by proposing an alternative methodology, using a dot probe task. Based on the assumptions made by the model, it was hypothesised that children rated as experiencing difficulties, particularly in the form of conduct problems or peer relationships, would demonstrate an attentional bias towards hostile or ambiguous pictures. The hypotheses were tested using a correlational design, with a sample of 72 boys aged 11 to 13 years, recruited from local secondary schools.

It brings them closer to changing their lifestyle (contemplation phase according to Prochaski model) as a result of using constructive strategies of releasing the tension caused by the cognitive dissonance. Thanks to such solutions the program is highly accepted by the participants, what is shown in formative evaluation scores and what is a sort of a paradox of prevention.
