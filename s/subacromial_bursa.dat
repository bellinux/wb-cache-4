40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{analgesic}} efficacy of <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursae</b> block (LA), suprascapular nerve block (SSB), and interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Methods: 91 patients scheduled to undergo an arthroscopic shoulder acromioplasty under GA in an outpatient setting were included. The patients were prospectively randomized into 4 groups: 1) interscalene brachial plexus block, 2) suprascapular nerve block, 3) <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursae</b> block, 4) control group for comparison. Pain scores (VAS), supplemental analgesia, and side effects were recorded in the recoveryroom, 4 hours and 24 hours after sur-gery. Results: Group ISB had significantly lower pain scores at rest in the postanesthesia care unit than the SSB group (p = 0. 037) and the control group (p = 0. 0313). The same results were seen 4 hours follow-up. The LA group had significantly lower pain scores at rest in the postanesthesia care unit than the control group (p = 0. 046) and after 4 hours follow-up significantly lower pain scores than both the SSB group (p = 0. 021) and the control group (p = 0. 037).

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction. Peri-articular {{shoulder}} pathology {{treatment may}} represent a challenge in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus, {{high blood pressure and}} secondary kidney involvment. Systemic pain killers like analgetics or non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may have temporary contraindication. Indeed, corticosteroid peri-articular therapy may be contraindicated or may expose to undesired side effects. Hyaluronic acid derivates {{may represent a}} feasible alternative in these patients. Objectives. To determine corticosteroid versus Hyaluronate derivates <b>subacromial</b> subdeltoid <b>bursa</b> injection short term efficacy and security profile. Material and methods. Ten consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure and symptomatic, ultrasound proven periarticular shoulder pathology underwent either <b>subacromial</b> subdeltiodian intra- <b>bursa</b> corticosteroid (5 patients) or Hyaluronate derivate (5 patients) injection. Clinical pain reduction and functional outcome was evaluated at baseline and during 2 months follow up. Glucose blood levels and blood pressure values were analyzed in the 5 consecutive days after the interventional maneuver. Results. There was a trend in obtaining a quicker clinical response (pain reduction and range of motion improvement) to corticosteroid therapy in comparison with hyaluronate but with similar, significant results for the two therapies at 2 months (p< 0. 005). Glucose levels in patients treated with HA registered a decrease in the next 5 days of follow up. On the contrary, in the CS patient group, glucose levels increased in the next 5 days in all 5 patients, with a trend to reach the baseline levels {{at the end of the}} fifth day.

50|$|Calcific {{bursitis}} {{refers to}} calcium deposits within the bursae. This most {{occurs in the}} shoulder area. The most common bursa for calcific bursitis to occur is the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that reduces friction, and facilitates movements between its adjacent tissues (i.e., between tendon and bone, two muscles or skin and bone). Inflammation of the bursae is called bursitis.|$|E
50|$|Subacromial {{bursitis}} is {{a condition}} caused by inflammation of the bursa that separates the superior surface of the supraspinatus tendon (one of the four tendons of the rotator cuff) from the overlying coraco-acromial ligament, acromion, coracoid (the acromial arch) and from the deep surface of the deltoid muscle.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the involvement of}} the synovial structures of the shoulder girdle of patients who have active symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 2 secondary referral centers of rheumatology. PATIENTS: 13 case-patients who had active symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica seen during a 6 -month period, 9 control-patients who had early symptoms of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis, and 10 age-matched healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was done on the 13 case-patients, 9 control-patients, and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: The frequency of subacromial and subdeltoid bursitis was significantly higher in the case-patients (who had polymyalgia rheumatica) than in the control-patients (who had elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis). The frequencies of synovitis of the joints and tenosynovitis of the biceps did not significantly differ between the 13 case-patients and the 9 control-patients.

40|$|Objective. To {{distinguish}} using shoulder sonography {{the different}} changes present in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and periarticular disorders (PD) of soft tissue of the shoulder. Methods. Ninety shoulders {{of patients with}} RA, 32 with PMR, 122 with PD, and 108 controls were studied sonographically, using a 7. 5 MHz linear probe. The following structures were evaluated: long head of biceps tendon, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, <b>subacromial</b> and subscapularis <b>bursae,</b> rotator cuff (thickness), calcifications, and glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints. Statistical analysis was by Student's t test and chi-squared test. Results. Involvement of long head of biceps tendon (peritendinous fluid collection, changes of thickness, and/or echotexture) was significantly different between RA and PMR and between PD and PMR. Alterations in thickness and/or fibrillar pattern were evaluated in rotator cuff tendons: supraspinatus tendon was involved with significant differences between PD and both RA and PMR; the changes of subscapularis tendon were present, with significant differences between PD and both the other groups; the alterations of infraspinatus tendon were not statistically different between the 3 groups. Effusion within bursae was present, with significant differences only between RA and PD. The mean thickness of rotator cuff was significantly different between controls (6. 2 mm) and both PD (5. 3 mm) and RA (5. 8 mm), and between PMR (6 mm) and PD. Evaluation of effusion within the glenohumeral joint (capsule-bone distance) showed significant differences between controls (2. 4 mm) and both RA (4. 2 mm) and PMR (4 mm), between RA and PD (2. 6 mm), and between PMR and PD. Calcifications were present only in PD (21. 3 %) and RA (6. 7 %), with significant differences. Effusion within the acromioclavicular joint was present in RA (35. 5 %) and PD (20. 5 %), with significant differences. Conclusion.

50|$|The {{literature}} on the pathophysiology of bursitis describes inflammation as {{the primary cause of}} symptoms. Inflammatory bursitis is usually the result of repetitive injury to the bursa.In the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa,</b> this generally occurs due to microtrauma to adjacent structures, particularly the supraspinatus tendon. The inflammatory process causes synovial cells to multiply, increasing collagen formation and fluid production within the bursa and reduction in the outside layer of lubrication (Ishii et al., 1997).|$|E
50|$|The suprahumeral joint (also {{known as}} the subacromial joint) is a {{physiological}} joint formed by an articulation of the coracoacromial ligament {{and the head of}} the humerus. It is formed by the gap between the humerus and the acromion process of the scapula. This space is filled mostly by the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> and the tendon of supraspinatus. This joint plays a role during complex movements while the arm is fully flexed at the glenohumeral joint, such as changing a lightbulb, or painting a ceiling.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{inflammation}} of the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> is relatively rare and may arise from autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis; crystal deposition disorders such as gout or pseudogout; calcific loose bodies, and infection. More commonly, subacromial bursitis arises {{as a result of}} complex factors, thought to cause shoulder impingement symptoms. These factors are broadly classified as intrinsic (intratendinous) or extrinsic (extratendinous). They are further divided into primary or secondary causes of impingement. Secondary causes are thought to be part of another process such as shoulder instability or nerve injury.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is located}} {{anterior}} to the subscapularis muscle and {{inferior to the}} coracoid process. Its function is to reduce friction between the coracobrachialis, subscapularis and short head of the biceps tendons, thus facilitating internal and external rotation of the shoulder. The subcoracoid bursa does not communicate with the glenohumeral joint under normal circumstances, but may communicate with the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> As such, contrast fluid injected into the glenohumeral joint during an arthrogram that extends into the subcoracoid bursa is abnormal, and indirectly implies a full thickness rotator cuff tear.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} small fluid-filled sacs known as {{synovial}} bursae are located around the capsule to aid mobility. Between the joint capsule and the deltoid muscle is the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. Between the capsule and the acromion is the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> The subcoracoid bursa is between the capsule and the coracoid process of the scapula. The coracobrachial bursa is between the subscapularis muscle and the tendon of the coracobrachialis muscle. Between the capsule and the tendon of the subscapularis muscle is the subscapular bursa, this {{is also known as}} the subtendinous bursa of the scapularis. (The supra-acromial bursa does not normally communicate with the shoulder joint).|$|E
50|$|When the arm is raised, the subacromial space (gap {{between the}} {{anterior}} {{edge of the}} acromion {{and the head of}} the humerus) narrows, through which the supraspinatus muscle tendon passes. Anything that causes further narrowing has the tendency to impinge the tendon and cause an inflammatory response, resulting in impingement syndrome. This can be caused by bony structures such as subacromial spurs (bony projections from the acromion), osteoarthritic spurs on the acromioclavicular joint, and variations in the shape of the acromion. Thickening or calcification of the coracoacromial ligament can also cause impingement. Loss of function of the rotator cuff muscles, due to injury or loss of strength, may cause the humerus to move superiorly, resulting in impingement. Inflammation and subsequent thickening of the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> may also cause impingement.|$|E
50|$|Subacromial {{bursitis}} often presents with {{a constellation}} of symptoms called impingement syndrome. Pain along the front and side of the shoulder {{is the most common}} symptom and may cause weakness and stiffness. If the pain resolves and weakness persists other causes should be evaluated such as a tear of the rotator cuff or a neurological problem arising from the neck or entrapment of the suprascapular nerve. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual and {{may or may not be}} related to trauma. Night time pain, especially sleeping on the affected shoulder, is often reported. Localized redness or swelling are less common and suggest an infected <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> Individuals affected by subacromial bursitis commonly present with concomitant shoulder problems such as arthritis, rotator cuff tendinitis, rotator cuff tears, and cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in neck).|$|E
40|$|Degeneration of the {{rotator cuff}} is often {{associated}} with inflammation of the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> and focal mineralization of the supraspinatus tendon. Portions of the supraspinatus tendon distant from the insertion site could transform into fibrous cartilage, causing rotator-cuff tears owing to mechanical instability. Indirect evidence is presented to link this pathology to ectopic production and secretion of bioactive bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) from sites within the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> Surgically removed specimens of <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> tissue from patients with chronic tears of the rotator cuff were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR. Bioactive BMP was detected in bursa extracts by a bioassay based on induction of alkaline phosphatase in the osteogenic/myogenic cell line C 2 C 12. Topical and differential expression of BMP- 2 / 4 and BMP- 7 mRNA and protein was found in bursa tissue. The bioassay of C 2 C 12 cells revealed amounts of active BMP high enough to induce osteogenic cell types, and blocking BMP with specific antibodies or soluble BMP receptors Alk- 3 and Alk- 6 abolished the inductive properties of the extract. Sufficient information was gathered to explain how ectopic expression of BMP might induce tissue transformation into ectopic bone/cartilage and, therefore, promote structural degeneration of the rotator cuff.

40|$|Few {{previous}} studies have investigated the pathomechanism and managements of rotator cuff lesions with shoulderstiffness. Based on observations by Codman in 1934, frozenshoulder presumably relates to rotator cuff tendenitis. In thepast six decades, tended to discriminate primary frozen shoulder from secondary shoulder stiffness due to shoulder disorders such as rotator cuff lesions or trauma. Intrinsic degeneration and outlet acromial spur impingement are reported aspathogenic causes of rotator cuff lesion. Although patientswith rotator cuff lesions with shoulder stiffness or adhesivecapsulitis (frozen shoulder) may have similar complaintsabout pain and motion limitation, the pathological reactions inthese disorders remain unclear. In our investigation of clinicalvignettes of shoulder stiffness, inflammation-mediated adhesions in the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> in rotator cuff lesions, andchanges in inflammatory cytokine levels {{have been linked to}} myofibroblast recruitment inthe <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa.</b> Our study provides the first indication that increased interleukin - 1 βexpression and myofibroblast recruitment in the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> are correlated with rotator cuff lesions with shoulder stiffness. Increased inflammatory cytokine concentrations inthe lesions also provide new molecular insight into the pathological role of the subacromialbursa in the development of shoulder stiffness in rotator cuff lesions. Although rotator cuffrepair is a shoulder-tightening procedure and is not recommended until resolution of theshoulder stiffness in rotator cuff lesions with stiff shoulder, our clinical evidence-based survey suggests that a combined procedure of manipulation, lysis of adhesions, acromioplasty,and rotator cuff repair is a useful procedure if the symptoms do not improve 3 months ofaggressive rehabilitation...|$|E

Strain injury (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2. 3), anterior shoulder pain (AOR 2. 3) and absence of pain with external rotation at 90 º abduction (AOR 3. 9) were the strongest clinical predictors of positive anaesthetic response. Clinical prediction model variables demonstrated 100 % specificity (3 positive tests) but low sensitivity (maximum 40 %) for a positive anaesthetic response. Combinations of 9 other clinical variables also demonstrated 100 % specificity (7 or more positive tests), and improved sensitivity (95 to 100 %) for a PAR compared with clinical prediction model variables when less than two findings were present.

40|$|Many of the {{disorders}} {{in the shoulder}} region are re-lated to the soft-tissue structures surrounding the sub-acromial joint space. Loss of clearance on of normal glid-ing of {{the walls of the}} <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> between the coracoacromial arc above {{and the head of the}} humerus below causes a set of symptoms and signs usually called the painful-arc syndrome 2 ”. The same syndrome also can be caused by several different lesions, of which inflamma-tion or rupture in the tendinous rotator cuff, biceps ten-dinitis, and arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint are the most frequent. This report concerns an unusual cause of a chronic painful-arc syndrome. Case Report A forty-eight-year-old draftsman was seen with a three-year history of pain in the left shoulder both with motion and at rest. and restricted tumor. There was no shoulder tenderness or muscle atrophy. Active ab-duction was restricted to 70 degrees and flexion to 90 degrees; both were intensely painful at the extremes of motion. There was a full range of passive motion in both directions, but with an intensely painful arc from 70 to I 80 degrees. Passive internal and external rotation was not re-stricted but was painful, and subacromial crepitus was palpable when ro-tation was tested with the shoulder in 90 degrees of abduction. Routine roentgenograms and arthrography of the shoulder joint were normal. Routine blood studies also were normal.

40|$|The {{majority}} of patients who complain of a painful shoulder are suffering either from periarthritis, ‘ ‘ frozen shoulder, ‘ ‘ or from a supraspinatus lesion. Lesions of the supraspinatus tendon at or close to its insertion, where it is intimately associated with the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa,</b> {{give rise to a}} characteristic combination of symptoms-the supraspinatus syndrome-which are mechanical in origin. In the middle range of abduction movement the tendon impinges on the overlying lrocesses and the tendon and bursa are compressed between t he humerus and acromion (Fig. 1). When there is abnormality of the tendon or bursa this pressure causes pain, anti any movement which tends to bring the lesion into contact with the acromion causes reflex muscle spasm. The supraspinatus syndrome is usually character-istic, although in its later stages it may be complicated by true limitation of shoulder movement, due partly to disuse and partly to adhesion formation in the region of the sub-acromial bursa, vhich masks the typical symptoms and complicates both diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|Shoulder region {{injection}} procedures can {{be beneficial}} {{in patients with}} osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders. These procedures can yield important diagnostic information, especially when identification of the pain generator via physical examination is limited due to pain-related guarding. Injections also can provide good therapeutic benefit directly and indirectly by allowing the patient to participate more meaningfully in physical therapy. As discussed in detail later in this article, some injection procedures can be performed in the examination room {{as part of a}} routine office visit, whereas others may require fluoroscopic guidance. From the perspective of injection procedures, the shoulder-girdle region can be conceptualized as being divided into anterior, lateral, and posterior regions (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The important structures that can be injected anteriorly are the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, the glenohumeral (GH) joint, the bicipital tendon sheaths, the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa,</b> the sternoclavicular (SC) joint, and the subcoracoid bursa.

40|$|Diagnosing {{shoulder}} pain {{conditions is}} a challenging area of musculoskeletal practice. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a clinical syndrome that indicates pain and pathology involving the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> and rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space. The three stages of SIS are subacromial bursitis, partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears. The cause of SIS {{is believed to}} be multi-factorial with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in its pathogenesis. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed SIS using a clinical examination including a subjective history followed by confirmatory clinical tests. A review of the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests highlights that individual tests have poor diagnostic accuracy. A combination of clinical tests or a clinical examination per se may be useful at ruling out rotator cuff tears, but is less accurate at detecting rotator cuff tears when it is present. There is consensus in the literature that particular combinations of signs and clinical features may be useful in diagnosing rotator cuff tears but not for diagnosing SIS. The vast majority of research to date examining the clinical diagnosis of SIS has been focused on individual clinical tests carried out by medical practitioners in specialist and tertiary care settings. This review has established that the majority of diagnostic accuracy studies for SIS and rotator cuff tears have had poor methodological design. This exploratory study was conducted with subjects undergoing a standardized clinical examination (index test) by a physiotherapist. The decision as to which specific tests were chosen for this research was based on supporting research within the literature and the test’s actual use within the New Zealand clinical setting. This included subjective history questions, active and passive shoulder movement tests and eleven SIS tests. Subjects were referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan immediately following the clinical examination and results from the scan stood as the criterion reference standard. Thirty eight individuals (males n= 23, females n= 15) with new onset shoulder pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed by a participating physiotherapist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and respective 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of the examination. Individual variables from the clinical examination were tested for their association with the diagnostic ultrasound scan reference criterion using Pearson Chi-Squared Exact test. Potential predictor variables were retained as potential predictors for use in the logistic regression analysis to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination variables for diagnosing SIS and the individual pathological stages of SIS. The results indicate that no historical, subjective or objective features from the clinical examination are accurate in diagnosing SIS or rotator cuff tears. The presence of night pain demonstrated a significant correlation (P< 0. 02) with the criterion reference standard for the presence of <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching. Night pain and pain with overhead activity has a high sensitivity for <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching being present. The absence of night pain and the absence of pain with overhead activity are two subjective phenomena from a clinical examination that are useful in ruling out <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching being present. Night pain was also found to be the best predictor of <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching being present (P< 0. 012). Male gender (P< 0. 034) was the best predictor of partial thickness rotator cuff tears while being 60 years of age or older (P< 0. 01) significantly correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears. The Drop Arm Sign (P< 0. 01) and External Rotation Lag Sign (P< 0. 01) were significantly correlated with SIS and full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical tests for all three pathological stages of SIS and <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching being present, had equivalent or if not greater diagnostic accuracy than previous report studies in the literature. The Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Sign can be used in the primary care setting to rule out the presence of <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> fluid/bunching or SIS if the tests are negative. For mid to end stage SIS (rotator cuff tears) the Empty Can Test and Drop Arm Sign with their high sensitivity can be used to rule out rotator cuff tears especially to the supraspinatus tendon when the tests are negative. Despite the small sample size and other limitations of this study, the findings are an important addition to the current literature surrounding the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for SIS and rotator cuff tears. This is the first study to use physiotherapists as examiners and to be set in a primary care setting. The study is also the first to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a range of historical and subjective features from the clinical examination. The results found in the current study could be used by future studies as a starting point {{in the development of a}} clinical decision or prediction rule to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tears...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technical}} tip for {{the improvement}} of the arthroscopic treatment of symptomatic calcifying tendinitis is described. Arthroscopic excision of calcifying tendonitis may result with multiple minute calcific debris in the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa,</b> causing severe post operative pain due to chemical irritation of the bursa. We suggest the use of a bladeless shaver barrel as a "Hoover" (vacuum cleaner) for arthroscopic clearance of these miniature calcific debris from the subacromial space after resection of the major deposits. The use of this technique resulted in good clinical outcome with improved post operative pain...|$|E
40|$|A short {{historical}} {{survey of}} periarthritis {{of the shoulder}} {{is followed by a}} lengthy discussion {{of the structure of the}} shoulder joint and the periarticular tissues. It is particularly these tissues which deserve special attention. Not only is great stress laid on their importance, but also the incorrect description of the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> in most anatomical atlases is pointed out. This bursa, together with the supraspinatus tendon and the tendon of the long head of the biceps play an important part as periarticular tissues in bringing about periarthritis of the shoulder.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the additive effects of hyaluronidase combined with steroids {{in patients with}} peri-articular shoulder disorder. Method Thirty patients with peri-articular shoulder disorder were given <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> injections {{once a week for}} three consecutive weeks. Fifteen patients (Group A) underwent <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa</b> injections with hyaluronidase 1, 500 IU, triamcinolone 40 mg and 0. 5 % lidocaine (total 6 ml). Another fifteen patients (Group B) underwent the same injections with triamcinolone 40 mg and 0. 5 % lidocaine (total 6 ml). We examined the active range of motion (AROM) in the shoulder, used a visual analogue scale (VAS) for measurement, and administered a shoulder disability questionnaire (SDQ) at the commencement of the study and then every week until one week after the third injection. Results There were no significant difference between group A and B before the injections took place (p> 0. 05). Statistically significant improvement was seen in the VAS, SDQ, and AROM of flexion, abduction, internal rotation at one week after the first and second injections compared with the parameters measured at previous visits in both groups (p 0. 05). Improvement in all parameters measured at one week after the third injection compared with the measurement values at one week after the second injection were not statistically significant in both groups (p> 0. 05).

30|$|The major {{drawback}} {{of using}} a hook plate is requirement of another surgery for removal of implant. Though there were no complications in our study, the hook plates can cause disturbances over the <b>subacromial</b> <b>bursa,</b> supraspinatus tendinitis, disturbances over the plate end and acromial osteolysis, if retained for long time. We were able to avoid these complications by timely removal of the implant. The limitation of our study is a relatively small sample size (thirty-three) and absence of a control group. A major advantage of our study was that the entire population group of soldiers was homogenous with similar functional requirements.|$|E
