40|$|Many {{factors have}} {{effect in the}} process of forming and {{happening}} violent behaviors. Most important of them are indefensible and violence-oriented spaces (sites and spheres). Indefensible spaces have many characteristics that differentiated in two categories: physical and social. From point of view of urban designers and architects, physical characteristics and from view of sociology and psychology scientists, social characteristics play role in disposing spaces in happening violence. Present article is prepared based on findings of a qualitative research conducted through an observation technique using 12 indefensible spaces selected within 108 indefensible spaces in the city of Tehran as units of observation. Observation conducted in 9 month period of time. This 12 general urban spaces concluded: thievery (hejrat boulevard, atabak street, valiasr park), affraying (asadabadi street, bahar street beside, valiasr cross), contention (moghaddam square, abouzar square, 22 th bahman park), bag robbery (seyyed khandan bridge, shariati park, khaje abdollah ansari street). Results indicate that existing of proper light and lack of building density are characteristics that separate spaces with robbery from other spaces. Lack of relation bond between visible spaces, bouffant and <b>sunken</b> <b>point</b> in city, having obvious bound and confine and low building are characteristics that separate spaces with contention from other spaces. Sequence and tension separate affray spaces from other spaces...|$|E
50|$|Recent archaeological digs have {{uncovered}} fragments of Mycenaean/Late Helladic pottery together with Proto-Apennine and Apennine material, {{pointing to a}} Middle Bronze Age trading site (emporium). Surveys around the coast, have established <b>sunken</b> coastal installations, <b>pointing</b> to extensive fishing and trading facilities, now up to 18m below the waterline. It is assumed that the lowest of these installations predate the Avellino eruption of Vesuvius, {{while some of the}} later ones may be associated with the Late Helladic material found elsewhere around the island.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground plan}} {{is created by}} a long {{rectangle}} made from five bays. The exterior of the nave is relatively stern, decorated by only ten massive load-bearing pillars. These pillars are reinforced by sandstones blocks and strapped in lower third with shaped moulding. On the tops of rests there {{is a combination of}} the counter and saddle shelters. Corner load-bearing pillars are built diagonally. Great windows of the nave provide great illumination of space of the church. Wide trough stone moulding is original. There are visible also some stonemasons' marks. There used to be a window in the western side of the church which was walled up in the 16th century and nowadays it is hidden under the plastering. The nave is ended by steep triangular gable walls in the west and the east. The western gable wall is segmented by three <b>pointed</b> <b>sunken</b> niche. Two entrance portals lead to the nave from the north.|$|R
50|$|While the Sunken city {{is one of}} {{the main}} attractions of the coastal area, nearby are other {{historic}} areas that also draw the public in. With a short walk from the west area of the <b>Sunken</b> City is <b>Point</b> Fermin Park, which hosts a large space of green meadows that leads to the Point Fermin Lighthouse (17). In addition, just north of the park is the Korean Friendship Bell, which was donated from Korea to the United States in 1976 (17). The view that the Sunken City has to offer is mainly what attracts and brings many people to visit the area regardless of the “no trespassing” signs and the large fence that is meant to deter the public from exploring. The Sunken City offers many visual sights to enjoy, as you can find tide pools that are filled with purple urchins inhabiting the area and even seals that may be sun bathing (2). In addition, the Sunken City presents the scenic view of the Pacific Ocean as well as Catalina Island, where people can also spot ships sailing along the coast of Los Angeles’s port (2).|$|R
30|$|Tanaka (1936) and Tseng (1941) {{reported}} {{the occurrence of}} Galaxaura rudis Kjellman in Taiwan (as Formosa) and Hainan Island, respectively. Based on their descriptions, the specimens from these two localities showed undifferentiated non-tumid basal cells (i.e., supporting cells of assimilatory filaments). Thus, both authors argued that these specimens were morphologically distinct from G. rudis. Afterward, when Chou (1945) proposed the new species, G. filamentosa, she suggested that the specimens from Taiwan and Hainan Island {{should be treated as}} synonyms of G. filamentosa because their cortical structures are extremely similar. This study shows that the cortical structure of the specimen from the Philippines is highly similar to that of G. filamentosa from Taiwan and Hainan Island. The size of G. filamentosa from these three locations is small and ranges between 2 and 4 cm (more often less than 2.5 cm) in height. It is also noteworthy that Svedelius (1953) showed that the gross morphology of G. filamentosa from Hawaii comprises two different types, the tufted type and the freely growing type. Most tufted-type specimens were 1.5 cm high and crowded together. In contrast, the freely growing type could grow up to 3 cm in height. Consistent with the observations on G. filamentosa (as G. rudis) by Tanaka (1936) and Tseng (1941), most G. filamentosa specimens from Hawaii examined by Svedelius (1953) are “obtuse at the apex”. Svedelius (1953) also reported that G. filamentosa lacks the <b>sunken</b> growing <b>point</b> at the tip of branch and lacks fertile structures. This study shows that these unique morphological features may not be surprising when considering that G. filamentosa might be the remaining part of the tufted villous branches of G. pacifica. It will be interesting to test this hypothesis if G. filamentosa-type plants are more common in the tropical region of the Pacific Ocean while G. pacifica-type plants are more common in the subtropical or temperate region of the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
40|$|The mobile water hyacinth, {{which was}} {{produced}} in growth zones, especially Murchison bay, was mainly exported to three sheltered storage bays (Thruston, Hannington and Waiya). Between 1996 and May 1998, the mobile form of water hyacinth occupied about 800 ha in Thruston bay, 750 ha in Hannington bay and 140 ha in Waiya bay). Biological control weevils and other factors, including localised nutrient depletion, weakened the weed that was confined to the bays and it sunk around October 1998. The settling {{to the bottom of}} such huge quantities of organic matter its subsequent decomposition and the debris from this mass was likely to have environmental impacts on biotic communities (e. g. fish and invertebrate), physico-chemical conditions (water quality), and on socio-economic activities (e. g. at fish landings, water abstraction, and hydro-power generation <b>points).</b> <b>Sunken</b> water hyacinth debris could also affect nutrient levels in the water column and lead to reduction in the content of dissolved oxygen. The changes in nutrient dynamics and oxygen levels could affect algal productivity, invertebrate composition and fish communities. Socio-economic impacts of dead sunken weed were expected from debris deposited along the shoreline especially at fish landings, water abstraction and hydropower generation points. Therefore, environmental impact assessment studies were carried out between 1998 and 2002 in selected representative zones of Lake Victoria to identify the effects of the sunken water hyacinth biomass...|$|R
30|$|The thalli {{comprise}} {{two distinct}} forms: 1) glabrous-type individual (Figure  5 A, 5 C) and 2) villous-type individuals (Figure  6 A). Glabrous-type thalli are light-red or pink {{in color and}} up to 6 cm high at full maturity. There are no gross morphological differences between female (Figure  5 A) and male plants (Figure  5 C). Villous-type thalli are dark-red in color and up to 2.5 cm in height. Both types of thalli initially consist of a primary cylindrical axis that originated from a discoid holdfast. The holdfast diameter is approximately 1 - 3 mm. The initial primary terete axis continuously develops several terete branches. These branches are produced in a dichotomous or subdichotomous manner. The length of internodes is 5 - 15 mm, and the width of branches is 1 - 2 mm. Branches in the glabrous-type thallus are smooth in the upper portion (Figure  5 A, 5 C) and villous in the lower portion of the thalli (Figure  5 B, 5 H), whereas the branches in the villous-type thallus are hairy throughout (Figure  6 A). Both types of thalli show light to heavy calcification in the cortical and medullary parts. Different cortical sections on the terminal branches of the glabrous area show different degrees of calcification that subsequently lead to the appearance of annulations (Figure  5 D). The {{cross section of the}} branches from the glabrous-type plants (i.e., gametophytes) and that from the villous-type plants display two different cortical structures. The first type can be observed from the smooth portion of the glabrous-type thallus (Figure  5 E- 5 F) wherein growth is apical with a <b>sunken</b> growing <b>point</b> (Figure  5 E). Young cortical initials on the apex of glabrous branches are slender (Figure  5 E) and then develop into a three cell-layers (Figures  5 F, 7 B). The outermost layer consists of highly pigmented epidermal cells 12 - 18 (20) μm in diameter (Figures  5 F, 7 B). The middle layer is composed of slightly larger cells that are 25 - 38 μm in width and 30 - 40 μm in length (Figures  5 F, 7 B). The innermost layer consists of the largest cells which are 25 - 50 μm in width and 38 - 105 μm in length (Figures  5 F, 7 B). In the surface view the outermost cortical cells show 4 - 6 sided and angular cells. Each cell contains one well-developed stellate chromatophore with a large central pyrenoid (Figures  5 G, 7 A). The second cortical type can be observed from the villous branches of the lower section of the glabrous-type thalli (Figure  5 B, 5 H, 5 L) and the villous-type thalli (Figures  6 A- 6 B). The cross-sectioned inner part of the branch is the medulla (Figures  5 I, 6 C, 7 C), which comprises heavily calcified dense medullary filaments (Figure  5 I). The inner layer of the cortex shows a mixture of medullary and assimilatory filaments (Figures  5 J, 6 D, 7 C). The outer layer of the cortex is composed of 10 - to 50 -celled, long assimilatory filaments (Figures  5 I- 5 J, 6 C- 6 D) that arise from an undifferentiated, non-swollen basal cell (Figures  5 K, 6 E). These long assimilatory filaments are dense and up to 1 mm long at distal portions of villous branches, but are scarce at the lower part of villous branches (Figures  5 H, 6 B). Overall, there are no obvious differences in the cortical structures between the villous branches in {{the lower part of the}} glabrous-type thalli and the villous-type thalli. The assimilatory filament growth pattern of G. pacifica differs from that in the villous-type thalli of G. rugosa, which possessed two different kinds of assimilatory filaments: long (5 - to 12 -celled) and short (2 - to 3 -celled) assimilatory filaments (for details, see Figure  6 d in Wang et al. 2005). The swollen basal cell from which the assimilatory filaments of G. rugosa are derived was not observed in the villous branches of G. pacifica. For the glabrous-type thalli, young glabrous branches are issued from the tip of villous branches (Figure  5 L). The cortical structure transforms from the early production of assimilatory filaments to the subsequent production of a 3 -celled cortex (Figure  5 M- 5 N). Following transformation, the medullary filaments become less compact in the glabrous branch compared to those in the villous branch (Figure  5 M- 5 N).|$|R
