40|$|Traffic {{management}} decisions and automation supporting those decisions currently lack accurate departure demand information. Future departure demand is typically predicted using the <b>scheduled</b> <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> {{of each individual}} flight, which are shown to be poor estimates of actual <b>departure</b> <b>times.</b> This paper describes an approach to improve the prediction of parking gate <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> for individual flights, thereby improving the knowledge of departure demand at longer prediction horizons. The approach uses air carrier-provided data about when certain milestones in preparing for departure are completed. Actual times for pre-departure events are compiled in advance from historical data. These statistics are then used to improve gate <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> predictions in real-time. This paper presents an algorithmic approach for applying pre-departure event times to improve gate <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> predictions for individual flights and applies the method using Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) messages from a large domestic air carrier at a busy airport. Results show the benefit of applying this pre-departure information to two existing automation systems that predict gate <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> – the Surface Management System and the Enhanced Traffic Management System. The application of ACARS data using the proposed algorithm provides a 36 % improvement to the gate <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> predictions. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In all-optical packet switching, packets may {{arrive at}} an optical switch in an uncoordinated fashion. When {{contention}} occurs, fiber delay lines (FDLs) are needed to delay (buffer) the packets that have lost in the contention to some future timeslots for the desired output ports. There have been several optical-buffered switch architectures and FDL assignment algorithms proposed in the literature. However, most of them either have high implementation complexity or fail to <b>schedule</b> in advance <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> for the delayed packets. In this paper, we study the packet scheduling algorithms for the single-stage shared-FDL optical packet switch. We propose three new FDL assignment algorithms, namely sequential FDL assignment (SEFA), multi-cell FDL assignment (MUFA), and parallel iterative FDL assignment (PIFA) algorithms for the switch. Our algorithms can make FDL and output-port reservation so as to <b>schedule</b> <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> for packets. Owing to FDL and/or output-port conflicts, the packets that fail to be scheduled are discarded before entering the switch {{so that they do}} not occupy any FDL resources. We show by simulation that with these algorithms, the optical-buffered switch can achieve a loss rate of ~ 10 − 7 even at the load of 0. 9. These algorithms are extended to the three-stage Clos-network optical packet switches in our companion paper.

40|$|Aircraft {{departing from}} an airport {{are subject to}} {{numerous}} constraints while <b>scheduling</b> <b>departure</b> <b>times.</b> These constraints include wake-separation constraints for successive departures, miles-in-trail separation for aircraft bound for the same departure fixes, and time-window or prioritization constraints for individual flights. Besides these, emissions as well as increased fuel consumption due to inefficient scheduling need to be included. Addressing all the above constraints in a single framework while allowing for resequencing of the aircraft using runway queues {{is critical to the}} implementation of the Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen) concepts. Prior work on airport <b>departure</b> <b>scheduling</b> has addressed some of the above. However, existing methods use pre-determined runway queues, and schedule aircraft from these departure queues. The source of such pre-determined queues is not explicit, and could potentially be a subjective controller input. Determining runway queues and scheduling within the same framework would potentially result in better scheduling. This paper presents a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the departure-scheduling problem. The program takes as input the incoming sequence of aircraft for departure from a runway, along with their earliest <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> and an optional prioritization scheme based on time-window of departure for each aircraft. The program then assigns these aircraft to the available <b>departure</b> queues and <b>schedules</b> <b>departure</b> <b>times,</b> explicitly considering wake separation and departure fix restrictions to minimize total delay for all aircraft. The approach is generalized and {{can be used in a}} variety of situations, and allows for aircraft prioritization based on operational as well as environmental considerations. We present the MILP in the paper, along with benefits over the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheme for numerous randomized problems based on real-world settings. The MILP results in substantially reduced delays as compared to FCFS, and the magnitude of the savings depends on the queue and departure fix structure. The MILP assumes deterministic aircraft arrival times at the runway queues. However, due to taxi time uncertainty, aircraft might arrive either earlier or later than these deterministic times. Thus, to incorporate this uncertainty, we present a method for using the MILP with "overlap discounted rolling planning horizon". The approach is based on valuing near-term decision results more than future ones. We develop a model of taxitime uncertainty based on real-world data, and then compare the baseline FCFS delays with delays using the above MILP in a simple rolling-horizon method and in the overlap discounted scheme...|$|R

40|$|Aerodynamic {{efficiency}} of intermodal freight trains can be significantly improved by minimizing the adjustedgap lengths between adjacent loads. This paper first develops a static model to optimize load placement on {{a sequence of}} intermodal trains that have <b>scheduled</b> <b>departure</b> <b>times.</b> This model applies when full information on all trains and loads is available. Then, we develop a dynamic model {{to account for the}} more realistic situation in which there is incomplete or uncertain information on future trains and incoming loads. This paper develops methodology to balance between (i) the advantage from optimizing multiple trains together and (ii) the risk of making suboptimal decisions due to incomplete future information. We propose a rolling horizon scheme to address this challenge, where exponentially decreasing weights are assigned to the objective functions of future trains. Numerical results based on empirical data show significant aerodynamic efficiency benefits from these optimization models.

40|$|In airport {{departure}} operations, some aircraft <b>departure</b> <b>schedules</b> {{are more}} challenging to achieve than others requiring identical numbers of aircraft to depart {{in a similar}} amount of time. In particular, some schedules are “stacked,” in that they require multiple departures within relatively short time intervals, in contrast to “uniform” <b>schedules</b> in which <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> are relatively evenly spaced throughout the departure window. Metrics capturing {{the degree to which}} departure distributions are uniform versus stacked (statistically, uniform versus nonuniform) may provide a quantitative measure useful for predicting on-time departure performance, or equivalently, for predicting <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> deviations. This paper describes how Shannon’s entropy metric was used for this purpose.
