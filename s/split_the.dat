50|$|The thin wires {{separating}} the scoring sections {{on the board}} occasionally overlap slightly, due to the manufacturing process.

For example, if <b>the</b> dart <b>splits</b> <b>the</b> wires {{separating the}} two and three point zones, the player is awarded three points. If <b>the</b> dart <b>splits</b> <b>the</b> wires separating the three point zone and the blue ring, the player is credited with three points.|$|R

5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby <b>split</b> <b>the</b> prokaryote domain.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic {{reduction}} is a numerical method for solving large linear systems by repeatedly <b>splitting</b> <b>the</b> problem.

5|$|Cartier {{continued}} to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry {{stepped down as}} Head of Drama in 1961, he lost much of his creative independence. Barry's successor, Sydney Newman, abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and <b>split</b> <b>the</b> responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as Maigret and Z-Cars.|$|E

5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then <b>split</b> <b>the</b> fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To <b>split</b> <b>the</b> sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>split</b> revealed <b>the</b> right and left currents within the organization, a lack {{of the experience of}} internal dialogues and democratic standards meant that <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> currents could not define their ideological, political and organizational differences. This led to more <b>splits</b> within <b>the</b> ranks of the Majority and Minority.|$|R
