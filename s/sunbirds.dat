5|$|The Red panda, Clouded leopard, Siberian weasel, Asiatic black bear, barking deer, Himalayan tahr, goral, gaur and {{pangolin}} {{are some}} of the fauna found near Kalimpong. Avifauna of the region include the pheasants, cuckoos, minivets, flycatchers, bulbuls, orioles, owls, partridges, <b>sunbirds,</b> warblers, swallows, swifts and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and <b>sunbirds,</b> many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sunbirds</b> and spiderhunters {{are very}} small {{passerine}} birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed.|$|E
50|$|Aethopyga is a genus {{of birds}} in the Nectariniidae family. Species in this genus are found in South Asia, Southeast Asia and parts of China. Many species such as the grey-hooded <b>sunbird,</b> Mount Apo <b>sunbird,</b> metallic-winged <b>sunbird,</b> {{handsome}} <b>sunbird</b> and Lina's <b>sunbird</b> are endemic to the Philippines.|$|R

50|$|The Palestine <b>sunbird</b> or {{northern}} orange-tufted <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris osea) {{is a small}} passerine bird of the <b>sunbird</b> family {{which is}} found {{in parts of the}} Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also known as orange-tufted <b>sunbird,</b> a name which is also used for the similar orange-tufted <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris bouvieri), found further south in Africa. It is the national bird of Palestine.|$|R
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, <b>sunbirds,</b> lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E
25|$|The pendant nest is an {{elongated}} sac woven of pliable {{materials such as}} grasses and plant fibers and suspended from a branch. Oropendolas, caciques, orioles, weavers and <b>sunbirds</b> are among the species that weave pendant nests.|$|E
25|$|Although {{hummingbirds}} are {{the most}} familiar nectar-feeding birds for North Americans, there are analogous species {{in other parts of}} the world: <b>sunbirds,</b> honeyeaters, flowerpeckers, honeycreepers, bananaquits, flowerpiercers, lories and lorikeets. Hummingbirds are the oldest group, with the greatest degree of specialization on nectar. Flowers attractive to hummingbirds that can hover in front of the flower tend to be large red or orange tubes with a lot of dilute nectar, secreted during the day. Since birds do not have a strong response to scent, they tend to be odorless. Perching birds need a substantial landing platform, so <b>sunbirds,</b> honeyeaters, and the like are less associated with tubular flowers.|$|E
50|$|The Tsavo <b>sunbird</b> is 9.5 to 10 cm (3.75 to 4 inches) long. The bill is down-curved {{and rather}} short for a <b>sunbird,</b> {{especially}} {{compared to that}} of the otherwise similar Marico <b>sunbird.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>SunBird</b> 200 was {{the name}} of a {{specific}} model of <b>SunBird</b> brand boats. The <b>SunBird</b> 200 is 20 feet (6 m) long and was available in both cubby cabin and open bow options. It has a 3.5 liter 175 hp V6 I/O Volvo engine. This made repair very difficult, because less than 2% of all boats contain a Volvo engine and thus {{it was hard to get}} spare parts. The <b>SunBird</b> 200 is not to be confused with the 200 Sundancer, a drastically different boat manufactured by Sea Ray. The <b>SunBird</b> 200 is no longer in production, as <b>SunBird</b> went out of business in the late 1990s.|$|R

25|$|Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows, larks, thrushes, cisticolas, <b>sunbirds,</b> {{and some}} raptors, {{including}} the large wedge-tailed eagle. A number of bird {{species have been}} introduced by humans; some, like the European goldfinch and greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species, while others, such as the common starling, common blackbird, house sparrow and Indian mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests of}} the {{district}} have excellent wild life habitats. A variety of animals and birds can be found.

Malabar grey hornbill and great Indian hornbill are found. Wide variety of other birds such as <b>sunbirds,</b> woodpeckers and kingfishers can also be seen.|$|E
25|$|The rat's tail babiana (Babiana ringens) is {{a species}} of plant that {{produces}} a strong stalk within the inflorescence {{that serves as a}} perch for the malachite sunbird as it visits the flower.

5000|$|The Ruwenzori double-collared <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris stuhlmanni), {{also called}} Stuhlmann's <b>Sunbird</b> or Rwanda double-collared <b>sunbird,</b> is {{a species of}} bird in the Nectariniidae family.

It is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the greater double-collared <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris afer). Some authors consider this bird {{to be part of a}} species complex with Cinnyris afer, where it joins Ludwig's double-collared <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris ludovicensis) and Prigogine's double-collared <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris prigoginei).

25|$|In zoophily, {{pollination}} {{is performed}} by vertebrates such as birds and bats, particularly, hummingbirds, <b>sunbirds,</b> spiderhunters, honeyeaters, and fruit bats. Ornithophily or bird pollination is the pollination of flowering plants by birds. Chiropterophily or bat pollination is the pollination of flowering plants by bats. Plants adapted to use bats or moths as pollinators typically have white petals, strong scent and flower at night, whereas plants that use birds as pollinators tend to produce copious nectar and have red petals.|$|E
25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, <b>sunbirds</b> and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
