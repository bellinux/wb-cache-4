5000|$|The {{process of}} [...] "humification" [...] can occur {{naturally}} in soil, {{or in the}} production of compost. Organic matter is degraded into humus by a combination of mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria, microbes and animals such as earthworms, nematodes, protozoa and various arthropods. The importance of chemically <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> is thought by some to be the fertility it provides to soils in both a physical and chemical sense, though some agricultural experts put a greater focus on other features of it, such as its ability to suppress disease. It helps the soil retain moisture by increasing microporosity, and encourages the formation of good soil structure. The incorporation of oxygen into large organic molecular assemblages generates many active, negatively charged sites that bind to positively charged ions (cations) of plant nutrients, making them more available to the plant by way of ion exchange.

5000|$|Much of the humus in most soils {{has persisted}} {{for more than}} a hundred years (rather than having been {{decomposed}} to CO2), and can be regarded as stable; this is organic matter that has been protected from decomposition by microbial or enzyme action because it is hidden (occluded) inside small aggregates of soil particles or tightly attached (sorbed or complexed) to clays. [...] Most humus that is not protected in this way is decomposed within ten years and can be regarded as less stable or more labile. Thus <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> contributes little to the pool of plant-available nutrients in the soil, but it does play a part in maintaining its physical structure. A very stable form of humus is formed from the slow oxidation of blue carbon, after the incorporation of finely powdered charcoal into the topsoil.

40|$|Population growth, rapid {{strides in}} {{urbanization}} and industrialization {{as well as}} inadequate expertise and infrastructures have made the management of solid waste {{as one of the}} most critical environmental issues in developing countries like India. It is estimated that more than 60 % of the waste generated in such countries have the ultimate fate to reach the dumping sites. The unscientific disposal of waste causes adverse impacts on all components of environment. The deterioration of soil and water quality due to leachates in the areas near open dumping sites has been well documented. Besides, evidences are also being accumulated to show increased concentration of various pollutants like pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins in such areas. Consequently, the management of solid waste needs to be revamped in order to protect the living beings and to make certain the healthy existence of the environment for long time. The first step for sustainable solid waste management is the segregation of waste on site of generation of waste; where in, the recyclable wastes are separated from those of organic waste and other inorganic waste. In further seggregation, the organic wastes are sent for compositing and vermicompositing. Compositing is degradation of organic wastes by biological means under controlled aerobic/anaerobic conditions to form <b>stable,</b> odorless <b>humus</b> like end product whereas vermicompositing is a bio-oxidative process of decomposition of organic waste involving the combined action of earthworms viz., Amynthas morrisi, Dendrovena veneta, D. bolaui, Eisenia andrei, E. foetida etc. and other soil microorganisms.

The tracers were previously used to calibrate a new version of Momos, a microbial biomass (MB) and decomposition model. MB is growing by ingestion of labile (VL) and stable (VS) plant materials as well as labile (HL) and <b>stable</b> (HS) <b>humus,</b> and is decreasing by respiration (CO 2 output) and mortality (input into HL). The fallow production model Faprom estimates biomass production, standing dead mass, and soil C input from plant mortality and potential root exudation. This work aimed to address three objectives: (1) use parameter values calibrated on C- 14 transformations to predict total C changes in soils, (2) quantify by simulations the C storage and turnover from new C- 12 inputs from roots, (3) split inputs from root death into VL and VS, direct root exudation into MB. These objectives were attained except (2) in the humic soil of the paramo, for which total C or MB-C predictions were not significantly improved by root-C input. The method described here is a new tool to predict in situ C input from roots (even when a production model is lacking) and the resulting C turnover for soils with moderate C stock. Experimental data could be improved by optimizing contact between roots and soilbags and enhancing the repeatability of MB-C measurements. Momos predicts half-lives of MB-C and HL-C labile compartments to be about 2 years in the puna and 35 - 80 y in the paramo.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} status of soil organic carbon in newly shaped soils called Velká podkrušnohorská dump in the Sokolov {{district}} and evaluate the information in relation to the physic-chemical properties of soils. Another objective was to determine the relationship between the stable and labile fractions of soil organic carbon. The amount of soil carbon (stable fraction) was measured in the solid soil samples and there was the analysis of basic physic-chemical parameters of the soil performed. The highest concentration of soil carbon was measured in the stand alders and larch. The amount of soil carbon (labile fraction) was measured in the water extract. The highest values were measured in the stand silver birch and alders. Based on this data the quotient of the labile fraction from the stable fraction was determined and the correlation of the labile and stable fractions was made. It was found out that the higher quality soils are located at the leafy trees, but it leads to leaching of organic carbon. The bulk density and coarse-grained soil fraction was determined from the physical properties and these data were used to calculate the stock of soil organic carbon. The highest value was measured in deciduous forests with small-leaved linden, in coniferous forests with larch. The stocks of soil organic carbon were converted into codes by land cover categories and the thematic map was created. It was found out that the leafy trees are much more appropriate for forest restoration, because they are characterized by the rapid initial growth, easily degradable plant litter and <b>stable</b> form <b>humus.</b> Deciduous forests are also characterized by more developed soil substrate, which is however unstable...|$|R

The following data were collected: soil moisture, total 14 C and 15 N and microbial biomass (MB) - 14 C and - 15 N, daily rainfall, air temperature and total radiation. Daily soil moisture was predicted using the SAHEL model. MOMOS- 2 to - 4 (type 1 models) use kinetic constants and flow partitioning parameters. MOMOS- 2 can be simplified to MOMOS- 3 and further to MOMOS- 4, with no {{significant changes in the}} prediction accuracy and robustness for total- 14 C and - 15 N as well as for MB- 14 C and - 15 N. MOMOS- 5 (type 2 models) uses only kinetic constants: three MB-inputs (from labile and stable plant material and from humified compounds) and two MB-outputs (mortality and respiration constants). MOMOS- 5 did not significantly change the total- 14 C and - 15 N predictions but markedly improved the predictive quality and robustness of MB- 14 C and - 15 N predictions (with a dynamic different from the predictions by other models).

30|$|Surface runoff {{is causing}} {{phosphorus}} (P) losses from soil {{which is responsible}} for eutrophication of water bodies (Pote et al. 1999). A well-established correlation between agricultural P losses to surface waters and eutrophication has been reported (Cassell et al. 1998; Correll 1998). Phosphorus application can result in increased risk of P delivery to surface waters. Application of excessive manure to soils for the longer period increases the P level in soil and/or surface water (Sharpley et al. 2004). Phosphorus is added to soil in the form of organic waste (Brogan et al. 2001). The use of poultry litter on the agricultural lands with elevated P levels needs special management. Fresh poultry litter may quickly release P in soil, whereas stable forms of organic matter may slowly release P sources. Composting is a biological process of decomposition in which organic matter is transformed to a <b>stable</b> product like <b>humus.</b> The process is carried out by microbes, which use organic waste for food and energy purposes (Chefetz et al. 1998). Composting of organic wastes is important due to the environmental and community constraints and enhanced agronomic value. McDowell and Sharpley (2003) reported the potential of soil P losses into runoff after application of P-containing materials. The release of P from soil to runoff has been well reported by the kinetics of P desorption from soil (Sharpley et al. 1981; Garcia-Rodeja and Gil-Sotres 1997). The salient P mobility controlling factors in surface runoff are transport and source such as manure or fertilizer (Pote et al. 1996; Sharpley et al. 1993). Runoff from cropland areas receiving poultry litter or compost may enhance P concentrations in water bodies (Eghball et al. 1996). The environmental issues related to poultry manure and agricultural residues application could be alleviated by composting before application to agricultural fields. Therefore, the present research was aimed to assess P losses from soils amended with poultry litter after co-composting with agro-wastes.|$|R

The use of manure energy by microorganisms—microbial activity—is a natural process of decomposition. Except in extreme cases of cold, pH, or lack of water, biological decomposition is inevitable. Microbial activity can create {{a wide range of}} byproducts. By storing, handling, or treating manure in various ways, farmers can control the byproducts produced by this biological activity. This is important to a farmer desiring to manage nutrients, control manure odors, increase ease of manure handling, or create a marketable product. Manure Contains Energy In a sense, agriculture is all about managing energy flow (Figure 1). This energy flow begins when solar energy is captured by growing crops. Farm animals, in turn, use the energy contained in crops to build body mass and produce milk or eggs. Some energy is lost through respiration and heat from the animal’s body. The remaining energy is excreted in manure. This excreted energy becomes a food source for microorganisms that live in the manure. Once the microorganisms deplete the available energy, the manure can no longer support microbial activity. At this point, the manure will not decompose further, and is considered “biologically stable. ” heat and respiration heat and respiration byproducts and <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> body mass animal products manure Figure 1.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} {{considerable}} research on organic carbon (OC) {{stocks in the}} upper layer of the soil but it has focused on semi-mechanistic predictions of OC stocks {{in the long term}} rather than on microbial processes acting on OC transformations. Published data lack of reference concerning the modelling of the short-term exchanges between atmosphere, plants, rhizobia and other microorganisms of soil. We think it is because the mechanistic role of microorganisms is poorly considered in most of the existing models. Compartmental theory is the most used to model the complex system of OC forms, with linear or no-linear propositions. Sometimes, the models did not consider explicitly an active microbial compartment and were often over parameterized. In contrast, the MOMOS proposition defined linearly the functional role of microorganisms with only a no-linear term linked to microbial respiration. It uses only 7 kinetic parameters having a clear ecological definition and being related to climate (all parameters), soil texture or pH (microbial respiration), and biological properties of debris inputs (enzymatic breakdown of plant debris and microbial mortality). The 3 other parameters (rates of humus stabilisation and enzyme assimilation of labile and <b>stable</b> <b>humus)</b> were found linked only to climate, suggesting that quality of humified materials should be more constant than OC forms from living materials. In coupling with soil water and production modules, the model emerges as a new theoretical basis to describe the life cycle and its applications to agro-ecology and global change...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{nitrogen}} (N) {{is often}} combined with carbon (C) in organic molecules, C passes {{from the air}} to the soil through plant photosynthesis, whereas N passes from the soil to plants through a chain of microbial conversions. However, dynamic models do not fully consider the microorganisms at the centre of exchange processes between organic and mineral forms of N. This study monitored the transfer of C- 14 and N- 15 between plant materials, microorganisms, humified compartments, and inorganic forms in six very different ecosystems along an altitudinal transect. The microbial conversions of the N- 15 forms appear to be strongly linked to the previously modelled C cycle, and the same equations and parameters {{can be used to}} model both C and N cycles. The only difference is in the modelling of the flows between microbial and inorganic forms. The processes of mineralization and immobilization of N appear to be regulated by a two-way microbial exchange depending on the C : N ratios of microorganisms and available substrates. The MOMOS (Modelling of Organic Matter of Soils) model has already been validated for the C cycle and also appears to be valid for the prediction of microbial transformations of N forms. This study shows that the hypothesis of microbial homeostasis can give robust predictions at global scale. However, the microbial populations did not appear to always be independent of the external constraints. At some altitudes their C : N ratio could be better modelled as decreasing during incubation and increasing with increasing C storage in cold conditions. The ratio of potentially mineralizable-N- 15 /inorganic-N- 15 and the N- 15 stock in the plant debris and the microorganisms was modelled as increasing with altitude, whereas the 15 N storage in <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> was modelled as decreasing with altitude.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} linking {{soil respiration}} to {{climate and soil}} physical properties are important for modelling transformation and sequestration of C and N in the soil. We investigated them by incubating 14 C and 15 N labelled straw in soils of the dry puna (Bolivian altiplano, semi-arid shrubland at 3789 m above sea level) and the humid paramo (Venezuelan tropical alpine vegetation at 3400 m). These two ecosystems of the high Andes are comparable in terms of altitude, mean temperature and land use, but are very different regarding organic matter content, rainfall patterns and soil physical properties. Total 14 C and 15 N, microbial-biomass 14 C and 15 N, soil moisture and meteorological data were recorded over 2 years. Daily soil moisture was predicted from a water balance model. The data from the paramo site were used to calibrate MOMOS- 6, a model of organic matter decomposition based on microbial activity and requiring only kinetic constant parameters to describe: (i) inputs to microbial biomass from plant debris and microbial metabolites, and (ii) losses from the biomass by mortality and respiration (respiration coefficient and microbial metabolic quotient qCO 2). The simulated qCO 2 – 14 C agrees well with qCO 2 – 14 C and qCO 2 measured at the calibration site and with published data. To apply MOMOS- 6 to the puna site, only the respiration coefficient of the biomass was re-estimated. The dynamics of 14 C and 15 N were very different in the two systems. In the puna, the transformation processes stop during the long dry periods, though total annual mineralization is greater than in the paramo. The change {{in the value of}} the respiration coefficient enables us to predict that the amount of C and N sequestered in the <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> is greater in the paramo than in the puna.

Rate and extent of immobilization and remineralization of N decreased with increased complexity of the plant residues/components; maximum being observed for glucose and minimum for lignins. Immobilization and remineralization turnover of N was used to determine dynamics of microbial biomass as well as to test assumptions used for its quantification with chloroform fumigation method. Chloroform fumigation was found to cause a substantial increase in the extractability and mineralization of non-biomass N. Quality of plant residues had a significant bearing on mineralization of N and its interaction with native soil N. Residues with narrow C/N ratio and high content of labile C had a positive effect on release of N from soil organic matter and its availability to crop plants. A substantial and real added nitrogen interaction was observed following application of fertilizer N (more for NH 4 than NO 3) and leguminous plant residues. In plant experiments, the interaction was exhibited by a substantial increase in root biomass especially under salinity stress. Higher amounts of N were released from leguminous plant residues in the presence of NH 4 than NO 3. Residues from cereal crops like rice and wheat had a negative effect on the plant availability of N from soil organic matter rather than from applied fertilizer.

One proposed solution to mitigate the large percentage of poverty in the country is micro-entrepreneurship. A compost micro-enterprise is a small business, which collects organic raw material and processes it into <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> material for the purpose of applying to soils to increase crop yields. Developing such micro-enterprises could not only indirectly improve current soil nutrient deficiencies specific to the region, but also provide alternative incomes for the already agriculturally involved community. The success or failure of enterprises practicing composting may be measured by a plethora of figures or outcomes. Employee characteristics are one variable that should be taken into consideration when estimating the efficiency of an agricultural enterprise's operations and productivity. While a variable, such as an employee characteristic, {{may not be able to}} be quantified exactly it should be argued that this variable can have a structural impact on productivity. Another crucial variable considered when developing such a micro-enterprise is accounting for its input and output. It is explained the issue of costs within micro-enterprises is complex and should be considered not only in terms of fees but also in terms of payments in any kind, such as entry and exit presence, and the duration of the apprenticeship. When an enterprise has failed to account for its various inputs and consequent output, it has become unsustainable because it has not satisfied basic economic, social and security needs presently and for its future. This study identified and described employee characteristics and documented the inputs and outputs of compost micro-enterprises in Chimaltenango, Guatemala. The study found that employee characteristics, particularly gender, age, and occupation affected a micro-enterprise's access to markets as well as row materials, and how efficiently tasks were completed. Costs of labor, raw material, transport, packaging, energy and the location the micro-enterprise itself heavily influenced profitability.

30|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{technique is}} widely used for determining the maturity in vermicompost material. Gieguzynska et al. (1998) and Sellami et al. (2008) suggested three important regions where exact absorbance could be measured in the UV-vis spectra: (1) the absorption at 280  nm indicates {{the beginning of the}} transformation of lignin and aliphatic compounds, (2) the absorption at 472  nm indicates the beginning of organic macromolecules depolymerisation and humification, and (3) the absorption at 664  nm is an indication of a highly humified material {{with a high degree of}} aromatic compounds and oxygen content in the stabilization phase. Ravindran et al. (2013) performed UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of humification during vermicomposting of fermented animal fleshing waste. The absorbance ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 4 / 6 and Q 2 / 4) in all treatments decreased and reached minimum at the end. The humification index decreased in treated mixtures with earthworms compared to that in the treated mixtures without earthworm. Low humification index in the final vermicompost indicates a high level of organic material humification. Lim and Wu (2015) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to determine the degree of humification during vermicomposting of palm oil industry effluent. The UV-vis spectra of the final vermicompost showed wider shoulder as compared to initial waste mixtures, reflecting the maturity of the final vermicompost. The results indicated that both the humification index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) were lower in the final vermicompost as compared to initial wastes. The decreases in humification index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) indicates decomposition and degradation of organic compounds by earthworms. Hussain et al. (2016 b) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of humification during vermicomposting of toxic parthenium weed. The results reveal that the humification index (Q 4 / 6) values of initial parthenium weed (7.29) were reduced (1.89) after vermicomposting. The reduction in the humification index of final vermicomposted parthenium weed indicates weed’s transformation into a strongly humified and matured material. Hussain et al. (2016 c) also confirmed the high level of humification during the vermicomposting of toxic and allelopathic ipomoea weed. The findings indicated that the humification index (Q 4 / 6) values of toxic weed reduced from 7.74 to 1.90 in the final vermicompost. The fall of humification index achieved after vermicomposting of ipomoea weed indicates high level of humification by earthworms.

The experiment was installed in young (2 yr) and old (7 yr) fallow plots. The following soil analyses were performed at nine sampling occasions: soil moisture, total-C- 14 and -N- 15, and Microbial Biomass (MB) -C- 14 and -N- 15. The measured data were fitted by the MOMOS- 6 model (a process based model, with five compartments: labile and stable plant material, MB, and labile (HL) and <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> (HS)) coupled with the SAHEL model (soil moisture prediction) using daily measured and/or predicted meteorological data. The aim was to understand how (1) the climatic conditions, (2) the quality of plant material, (3) the fallow age and (4) the soil properties affect the cycling of C and N within the soil organic matter system. The fallow age (2 and 7 yr) {{did not affect the}} measured data or the model predictions, indicating that in these systems the decomposition potential is not affected by fallow length. During the short initial active decomposition phase, the labile plant material was quickly exhausted, enabling a build up of MB and of HL. During the low activity phase, that covered 4 / 5 of the time of exposure, the MB size decreased slowly and the HL pool was progressively exhausted as it was reused by the MB as substrate. The HL compartment was directly or indirectly the major source for the inorganic N- 15 production. If the ON ratio of the added plant material increased, the model predicted (1) a reduction of the decomposition rates of the plant material (essentially the stable plant material) and (2) an increased mortality of the MB which increased the production of HL (microbial cadavers and metabolites). Thus the essential effect of the slower decomposition due to the N-poor plant material was a higher accumulation of C and N in the HL and its slower recycling by the MB during the low activity phase. The labelling experiment allows to understand the higher soil native organic matter content in Paramo soils compared to Puna. The large sequestration of organic matter generally observed in the Paramo soils can be explained by two abiotic factors: the unfavourable soil microstructure and the accumulation of free aluminium linked to the climatic and acid soil conditions, inhibiting the microbial activity physically and chemically.

The experiment was installed in young (2 yr) and old (7 yr) fallow plots. The following soil analyses were performed at nine sampling occasions: soil moisture, total- 14 C and - 15 N, and Microbial Biomass (MB) - 14 C and - 15 N. The measured data were fitted by the MOMOS- 6 model (a process based model, with five compartments: labile and stable plant material, MB, and labile (HL) and <b>stable</b> <b>humus</b> (HS)) coupled with the SAHEL model (soil moisture prediction) using daily measured and/or predicted meteorological data. The aim was to understand how (1) the climatic conditions, (2) the quality of plant material, (3) the fallow age and (4) the soil properties affect the cycling of C and N within the soil organic matter system. The fallow age (2 and 7 yr) {{did not affect the}} measured data or the model predictions, indicating that in these systems the decomposition potential is not affected by fallow length. During the short initial active decomposition phase, the labile plant material was quickly exhausted, enabling a build up of MB and of HL. During the low activity phase, that covered 4 / 5 of the time of exposure, the MB size decreased slowly and the HL pool was progressively exhausted as it was reused by the MB as substrate. The HL compartment was directly or indirectly the major source for the inorganic 15 N production. If the C:N ratio of the added plant material increased, the model predicted (1) a reduction of the decomposition rates of the plant material (essentially the stable plant material) and (2) an increased mortality of the MB which increased the production of HL (microbial cadavers and metabolites). Thus the essential effect of the slower decomposition due to the N-poor plant material was a higher accumulation of C and N in the HL and its slower recycling by the MB during the low activity phase. The labelling experiment allows to understand the higher soil native organic matter content in Paramo soils compared to Puna. The large sequestration of organic matter generally observed in the Paramo soils can be explained by two abiotic factors: the unfavourable soil microstructure and the accumulation of free aluminium linked to the climatic and acid soil conditions, inhibiting the microbial activity physically and chemically. 2162 - 2177 pansu@mpl. ird. f...|$|E
