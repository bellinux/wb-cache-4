40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> and household finances {{using data from the}} British Household Panel Survey. We explore how <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> influences the probability of holding different types of unsecured debt and assets, as well as how <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> influences the levels of unsecured debt, financial assets and net worth held. Our findings suggest that <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> has a positive influence upon the types of financial assets held, which is particularly pronounced for the holding of stocks and shares. <b>Social</b> <b>interaction</b> is also found to influence the amount of financial assets held as well as the level of household net worth.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Social</b> <b>interaction</b> history {{refers to}} traces of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> in {{information}} spaces. These traces have potential to help users explore and navigate through information spaces. In digital spaces, however, past records of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> are often hidden or underutilized. As a result, users cannot use social navigation {{to guide their}} movement while browsing information collections. We developed a conceptual framework for using <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> history to improve information exploration. The basic hypothesis of our framework is that <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> history {{can serve as a}} good indicator of the potential value of information items. We tested our hypothesis by performing statistical analysis of a data set from a social web application.

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> is modeled as a {{consumer}} good. <b>Social</b> <b>interaction</b> may provide an externality {{in the form of}} social capital, but the primary reason that individuals engage in <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> is that these activities directly yield utility. It {{is important to note that}} some measures of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> show declines while many do not. A model of household production is employed to derive the demand for <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> The model shows that the demand for <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> is a function of its price, the price of other goods and income. The role of children and marriage in <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> can also be explained in the model. The theory is tested with data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the results show that <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> can be explained as the consequence of utility maximizing behavior by individuals. Increases in education generally increase memberships but reduce visiting with relatives and friends. Increases in income generally increase memberships and some forms of visiting. The model predicts 70 percent, or more, of the time trends in <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> These results are in contrast to social capital theorists who have focused on the declines in <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> and who have attributed these changes to factors such as increased community heterogeneity and increased television viewing. ...|$|R

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effect of <b>social</b> <b>interaction,</b> if offered as a mutually exclusive choice to drugs of abuse, are under-investigated. In a rat place preference conditioning (CPP) paradigm, four 15 min episodes of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> with a gender- and weight matched male early-adult conspecific inhibited cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP, a model of relapse. These protective effects of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> were paralleled by a reduced activation, as assessed by Zif 268 expression in brain areas known to play pivotal roles in drug-seeking behavior. Here we show that <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> during extinction of cocaine CPP also reduced cocaine-CPP-stimulated FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and core. In addition, <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> during cocaine CPP extinction increased pCREB (cAMP response element binding protein) expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and the cingulate cortex area 1 (Cg 1). Our results show that FosB and pCREB may be implicated in the protective effect of <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> against cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP. Thus, <b>social</b> <b>interaction,</b> if offered in a context that is clearly distinct from the previously drug-associated one, may profoundly inhibit relapse to cocaine addiction...|$|R

5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E

As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
