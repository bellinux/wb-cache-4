5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called <b>steel</b> <b>factor</b> receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> receptor interacts chemically with <b>steel</b> <b>factor</b> or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

40|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the protein}} {{product of the}} Steel locus in the mouse, is a {{multifunctional}} signal for the primordial germ cell population. We have shown previously that its expression accompanies the germ cells during migration to the gonads, forming a "travelling niche" that controls their survival, motility, and proliferation. Here we show that these functions are distributed between the alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble forms of <b>Steel</b> <b>factor.</b> The germ cells normally migrate as individuals from E 7. 5 to E 11. 5, when they aggregate together in the embryonic gonads. Movie analysis of Steel-dickie mutant embryos, which make only the soluble form, at E 7. 5, showed that the germ cells fail to migrate normally, and undergo "premature aggregation" {{in the base of}} the allantois. Survival and directionality of movement is not affected. Addition of excess soluble <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> to Steel-dickie embryos rescued germ cell motility, and addition of <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> to germ cells in vitro showed that a fourfold higher dose was required to increase motility, compared to survival. These data show that soluble <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> is sufficient for germ cell survival, and suggest that the membrane-bound form provides a higher local concentration of <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> that controls the balance between germ cell motility and aggregation. This hypothesis was tested by addition of excess soluble <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> to slice cultures of E 11. 5 embryos, when migration usually ceases, and the germ cells aggregate. This reversed the aggregation process, and caused increased motility of the germ cells. We conclude that the two forms of <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> control different aspects of germ cell behavior, and that membrane-bound <b>Steel</b> <b>factor</b> controls germ cell motility within a "motility niche" that moves through the embryo with the germ cells. Escape from this niche causes cessation of motility and death by apoptosis of the ectopic germ cells...|$|E

By introducing, with a retroviral vector, a normal EPO-R cDNA into murine adult bone marrow cells, we showed that EPO is also able to induce proliferation in pluripotent progenitor cells.

Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the burst disks to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the burst disk. These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless <b>steel.</b> <b>Factors</b> that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability.

PHSC activity was measured as long-term erythroid and lymphoid competitive repopulating ability. Cells {{to be tested}} (usually marrow or spleen cells from treated donors) were mixed with untreated competitor marrow that pro-duces erythrocytes and lymphocytes that are genetically dis-tinguishable from the donors by differences in hemoglobin (Hb) and glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) markers. These cell mixtures were injected into lethally irradiated hosts, and after 111 t o 293 days, functional abilities of donor PHSC populations were assessed and expressed as percentages of donor-type Hb and GP 1 in the host’s circulating erythro-cytes and lymphocytes, respectively. A striking increase i...|$|R

40|$|The Purpose of {{this study}} to {{identify}} the factors influences housing cost in low cost housing projects in Sana’a the capital of Yemen. A questionnaire survey {{has been used as}} the tools to carry out this study. The questionnaire survey consisted of 32 factors which were grouped into five major categories named; land factors, materials used factors, construction methods used factors, finishing works factors and external factors. The level of importance of the categories was measured and ranked the relative importance weights. This study found that land cost factor, cement cost <b>factor</b> and <b>steel</b> cost <b>factor</b> are the most important factors influencing housing cost in Sana’a. Based on the analysis of the ranking and intensity of a housing cost factors, this paper suggests possible improvements that could be made in order to decrease the housing cost...|$|R
