His body was <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> a chair and leaning {{forwards}} onto the table.

It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E

She also approved controversial covers from {{a new crop of}} artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover that had people buzzing about the meaning of a punk rock passenger <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> the backseat of an elegant horse-drawn carriage: was it Brown's self-mocking riposte to fears she would downgrade the magazine? A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increasing}} urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> {{most cities}} {{in developing countries}} continues to attract attention of national and international agencies but the efforts had not achieved much result at checking the sprawl. There is the need therefore to re-evaluate these efforts and make necessary suggestions that would reverse the trend. This study investigates the problems of urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. It utilizes published and unpublished materials as well as sundry informal investigations (i. e. observations) of the stakeholders {{in the development and}} management of urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> Nigerian cities. The paper presents the urbanization trends in Nigeria and discusses the characteristic features of urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> its cities as well as identifies the various factors responsible for the urban sprawl. It evaluates strategies adopted so far at curtailing the sprawl. A major limitation of the various strategies adopted is the inadequate involvement of the people (developers) at checking the sprawl. The paper therefore suggests a people-oriented strategy <b>in</b> checking urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> Nigerian cities; which is expected to be facilitated by the government planning officials...|$|R

The statue depicts Orr <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> mid-flight after scoring the goal. The unveiling {{was attended by}} many of Orr's past teammates. Orr spoke at the unveiling: [...] "This specific moment and time we celebrate with this statue is something we can all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time we enter Boston Garden.

5000|$|The {{more recent}} {{phenomenon}} of urban sprawl across American {{cities such as}} Phoenix and Los Angeles, were only made possible under the conditions of a car culture. [...] The impact of this car culture and resulting urban sprawl is, according to academics, threefold. First, although urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> both shrinking and growing cities have many similar characteristics, <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> relation to declining cities may be more rapid with an increasing desire {{to move out of}} the poor, inner-city locations. [...] Second, there are many similarities in the characteristics and features of suburban areas around growing and declining cities. [...] Third, urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> declining cities can be contained by improving land use within inner city areas such as implementing micro-parks and implementing urban renewal projects. There are many similarities between urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> relation to both declining and growing cities. This, therefore, provides similar intervention strategies for controlling sprawl from a city planning point of view.|$|R
2500|$|Reports {{initially}} {{stated that}} Nagai {{was hit by}} stray bullets fired by soldiers or possibly shot from the front. The [...] "stray bullet" [...] explanation was proposed {{by the government of}} Myanmar as an explanation for Nagai's death. However, video footage obtained by Japanese television appears to show a Burmese soldier shoving Nagai to the ground and shooting him at point-blank range. A still image photographed by Adrees Latif showed the soldier standing over Nagai, who was sprawled on the ground and still clutching his camera. This photograph appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on September 28, 2007. A subsequent shot showed Nagai's body <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> the street as the soldier walked away. Judging from the patch, the soldier responsible is believed to be from one of the Light Infantry Divisions (possibly LID 66) in charge of crowd control in Yangon at the time of protests. At the Japanese embassy in Myanmar, a physician established the trajectory of the fatal bullet that killed Nagai, determining that the bullet entered Nagai's chest from the lower right side and pierced his heart before exiting from his back.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the First World War he led his regiment, with two {{squadron}}s of the 4th Dragoon Guards, in a charge at Elouges on 24 August 1914, as part of the Battle of Mons. He later participated in the final [...] "lance on lance" [...] action of the war on 7 September 1914 at Moncel when he led a charge of two troops of B Squadron of his Regiment and overthrew a squadron of the 1st Guard Dragoons. In this second charge, Campbell was wounded several times; the medical officer of the 4th Dragoon Guards, Captain Arthur Osburn, found him <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> a field of clover and treated him for [...] "a revolver wound in his leg, a lance wound in his shoulder, and a sword wound in his arm". Despite this, Campbell told the doctor [...] "I've just had the best quarter of an hour I've ever had in my life!" [...] In November 1914 Campbell was promoted to command 6th Cavalry Brigade, then in May 1916 came further promotion to command 21st Division. He retained that command for the rest of the war. His divisional staff gave him the further nickname of [...] "Barbara", the reason for which is no longer known.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, Greswell {{played in}} all 16 of Somerset's County Championship matches, plus the {{game against the}} Australians. He also {{appeared}} in amateur sides put together by H. D. G. Leveson Gower against both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and in an end-of-season Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough. In the season as a whole he took 94 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.10 runs per wicket. [...] "Wiseacres, <b>sprawled</b> <b>in</b> their canvas chairs in front of the Stragglers Bar at Taunton, stroked leathery faces and said he would walk into the England team," [...] says one account of that first full season. What made Greswell's bowling different was the very late movement that he achieved off the pitch. Bowling at [...] "deceptively languid medium pace", he also used a lot of swing: [...] "He could exploit the element of surprise without appearing to try. He could knock over leg stumps and orchestrate dolly catches to short leg." [...] The possibility of a call-up to the England Test side was not fanciful: in the Somerset match against the Australians at Bath, he took four Australian wickets for 11 runs in 13 overs, and the Australians, set just 68 to win the match, scraped home with only two wickets to spare. And the England selectors in 1909 were not averse to experimentation: later in the season, they picked Douglas Carr, another novelty bowler also in his first season of full-time cricket. Greswell did particularly well in two of the season's more visible matches. For Leveson Gower's team against Cambridge University at Eastbourne, he took six for 108 in the first innings and seven for 62 in the second: this was his first 10-wicket match (13/170), though this was a 12-a-side game (but still regarded as first-class). Then, in Somerset's match against Middlesex at Lord's, he took three for 59 and six for 96, and also hit exactly 100 in 75 minutes – the only century of his career.|$|E

40|$|Urban Sprawl {{is a broad}} concept, {{with many}} {{different}} definitions about what indicates <b>sprawl.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we analyze <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> the Öresund Region, focusing mainly on the Swedish region Skåne. Typical indicators for <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> Scandinavia, particularly in the Öresund Region, are: satellite towns serving as residential suburbs for bigger surrounding cities (Malmö, Lund and Copenhagen) with low-density building and low mixed-use, linear development along railroads and railways, high commuting and automobile dependence. The analysis of the spatial planning systems shows how urban development in Denmark and Sweden is happening {{and what kind of}} opportunities the municipalities have to prevent sprawl. Against this background, we evaluate projects and ambitions of our analyzed municipalities for future urban development and look at other influences which cause urban <b>sprawl</b> <b>in</b> the municipalities in Skåne. Accordingly, we consider connections between transport policies/systems - as a determinant for urban development - and the spatial planning of the municipalities. The regional integration in the Öresund Region is also analyzed as a determinant for sprawl, since this integration has several impacts on urban development in the municipalities. Concepts, policies, projects and current realities are, this way, analyzed to enlighten a clearer picture of the shape <b>sprawl</b> is taking <b>in</b> the Öresund Region...|$|R
