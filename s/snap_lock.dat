50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>snapping</b> is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of {{cylinder}} lock, such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. <b>Lock</b> <b>snapping</b> involves applying a strong torque force to the lock cylinder, usually {{with a pair of}} locking pliers, thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to <b>snap</b> the <b>lock</b> and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from <b>lock</b> <b>snapping.</b>|$|R

50|$|Stenosing {{tenosynovitis}} (also {{known as}} trigger finger or trigger thumb) is a painful condition {{caused by the}} inflammation (tenosynovitis) and progressive restriction of the superficial and deep flexors fibrous tendon sheath adjacent to the A1 pulley at a metacarpal head. Repetitive forceful compression, tensile stress, and resistive flexion, causes inflammation, swelling, and microtrauma, that results in thickening (commonly a nodular formation) of the tendon distal to the pulley and stenosis of the tendon sheath leading to a painful digital base, limitation of finger movements, triggering, <b>snapping,</b> <b>locking,</b> and deformity progressively.|$|R
50|$|Navel jewelry {{has become}} more {{extensive}} in recent years. Many new designs, such as the ancient Bali jewelry designs, {{have been added to}} everyday navel cultures. Barbells remain the most common. The world's first belly huggy was designed and patented by TummyToys navel rings. Vogue fashion published an article in 2015 about the circular captive bead belly rings and TummyToys <b>snap</b> <b>lock</b> clasps becoming the current trend for navel piercings. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing. Navels are most often pierced with a 14g curved barbell, which is recommended to be worn until the piercing has fully healed, the healing time is typically anywhere between 6 - 12 months. A wide variety of decorative jewelry is available for navels - simple curved barbells, captives, TummyToys belly huggies, flexible PTFE and fancy long length styles with dangling pendants. Currently, real diamond and solid gold belly rings are also available {{in a wide range of}} styles. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing, both for top and bottom piercings.|$|E
40|$|Chip-trays are plastic {{containers}} that are 50. 5 cm long by 5. 5 cm wide by 3. 5 cm deep, and contain 20 compartments - or cells - {{that can be}} closed with a <b>snap</b> <b>lock</b> lid. Traditionally used by geologists (e. g. to store drill core fragments), for the past 5 years we have routinely used chip trays {{in a range of}} soil applications including soil survey, forensic investigations and mineralogical studies. This paper, however, focuses on recent adaptations to acid sulfate soil (ASS) protocols that rely on the use of chip-trays, which offer significant improvements to field sampling and soil storage, and provide the means for a new laboratory incubation method of ASS materials to better characterise and classify ASS types, including hypersulfidic, hyposulfidic and sulfuric materials. The chip tray-based improvements to ASS protocols have found use {{in a wide range of}} projects in diverse Australian ASS landscapes (e. g. coastal, and inland upland, wetland and riverine environments). For example, characterising hydro-toposequences, constructing ASS processes models and use in ASS risk assessment protocols.

40|$|Congenital {{dislocation}} of the radial head (CDRH), a {{congenital anomaly}} of the elbow, can cause {{symptoms such as}} joint stiffness, <b>snapping,</b> <b>locking,</b> or pain, however the diagnosis is sometimes made incidentally from x-rays.

This paper presents a case of unilateral CDRH that was asymptomatic until adolescence, when <b>locking</b> and <b>snapping</b> developed. Several treatment options are described in the literature. Although the conventional and computer-assisted external fixator systems are used in several clinical pictures such as extremity deformities, joint contractures and fixation of acute fractures etc a computer-assisted external fixator system has not been used for CDRH.

5000|$|Historicopous, trigger fingers, or trigger digit (also a sub-set of stenosing tenosynovitis) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} characterized by catching, <b>snapping</b> or <b>locking</b> of the involved finger flexor tendon, associated with dysfunction and pain.

40|$|Background. Trigger finger is {{characterized}} by sometimes painful <b>snapping</b> or <b>locking</b> when flexing the finger. Although trigger finger is frequently seen in clinical practice, no standard treatment protocol has been established as “best practice. ” Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to achieve consensus on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline for trigger finger. Design. A European Delphi consensus strategy was initiated. Systematic reviews reporting on the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical interventions were con-ducted and used as an evidence-based starting point for this study. Setting. In total, 35 experts (hand therapists and hand surgeons selected by the national member associations of their European federations and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians) participated in the Delphi consensus strategy. Measurements. Each Delphi round consisted of a questionnaire, an analysis, and a feedback report. Results.

After prolonged and fruitless efforts the intense cold began to chill me, and being well aware of the great danger of getting benumbed, or of falling into that torpid state of indifference to life, coupled with intense desire for rest which precedes death from cold, I made up my mind at once, tired and hungry though I was, to turn round and walk straight back to the fort.|$|R

On another occasion she was shot at several times, which only slowed her down temporarily. She appears to be trained in combat as well. When tapping into her full Banshee persona, Jeannette transforms into a black and white being, very similar to the Silver Banshee.
