5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
25|$|Sorbitol is a <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute,</b> {{and when}} used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).|$|E
25|$|One {{packet of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> {{is equal to}} 1 dessertspoon (2 teaspoons). For most {{substitutes}} the number of sweetener packets that might safely be used daily is between 9 and 75 packets for a 60 kg (132 lb) person.|$|E
25|$|Cost and {{shelf life}} – Many <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are cheaper than <b>sugar.</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are often lower in total cost {{because of their}} long {{shelf-life}} and high sweetening intensity. This allows <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> {{to be used in}} products that will not perish after a short period of time.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commonly}} consumed {{foods with}} <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are diet sodas, cereals, and sugar-free desserts such as ice cream. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> {{are found in}} many products today due to their low or non-caloric characteristics. This {{can be used to}} market a product to dieters or those conscious of their sugar intake, such as consumers with diabetes. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> such as xylitol and saccharin have many positive research results that show qualities of dental decay prevention, which causes them to be popular for use in chewing gums and toothpaste.|$|R

25|$|A <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> is a food {{additive}} {{that provides}} a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{use as a}} <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> in reduced-sugar foods, Sorbitol is {{also used}} as a {{humectant}} in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process.|$|E
25|$|Tab was Coca-Cola's {{first attempt}} to develop a diet soft drink, using {{saccharin}} as a <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute.</b> Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of Diet Coke. The Tab soft drink is difficult to locate in recent times, due to its de facto replacement by Diet Coke.|$|E

25|$|A sugar packet is a {{delivery}} method for one 'serving' of sugar. Sugar packets are commonly supplied in restaurants and coffee bars in preference to sugar bowls or sugar dispensers {{for reasons of}} neatness, spill control, {{and to some extent}} portion control. In 1957, the sugar packet that consisted of a granulated low-calorie <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute,</b> was invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, the founder of Cumberland Packing or better known today as the Sweet 'N Low company.|$|E
25|$|Lead acetate (sometimes called sugar of lead) is an {{artificial}} <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> made from lead {{that is of}} historical interest because of its widespread use in the past, such as by ancient Romans. The use of lead acetate as a sweetener eventually produced lead poisoning in any individual ingesting it habitually.

There have been cases of foods, candies and gums containing xylitol causing toxic or even fatal liver damage in dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Sucralose is an {{artificial}} sweetener and <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute.</b> The majority of ingested sucralose is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times as sweet as both aspartame and [...] acesulfame potassium, and twice as sweet as sodium saccharin. [...] Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term weight loss with some data supporting weight gain and heart disease risks.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> have {{sweet taste}} (like sugar), {{but have no}} {{calories}} or carbohydrates. The artificial sweeteners don’t contribute to weight gain, don’t cause decay and don’t raise blood sugar levels. Since <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are many times sweeter than sugar, only small amounts are needed to sweeten foods and beverages. All, except saccharin, are approved as safe for use during pregnancy. The aim of the studi was to make research based on the questions: are the artificial sweeteners healthy and how each of them influence on oral health. For realisation of the study aim, research of the scientific base (PubMed, Medline and MedScape) was made. The generic name, chemical structure, product name and details, positive and negative attribute, will be shown as table chart. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> have been thoroughly tested by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been established as safe for use as tabletop sweeteners or as ingredients in foods and beverages.

2500|$|In Korea, maesil-cheong ( [...] , [...] "plum syrup"), an {{anti-microbial}} syrup made by sugaring ripe plums, {{is used as}} a condiment and <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute.</b> It can be made {{by simply}} mixing plums and sugar together, and then leaving them for about 100 days. To make syrup, the ratio of sugar to plum should be at least 1:1 to prevent fermentation, by which the liquid may turn into plum wine. The plums can be removed after 100 days, and the syrup can be consumed right away, or mature for a year or more.|$|E
2500|$|Eating natural sugars like glucose and sucrose {{instead of}} a <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> can have {{negative}} health effects. The consumption of added sugars has been positively associated with multiple measures known to increase cardiovascular disease risk amongst adolescents as well as adults. The calories contained in sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to increases in body weight and body fat, and replacement of sugar by artificial sweeteners reduces weight. Obesity contributes to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Glucose has a high glycemic index, sucrose medium, and fructose low. There is evidence that sugar-sweetened beverages [...] "may {{increase the risk of}} metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes not only through obesity but also by increasing dietary glycemic load, leading to insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and inflammation," [...] according to a 2010 meta-analysis.|$|E

Some older Manasir still prefer to drink their tea along with a handful of Wad Laqai dates as the traditional <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute.</b> The dates should be left to dry on the tree, because of difficulties to remove the ripe fruits without causing adjacent dates from the same bunch (Shakhlub, شخلوب) to fall off prematurely. Another peculiarity of the Wad Laqai type is that its fruits should not be pollinated before reaching the green stage (Dafiq, دفيق). They are also considered most sensitive and therefore difficult to harvest. If fresh dates are picked others on the bunch easily turn into Karmush ...|$|E
40|$|Low- and no-calorie sugar subtistutes are {{compounds}} that provide food with its sweet taste. As the term suggests, they have lower or no food energy and usually {{are characterized by}} higher sweetness than sucrose. For that reason, these substances are especially used during the treatment of diabetes mellitus, to reduce the energy content of food or in prevention of dental caries. Natural sweeteners were discovered a long time ago, during the search for sustenance. For example Stevia was used by South American Natives even before the European conquest of the territory. However, the history of artificial sweeteners is not too significant, because it relates to breaking the laboratory rules. That is how saccharin was invented in 1878. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are added to food on purpose, adjusting the taste or extending the shelf life of foods. In the EU, every approved sweetener has got an E-code, which is displayed on the label. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> can be grouped according to their origin, their nutrition value or their chemical structure. This thesis discusses low- and no-calorie <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> that can be synthetic or natural. Mentioned synthetic sweeteners typically contain less then 21 kJ per portion. These intensive food additives possess many times the sweetness of sucrose. The main representatives of this group are saccharin, cyclamate, acesulfame K, sucralose and aspartame with its derivatives. The group of natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> constits of substances like erythritol, D-tagatose, trehalose, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, stevioside and thaumatin. There are some limitations confirmed by expert studies. For example, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus should mainly use synthetic sweeteners, because of their low nutritional value. Even though in some states certain sweeteners are forbidden, safety studies {{say that there are}} no adverse effects, if the recommended daily intake is respected. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes,</b> therefore, can be considered safe...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus mutans is {{considered}} the primary etiologic agent of dental caries and contributes significantly to the virulence of dental plaque, especially {{in the presence of}} sucrose. To avoid the role of sucrose on the virulence factors of S. mutans, <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are commonly consumed because they lead to lower or no production of acids and interfere with biofilm formation. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> in the cariogenic potential of S. mutans biofilms. Thus, in the presence of sucrose, glucose, sucralose and sorbitol, the biofilm mass was quantified up to 96 h, the pH of the spent culture media was measured, the expression of biofilm-related genes was determined, and demineralization challenge experiments were conduct in enamel fragments. The presence of <b>sugars</b> or <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> profoundly affected the expression of spaP, gtfB, gtfC, gbpB, ftf, vicR and vicX in either biofilm or planktonic cells. The substitution of sucrose induced a down-regulation of most genes involved in sucrose-dependent colonization in biofilm cells. When the ratio between the expression of biofilm and planktonic cells was considered, most of those genes were down-regulated in biofilm cells in the presence of sugars and up-regulated in the presence of <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes.</b> However, sucralose but not sorbitol fulfilled the purpose of reducing the cariogenic potential of the diet since it induced the biofilm formation with the lowest biomass, did not change the pH of the medium and led to the lowest lesion depth in the cariogenic challeng...|$|R

5000|$|The TAS1R2+TAS1R3 {{heterodimer}} receptor {{functions as}} the sweet receptor by binding {{to a wide}} variety of <b>sugars</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes.</b> [...] TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae near the back of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth. [...] These cells are shown to synapse upon the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves to send their signals to the brain. The TAS1R3 homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances. Natural sugars are more easily detected by the TAS1R3 receptor than <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes.</b> This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.|$|R
