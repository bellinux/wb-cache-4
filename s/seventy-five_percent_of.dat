40|$|This paper {{traces the}} historiography of Angel Island Immigration Station (AIIS) {{focusing}} on three cinematic documentaries which seek {{to explain the}} history of AIIS: Carved in Silence produced in 1988 by Felicia Lowe, Discovering Angel Island: The Story behind the Poems produced in 2004 by National Asian Americans Telecommunication Association (NAATA) in partnership with KQED and Angel Island Immigration Station Tour produced in 2010 by Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation (AIISF) as an official guide to the National Historic Landmark. Produced in different decades, the three documentaries interestingly provide expanding history of the Center. This paper also intends to compare these documentaries to the most comprehensive and recent history by Erika Lee and Judy Yung in "Angel Island: Immigrant Gateway to America" published in 2010 {{to understand how the}} construction {{of the history of the}} Center keeps expanding. This study employs Jack C. Ellis and Betsy A. McLane’s theory on documentary to read the subjects, purposes, forms, production methods and particular experience provided by the three documentaries which seek to explain and convince the U. S. public the importance of the history of Angel Island. According to Ellis and McLane, documentary can be read in terms of subjects: purposes, viewpoints, or approaches; forms; production methods and techniques; and sort of experience they offer audience. The lack of information and research dealing with the presence of non-Chinese immigrants in AIIS is a major problem. The long journey of the recognition of the more comprehensive history of AIIS is still shadowed by its trigger, the discovery of the Chinese calligraphy. People and organizations concerned with the reconstruction of the history are still dominated by those related to Chinese community. The historical factor of Chinese exclusion era, from 1882 to 1943, and the fact that <b>seventy-five</b> <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> immigrants arriving at Angel Island were Chinese are the main reasons why the presence of Chinese immigrant has become the main theme on the discussion of the history of AIIS...|$|R

Quinchamalium procumbens, Ophryosporus chilca and Baccharis genistelloides showed strong activity. Extracts of Brachyotum rostratum, Monnina salicifolia, and Orthrosanthus chimboracensis were particularly interesting, since they were cytostatic but not cytotoxic at concentrations of 0. 5 mg/ml.

40|$|Little or no {{antiviral}} {{immune response}} is mounted in athymic nude mice {{infected with the}} Daniels strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. In these athymic mice, increasing levels of infectious virus could be detected in the central nervous system. <b>Seventy-five</b> <b>percent</b> (9 <b>of</b> 12) of the nude mice were moribund or dead by 4 weeks postinfection. In contrast, treatment of Theiler's virus-infected nude mice with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (H 7 - 2) against the viral protein VP- 1 resulted in a dramatic reduction of infectious virus within the central nervous system. All antibody-treated nude animals survived beyond 4 weeks postinfection. Monoclonal antibody titers could be maintained by passive transfer in treated nude mice at levels {{comparable to those of}} polyclonal antibody titers found in heterozygous infected nu/+ littermates. Areas of demyelination were detected in the untreated animals as early as 7 days after infection with little or no remyelination present.

However, the rest of these treated mice were found to have areas of both demyelination and remyelination. Thus, anti-Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus antibody against VP- 1 can play a dramatic role in the survival of mice, clearance of virus, limiting viral spread, and altering the pattern of disease {{in the absence of a}} functional T-cell response...|$|R

Interestingly, 11 and 36 % of the isolates appeared to overproduce the MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM efflux systems, respectively. Altogether, our results show that P. aeruginosa may accumulate intrinsic (overproduction of cephalosporinase AmpC, increased drug efflux, fluoroquinolone target mutations, and deficient production of porin OprD) and exogenous (production of secondary beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes) resistance mechanisms without losing its ability to generate severe bloodstream infections.
