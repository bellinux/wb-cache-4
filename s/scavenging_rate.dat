40|$|This work {{describes}} stochastic models {{developed to}} study the competition between radical scavenging and recombination for simple model systems typical of radiation chemistry, where the reactive particles are tightly clustered and reactions are assumed fully diffusion limited. Three models are developed: a Monte Carlo random flights model with a periodic boundary condition for scavengers, Monte Carlo simulations in which the <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> is calculated from the Smoluchowski theory for diffusion-limited reactions and a modification of the independent reaction times method where the scavengers close to the spur are explicitly included and the scavengers further away are treated as a continuum.

40|$|The {{importance}} of scavenging communities, and the detritus and carrion {{on which they}} feed, has been well studied {{from the perspectives of}} spatial food subsidies (marine to terrestrial, terrestrial to marine, and marine to marine) and community structure (e. g. whale and wood falls in the deep sea). Most of these studies focus on comparing <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> or scavenger diversity within a single habitat, usually deep-sea or intertidal, and seldom make comparisons between these regions. A baited trap experiment was conducted to quantify the macro-scavenger community and <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> on aged fish and kelp at intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal sites around San Juan Island, WA, USA. Bray Curtis cluster analysis showed a distinction between macrofaunal communities in the intertidal and both subtidal sites, with higher <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> on fish than kelp at all sites. Differences in the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were found in trap macrofaunal communities between sites, although further study is needed to show if these differences are really the result of different communities of scavengers or merely the influx of ambient macrofauna into the traps at different sites...|$|R
40|$|As {{fisheries}} {{grow and}} the amount of bycatch being thrown back into the oceans rises, studies on the effects of interferences in natural food chain processes that occur throughout the ocean become increasingly important. This study aims to look at <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> at different depths and make preliminary observations about how quickly carrion will be consumed and affect the food chain. Three identical traps were deployed at three different habitats: intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal. The first was pulled up after 6 hours, the second after 12 hours, and the third after 24 hours. All of the species within each trap were counted, identified, recorded, and entered into Primer and Excel to determine the differences between the habitats, the species richness and diversity for each depth, and the percent bait consumption to determine <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates.</b> The results showed that scavenger species varied noticeably at different depths. The shallow subtidal had the highest scavenger diversity and fastest consumption rates. It also seems apparent that <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> in the intertidal are slowest. Therefore, the habitat would probably be most affected by large carrion debris due to slow decomposition, but it would affect upper trophic levels more slowly than in the other habitats. Future studies should be completed at deeper depths, with more replication, and using controls to find more conclusive results...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are important}} materials in advanced industries. It {{is a concern}} that pulmonary exposure to CNTs may induce carcinogenic responses. It has been recently reported that CNTs scavenge ROS though non-carbon fibers generate ROS. A comprehensive evaluation of ROS scavenging using various kinds of CNTs has not been demonstrated well. The present work specifically investigates ROS scavenging capabilities {{with a series of}} CNTs and their derivatives that were physically treated, and with the number of commercially available CNTs. CNT concentrations were controlled at 0. 2 through 0. 6 wt%. The ROS <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> was measured by ESR with DMPO. Interestingly, the ROS <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> was not only influenced by physical treatments, but was also dependent on individual manufacturing methods. Ratio of CNTs to DMPO/ hydrogen peroxide is a key parameter to obtain appropriate ROS quenching results for comparison of CNTs. The present results suggest that dangling bonds are not a sole factor for scavenging, and electron transfer on the CNT surface is not clearly determined to be the sole mechanism to explain ROS scavenging.

40|$|Background: A {{wide array}} of {{fluorescent}} proteins (FP) is present in anthozoans, although their biochemical characteristics and function in host tissue remain to be determined. Upregulation of FP’s frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses. Methodology/Principal Findings: The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated {{a positive correlation between}} H 2 O 2 <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H 2 O 2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H 2 O 2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts. Conclusions/Significance: Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H 2 O 2 scavenging activity. The higher <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles o...|$|E

40|$|Sampling of {{atmospheric}} aerosol particles {{was carried out}} at Syowa station, Antarctica (39. 58 ◦E, 69. 00 ◦S) in 1998. For {{a better understanding of}} sea-salt chemistry in the coastal Antarctic regions, individual sea-salt particles were analysed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX). Individual particle analysis indicates that more sea-salt particles were modified in fine particles (0. 2 – 2 µm in diameter) through heterogeneous reactions mainly with gaseous sulfur species in the summer and reactive nitrogen oxides in the winter– spring. In particular, sea-salt particles in the coastal Antarctic atmosphere may be modified by heterogeneous reactions with not only SO 2 and H 2 SO 4 but also volatile sulfur species (e. g. CH 3 SO 3 H, DMS and DMSO) derived from bioactivity on the ocean surface during the summer. Also, low air temperature and a larger extent of sea ice offshore Syowa probably enhanced release of fractionated sea-salt particles (S-rich, Mg-rich, K-rich and Ca-rich) from the surface of snow and sea ice, particularly in September–October 1998. In addition, we attempt to estimate the <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> {{of atmospheric}} sulfur species and reactive nitrogen oxides by dry deposition of sea-salt particles.

For a 0. 01 micron radius, the average is 1 /liter at - 15 C and 3 /liter at - 18 C. It is noted that the measurements are in fair agreement with ice crystal concentrations in stable winter clouds measured over Elk Mountain, WY (Vali et al., 1982) ...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{synthesis}} of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on cellulose fiber {{has been successfully}} performed via facile green approach using lignin-containing unbleached kraft softwood pulp. The resulting AuNPs composited fibers showed apparent color change from pale yellow to purplish-dark brown by varying the amount of gold ions (Au 3 +) due to the surface plasmon resonance of nanogold. Further confirmation of AuNP formation on the fiber surface was conducted by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that gold nanoparticles formed on the fiber are well-defined pure metallic gold, indicating that Au 3 + ions are efficiently bioreduced into Au 0 and bind to the fiber surface. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by decomposition of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) in dark and light condition. As-prepared unbleached kraft fiber-AuNP composite showed significantly enhanced antioxidant activity and its DPPH <b>scavenging</b> <b>rate</b> reached about 86. 05 %...|$|E
40|$|Active {{ingredients}} in different lengths of black soybean sprouts were extracted with water. Concentrations {{of the main}} proteins and polysaccharides were determined by the Forint phenol assay and phenol-sulfuric acid assay, respectively. Anti-oxidizing capacities of the extracts were measured in vitro using the DPPH scavenging test and whitening capacity was measured in vitro using the tyrosinase inhibition test. The effects of the bean sprout extracts on human skin fibroblasts damnified by H 2 O 2 were studied using an MTT colorimetric assay. The safety of the extracts was determined using the red blood cell (RBC) test, chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and human patch test. Results show that DPPH radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> at different shoot lengths were all greater than 95 %, while the tyrosinase inhibition capacity of the extracts reached 98 %. Hemolysis rate in all extracts were lower than 10 %, below the 20 % regulatory limit for the RBC test. No signs of allergic reactions were observed in the human patch tests. The optimum extract was obtained from bean sprouts grown to 0. 5 cm. Extracts of black bean sprouts are safe {{and can be used}} as additives in anti-aging and whitening cosmetic products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to synthesize a new organic selenium compound, carboxymethyl chitosan-selenium (CMCTS-Se), and evaluate its antioxidant abilities on hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals. Sodium selenite and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS) were used to prepare CMCTS-Se. It was characterized by ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) techniques. The results proved the successful synthesis of CMCTS-Se. The yield was 44. 78 % and the content of selenium (Se) was 20. 50 mg/g determined by colorimetry at 420 nm using 3. 3 ’-diaminobenzidine as color-produced reagent. The antioxidant activities on hydroxyl radicals and super oxide radicals of CMCTS-Se were investigated. The results showed that antioxidant activities were concentration related in the setting concentration range and the antioxidant effects of CMCTS-Se were totally better than that of CMCTS. The <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> on hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals of 2. 0 mg/mL CMCTS-Se were 68. 25 % and 62. 15 %, respectively. VC, a well-known antioxidant, as a standard in our assay, showed a little higher antioxidant activity than CMCTS-Se. This research provides a possible application of CMCTS-Se as a low toxic and effective organic Se-enriched healthy product...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBelow-cloud {{scavenging}} (BCS) {{coefficients of}} aerosols by rainfall are estimated for reported aerosol size distributions measured during field experiments in various environments. The method employed {{is based on}} explicit calculations of the efficiency of collision between a raindrop and aerosol particles. Results show that BCS coefficient increases with rainfall rate and has a significant dependence on aerosol size distribution parameters. Thus, BCS is important for very small particles (with diameters less than 0. 01 µm) and for coarse particles (with diameters larger than 2 µm). For rainfall rate R ~ 1 mm hr - 1, the 0. 5 -folding time of these particles is {{of the order of}} one hour. It is shown that BCS is negligible for aerosol particles in the range [0. 1 - 1] µm if compared with in-cloud <b>scavenging</b> <b>rates</b> for low and moderate rainfall rates (R ~ 0. 1 - 10 mm hr - 1). The results indicate that a boundary layer aerosol size distribution with coarse mode is drastically affected very shortly after rain starts (in a fraction of one hour) and consequently, the below-cloud aerosol size distribution becomes dominated by particles in the accumulation mode...|$|R
