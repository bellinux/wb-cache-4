40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that lymph node ratio (LNR) is a strong {{prognostic}} factor in head and neck cancer. This study aims {{to determine if the}} yield of harvested lymph nodes (LNs) influences the LNR. The study included 522 head and neck cancer patients, undergoing 638 primary and salvage (selective) neck dissections between 2002 and 2012. Before 2007 the neck dissection specimens were macroscopically and microscopically examined by pathologists and after 2007 the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> was performed by pathology technicians. For comparison of mean LN yields, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The mean number of LNs among 374 specimens examined by pathologists was 24 (range 0 - 89) vs. 32 (range 2 - 89) among 264 specimens examined by pathology technicians (P <. 001). This caused the mean LNR in the non pre-treated patient group to drop from 11. 4 % to 8. 7 %. The counts of LNs per type of neck dissection were significantly different and increased with the number of levels involved. However, there was no linear relationship and the higher yields could be mostly ascribed to LNs in level V. The LNR varied from 8. 1 % to 18. 4 % among the different types of neck dissections. A significant {{increase in the number of}} harvested LNs, but a decrease in LNR was observed after introducing pathology technicians <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> A clear association between the extent of the dissection and the number of harvested LNs was observed.

MethodsThe rats were orally administered {{a dose of}} 5000 mg/kg body weight and observed continuously for 6 h and then daily for 14 days. Control rats were administered distilled water. The effect of the extract on general behavior, body weight, and food and water intake were measured. After 14 days, the rats were sacrificed and their organs (liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidney, adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes) were removed <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> The body and organ weights in addition to hematology (e. g., hemoglobin and white blood cell counts) and clinical blood biochemistry (e. g., albumin and bilirubin) were also examined.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the standards of quality control and assurance programs adopted in pathology laboratories in Turkey by the aid of a questionnaire-based survey. Materials and Methods: We have submitted a survey that consisted of 68 questions to 250 various public and private pathology laboratories located in university hospitals, Ministry of Health research hospitals, and private hospitals throughout Turkey. We received 84 responses, and the responses were analyzed with the aid of a statistics program (SPSS). Results: None of the pathology laboratories that responded to the survey used a quality control program that was unique to pathology, and many of the responders were using general hospital quality control programs. There were no standards in the use and calibration of histopathology equipment. Half of the laboratories had written guidelines of their quality control procedures. The written protocols were most common <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and reporting of specimens. Adult autopsies were very low to null, but there were large number of pediatric and perinatal autopsies performed in most of the laboratories. We identified many problems concerning the safety procedures.

Rats in the positive control group were given omeprazole orally (50 mg/kg body weight) 2 h prior to the administration of absolute ethanol. The treatment groups received LJT (400 mg/kg body weight) 2 h prior to absolute ethanol administration. All rats were sacrificed 1 h after receiving the ethanol treatment. The stomach was excised <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and biochemical analysis. The administration of LJT protected gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced acute gastric injury, including hemorrhage and hyperemia. LJT reduced the increase in lipid peroxidation in ethanol-induced acute gastric lesions. LJT increased GSH content and activities of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that LJT protects gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced acute gastric injury by increasing their antioxidant content.

40|$|Background Hepatic {{fibrosis}} {{is characterized}} by a progressive accumulation of fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including collagen, which occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) /Smad 3 signalling plays a central role in tissue fibrogenesis, acting as a potent stimulus of ECM accumulation. Aim To evaluate the potential protective role of Smad 3 deficiency in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in Smad 3 null mice. Methods Chronic hepatitis-associated fibrosis was induced in 13 Smad 3 null and 13 wild-type (WT) mice by intraperitoneal DMN administration (10 mu g/g body weight/day) for three consecutive days per week for 6 weeks. The liver was excised <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and histological, morphometric and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. For IHC, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen types I-III, TGF-beta 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Smad 3, Smad 7 and CD 3 antibodies were used. Results At <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination,</b> the liver of DMN-treated Smad 3 WT appeared harder with a dark brown colouring and necrotic areas compared with that from null mice. Histological and morphometric evaluation revealed a significantly higher degree of hepatic fibrosis and accumulation of connective tissue in the Smad 3 WT compared with null mice. IHC evaluation showed a marked increase in alpha-SMA, CTGF, collagen I-III, TGF-beta and Smad 3 staining in the liver of Smad 3 WT compared with that in null mice, whereas Smad 7 was increased only in null mice. Conclusions The results indicate that Smad 3 loss confers resistance to the development of DMN-induced hepatic fibrosis. The reduced fibrotic response appears to be due to a reduction of fibrogenic myofibroblast activation and ECM production and accumulation. Smad 3 could be a novel target for potential treatment of fibrosis complicating chronic hepatitis...|$|R
30|$|X-radiography and {{infrared}} reflectography (IRR) [1] remain the standard tools <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of paintings {{even with the}} advent of advanced elemental (X-ray fluorescence) [2] and reflectance imaging spectroscopy [3]. Infrared reflectograms can provide useful information about underdrawings or paint composition changes because most artists’ pigments absorb less light and also scatter less light in the near-infrared spectral region compared to the visible spectral region. The color of materials is mainly due to electronic transitions induced by absorption of visible light. Most pigments have no or weak absorption features outside of the visible region (> 700  nm). In addition, the amount of the light scattering by the pigment particles is inversely proportional to wavelength, and so the longer infrared wavelengths are scattered less than shorter visible wavelengths. Both the lower absorption and the lower amount of light scattering by the pigment particles means more incident light is transmitted through the paint layer and can reach the preparatory ground layer or underdrawing. An underdrawing can be seen when more light is reflected back through the paint layers from the ground layer than from the more absorbing underdrawing. Hence, the difference in reflectance between the underdrawing lines and the preparatory ground is necessary to produce enough contrast in an infrared reflectogram to render the underdrawing visible. Similarly, the contrast generated by differences in the absorption and reflectance of infrared light by two different paint layers helps to visualize areas of the composition that have been painted over and changed.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{dressings}} for donor {{sites or}} other partial thickness wounds must promote removal of nonviable or necrotic tissue, eradication {{and prevention of}} microbial infiltrate, exudate absorbance, and regrowth of healthy epidermis and dermis. There are many commonly used products that facilitate these processes. Established properties of an in situ photopolymerizable semi- interpenetrating network (sIPN) {{suggest that it is}} also a viable treatment option. The widely varying material properties suggest that these dressing treatments may elicit different healing responses via different cellular mechanisms. In this study, we sought to resolve the differences in healing between Acticoat™, sIPN, nonadherent dressing with Tisseel™, and Xeroform™ dressing treatments in a porcine partial thickness wound model. Donor site wounds were produced on pigs at two cut depths and dressed with Acticoat™, sIPN, nonadherent dressing with Tisseel™, and Xeroform™ with alternatively placed autografts to provide a control area between each test site. Figs were euthanized at 4, 7, 14, and 42 days <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and biopsy collection. Biopsies were analyzed histologically by two blinded observers for cellular densities and regional thicknesses within the tissue. sIPN- and Xeroform™-treated wounds were healed by 7 days, and Acticoat™- and nonadherent dressing with Tisseel™-treated wounds were healed by 14 days. Inflammatory responses were between comparable treatment type across all time periods. Dermal granulation features increased with time but were not significantly different. All dressing treatments elicited wound healing without outstanding toxicity or pathology indicating that sIPN is a comparable and viable treatment for partial thickness wounds.

Materials and methods Chronic colitis-associated fibrosis was induced in 15 Smad 3 null and 13 wild-type mice by intra-rectal administration of TNBS. Each mouse received an incremental dose of TNBS (0 · 5 - 1 · 0 mg per week) over a 6 -week period. The colon was excised <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and histological, morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses. For immunohistochemistry, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen types I-III, TGF-β 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Smad 3, Smad 7, and CD 3 antibodies were used. Results At <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination,</b> the colon of Smad 3 wild-type mice appeared significantly harder, thicker and shorter than that of the Smad 3 null mice. Of the wild-type mice, 50 % presented colonic adhesions and strictures. Histological and morphometric evaluation revealed a significantly higher degree of colonic fibrosis and accumulation of collagen in the Smad 3 wild-type compared to null mice, whereas the degree of colonic inflammation did not differ between the two groups of mice. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed a marked increase in CTGF, collagen I-III, TGF-β and Smad 3 staining in the colon of Smad 3 wild-type compared to null mice, whereas Smad 7 was increased only in null mice. Conclusions These results indicate that Smad 3 loss confers resistance to the development of TNBS-induced colonic fibrosis. The reduced fibrotic response appears to be due to a reduction in fibrogenic mesenchymal cell activation and ECM production and accumulation.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{feasibility}} of the video-assisted insertion {{of a new}} sutureless vascular prosthesis was studied. Methods: Seven sheep, weighing 25 to 35 kg, were operated on under general anesthesia. The animals were intubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube {{and placed in the}} right lateral decubitus position. A thoracoscope was introduced in the 11 th intercostal space, and a minithoracotomy (4 to 5 cm) was performed in the seventh intercostal space. After retraction of the lung, a short segment (10 cm) of the descending thoracic aorta was exposed. Our prosthesis was made of Dacron and was specifically designed to be inserted without a suture. After systemic heparinization, the aorta was cross-clamped with two vascular clamps introduced into the thoracic cavity through two 5 -mm thoracic incisions. The aorta was either replaced (five cases) or bypass grafted (two cases). At the completion of the procedure, blood pressure was pharmacologically increased (5 mg intravenous bolus of epinephrine), and each anastomosis was checked for bleeding. All animals were killed, and the prosthesis was retrieved <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Results: The procedure was completed in each case without extension of the minithoracotomy. Insertion of the prosthesis was easy and fast, and completion of each anastomosis required 10 to 15 minutes. A 3 - to 4 -mm space between each clip was sufficient for proper attachment. All procedures were performed in less than 120 minutes. No bleeding was observed at the level of each anastomosis, even when a sustained high blood pressure was induced. The proper insertion of the prosthesis and the absence of any anastomotic stenosis was confirmed by means of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Conclusion: Video-thoracoscopic replacement or bypass grafting of the descending thoracic aorta was easy with this new sutureless vascular prosthesis. Minimally invasive vascular surgery might be facilitated with such a prosthesis. However, long-term animal studies are required before human implantation can be undertaken.

This tool is tailored and applied to ensembles of young and elder human and of porcine and bovine vertebral bone specimens. On the microscale of the spongiosa a linearized Lamé–Navier type elasticity model is assumed and the computed macroscopic material properties are represented by a general elasticity tensor. The computation {{is based on a}} suitable set of microscopic simulations on the cubic <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> strain scenarios. The subsequent evaluation of the effective stresses is used to determine effective linear elasticity tensors. A Composite Finite Element discretization is taken into account to resolve the complicated domain. The classical strain–stress and a corresponding variational homogenization approach are compared. In case of an (artificial) periodic microstructure, a fundamental cell is easily identified and a macroscopic unit strain can be imposed using affine-periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, statistically periodic structures require the identification of statistically representative prototype cells. Unit macroscopic strains are then imposed only in an approximate sense using displacement boundary conditions. The impact of the resulting boundary artifacts on the solution are compensated for via restricting the evaluation of effective stress to a suitably selected smaller subset of the cubic specimen. Furthermore, an optimization approach is used to identify possible axes of orthotropy of the resulting linear elasticity tensor.

MethodsWe performed a prospective cohort study among HIV-infected patients with CD 4 cell counts < 100 /mm 3 seen at a university hospital in Paris. Medical records were reviewed and stool samples were obtained <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and detection of parasites including cryptosporidia and microsporidia, {{whether or not the}} patient had diarrhea. Stool cultures were performed for patients with diarrhea. Factors associated with the detection of parasites were then identified. ResultsStools samples from 143 consecutive patients were analyzed. Patients were mostly men (76 %), and the median patient age was 41 years. The median CD 4 cell count was 32 /mm 3, and 59 % were receiving cART. Diarrhea was present in 85 patients (59 %), 19 of whom (22 %) had intestinal parasites detected in stools. Three patients with diarrhea were diagnosed with Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, and Clostridium difficile infections. Among the 58 patients without diarrhea, parasitic intestinal pathogens were still identified in six (10 %). The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 17 %, with cryptosporidia (n= 8), microsporidia (n= 6), and Giardia duodenalis (n= 5) being the most frequent pathogens. Patients with intestinal parasites had diarrhea more often (76 % vs. 56 %, p= 0. 025) and were more often at US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical stage C (84 % vs. 69 %, p= 0. 024) than patients without parasites.

Chronic colitis and fibrosis were induced by oral administration of 2. 5 % DSS (w/v) for 6 weeks. GW 9662 (GW), a selective PPAR-γ inhibitor, was also administered by intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day combined with GED treatment. All drugs were administered {{at the beginning of the}} second cycle of DSS (day 12). 65 mice were randomly divided into five groups (H 2 O as controls n = 10, H 2 O+GED n = 10, DSS n = 15, DSS+GED n = 15, DSS+GED+GW n = 15). The colon was excised <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> and histological and morphometric analyses. The level of expression of molecules involved in EMT and fibrosis, like TGF-β, Smad 3, E-cadherin, Snail, ZEB 1, β-catenin, GSK- 3 β and PPAR-γ, was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blot and Real Time PCR. GED improved the DSS-induced chronic colitis and fibrosis. GED was able to reduce the expression of the main fibrosis markers (α-SMA, collagen I-III and fibronectin) as well as the pivotal pro-fibrotic molecules IL- 13, TGF-β and Smad 3, while it increased the anti-fibrotic PPAR-γ. All these GED effects were nullified by co-administration of GW with GED. Furthermore, GED was able to normalize the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin and upregulated GSK- 3 β, that are all known to be involved both in EMT and fibrosis.

40|$|In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{including}} Mozambique, acute {{bacterial meningitis}} (ABM) represents a {{main cause of}} childhood mortality. The burden of ABM is seriously underestimated because of the poor performance of culture sampling, the primary method of ABM surveillance in the region. Low quality cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and frequent consumption of antibiotics prior to sample collection {{lead to a high}} rate of false-negative results. To our knowledge, this study is the first to determine the frequency of ABM in Mozambique using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and to compare results to those of culture sampling. Between March 2013 and March 2014, CSF samples were collected at 3 regional hospitals from patients under 5 years of age, who met World Health Organization case definition criteria <b>for</b> ABM. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>examination,</b> cytochemical study, culture, and qPCR were performed on all samples. A total of 369 CSF samples were collected from children clinically suspected of ABM. qPCR showed a significantly higher detection rate of ABM-causing pathogens when compared to culture (52. 3 % [193 / 369] versus 7. 3 % [27 / 369], p = 0. 000). The frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, group B Streptococci, and Neisseria meningitidis were 32. 8 % (121 ⁄ 369), 12. 2 %, (45 ⁄ 369), 3. 0 % (16 ⁄ 369) and 4. 3 % (11 ⁄ 369), respectively, significantly higher compared to that obtained on culture (p < 0. 001 for each). Our findings demonstrate that culture is less effective for the diagnosis of ABM than qPCR. The common use of culture rather than qPCR to identify ABM results in serious underestimation of the burden of the disease, and our findings strongly suggest that qPCR should be incorporated into surveillance activities for ABM. In addition, our data showed that S. pneumoniae represents {{the most common cause of}} ABM in children under 5 years of age...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of ITPN is the appearance of a solid nodular tumor obstructing the dilated ducts on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> [2]. In both the initial pancreas head lesion and the remnant pancreas body lesion, we observed a solid nodular tumor with a dilated MPD on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> The pancreatic tail lesion was located apart from the MPD, and we did not observe a solid nodular tumor obstructing dilated ducts on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> However, microscopic examination showed a tubulopapillary growth with entirely high-grade atypical cells, minimal cytoplasmic mucin, and no visible luminal mucin secretion, which was identical to the histological features of ITPN in both the primary tumor and the pancreatic body tumor. Additionally, all immunohistochemical and molecular results were identical to both the primary tumor and the pancreatic body tumor. Therefore, the pancreatic tail tumor was also thought to be ITPN.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Diagnosis of {{tuberculosis}} {{in a field}} setting depends {{on the quality of}} <b>specimens</b> submitted <b>for</b> smear-microscopy. <b>Macroscopic</b> assessment (sputum or saliva) of the <b>specimen</b> <b>for</b> suitability for further examination is common practice in routine care. We examined whether macroscopic assessment could correctly identify sputum specimens based on four published algorithms using microscopic features in the setting of active case finding in a community survey. The study included 901 randomly selected adults who reported cough for 3 weeks or more in the national tuberculosis prevalence survey in Bangladesh. A single specimen of each was assessed with microscopy and microscopy (Gram-stain) to classify it as either sputum or saliva. The primary outcome was the agreement between the two assessment methods (Kappa statistic) From 901 specimens, 561 (62 %) were macroscopically classified as saliva and 340 (38 %) as sputum. From these, 888 Gram-stained slides could be examined for microscopic features. The agreement between the macroscopic assessment with any of the four microscopy algorithms for sputum was very poor (all Kappa’s below 0. 1). While macroscopic assessment of submitted specimens might be of value in routine care, it is not warranted in a setting of active case finding in a community survey. Submitting a specimen in the first place should be the primary goal in this setting...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{established a}} mouse model of peritoneal dissemination of human gastric carcinoma, including {{the formation of}} ascites, by orthotopic transplantation of cultured gastric carcinoma cells. To clarify the processes of expansion of the tumors in this model, nude mice were sacrificed and autopsied at different points of time after the orthotopic transplantation of the cancer cells <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> and histopathologic <b>examination</b> of the tumors. The cancer cells grew actively in the gastric submucosa and invaded the deeper layers to reach the serosal plane. The tumor cells then underwent exfoliation and became free followed by the formation of metastatic lesions initially in the greater omentum and subsequent colonization and proliferation of the tumors on the peritoneum. Although this model allowed the detection of even minute metastases, it was not satisfac-tory {{from the viewpoint of}} quantitative and objective evaluation. To resolve these problems, we introduced a luciferase gene into this tumor cell line with a high metastasizing potential and carried out in vivo photon counting analysis. This photon counting technique was found to allow objective and quantitative evaluation of the progres-sion of peritoneal dissemination on a real-time basis. This animal metastatic model is useful for monitoring the responses of tumors to anticancer agents. (Cancer Res 2006; 66 (15) : 7532 - 9...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundATP 10 D {{belongs to}} a {{subfamily}} of P-type ATPases implicated in phospholipids translocation from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular biological membrane. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified that a variant in Atp 10 d gene (rs 2351791) associates with serum lipid profile and myocardial infarction. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the effect of this variant on atherosclerosis in Japanese elderly population. MethodConsecutive autopsy cases registered in JG-SNP study were recruited (n =  1536). The samples were pathologically assessed <b>for</b> atherosclerosis using <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the formalin-fixed arteries, and coronary stenotic index (CSI), intracranial atherosclerotic index (ICAI) and pathological atherosclerotic index (PAI), which represent systemic arteries were calculated. The variant rs 2351791 (G/T) in Atp 10 d gene was genotyped by Taqman genotyping assay and association determined. ResultBoth CSI and ICAI were significantly higher in GG genotype than GT genotype and TT genotype (p =  0. 003 and p =  0. 001, respectively). Both associations remained significant in minor allele dominant model after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes, HDL, smoking and drinking (p =  0. 001 and p =  0. 001, respectively). PAI was not associated with this variant. Consistent with the previous report, plasma HDL cholesterol level was lower in GG genotype compared to GT + TT genotypes (p =  0. 001).

40|$|Background: Gallbladder {{stones are}} {{the main reason for}} {{numerous}} gallbladder removal procedures. In many cases it is impossible to discover gallbladder carcinoma during the preoperative workup. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening is usually the result of gallstones but may harbour carcinoma as well. The objective of our study was to estimate the accuracy of the intraoperative <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> determination of a pathological process of the gallbladder. Methods: We retrospectively examined 25 cases of the gallbladder carcinoma found in 4288 patients who underwent cholecystectomy in the period from 1993 to 2004.  In each of those cases we determined whether a suspicion for carcinoma has been reported based on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Results: According to <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the gallbladder surgeon did not report any suspicion for the carcinoma in 52 % of the cases. Conclusions: Due to high inaccuracy of preoperative and intraoperative macroscopical assessment, pathological examination of the resected gallbladder is the only accurate method for the diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma, as well as for staging and establishing the indication for extended surgical procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Appendicectomy {{specimens}} {{removed from}} patients with suspected acute appendicitis often appear macroscopically normal but histopathological {{analysis of these}} cases may reveal a more sinister underlying pathology. We evaluated histopathological reports of 1225 appendicectomy specimens at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) {{over the past three}} years. Methods Histopathology reports for all appendices analysed at the NNUH between March 2003 and March 2006 were reviewed by examination of the case notes. The analysis focussed on the confirmation of acute appendicitis, incidental unexpected incidental findings other than inflammation, whether these abnormalities were suspected on gross examination at the time of surgery, and the effect on patient management and prognosis. Results The histopathology reports disclosed a variety of abnormal incidental lesions. Of the 1225 specimens, 46 (3. 75 %) revealed abnormal diagnoses other than inflammatory changes. Twenty-four (1. 96 %) of these were clinically significant and affected further patient management. Only two of these (0. 16 %) were suspected on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> intra-operatively. Conclusion Twenty-four of the 1225 specimens (1. 96 %) had an impact on patient management or outcome and were not suspected on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> at the time of surgery. These would have been missed had the specimens not been examined microscopically. The intra-operative diagnosis of the surgeon is therefore unreliable in detecting abnormalities of the appendix. This study supports the sending of all appendicectomy <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> routine histopathological examination. </p...|$|R
40|$|A tissue {{engineering}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the growth of new auricular cartilage tissue and inflammatory reactions in autologous cartilage grafts obtained from three, partly immmunomodulated domestic pigs each in two experimental groups. This was done by amplifying the enzymatically isolated porcine ear chondrocytes and subsequently growing three-dimensional tissue on a supportive fiber scaffold consisting of polyglycolide/polyactide or silica gel and/or fibrin glue. Following several days of preculture, the grafts were subcutaneously reimplanted into the pigs. The newly formed tissue was explanted after 3, 8, 16, and 31 days <b>for</b> <b>macroscopic</b> and microscopic <b>examination.</b> The immunomodulated polyglycolide-polyactide grafts showed development of calcifications and metaplastic ossifications. Fiberless neotissue grown in the cortisone-treated pigs was found to contain chondrocytes but these were degenerated. Blood tests revealed no signs of adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy. Parallel in vitro experiments showed no advantage of adding bovine serum to the monolayer culture medium compared to the addition of fetal calf serum (FCS). Degenerated cartilage cells were also found in vitro with the degree of degeneration decreasing with the duration of cultivation and the progression of cell proliferation. Further studies aiming at providing cosmetically acceptable autologous cartilage grafts for patients with traumatically or congenitally damaged ear cartilage {{in the near future}} should include supplementary investigations for optimizing graft composition and the respective culture conditions...|$|R
