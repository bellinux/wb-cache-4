40|$|The {{deployment}} of a safe, reliable, and financially economical carbon-capture and <b>storage</b> <b>chain</b> requires detailed considerations {{to be made}} of the hazards of CO 2 transportation, and the risks involved in pipeline operation. CO 2 poses a number of dangers upon its release, and one major concern is the escalation of a pipeline rupture event due to Joule-Thomson cooling within the vicinity of the expansion, leading to embrittlement and possible running fractures. Capable of releasing several thousand tonnes of high density CO 2, such an event could have catastrophic consequences. This paper demonstrates an experimentally validated, numerical approach to the modelling of release scenarios. In addition to the prediction of complex phase behaviour, the approach is capable of quantifying temperatures and pressures for the purpose of fracture propagation modelling.

40|$|AbstractThe {{commercial}} {{deployment of}} CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) technology requires whole system optimisation of the CO 2 supply, transport and <b>storage</b> <b>chain</b> under evolving targets or constraints. Most {{of the earlier}} attempts to model CCS networks were deterministic steady state models.

This work presents a multi-period spatially explicit least cost optimisation model of an integrated CO 2 capture, transportation and storage infrastructure. The model is showcased through a case study focusing on the future UK CCS infrastructure. The solution demonstrates the investment requirement and operational strategy for all components of the chain at each phase and, hence, shows how the system evolves through four time periods up to year 2050. The non- intuitive results of the multi-period model confirm that such a tool is essential for large scale CCS deployment...|$|E

40|$|CO 2 is {{recognized}} as one of the most important greenhouse gases. Many mitigating solutions to stabilize its atmospheric concentration are currently being investigated in order to control the so called Global Warming. Among these, the CCS (Carbon Capture and <b>Storage)</b> <b>chain</b> is one of the most promising solutions and is linked to the handling of large amounts of CO 2 through dedicated buried pipelines. As a consequence of any accidental release, a dry ice bank may be formed on the ground acting as a delayed emission source. This study aims at investigating different modeling approaches to face hazards related to this source and the mechanisms related to the near field atmospheric dispersion of CO 2. Moving from simplified approaches to more complex ones relying on Computational Fluid Dynamics, some danger distances are classified under different stability classes. The analysis shows some discrepancies concerning the predicted gas dispersion. The most simplified approaches are not able to give a near–field reliable description that is instead captured by the CFD along with stratification phenomena. On the contrary, the CFD applicability is strictly linked to the computational burden that is usually not compatible with emergency–related responses but only with planning issues...|$|E

The most important common operations for wells are shut-ins and depressurizations for reservoir characterization, maintenance stops {{and testing of}} valves. The aim of this work is firstly to demonstrate the need for experiments on these operations. Secondly, a new experimental set-up is proposed for such experiments. The main conclusion from this paper is that the physical phenomena during shut-ins and depressurizations of CO 2 injection wells can be described with models, but that {{that there are still}} some uncertainties left. The largest uncertainties occur when the transient flow is rapid and/or CO 2 is mixed with water. The proposed experimental set-up consists of a well with casing to be drilled vertically 200 - 250 meter at the Statoil laboratory in Trondheim, Norway. A U-tube with two legs with different diameter will be suspended in the well. Moreover, water or brine can be added for observing the effects of the H 2 O-CO 2 interaction. The U-tube is to be linked to the existing CO 2 transport test facility, which has the necessary vessels, compressor and pump.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of yield, quality, and nutritional value of grain cereals by filamentous fungi and subsequent contamination with mycotoxins {{is of great}} concern around the world. Mycotoxins are known to cause serious health problems in animals causing weight gain reduction, capillary fragility, reduced fertility, suppressed disease resistance, and even death. Some mycotoxins such as fumonisins, aflatoxins and ochratoxins, in particular, have also been associated with human health problems. The key mycotoxigenic moulds in partially dried grain are Aspergillus flavus(aflatoxins), A. ochraceus (ochratoxins) and some Fusarium species (fumonisins, trichothecenes) on temperate and tropical cereals. Aflatoxins, produced by Aspergillus section Flavi species, and fumonisins, produced by Fusarium verticillioides, are prominent among the mycotoxins associated to maize economic losses (Zea mays L.). The presence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in maize is of particular concern for maize products, as both mycotoxins are heat stable and survive the temperatures used in drying and maize processing. The presence of a given fungus {{does not mean that}} the mycotoxin(s) associated with that fungus are also present. There are many factors, especially environmental conditions and agricultural practices, involved in the production of mycotoxins. The aim of this work was to detect whether mycotoxins were present in post-harvested maize. Ninety five maize samples collected from different agroclimatic regions of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Ribatejo, Alto Alentejo) were analyzed by HPLC for mycotoxin contamination. These samples were taken in three different steps of the <b>storage</b> <b>chain</b> and moisture content was measured immediately after sampling. Strains of Aspergillus section Flavi and Aspergilllus section Nigri were isolated after plating in MEA 10. Several assays with different solvent mixes and shaking times were tested allowing the development of a simultaneous extraction based in protocols provided by Vicam of aflatoxins (AF), ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisins B 1 and B 2 (FB 1 and FB 2) with immunoaffinity columns. This method was validated by analysis of replicate spiked samples with 40 µg/Kg of AF; 7 µg/Kg of OTA and 200 µg/Kg of FB 2. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) extraction was the one used by Mictotox LTDA. This method was validated by analysis of replicate spiked samples with 4000 µg/Kg of CPA. Spiked samples were allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours prior to extraction. In addition, a matrix blank was also analyzed to determine any residual mycotoxin levels. Overall, three batches of duplicate spiked samples and one blank sample were analysed. From the 95 samples obtained 287 strains belonging to Aspergillus section Nigri and 417 strains belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi were isolated. Mycotoxins were detected in 67 % the samples. Sixty four percent of the samples were positive for FB 1 and FB 2 with values below 100 µg/Kg (LOD of 0. 1 µg/Kg). Only 8 % of the samples were positive for aflatoxins (LOD of 0. 1 µg/Kg), being AFB 1, AFG 1 and AFG 2 detected in 5, 5 and 1 sample, respectively. AFB 2 was not detected. Levels for AFB 1 and AFG 1 ranged from 0. 1 - 0. 5 µg/Kg. Neither OTA (LOD of 0. 04 µg/Kg) nor CPA (LOD of 10 µg/Kg) was detected in any sample.
