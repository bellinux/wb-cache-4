A growing body of literature highlights that naturalised third-country nationals are also making use of their ‘freedom of movement’. This paper proposes a typology of ‘new EU citizens’ who onward migrate between member states. It draws on relevant statistics and qualitative empirical research carried out with Dutch-Somalis, Swedish-Iranians and German-Nigerians who relocated to the UK. In contrast to research with native-born EU movers, our findings indicate that the majority of naturalised EU citizens onward migrated due to the discrimination and racism they experienced in their previous place of residence. In this paper we conceptualise the interactions of integration and transnationalism as a potential trigger for onward migration. We illustrate how onward migrants are able to complete certain aspects of their integration process in a <b>second</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> Moreover, we show how migrants maintain transnational ties across several destinations and therefore contribute to a broader understanding of transnationalism...|$|E

Furthermore, {{in order to ensure}} that this exit strategy is credible and does not prove to be an empty promise of consolidation, we suggest institutional arrangements within the EU that would provide incentives to follow through.

40|$|Due to its {{intrinsic}} need {{to establish}} an internal market even against the nation states’ will, EU law has always {{had to rely on}} the responsiveness of its peoples {{in order to make the}} establishment of the internal market a success. As to this need, top-down macro-economic regulation without a social bottom-up backup by the peoples of Europe has mostly failed. This creates a “legitimacy market failure” of the EU internal market, which needs to be cured by responsive regulation. Data gained from behavioural research are the right tools to cure such a market failure in EU internal market law.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{challenge}} the assumption that small <b>member</b> <b>state</b> influence on the European Union’s (EU) common foreign policy has been negligible. Its purpose is to study the influence of two small <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> Latvia and Lithuania, have had on the Eastern Partnership initiative during their respective Presidency of the Council of the EU periods. A third case, Poland’s Presidency, will also be examined and compared {{with the other two}} cases. This will allow for a more nuanced understanding of the impact the other two small <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have had {{in the development of the}} EaP compared to a bigger <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> Overall, this thesis adds to the existing discussion of small <b>member</b> <b>state</b> influence in three ways: first, it provides an overview of classical and contemporary small <b>member</b> <b>state</b> literature and critically assesses the realist interpretation of small state behavior in the international system; second, it reviews the different methodologies used by various authors and synthesizes a new influence measuring framework; and third, it applies the analytical framework to the selected cases and tests three sets of hypothesis. I argue that three factors can most adequately explain small <b>member</b> <b>state</b> influence: first, small <b>member</b> <b>states</b> must be committed to an issue - it must be of general importance to them; second, they must possess immaterial resources, such as general expertise or they be recognized as leaders in the issue area; and third, small <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are more influential when they use the EU’s institutional setting (such as the Council Presidency seat) to their advantage. The actual extent of influence is measured using three indicators: goal achievement, the ascription of agenda setting, and the ascription of final outcomes. This exercise revealed three conclusions: first, that small states have more influence on the multilateral Eastern Partnership platforms than on bilateral relationships; <b>second,</b> that small <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have more influence on the final outcomes than on the agendas; and third, that the overall goal achievement level is higher when the level of ascription is higher. Based on the results this thesis produced, I conclude that small <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are able to exert a limited amount of influence on the EU’s foreign policy when they use their strengths and resources to leverage their positions vis-à-vis bigger and more powerful <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> but without the support of other actors, the probability of failing to deliver results would be higher...|$|R
40|$|The Czech Republic {{assumed the}} {{rotating}} Presidency of the European Union on 1 January 2009, following France and as only the <b>second</b> new EU <b>member</b> <b>state</b> after Slovenia {{to hold the}} position.

On the other hand, the coming to an end of the terms of the European Parliament and of the Commission can provide the Czechs with a window of opportunity to focus less on inter-institutional bargaining and more on the work in the Council, especially in terms of finding common grounds on the more controversial issues such as energy security, resuscitation of the European economy and the stabilisation and closer involvement in the Eastern EU neighbourhood...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of critical infrastructure such as transport is increasingly {{becoming part of}} the investment portfolio, not only of European public authorities, but also of the private sector. However, since the 27 EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> differ substantially in their social and economic structure and infrastructure endowment, this should already prepare us for the variety of approaches to infrastructure investment strategy and financing in use (DLA Piper, 2006; EIB, 2004). Within this context we need {{to keep in mind that}} <b>member</b> <b>state</b> governments are characterized by very diverse administrative cultures and capabilities and distinct legal and planning traditions. Despite these differences, the objective of this paper is to define a common framework that can be used as a toolkit for the PPP application in transport. We review four main cases of PPP implementation in Europe in order to identify the common elements and the divergent ones. Given this background and the current economic crisis, two policy streams are at the core of our toolkit definition. First, EU countries are confronted with the necessity to improve competitiveness by investing in transport infrastructure. <b>Second,</b> several <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are compelled to contain their public budgets. These two policy streams provide countries with a powerful incentive to explore alternative funding approaches in order to build transport infrastructure and provide service delivery. The proposed approach is based on the concept that a partnership is as a long-term co-operative relationship for which renegotiation of contract terms is acceptable. In this context, the nature of the public sector contribution ranges from conferring assets and providing guarantees to contractual and regulatory measures. Although it is difficult to provide a clear-cut characterisation for the PPP toolkit we propose a shift away from conventional traditional models of transportation service delivery, (characterized by hierarchical decision structures, vertical integration in delivery, and relatively underspecified funding tools), to a more diversified financial landscape where the toolkit represent a platform where different financial resources can be implemented. Therefore, the main potential benefit of the toolkit PPP approach, in transport, is its flexibility in adapting the structure of incentives and risk-sharing to the features of the project and to the economic and institutional environment. However, in practice the public sector agency has to achieve a judgment about the trade-offs between the various, sometimes conflicting, objectives.
