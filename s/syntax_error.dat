500|$|Statements {{cannot be}} a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A {{particular}} case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a <b>syntax</b> <b>error</b> in Python.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{automatically}} generating repair feedback for <b>syntax</b> <b>errors</b> for introductory programming problems. <b>Syntax</b> <b>errors</b> constitute {{one of the largest}} classes of errors (34 %) in our dataset of student submissions obtained from a MOOC course on edX. The previous techniques for generating automated feed- back on programming assignments have focused on functional correctness and style considerations of student programs. These techniques analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately, {{it is not possible to}} generate ASTs for student pro- grams with <b>syntax</b> <b>errors</b> and therefore the previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing <b>syntax</b> <b>errors.</b> We present a technique for providing feedback on <b>syntax</b> <b>errors</b> that uses Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model syntactically valid token sequences. Our approach is inspired from the recent work on learning language models from Big Code (large code corpus). For a given programming assignment, we first learn an RNN to model all valid token sequences using the set of syntactically correct student submissions. Then, for a student submission with <b>syntax</b> <b>errors,</b> we query the learnt RNN model with the prefix to- ken sequence to predict token sequences that can fix the error by either replacing or inserting the predicted token sequence at the error location. We evaluate our technique on over 14, 000 student submissions with <b>syntax</b> <b>errors.</b> Our technique can completely re- pair 31. 69 % (4501 / 14203) of submissions with <b>syntax</b> <b>errors</b> and in addition partially correct 6. 39 % (908 / 14203) of the submissions...|$|R
