[...] He also {{wanted to keep the}} characters in high school longer, saying, [...] "I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college and what have you, and I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles." [...] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. [...] "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show," [...] he said, and elaborated: ...|$|E

He said, [...] "As for releasing a full-length with a tour in the classic sense, I don't <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening.</b> But we're all great friends, and I do see us putting together new material and hitting the road. The fans have been so supportive and such {{a huge part of}} our lives that I would feel horrible not to at least give them something." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{fear that}} a {{headscarf}} ban {{will be the first}} step on the road to a laicistic state, which will prohibit religious signs and symbols in the public sphere. I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>That</b> is not my vision of our country, with its centuries of Christian influence.|$|R

[...] "I have <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> before {{where there}} has been {{considerable}} tension of the muscles before death; it is only their final slackening, that is all.

5000|$|Man, we {{was only}} 18-19 {{when we first}} got started. When We broke up we were still like 28. Now we are 35-36. It'd be real {{different}} being in the studio.

5000|$|The plan is {{supported}} by central government. David Cameron MP said: “I {{think this is a}} very important point and I hope that councils up and down the country will look at it. Three large councils are coming together and saving £33m because they are sharing back-office services, executive teams and so on. Frankly, if they can do it, as large councils that have big responsibilities, many other councils should be doing it in London and elsewhere. Until we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening,</b> I do not think it is realistic to say that it is necessary for councils to cut front-line services” ...|$|E
5000|$|Maryland {{finished}} {{its first}} season under Bakich with a 17-39 mark and 5-25 in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Not unexpectedly, outclassed talent-wise in the ACC, the Terrapins matched the worst finish in program history. Bakich said, [...] "I {{know it sounds}} odd, but wins and losses have never been important to me. I wanted to change the attitude of this team first and foremost, and you can already <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening.</b> Our seniors have {{done a great job}} of leading this team, and the transformation has already been made." [...] The 2011 recruiting class was described {{as one of the best}} in school history. Bakich resigned as Maryland's head baseball coach on June 27, 2012, in order to pursue his new head coaching career for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2010 it was {{announced}} that the character had been axed along with five others by the new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood as part of a plan to [...] "breathe new life into the show". Bergin said of his departure: [...] "I've had a great six months working on EastEnders playing Danny. He has been a great character to play and without giving too much away, he's sure to ruffle a few feathers before he leaves Walford." [...] He said the conclusion of Danny's storyline was [...] "satisfying for him as an actor" [...] and that it was the ending the audience deserves. He added that he knew the length of his contract from the start, and although there is always a possibility of a contract being extended, he could never <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> with Danny. He later told All About Soap that he would love to return as Danny, as his storyline was left on a cliffhanger, and explained that Danny's final scenes were emotional with a final twist, saying [...] "his exit sums the character up perfectly." [...] Bergin later said that people used to jeer at him in the street saying: [...] "I would get booed in the supermarket but, because he did everything with a smile, he had that energy about him that he was not really like that. People would boo me, although it wasn't aggressive. It was in a panto spirit." ...|$|E
5000|$|For inspiration, Craig Mabbitt {{said that}} he drew {{experiences}} from many things, stating, [...] "I {{wanted to write about}} every emotion that you can get from life, everything that kind of happens, every kind of story I've heard that really upset me." [...] The track [...] "Lost in Darkness" [...] tells the story about one of Mabbitt's friends who was dragged out of her home and raped at gunpoint. Mabbitt stated that, [...] "She was screaming for help and nobody helped her at all. Everybody just turned the other cheek. That was something that really struck me, and I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> a lot, just people not wanting to lend a helping hand to people when somebody is hurting... That's definitely where I went with that song." [...] The second track, [...] "Massacre", is about Mabbitt's past addictions and the things he did to overcome them. The ballad track [...] "World Around Me" [...] takes a broader view and was written about life in general. [...] "Around Me is about relationships with my ex and my child, everything accumulated into one song." [...] The closing track, [...] "The Aftermath (G3)", is the third song under the title of [...] "The Guillotine" [...] for Escape the Fate. The original Guillotine was sung by Ronnie Radke for Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and was about the video game series Halo. When Mabbitt joined, a song entitled [...] "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine Part II)" [...] was included on This War Is Ours and was also about Halo. However, the second Guillotine was written as well to relate to real-life soldiers in battle. For the self-titled album, Mabbitt wrote a third Guillotine track but did not want to base it off of Halo again. Instead, he wrote a more personal track about his father who was in the military when Mabbitt was a child. [...] "The chorus, ‘Now I'm coming home,' is an ode to my Dad and an ode to all the soldiers out there who are fighting a war for us and waiting to come home to their families." [...] As a whole, Mabbitt feels that, [...] "every track has a completely different underlying story to it." ...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT : South Africa (SA) is {{the leader}} {{in the world with}} regard to {{the number of people that}} are {{infected}} with HIV/AIDS in the world. This poses a threat to South Africa’s political, social and economic development initiatives as majority of those that are infected are between ages 15 - 49. HIV/AIDS has no cure and it is a serious problem that need everybody undivided attention and dedication. It was previously an accepted belief in life that children will grow and take care of their parents once they are grown ups, but today they never live to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> as they continue to be robbed of this opportunity by deaths caused by HIV/AIDS infection. Children are also robbed of parental warmth, guidance and caring environment as their parents are also dying of HIV/AIDS infection and then left behind to fond for themselves. HIV/AIDS infected people are also facing the challenge of dealing with negative societal attitudes while at the same time they had to fight for their lives against the disease as it is not regarded as other diseases by the broader society. They are continuously rejected ostracized, discriminated against, not treated with respect, love, cared and supported for. Everyone needs to help in creating a supportive and enabling environment where HIV/AIDS victims can speak out openly without the fear of being victimized and rejected. The aim of this study is to assess the learner’s knowledge of HIV/AIDS and to determine their attitudes towards People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). It was found that HIV/AIDS knowledge and awareness was high among learners, even though there was some limited knowledge in certain aspects. With regard to perception and attitudes it was discovered that learners had a fair and positive attitude towards PLWHA. It is recommended that these positive attitudes, perception and high knowledge and awareness be sustained through education at schools as they are the appropriate places to teach youth about HIV/AIDS prevention strategies and high risk behaviors. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van die studie was bepaling van die kennis, houding -en persepsievlakke van leerders wat leef met MIV/VIGS. Bevindings van die studie dui daarop dat kennisvlakke van leerders dikwels gebrekking is en redes word daar voor aangevoer. Dit word verder bevind dat die houding – en persepsievlakke redelik goed is by die leerders. Voorstelle word gemaak vir die beter bestuur van MIV/VIGS op skoolvlak ten einde die pandemie so doeltreffend as moontlik op skoolvlak te bestuur...|$|E
