50|$|He {{enjoys the}} <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> before {{stumbling}} into a bush, where he hears birdsong, drawing {{his attention to}} a couple of bluebirds courting. When the bluebirds kiss, two bird chicks jump up from the nest singing. A couple of playful lambs hop by, spurring Pluto to mimic them by hopping as well. His hopping causes him to hit his head on a low-hanging branch and fall yet again into another bush, scaring out rabbits and quails. As one train of quails flees from him, one quail chick lags behind and Pluto decides to run after it, mimicking its way of running. Pluto and the quail stops abruptly as they both hear a deep, bass voice singing about springtime. The voice is echoing out of a tiny burrow in the ground, to which the quail chick puts its ears to better listen to the singing. Suddenly, a fuzzy green caterpillar pops out of the burrow and continues to sing, though now in a high falsetto. The quail is delighted to see food present itself so easily and opens its mouth in anticipation. The caterpillar, halfway through singing does a double-take as he finally notices the quail eyeing him hungrily. The caterpillar reaches out with two of his hands and daintily closes the quail's beak, smiling at it shyly. Bewildered at having its mouth closed, the quail gives the caterpillar enough time to launch itself out of the burrow only to dive headfirst back inside. Not willing to let its prey escape so easily, the quail thrusts it head into the burrow after the caterpillar, manages to bite onto the caterpillar's tail and starts to slowly pull the caterpillar back out. To continue his mimicry, Pluto clamps his teeth on the quail's tail feathers and also starts pulling, lifting the quail into the air, and stretching the caterpillar to more than three times its original length. The caterpillar continues to keep his head inside the burrow while flailing his legs in desperation even though the sound of stretching can be heard. Finally, the quail's tail feathers give out, causing the tug of war to end with Pluto's head whipping back, red feathers floating everywhere. When Pluto investigates, he can see that the force of the caterpillar snapping back to his original length had pulled the quail halfway into the burrow with its head facing out. Underground, the caterpillar sees the quail's rear plugging up his hole, so in vengeance, he uses his many legs to repeatedly kick the quail's rear until the quail is forced out of the burrow like popping champagne cork.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Josep Ensesa Gubert, {{the son of}} a {{successful}} Girona industrialist, persuaded his father to buy the land between the bay at Sant Pol and the long beach at Sa Conca north of Sant Feliu de Guixols. The area didn't even have a name, so the family chose to call it after the Agaro stream that ran through it. Inhabited by squirrels and lizards, supervised by gulls that would inspire the inn's name, the treeless scrub offered little but a gentle climate, splendid isolation and dazzling views. Not to mention the intoxicating <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> pine <b>trees</b> mixed with aniseed plants that grew wild, even to this day. Josep Ensesa was (thankfully) determined that the mystic spirit of the place was not to be sacrificed to the demands of property development {{as the rest of the}} Costa Brava succumbed over the next eight decades to the present.|$|R
60|$|He {{decided to}} {{commence}} with the Botanical Gardens, {{where he had}} already made so many studies, and chose the little artificial pond, sprinkled now with an autumn shower of red and yellow leaves, for though the gardeners longed to sweep them off, they could not reach them with their brooms. The rest of the gardens they swept bare enough, removing every morning Nature's rain of leaves; piling them in heaps, whence from slow fires rose the sweet, acrid smoke that, like the cuckoo's note for spring, the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> lime <b>trees</b> for the summer, is the true emblem of the fall. The gardeners' tidy souls could not abide the gold and green and russet pattern on the grass. The gravel paths must lie unstained, ordered, methodical, without knowledge of the realities of life, nor of that slow and beautiful decay which flings crowns underfoot to star the earth with fallen glories, whence, as the cycle rolls, will leap again wild spring.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly {{the light}} crept up the eastern sky, a little line of pearl, then {{a band of}} pink, broadening, stretching, spreading, until it shot its warm colour across the heavens, tinging {{the edges of the}} {{drifting}} clouds. Over the woodlands lay a thin gray vapour, the tops of the high oaks jutting out like dim islands from the sea of haze. Gradually as the light increased the mist shredded off into little ragged wisps, which thinned and drifted away, until at last, as the sun pushed its glowing edge over the eastern forests, it gleamed upon the reds and oranges and purples of the fading leaves, and upon the broad blue river which curled away to the northward. De Catinat, as he stood at the window looking out, was breathing in the healthy resinous <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trees,</b> mingled with the damp heavy odour of the wet earth, when suddenly his eyes fell upon a dark spot upon the river to the north of them. [...] "There is a canoe coming down!" [...] he cried. In an instant they had all rushed to the opening, but Du Lhut sprang after them, and pulled them angrily towards the door.|$|R
5000|$|The Rainbow Starfrontlets {{feed off}} of nectar taken {{directly}} from brightly colored, <b>scented</b> small flowers <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> herbs, shrubs and epiphytes. They {{tend to favor}} flowers with the highest sugar content. Then they seek it out, aggressively protect, and watch those areas containing flowers with high energy nectar.They use their straw-like tongues to retrieve the nectar while hovering, licking 13 times per second. They may also take some small spiders and insects for sources of protein, in which are needed during the breeding season to ensure the good development of their young. Insects are often hunted in flight swooped off leaves or branches, or are snatched forecfully from spider webs. A nesting female may capture up to 2,000 insects in a day.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> marking <b>trees</b> by {{the brown}} bear occurs throughout {{the range of}} presence of the species. It has recently been recognised as a mean of intra-specific chemical communication, besides the likely function of ecto-parasite removal, and evidence from grizzlies showed that <b>scent</b> marking <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> is mainly performed by adult males during the breeding season. However, detailed studies on this behaviour in the Euroasian brown bear are lacking. We conducted a three year study on a wild bear population of 50 individuals in the Eastern Italian Alps, using camera traps. We aimed to assess the use <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> by bears’ age and sex classes, its temporal variation, and to determine key habitat and human disturbance drivers of the intensity of use <b>of</b> rub <b>trees.</b> Camera trapping yielded more than 500 videos of bears from more than 9000 camera trapping days, age and sex classes were identified in 59 % of the videos. Results showed that rubbing was mainly performed by adult males, with females and sub-adults that only occasionally rubbed. Rubbing was performed more during the breeding season, confirming that the main function of this behaviour is associated to males' breeding strategy. Olfactory investigation was performed by bears {{of all ages and}} sexes, indicating the importance <b>of</b> <b>scent</b> marking at rub trees for intra-specific communication. We used the camera trapping event rate as a raw index of intensity of usage <b>of</b> rub <b>trees</b> and found it to be affected by aspect, type of roads and passage of motor vehicles at the sites, while the passage of people did not affect it. We also estimated bear occupancy and detectability and found that the latter was influenced by trail type and distance from roads and buildings. Our study provides a first contribution to the use <b>of</b> rub <b>trees</b> by brown bears in the Alps. Download the complete issue...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> developmental stability (low fluctuating asymmetry, FA) is attractive to women who are fertile (at high-conception risk points in their menstrual cycles), but not to other women or men. Prior research also indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> dissimilarity in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes {{may play a role}} in human mate choice. We studied the scent attractiveness to the opposite sex of t-shirts worn for 2 nights 2 ̆ 7 sleep. Our results indicate that the two olfactory systems are independent. We repeated previous results from studies <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. We repeated previous results from MHC research in part; men, but not women, showed a preference for t-shirts with the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> MHC dissimilarity. Women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scent</b> ratings <b>of</b> t-shirts were uncorrelated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC dissimilarity and allele frequency, but positively correlated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC heterozygosity. Fertile women did not exhibit any MHC trait preferences. Women 2 ̆ 7 s preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men who were heterozygous for MHC alleles may be stronger in women who are at infertile cycle points. Men preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> common MHC alleles, which may function to avoid mates with rare alleles that exhibit gestational drive. Men also preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> women at fertile cycle points. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> facially attractive women, but not men, was preferred. Neither FA nor facial attractiveness in either sex correlated with MHC dissimilarity to others, MHC heterozygosity, or MHC allelic rarity...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{provided}} additional confirmatory evidence showing MHC influences mate preference.

50|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that men prefer the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> {{women in her}} most fertile period. For example, in one study, men rated the body odours of T-shirts worn by women during their most fertile phase as more sexy and pleasant than T-shirts worn during their least fertile phase. Despite this, {{much of the research}} in the area concludes that the effect <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry appears to be sex specific such that men do not find the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetrical women more attractive than the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> asymmetrical women. It therefore appears that attraction to symmetric body odour of the opposite sex appears to apply exclusively to women, and specifically fertile women, as non-fertile women and men do not display this preference.|$|R
40|$|Many snakes {{are able}} to use their chemosensory system to detect <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> conspecifics, which is {{important}} in many social contexts. Age discrimination based on chemical cues may be especially important to ensure access to sexually mature potential partners. In this study, we used 24 individual Boa constrictor snakes (12 adults mature and 12 non-mature individuals) that had been captured in different areas of Ecuador, and were maintained in captivity at the Vivarium of Quito. We used tongue-flick experiments to examine whether these snakes were able to discriminate between scents from mature and non-mature individuals. Results showed that B. constrictor snakes used chemical cues to recognize conspecifics and that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> individuals of different ages elicited chemosensory responses of different magnitudes. The scents from adult conspecifics elicited the quickest and highest chemosensory responses (i. e., short latency times and high tongue-flick rates), although {{we did not find}} differential responses to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> males and females. The magnitude of the responses was lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> sub adult individuals, and then even lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> juvenile snakes, but in all cases the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> snakes was discriminated from a blank control. We discuss the potential chemical mechanisms that may allow age recognition and its implications for social and sexual behavior of this snake species...|$|R
