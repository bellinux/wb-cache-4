Surviving trees have resin-bleeding lesions and brittle needles and become wilted and discolored. Damage to the trees is increased when the beetle acts as a vector for <b>sapstain</b> fungi, introducing them into the wounds. These pigmented fungi discolor wood, producing cosmetic damage that makes it less marketable. This beetle can act as a vector for numerous species of sapstaining fungi in the genus Ophiostoma.|$|E
40|$|Vector-pathogen {{dynamics}} play {{a central}} role in understanding tree health and forest dynamics. There is substantial evidence that bark beetles act as spore vectors for many species of fungi that cause ‘sapstain ’ discolouration of damaged trees and timber. However, the direct quantitative link between vector-mediated spore dispersal and subsequent <b>sapstain</b> colonisation of wood is not fully understood. Here, we used caged versus uncaged experimental logs to test whether the exclusion of bark beetles quantitatively alters the distribution and intensity of <b>sapstain</b> fungal spread within damaged trees. Using generalised linear mixed models, we tested the effect of bark beetle exclusion on <b>sapstain</b> intensity within and among cut logs at two plantation forest sites. Overall, <b>sapstain</b> was found on all logs regardless of caging treatment, indicating that <b>sapstain</b> colonisation can occur (to some degree) without arthropod vectors, probably via wind, rain-splash and, potentially, latent endophytic development. This was supported by the dominance of Diplodia pinea in fungal isolations taken from trees felled at the site, as this fungal species is known to disperse independently of bark beetles. However, the intensity of <b>sapstain</b> within and among experimental logs was significantly greater in uncaged than in caged logs, where beetle colonisation was significantly greater. This appeared to be driven by a significant within-log association between the intensity of staining and the intensity of beetle, and other arthropod, tunnelling and feeding activities. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the dominant mechanism underlying the role of bark beetles in <b>sapstain</b> development i...|$|E

40|$|Storms causing {{windthrow}} {{are major}} natural disturbance events and an unpredictable hazard to forest planning. Knowledge of regional and seasonal climatic effects on <b>sapstain</b> and decay fungi will allow forest managers to minimise losses from wood deterioration during salvage operations. A {{study was conducted}} monitoring <b>sapstain</b> in trees that were experimentally felled to simulate storm breakage at up to four times during the year in. Pinus radiata plantations across six locations in different climatic zones throughout New Zealand. It was found that drying of sapwood and development of <b>sapstain</b> depended more on the season when the storm occurred, rather than the time since felling. <b>Sapstain</b> appeared almost immediately in stems felled during summer, at some locations reaching more than 20 % mean cross-sectional cover inside logs within 3. months, whereas in those felled during winter an initial lag phase during the cooler months preceded a more rapid rise during spring and summer. Rates varied substantially between locations with a tendency for faster deterioration where average temperatures were greater. For trees damaged during winter, {{it was predicted that}} a.

40|$|The {{increasing}} frequency {{and severity of}} windthrow events affecting the forestry industry in New Zealand have raised important management issues surrounding the rate of colonisation of fallen trees by <b>sapstain</b> fungi and the time available for salvage harvesting before <b>sapstain</b> degradation limits potential economic returns. These fungi {{are known to be}} spread by a multitude of factors including wind, rain splash, harvesting processes and insect vectoring. Apart from the ecological interest in these interactions between fungi, plants and insects, <b>sapstain</b> fungi are also economically important because their hyphae discolour the sapwood and reduce the overall quality of the timber. The amount of time available to salvage harvest damaged trees is unknown, especially on seasonal and regional scales. Manipulative experiments were established in Pinus radiata forests to examine this seasonal and regional variation in <b>sapstain</b> attack following windthrow, and to investigate the importance of bark beetles as vectors of <b>sapstain</b> fungi. A range of methods were implemented to assess the role of bark beetles as vectors and to ascertain which <b>sapstain</b> fungi are associated with them. Experimental billet logs were caged to exclude beetles and subsequently analyse fungal attack in comparison with identical logs left exposed to beetles. In addition, individual beetles were sampled directly to determine whether they carried spores of particular fungal species and to assess the degree of association in vector-fungal dynamics. Finally, a novel application of DNA melt peak analysis was developed to investigate variation among the fungal communities associated with beetles potentially involved in vectoring <b>sapstain</b> spores. The moisture content of fallen trees was found to be the main factor regulating <b>sapstain</b> development, and when moisture content drops below 100 % (on dry weight basis) <b>sapstain</b> fungi grew rapidly. The speed at which this level drops depends on the season, with much faster drying occurring in the warmer months of spring and summer. As a result, trees that fell in the previous winter or autumn did not develop significant <b>sapstain</b> levels until temperatures rose in the following summer, suggesting that storm-damaged trees that fall in winter can be left safely until just before the next summer before they are no longer suitable for salvage harvest. In New Zealand, the bark beetle species acting as vectors of <b>sapstain</b> fungi are not behaviourally adapted to colonisation of logs that are not in contact with the ground. Following windthrow events in pine forests, trees generally lie with their stems suspended above the level of the ground by their branches. As a result, under these circumstances, beetle colonisation of windthrown timber was low, and bark beetles were not a significant vector of stain. The caged and un-caged experimental log billets, however, were in contact with the ground, resulting in colonisation of the un-caged logs. In this case, bark beetles did {{play an important role in}} contributing to <b>sapstain</b> intensity, and the stain distribution within the logs mirrored that of the stain distribution. However, this effect may be due to the provision of access points for wind- or water-borne spores of the non-insect vectored stain fungus Diplodia pinea, or to the spread of hyphae through the tunnelling and feeding activities of beetles within the tree, rather than by bark beetles acting as vectors of spores. Bark beetles were confirmed as <b>sapstain</b> vectors with the isolation of seven different ophiostomatoid stain fungi from them, five of which were also found in wood. Finally, the development of a laboratory based, rapid species identification method was developed to identify fungal DNA. Melt peak analysis allowed the species-specific DNA melt temperatures to be compared with the melt temperatures of known species to be able to rapidly, and cheaply, identify an unknown species. Bark beetles are vectors of <b>sapstain</b> fungi in P. radiata forests, however the bark beetle species naturalised in New Zealand prefer to colonise wood when it is in contact with the ground. Following windthrow, trees are generally not attacked by beetles as they are held from the ground by their branches, leaving them to be stained predominantly be wind and rain dispersed stain fungus D. pinea. Stain did not occur until the moisture content of fallen trees dropped below 100 %, which only happens in the warm months of summer and spring. In New Zealand, there are interactions between trees and bark beetles, and bark beetles with fungal pathogens from all around the globe resulting in a unique novel assemblage of species together for the first time. Understanding the dynamics of these species in their novel environment is crucial to effectively responding to potential pest threats...|$|E

40|$|Storm {{damage in}} {{production}} forests constitutes {{a major source}} of economic loss world wide, yet the retrieval of salvageable timber remains problematic. In particular, an inability to anticipate when <b>sapstain</b> and degrade will appear hampers the planning of log recovery operations. A study was conducted to monitor the deterioration of fallen trees following two winter storms causing wind and snow damage in a Pinus radiata plantation forest in the upper South Island of New Zealand. Percentage <b>sapstain,</b> incidence of basidiomycete decay fungi, and frequency of bark beetle infestation increased, while percentage sapwood moisture content decreased, over a period of 1 year. These changes proceeded more rapidly in fallen trees that were severed at stump height, to simulate breakage, than in those that were left partially rooted.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The fungi {{that cause}} mold and stain of freshly sawn lumber result in {{millions}} of dollars in losses to the forest products industry. Stain and mold are typically prevented by either kiln drying or by application of a topical fungicide. While these treatments are effective, kiln drying is costly and many mills object to use of chemicals. One alternative to conventional stain prevention is biological control. One problem with this approach on western wood species such as Douglas-fir is the lack of information on the target stain and mold fungi that colonize the sapwood of this species. The fungi colonizing freshly sawn Douglas-fir sapwood were isolated and identified by culturing lumber obtained from 4 different locations in the Willamette Valley in western Oregon using regular, streptomycin amended or streptomycin/cycloheximide amended malt extract agar. The ability of each taxa to cause discoloration was evaluated in a laboratory discoloration test. A total of 547 fungi were isolated from Douglas-fir sapwood, representing 24 genera and 45 species. Graphium species were the most frequently isolated fungi, representing 17. 4 percent of all isolates. Most of these isolates were considered as anamorphs of Ophiostoma piceae. Other frequently isolated <b>sapstaining</b> fungi included Cephaloascus fragrans, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhinocladiella cellaris, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Scytalidium lignicola. Molds, primary Penicillium and Trichoderma species, were frequently isolated, and may represent potential biological control organisms or competitors of biological control organisms because of their antagonistic characteristics. Many fungal species of unknown biological significance were also isolated from Douglas-fir sapwood, and their roles in the stain development merit further study. Media and lumber source both affected the fiingal flora isolated. Among stain fungi, Graphium species exclusively occurred on cycloheximide amended media. There was also close relationship between the degree of fungal colonization and the length of time after the lumber was cut. The degree of discoloration exceeded 70 percent in all Graphium species. Cephaloascus fragrans, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhinocladiella cellaris, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Scytalidium lignicola and Thysanophora penicillioides also produced extensive staining of Douglas-fir sapwood. Mold isolates also caused discoloration of Douglas-fir sapwood wafers, although their discoloration could be easily removed. All Penicillium species produced over 90 percent discoloration, while Trichoderma species produced 80 to 86 percent discoloration. The results indicate that Graphium species are the primary stain fungi on Douglas-fir sapwood, however, other species were also capable of colonizing this material...|$|R

Triglycerides cause deposits in softwood mechanical pulping, and both microbial and enzymatic products have been commercialized to be applied on wood and pulp, respectively. The former are based on colorless strains of <b>sapstain</b> fungi. The latter are improved lipases, including thermostable variants from directed evolution. These enzymes are among the additives of choice in pulping of high-resin-content softwoods.

All five isolates of Trichoderma harzianum and Serratia plymuthica could inhibit stain fungi growth in agar plates and exhibited bioprotectant potential against <b>sapstain</b> fungi on wood wafers. The production of chitinase and protease {{related to the}} breakdown of stain fungal cell walls was studied in liquid media and wood wafer cultures for test bioprotectants. Higher chitinase activity was obtained in chitin-containing media. Although the synthesis of chitinase was repressed by simple carbon substrates in liquid media, chitinase activity was still detected on wood wafer cultures when the bioprotectant was pregrown on media containing these same carbon sources. No protease activity was detected in liquid cultures, but protease activities were detected on wood wafer cultures. The relationship between biocontrol performance and lytic enzyme activities was evaluated using mixed cultures of bioprotectants and stain fungi on wood wafers. Generally, fungal stain inhibition increased with increases in chitinase. Increasing chitinase activity above about 0. 08 uU/m 1 had a minimal effect on fungal stain inhibition. Further statistical analysis indicated that biocontrol efficacy appeared {{to be related to}} LOG (chitinase activity) but not to LOG (protease activity).

In all wrapped stacks the COl levels increased and the 0, concentration decreased, reaching zero within about 14 days. The addition ofyeast aided the depletion ofoxygen and the increase in carbon dioxide in wrapped stacks, although it had no significant effect on stain development. Further trials with even simpler wrapping systems are needed to fully assess the additive effect ofusing Yeasts to help maintain low oxygen levels under such conditions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} pest status and ecology of Hylastes ater in Pinus radiata reforestation sites. Aspects of the flight activity, larval survival and adult emergence from stumps by Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda were investigated. H. ater {{was found to be}} univoltine with a peak of flight activity in autumn. Competition from H. ligniperda has displaced H. ater from sites harvested during the spring and summer months. H ligniperda was bivoltine with peaks of flight activity in spring and summer. The establishment of H. ligniperda in New Zealand has resulted in changes in the lifecycle of H. ater. Attack by Hater on P. radiata seedlings was found to be the dominant cause of seedling mortality in the first year after planting. Although high mortality of seedlings has been recorded from some sites, seedling mortality greater than 10 % was found to be uncommon in this study. However, high levels of sub-lethal feeding were common in many plantings. High-risk sites were those harvested in autumn and planted the following winter. Seedlings treated at planting with the insecticide Marshal suSCon® demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality due to Hater attack. Marshal suSCon® had a repellent effect on H. ater. Sub-lethal attack did not effect the growth of seedlings {{in the first two years}} after planting. Six species of <b>sapstain</b> fungi were isolated from sub-lethally attacked seedlings. There was a significant relationship between severity of attack and invasion of the seedling by <b>sapstain</b> fungi. A seventh species of <b>sapstain</b> was isolated from H. ater but was not found in any of the experimental seedlings. Because of the potential economic significance of these findings, further research is required to unequivocally demonstrate whether or not H. ater vectors sap stain fungi to seedlings during attacks. Six unrelated P. radiata seedling types were assessed for resistance to Hater attack. Seedling types exhibited varying levels of resistance to attack. The frequency of attack was not different between resistant and non-resistant seedlings, indicating that Hater did not make a selection prior to attack. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms of resistance, but opportunities exist for resistant seedlings to be used in management programmes. H. ater and H. ligniperda were attracted to volatiles in the field. Ethanol added to α-pinene, β-pinene and raw turpentine had a synergistic effect by enhancing attraction. Although there were differences in numbers trapped by the different treatments, sex ratios of Hater attracted to volatiles and the control were equal in number. This indicates that aggregation or sex pheromones are not likely to be produced by Hater, and it is attracted to host volatiles. The information generated during this research was used to suggest strategies to manage the risks associated with Hater in second rotation forests in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Ninety wood-inhabiting fungi were {{screened}} {{for their ability}} to degrade and detoxify acetone extractives in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood under solid-state fermentation conditions. Fungal degradation of resin acids and long-chain fatty acids was investigated by high pressure liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) and the toxicity of the acetone soluble fraction of wood measured by Microtox assay. Discriminant analysis of data showed different patterns of extractive detoxification for white-rot basidiomycetes and <b>sapstain</b> fungi. The major detoxification skills of basidiomycetes appeared {{to be related to the}} highest degradation of resin acids, and particularly dehydroabietic acid. Among them, Ischnoderma benzoinum, Stereum sanguinolentum and Trametes versicolor greatly reduced the sapwood toxicity due to acetone extractives from the EC 50 value of 0. 08 mg wood ml- 1 to levels between 5 - 10 mg wood ml- 1...|$|E
40|$|Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) {{are common}} vectors of Ophiostoma species. These fungi include primary tree {{pathogens}} and important <b>sapstain</b> agents. In Mexico, Ips calligraphus and Dendroctonus mexicanus occur on {{many species of}} pine. Pinus maximinoi and P. pseudostrobus are the hosts of both species of insects. Little {{research has been done}} on ophiostomatoid fungi associated with pine bark beetles in Mexico. We recently obtained specimens of these bark beetles and their galleries from Mexico. The aim {{of the study was to}} isolate and identify Ophiostoma species associated with the two beetle species. In total, six ophiostomatoid species were found to be associated with them. These included Ceratocystiopsis minuta, Ophiostoma pluriannulatum, an O. galeiformis-like species, two unidentified Sporothrix spp., as well as a new species similar to O. adjuncti, O. ips, and O. montium, that we name as O. pulvinisporum sp. nov...|$|E
40|$|Wood extractives (resin) cause pitch {{deposition}} {{problems and}} effluent toxicity in pulp and papermaking. The ability of six sapstaining fungi to degrade and detoxify extractive constituents in Scots pine sapwood was examined, {{and the results}} were compared with those obtained with the commercial depitching fungus Cartapip (Ophiostoma piliferum). Pestalotiopsis crassiuscula and O. piliferum were the best strains and they provided high reductions of total resin (50 – 60 ␒n 6 weeks). Both strains were highly effective in the degradation of individual extractive components including triglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids. Although all strains displayed moderate to high pitch degradation, their detoxifying capacity was limited. Two important exceptions were Ceratocystis deltoideospora and O. piliferum that caused a 11 – 14 -fold decrease in toxicity (Microtox bioassay). These results indicate the potential of wood pretreatment with the selected <b>sapstain</b> fungi for minimizing pitch problems and decreasing effluent toxicity in pulping...|$|E
40|$|Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) {{are common}} vectors of ophiostomatoid fungi, {{including}} several primary tree pathogens {{as well as}} important agents of <b>sapstain.</b> Dendroctonus valens, considered a secondary bark beetle in its native, North America, has caused unprecedented tree mortality in China. Several species of ophiostomatoid fungi {{are associated with the}} beetle in North America, but little research has been done on the fungi associated with this invasive bark beetle in China. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize ophiostomatoid fungi associated with this D. valens in China. Ten ophiostomatoid fungi (Leptographium procerum, L. pini-densiflorae, L. truncatum, Hyalorhinocladiella pinicola, Ophiostoma flocossum, O. ips, O. minus, O. piceae, O. abietinum and an undescribed taxon close to O. rectangulosporium) were isolated from the bark beetle or its galleries and identified using morphology and DNA sequence comparisons. Leptographium truncatum, L. pini-densiflorae, H. pinicola, O. flocossum, and O. minus are reported from China for the first time. Leptographium procerum was the most frequently isolated species...|$|E
40|$|Phlebiopsis gigantea (=Phanerochaete gigantea) is a {{white rot}} fungus that rapidly colonizes cut stumps, stems, and {{branches}} of pine. Two laboratory and several field studies showed that inoculation of red pine logs, Pinus resinosa, with P. gigantea reduced the pitch content of wood, facilitated bark removal, modified wood cells, and controlled detrimental <b>sapstain.</b> Isolations from inoculated logs revealed up to 100 and 80 % colonization of the sapwood by P. gigantea after 8 weeks {{in the field and}} 32 days in the laboratory, respectively. Logs colonized by P. gigantea in both the laboratory and field showed a 9 to 71 % reduction in pitch content, as well as a significant enhancement of bark removal. Examination with Simons' stain of refined wood fibers from inoculated logs revealed an increase in cell wall porosity. Blue stain fungi that cause dark discoloration of the sapwood were inhibited by inoculation with P. gigantea. These studies demonstrate that biological processing of logs with P. gigantea can result in substantial benefits to the pulp and papermaking process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ophiostoma {{species such}} as O. quercus are the most {{frequent}} causal agents of <b>sapstain</b> of freshly felled hardwood timber and pulpwood. Many species are regarded as economically important agents of wood degradation. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify a collection of Ophiostoma isolates, resembling O. quercus, found on stained Euca-lyptus pulpwood chips in China. DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions, including the 5. 8 S region, of the ribosomal DNA, and parts of the b-tubulin and elongation factor- 1 a genes, revealed that the isolates were not O. quercus. Surprisingly, they represented O. tsotsi, a wound-infesting fungus recently described from hardwoods in Africa. In addition, sequence data from an isolate from agarwood in Vietnam, identified in a previous study as belonging to an unknown Pesotum species, were also shown to represent O. tsotsi. A high level of genetic variability was observed among isolates of both O. quercus and O. tsotsi. This was unexpected and suggests that both species have been present in Asia for a significant amount of time...|$|E
