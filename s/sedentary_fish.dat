Short dives for sedentary prey were more expensive than dives of similar duration for motile prey (e. g. 20 % higher for a 10  s dive) whereas the reverse was true for long dives (i. e. long dives for motile prey were more expensive than for sedentary prey). Across dives of all durations, the foraging phase of the dive was more expensive when the birds hunted motile prey, presumably due to pursuit costs. The period of descent in all the dives undertaken appears to have been more expensive when the birds foraged on sedentary prey, probably due to a higher swimming speed during this period...|$|E

We used a multiple regression method based on permutations of distance matrices. Our study reveals that L. dimidiatus are significantly more numerous at sites where ecological factors, such as the species richness of the fish community, may promote their cleaning activity. Moreover, they were significantly more abundant in atolls presenting a large number of <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> species, few predators and few fishes living in large groups.

These efforts aim to inform conservation strategies for marine regions to ensure they have inbuilt capacity to retain biological diversity and ecological function in the face of global environmental change – particularly changes in climate and resource exploitation. In the absence of direct biological and ecological information for many marine species, scientists are increasingly using spatiallyexplicit, predictive-modeling approaches. Through the improved access to multibeam sonar and underwater video technology these models provide spatial predictions of the most suitable regions for an organism at resolutions previously not possible. However, sensible-looking, well-performing models can provide very different predictions of distribution depending on which occurrence dataset is used. To examine this, we construct species distribution models for nine temperate marine <b>sedentary</b> <b>fishes</b> for a 25. 7 km 2 study region off the coast of southeastern Australia. We use generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM) and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to build models based on colocated occurrence datasets derived from two underwater video methods (i. e. baited and towed video) and fine-scale multibeam sonar based seafloor habitat variables. Overall, this study found that the choice of modeling approach did not considerably influence the prediction of distributions based on the same occurrence dataset.

30|$|The spatial {{variation}} of reproductive measures of bluegill in Lake Yogo may imply that bluegill utilize a relatively narrow habitat during the reproductive season, and are consequently impacted by thermal conditions of each habitat.

A study conducted in Pelican Lake (332 ha) in Nebraska, USA, showed that the estimated home ranges of bluegill varied 0.13 to 172 ha (Paukert et al.

Temporal distribution of pollutants was also investigated over restricted survey ponds sampled three times round year 2007. Sedentary pond Prussian carp juveniles were also captured to determine their brain aromatase activity (AA) and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) levels. Heavy metal distribution was also examined in various pond matrices. Amongst the pesticides analysed, only herbicides were detected. Contamination of pond water by atrazine was frequently observed during spring 2004, while isoproturon and glyphosate were detected round year 2007. Levels of herbicides were inversely related to the distance of ponds to crop field, and values peaked in April or October. Absence of endocrine disruptors in pond water was confirmed by lack of modulation in VTG and AA in male fish. Heavy metals were present in all the pond matrices, but overall contamination levels were low. The results demonstrated that Belgian ponds were mainly contaminated by herbicides and that pond <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> were not affected by endocrine disruptors. They also demonstrated a marked effect of land-use intensity on herbicide pollution which can be mitigated by an adjustment of the buffer zones. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} using marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) to conserve fisheries and {{the marine environment}} generally has come largely from <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> living on tropical reefs. Objectives of MPAs include stock maintenance or recovery, habitat restoration, protection of non-target species, development of recreational and educational activities, and promotion of scientific understanding.

40|$|Mucus {{production}} by scleractinians appears as an antifouling mechanism which prevents settlement of other organisms and {{accumulation of sediments}} on their surface. This Surface Muccopolysaccharide Layer (SML) harbours dense populations of bacteria which play a paramount role in scleractinians nutrition, metabolism and good health maintenance. However, environmental disturbances can alter these microbiocenoses. Characterization of bacterial communities was carried out using a set of simple techniques that enable us to describe the state and functions of whole microbial communities associated with different hard coral species. Multi-comparisons have been performed on bacterial communities from open water, interstitial water, sedimentary interface and macro algae {{as well as between}} healthy and bleached colonies, and patches associated or not with Pomacentridae fishes. The functional study included measurements of bacterial biomass, respiration, oxydative and hydrolytic metabolisms. Non-Fungiidae corals and sedimentary interface have a quite similar bacterial biomass but open water, interstitial water and macro-algae are characterized by higher bacterial biomass. Bacterial respiration potential is similar on corals and at the sedimentary interface, but it is higher in interstitial water and lower in open water and for bacterial community associated with macro-algae. Hydrolytic activities are highest in SML. Bleached corals and patches associated with Pomacentridae fishes show more abundant bacteria, with higher respiration rate and higher hydrolytic activity than corals without fishes and healthy ones. In addition, bacteria of bleached corals display a higher division percentage, a higher growth rate and a lower turn-over time We confirmed that bleaching events or the presence of <b>sedentary</b> <b>fishes</b> modify the bacterial communities structure and affect relationships between coral, endosymbiotic algae, SML-associated microbial community and associated organisms. Such results highlight that SML-bacterial communities are modified by bleaching and raise the question of a potential protection of fishes against pathogens. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|River {{systems are}} {{vulnerable}} to natural and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and will often harbor populations deviating markedly from simplified theoretical models. We investigated fine-scale population structure in the <b>sedentary</b> river <b>fish</b> Cottus gobio using microsatellites and compared migration estimates from three FST estimators, a coalescent maximum-likelihood method and Bayesian recent migration analyses. Source-sink structure was evident via asymmetry in migration and genetic diversity with smaller upstream locations emigration biased and larger downstream subpopulations immigration biased. Patterns of isolation by distance suggested that the system was largely, but not entirely, in migration-drift equilibrium, with headwater populations harboring a signal of past colonizations {{and in some cases}} also recent population bottlenecks. Up- vs. downstream asymmetry in population structure was partly attributable to the effects of flow direction, but was enhanced by weirs prohibiting compensatory upstream migration. Estimators of migration showed strong correspondence, at least in relative terms, especially if pairwise FST was used as an indirect index of relative gene flow rather than being translated to Nm. Since true parameter values are unknown in natural systems, comparisons among estimators are important, both to determine confidence in estimates of migration and to validate the performance of different methods...|$|R
40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 346 - 356 No-take marine {{reserves}} (NTRs) may promote {{recovery of}} exploited populations within their boundaries and spillover of fishes to adjacent fishing grounds, thus potentially benefiting the local fisheries. Although {{some studies have}} measured spillover by examining gradients of fish abundance and body size across reserve boundaries, {{there are no such}} studies to date including information from before reserve establishment, thus seriously limiting interpretation of results. We measured reef fish spillover from a NTR (Itacolomis Reef, Eastern Brazil) by estimating biomass and body size across the reserve boundary before (2001) and after (2002 – 2005) initiation of protection. Replicate sites were sampled inside and outside the reserve, with unprotected sites included in three distance categories from the reserve boundary: 0 – 400, 400 – 800 and 800 – 1200 m. This latter category generally surpasses the scales over which spillover is expected to influence patterns of fish abundance outside reserves (generally < 500 m), particularly for relatively <b>sedentary</b> <b>fishes,</b> thus acting as a control for the reserve effect. Habitat measurements were undertaken at the same sites, from 2003 on. Biomass of Scarus trispinosus, a major fishery resource and the dominant species in terms of biomass (37. 4 % of total biomass), was lower inside the reserve area before its establishment. During this same period, no individuals of two primary target species, Mycteroperca bonaci and Sparisoma axillare, were recorded inside the reserve. Coral cover was consistently lower inside the reserve from 2003 on. Biomass and body size of M. bonaci, aswell as biomass of Ocyurus chrysurus, increased continuously inside the reserve after its establishment, with no similar increases recorded in control sites. Evidences of spillover (i. e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to its boundary) were obtained for M. bonaci, O. chrysurus and S. trispinosus, although this pattern was only marginally significant for O. chrysurus. Despite these positive signs, recovery and spillover of S. trispinosus were probably inhibited by increased poaching from 2003 on. Our results indicate that the NTR at Itacolomis Reef was established a priori on poor quality habitats. Thus, future spatial comparisons between protected and unprotected sites would underestimate changes due to protection. These findings highlight the importance of baseline information and continued monitoring for adequately understanding the effects of NTRs, as well as the need of closer collaboration between natural and social scientists in order to effectively protect high-quality habitats in the long term while accounting for the socio-economic needs of local fishing communities...|$|R
40|$|No-take marine {{reserves}} {{are one of}} the oldest and most versatile tools used across the Pacific for the conservation of reef resources, in particular for invertebrates traditionally targeted by local fishers. Assessing their actual efficiency is still a challenge in complex ecosystems such as coral reefs, where reserve effects are likely to be obscured by high levels of environmental variability. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential interference of small-scale habitat structure on the efficiency of reserves. The spatial distribution of widely harvested macroinvertebrates was surveyed in a large set of protected vs. unprotected stations from eleven reefs located in New Caledonia. Abundance, density and individual size data were collected along random, small-scale (20 × 1 m) transects. Fine habitat typology was derived with a quantitative photographic method using 17 local habitat variables. Marine reserves substantially augmented the local density, size structure and biomass of the target species. Density of Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima doubled globally inside the reserve network; average size was greater by 10 to 20 % for T. niloticus. We demonstrated that the apparent success of protection could be obscured by marked variations in population structure occurring over short distances, resulting from small-scale heterogeneity in the reef habitat. The efficiency of reserves appeared to be modulated by the availability of suitable habitats at the decimetric scale ("microhabitats") for the considered sessile/low-mobile macroinvertebrate species. Incorporating microhabitat distribution could significantly enhance the efficiency of habitat surrogacy, a valuable approach in the case of conservation targets focusing on endangered or emblematic macroinvertebrate or relatively <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> species...|$|E

Fifteen adults were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and monitored between July 2007 and February 2008 for periods of up to 36 d. Interindividual variability was detected for both spatial and temporal patterns. There were 2 principal movement behaviours that were recorded, with some individuals showing high site fidelity and others showing a more mobile behaviour, moving out from the monitoring area. Observation-area curves indicated that a period between 3 and 5 d was required to determine home ranges of the <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish.</b> Home range sizes were small, with a minimum shift of core areas occurring on a daily basis. Total minimum convex polygon (MCP) areas ranged between 0. 102 and 0. 671 km 2, whereas 95 % kernel utilization distributions (KUD) ranged between 0. 760 and 1. 333 km 2. Core areas (50 % KUD) ranged between 0. 175 and 0. 294 km 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in home range patterns between day and night periods. However, the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) revealed diel rhythms on the detection pattern that could be related to a resting behaviour at night.

40|$|Multi-biomarker {{approach}} is extensively used {{to characterize the}} effects of ecosystem contamination on fish health. In order to measure multi-biomarker responses in freshwater ecosystems, numerous wild fish species have been used. However, the geographical distribution of these extensively characterized fish species did not allow a large sampling for ecotoxicological application and justifies the research of novel sentinel species for biomonitoring. The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize the potential of the European bullhead (Cottus sp.) as sentinel fish species to assess the effects of pollution using a set of biochemical biomarkers. This fish is widespread throughout Europe, and it's <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> that allows assessing local disturbances conversely to migratory or mobile fish species. The selected biomarkers included biotransformation enzyme (i. e 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, EROD), oxidative stress (i. e glutathione peroxidase, GPx and lipoperoxidation, TBARS) and neurotoxic parameters (i. e acetylcholinesterase, AChE). To evaluate the potential of European bullhead for biomonitoring, laboratory and field experiments were conducted. Laboratory investigations were performed to characterize chemical-induced variations of biomarkers using reference chemical compounds. For this purpose, bullheads were exposed to beta-naphtoflavone (BNF), fenitrothion and copper in order to evaluate respectively EROD, AChE and GPx activities as well as TBARS data. BNF generated a rapid induction of liver EROD activity in bullhead. Fenitrothion had no effect on the AChE activities. In field, wild bullheads were sampled, in the North of France, between September and October 2008 at seven sites considered as benchmark by the Water Framework Directive, and five contaminated sites. The selected set of biomarkers was measured in fish from sites exhibiting various contamination levels to evaluate discriminant power of this tool and to characterize response profiles in a multicontamination context.

40|$|In Chile, the {{indiscriminate}} harvest {{for export}} of the edible shellfish, Concholepas concholepas or false abalone, propelled by a neo-liberal market economy during the 1970 s, almost {{led to the}} extinction of the species, thereby threatening the dependant small-scale artisan fishers’ survival {{as well as the}} ecosystem. To reverse this, fishers’ organizations in Chile have adopted the state created regulatory measure, Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR; locally known as Management Areas [...] MAs). Replacing the former unsuccessful fishing regulatory measurements, the MEABR regime empowers the fishers with exclusive territorial use rights (TURF) to manage the species, often under commons institutions, thus creating new seascapes of confidence. However, {{as is often the case}} with new solutions, emergent problems are posed that threaten to undermine the reform. With the new regulated extraction measure and geographical expansion of this novel labour and production alternative, fishers experience a transition from ‘nomadic’ to <b>sedentary</b> <b>fishing</b> leading to a transformation of their lifestyle and skills. If MAs become permanent, fishing in rural areas may lead to tensions as the fishers settle on coastal lands without entitlement, or are hindered from developing their own fisheries infrastructure. The legal system does not seem to fully foresee the consequences of the reform, and prevailing power relations and private property rights work to disadvantage the fishers. Using a participatory approach for the first research location of El Quisco (Valparaíso Region), and interviews with key informants for the second research location of Puerto Oscuro (Coquimbo Region), fishers’ views of the Chilean TURF were evaluated. How fishers perceive this experience should be central for the success or failure of the MAs as a viable alternative to the earlier conditions of open access. While the assessment of El Quisco deals more with the performance of the MA, Puerto Oscuro is used to portray the seascapes of conflict that have emerged as ownership of the coastal land is contested. The study shows that while the reform has brought better incomes from the benthic resources, the overall economic importance of the MAs for the fishers is reduced relative to the incomes coming from fishing activities realized outside the MAs. Experiences in both cases have been otherwise positive in terms of the recuperation of the species, ecological concerns and strengthening fishers’ so-called soft assets. Nevertheless, many problems remain, among them the problem of access to the sea border and those related to ambiguous land rights to support coastal settlement and fishing infrastructure development...|$|R

40|$|Marine environments at depths below - 10 to - 25 m {{are almost}} devoid of ambient red {{sunlight}} because water quickly attenuates long wavelengths. This stenospectral light environment presents unique opportunities for organisms that can transform ambient blue-green light into red light by fluorescence. Numerous marine fish species display intricate patterns of fluorescence. Because color vision {{is a key}} component of fish sensory ecology, several putative visual functions of red fluorescence have been proposed but are difficult to test experimentally. Here, we follow a comparative approach to assess the consistency between the phylogenetic distribution of red fluorescence with its presumed functions. We collected and analyzed the largest data set of red fluorescence in fishes to date, consisting of confirmed cases in 272 primarily diurnal fish species from 49 out of 90 surveyed fish families and 12 out of 21 surveyed fish orders, contrasted to 393 fish species with confirmed absence of red fluorescence. Based on a priori hypotheses on adaptive function, we compare the prevalence of red fluorescence among pre-defined sets of species based on ecological or biological characteristics while controlling for shared ancestry. When comparing between species, we find no evidence that red fluorescence is more prevalent in deep-water species, contrasting with our recent finding that fluorescence brightness increases with depth within species. There is also no evidence for a role in group-driven communication. Phylogenetic patterns are consistent, however, with three other predictions. First, fluorescence with a rather patchy distribution across the body occurred significantly more often among sit-and-wait predators or otherwise <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> than in more mobile species, consistent with background matching for camouflage. Second, small, predatory fishes tended to show red fluorescent irides disproportionally often consistent with a proposed function in prey localization. Finally, sexually dimorphic species showed fluorescent fins more often, as predicted if relevant in sexual communication. From these findings, we derive predictions for experimental investigations of the presumed functions of red fluorescence...|$|E

First, I monitored 320 YOY salmon to test alternative views on the patterns (restricted vs. not-restricted), causes (competition vs. habitat use) and consequences (mobile fish of lower vs. equal fitness) of movement in stream fish. Most fish (mean = 63. 8 %) stayed in the study sites (10 - 120 m) throughout their respective study season (28 - 74 days), and 61. 8 % of the re-sighted fish moved less than 1 m up- or downstream. Fish originally found in slow water moved farther than fish from fast water, and fish found at high population density were more likely to disappear than fish from low density. Mobile fish grew as fast, or faster, than more <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish,</b> suggesting that movement can be advantageous. Second, I mapped the daily territories of tagged YOY salmon to test if the typical single-central-place view of territoriality among YOY salmonids holds when fish are followed for longer periods, at low population densities. In contrast to earlier studies, YOY salmon visited several foraging stations (median = 12. 5; range = 3 - 26) within their territories, and showed limited fidelity to any particular station. When mapped around several stations, rather than assuming one station as is customary, territories of YOY salmon were larger than previous reported (mean = 0. 932 m 2), were less circular in shape, and were elongated along the stream length rather than the stream width. Although the study fish used large multiple-central-place territories, aggressive acts directed toward other YOY Atlantic salmon were usually found on the outskirts of these areas, suggesting these were fairly efficiently defended against conspecifics. A literature review suggested that YOY salmonids defend small territories from one central-place foraging station at high population density, but use several stations and large territories at low density. Third, as current velocity, prey abundance and prey mobility increase, stream-fish are predicted to become less mobile, use smaller home ranges, and become more aggressive as they switch from "cruising" to "sit-and-wait" foraging. I tested if these predictions held for YOY Atlantic salmon that specialize as sit-and-wait foragers, but vary in the number of foraging stations visited and the distance traveled within a territory (15. 7 - 95. 0 m/ 40 min). As predicted, territory size decreased with increasing current velocity and prey availability. YOY salmon, however, were most mobile and attacked intruders more often at intermediate, optimal, current velocities. These findings, and the fact that fish in slow water do not feed more on benthic prey than fish in fast water, suggest that mobility in YOY Atlantic salmon reflects the patrolling of territories, rather than just the direct exploitation of other food resources than drifting pre...|$|E
40|$|Eight hundred forty-six {{reports of}} tagged fish caught by anglers were {{analyzed}} todetermine the movement patterns of 14 species of native warm-water stream fishes. Eachspecies included a sedentary group which remained near the release point and a mobile groupwhich ranged {{more or less}} freely. The species could be classified according to the relativeabundance of the two groups. Rock bass, smallmouth bass, longear sunfish, spotted bass andyellow bullhead were classified as sedentary species; carp, flathead catfish, largemouth bass,golden redhorse, and black redhorse are semi-mobile; and channel catfish, freshwater drum andwhite crappie as mobile. The species varied greatly in {{the average number of}} days between tagging and recapture and inthe direction of movement and distances traveled by the mobile fish. The mobile group usuallywas free longer than the <b>sedentary</b> <b>fish</b> but frequently the difference in time was not great. Mobilefreshwater drum, golden redhorse, black redhorse, spotted bass, largemouth bass and longearsunfish tended to travel relatively long distances downstream and much shorter distancesupstream. The distances traveled by the remaining species were more nearly equal but theaverage distance traveled upstream was always the longer. Mobile yellow bullhead, greensunfish, spotted bass, longear sunfish and largemouth bass seldom traveled more than 25 milesbut some mobile carp moved over 200 miles. Other species traveled intermediate distances. When released in headwaters, sedentary species tended to be more sedentary, and semi-mobilespecies in their preferred habitat also tended to be more sedentary than the average. Mobilespecies and semi-mobile species not in their preferred habitat became more mobile. Most of themobile fish released in headwaters moved downstream. For the four most numerous species (rock bass, channel catfish, carp, smallmouth bass) data arepresented to show the effect of release location, season and age upon movement. Rock basswere more sedentary in headwaters than farther downstream but channel catfish were moremobile in headwaters. Mobile fish of both species tended to move downstream when released inheadwaters but to make more upstream movements when released in downstream areas. Carpseemed to adapt their movements to the physical conditions in the habitat. They were mostlysedentary in stable habitats but predominantly mobile in habitats subject to flooding. Thesubspecies of the fish, the type of stream and the geographical location of the release site mayhave affected the amount and direction of movement of smallmouth bass. All four speciesshowed a relatively high proportion of mobile fish in the spring and low proportions in thesummer. Data on fall movements were not conclusive. Rock bass, channel catfish andsmallmouth bass of intermediate age were more mobile than either the younger or the older fish. The concept that the native population of warm-water stream fish consists of a sedentary and amobile group provides a logical explanation of many observed phenomena and a contradictoryresults which have confused some investigators. It supplements recent findings concerning thehome ranges of species if it is assumed that only the sedentary group was investigated...|$|E
40|$|With over 20 · 000 {{species of}} teleost fish, {{considerable}} interspecific diversity in cardiac {{anatomy and physiology}} is expected. This is the outcome of evolutionary adaptation to different habits, modes of life and activity levels. For example, athletic species have a more powerful heart than <b>sedentary</b> species, and <b>fish</b> such as hagfish, carp and eel normally show a much higher degree of myocardial hypoxia tolerance than species such as salmonids (Farrell, 1991; Farrell and Jones, 1992). Plasticity in cardiac form and function has also been demonstrated during ontogeny, and the cardiovascular flexibility exhibited during embryonic and larval development, is nicely reviewed by Pelster (2003). What is less well appreciated, however, is {{the high degree of}} intraspecific cardiac plasticity displayed by post-larval fishes. Accordingly, this review explores what is known about intraspecific cardia...|$|R
40|$|Inter-Research 2014. Catchability, a key {{parameter}} {{in stock}} assessment, is often considered constant {{in time and}} space. However, when fishing with passive gears like traps or gillnets, fish behavior determines the odds of encounter with the fishers and thus catchability. Few studies have presented comprehensive empirical evidence {{of the link between}} behavior measured in the wild and catchability from a life-history strategy perspective. Here, a suite of different variables, including environmental cues, physiological states, fish activity, home range and catchability, were modeled using a sinusoidal function to describe their seasonality over the year and the degree of coupling among them in a <b>sedentary</b> coastal <b>fish</b> (Labrus bergylta). All the variables except the home range size showed a significant variation over the year, following a sinusoidal pattern. The models showed a tight match between the seasonality of catchability and fish activity, with high values of both variables occurring in late spring to early summer, when the highest levels of feeding and the period of reproductive inactivity occurred. Lower catchability values were predicted in late autumn to early winter, coinciding with the spawning season and the associated reduced activity. This integrative research shows that the spatio-temporal dimension of fish life-history strategy has a key role in shaping catchability even in highly sedentary species. Time-varying catchability needs to be incorporated into stock assessment models that aim to accurately describe fish population health and to estimate abundance indices. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{reserves}} are widely considered to potentially benefit reef fisheries through emigration, yet the empirical basis for predicting {{the extent of}} this for small reserves is weak. The effects of fishing pressure and habitat on biomass and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of three species of exploited reef fish were studied at South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands. Distribution and abundance of hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus) and white margate (Haemulon album) were inversely correlated with cover of fleshy macroalgae. Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) were positively associated with vertical relief, but were unaffected by algal cover. Mean size, density, and biomass of hogfish were higher in a small (4 km sup 2) marine reserve than on fished reefs, as was biomass of white margate. CPUE of hogfish was inversely related to distance from {{the centre of the}} reserve, suggesting that spillover of this species from the reserve to adjacent reefs may enhance local yields, possibly providing economic incentives for fishers to comply with reserve regulations. Fishing pressure, however, had no apparent effect on Nassau grouper. Larger fishes and those that migrate to spawn, such as economically valuable Nassau grouper, may move over too large a range to be effectively protected by small marine reserves. Small reserves may not protect all fish, but they can increase the biomass of smaller or more <b>sedentary</b> reef <b>fishes</b> and may be a useful tool for the conservation or management of species such as hogfish. Other policy options, such as seasonal spawning closures or total allowable catches, need to be considered for larger, more mobile fishes in the Turks and Caicos Islands...|$|R
