40|$|<b>Substances</b> <b>and</b> {{materials}} used in endodontic therapy come into close contact with the periradicular tissues via apical foramen and foramina. Consequently, they should possess biocompatibility. There are currently few studies describing the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of <b>substances</b> <b>and</b> {{materials used}} in endodontics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the direct genotoxic and mutagenic properties of several <b>substances</b> <b>and</b> {{materials used in}} different phases of the endodontic treatment. For this intent, two prokaryotic test systems were used: the SOS chromotest and the Ames test. No metabolization with S 9 was investigated, since only the direct effects of the <b>substances</b> <b>and</b> materials were surveyed. Most of the <b>substances</b> <b>and</b> materials tested presented mild to moderate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as revealed by the SOS chromotest. Formocresol was the only tested substance to present severe genotoxicity to the tester bacterial strains. However, no substance or material tested showed direct mutagenicity as revealed by the Ames test...|$|R

They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens. Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, but that does not work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, as he describes it, his brain is devoid of <b>substance</b> <b>and</b> contains only a few rodents.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine <b>substance,</b> <b>and</b> humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, <b>substance,</b> <b>and</b> situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E
