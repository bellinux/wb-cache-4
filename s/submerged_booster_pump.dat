40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action in valvular heart disease and to dissect <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> from reservoir-conduit functions. In five patients with aortic stenosis and six with mitral stenosis, sequential atrioventricular (A-V) pacing was instituted during the course of diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Continuous recording of valvular gradient allowed estimation of flow for each cardiac cycle by transposition of the Gorlin formula. Left ventricular ejection time and left ventricular stroke work in aortic stenosis or left ventricular mean systolic pressure in mitral stenosis were also determined. Control observations were recorded during sequential A-V pacing with well-timed atrial systole. Cardiac cycles were then produced with no atrial contraction but undisturbed atrial reservoir function by intermittently interrupting the atrial pacing stimulus during sequential A-V pacing. This intervention significantly reduced valvular gradient, flow, left ventricular ejection time, and left ventricular mean systolic pressure or stroke work. Cardiac cycles were then produced with atrial booster action eliminated by instituting synchronous A-V pacing. The resultant simultaneous contraction of the atrium and ventricle not only eliminated effective atrial systole but also placed atrial systole during the normal period of atrial reservoir function. This also significantly reduced all the hemodynamic measurements. However, comparison of the magnitude of change from these two different pacing interventions showed no greater impairment of hemodynamic state when both <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action and reservoir function were impaired than when <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action alone was impaired. The study confirms the potential benefit of well placed atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action in valvular heart disease in man...|$|R

40|$|A {{project was}} carried out in {{conjunction}} with an Australian dredging company and served the purpose of increasing their operational efficiency through advanced monitoring and control. A system consisting of wireless communications, PLCs, HMIs and SCADA was implemented to provide the dredge operator and management staff remote monitoring and control of the operation. The pre-existing dredging arrangement relied on frequent visits to the land-based engine-driven <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> to tune the engine speed for optimal pipeline flow. These visits were carried out by land-based staff, {{at the request of the}} offshore dredge operator who monitors the flow via a magnetic flowmeter. The dredge operator needed to control the <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> remotely to save time and resources. For improved project supervision, it was also envisaged that management should have access to daily shift reports and live monitoring from the office. Electrical systems were implemented at the dredge and <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> to accommodate wireless and wired industrial networks. The new arrangement allows the dredge operator to monitor and control operations via a HMI display mounted in the dredge cabin. From the cabin, the dredge operator can view data from both engines and process instrumentation such as pipeline flow. The <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> also contains a HMI display from which it can be independently monitored and controlled. A SCADA system was installed on the dredge to generate daily reports and provide management with live access to operations from the office. The new system was a complete success increasing production efficiency and improving operations management. Eliminating visits to the <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> and improved supervision of equipment significantly reduces dredging downtime. Access to daily reporting and live operations allows management to supervise operations without travelling to site resulting in cost and time savings. This project not only provides a solution to a gap in the dredging market, it provides a knowledge-base for future students or engineers to continue development of diesel engine monitoring and control using commercially available components...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6]. A total of 36 pumps was modified in the Texas Utilities system as described in this paper. This included 16 boiler feed pumps (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) <b>booster</b> <b>pumps,</b> 6 low pressure (LP) <b>booster</b> <b>pumps,</b> and 7 other pump applications. The operating behavior of all pumps improved exactly as expected, {{with the exception of}} one high pressure <b>booster</b> <b>pump,</b> which is described as a special case, with the emphasis on the importance or re-assembly and maintenance procedures. The power plants and the type of pumps involved in this investigation and corrective design changes are reflected in Table 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of measuring left atrial (LA) function with acoustic quantification (AQ) and then assess the effects of age and sex on LA reservoir, conduit, and <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> function.  PATIENTS AND SETTING— 165 subjects without cardiovascular disease, 3 - 79 years old, were enrolled by six tertiary hospital centres.  INTERVENTIONS—Continuous LA AQ area data were acquired and signal averaged to form composite waveforms which were analysed off-line.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Parameters of LA performance according to age and sex.  RESULTS—Signal averaged LA waveforms were sufficiently stable and detailed to allow automated analysis in all cases. An age related increase in LA area was noted. LA reservoir function did not vary with age or sex. All parameters of LA passive and active emptying revealed a significant age dependency. Overall, the passive emptying phase accounted for 66 % of total LA emptying ranging from 76 % in the youngest to 44 % in the oldest decade. LA contraction accounted for 34 % of atrial emptying in all subjects combined with the older subjects being more dependent on atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> function. When adjusted for atrial size, there were no sex related differences in LA function.  CONCLUSIONS—LA reservoir, conduit, and <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> function can be assessed with automated analysis of signal averaged LA area waveforms. As LA performance varies with age, establishment of normal values should enhance the evaluation of pathologic states in which LA function is important.    Keywords: aging; atrium; echocardiograph...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the significance of an effective atrial systole and the interactions between atrial and ventricular function. BACKGROUNDThe significance of atrial function is controversial, particularly in the setting of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. METHODSSerial, rapid pacing in five dogs that had undergone radiofrequency ablation and implantation of right atrial and ventricular pacemakers produced reversible atrial and ventricular dysfunction (alone and in combination). Atrial function (echocardiograph-determined transmitral diastolic flow, left atrial appendage emptying, and pulmonary venous flow), cardiac output, and right heart pressures were measured at matched paced heart rates of 80 beats/min. RESULTSIsolated rapid atrial pacing (LV ejection fraction ∼ 60 %) decreased atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> in the body and appendage of the left atrium, but increased the conduit function of the left atrium. Isolated LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction ∼ 34 %) increased atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> function. The decreased atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> function in animals with combined atrial and ventricular dysfunction was incompletely compensated by the redistribution of the reservoir and conduit functions of the left atrium. As a result, cardiac output decreased and right heart pressures increased only after superimposed pacing. CONCLUSIONSIn the presence of a normal left ventricle (LV), atrial failure has little effect on cardiac output and right heart pressures because of compensatory conduit function, but when early LV dysfunction coexists, changes in reservoir and conduit functions are insufficient to compensate for an impairment of atrial contraction...|$|R
40|$|This study applies testing {{apparatus}} and a computational approach {{to examine a}} newly designed spiral-grooved turbo <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> (TBP), which has both volume type and momentum transfer type vacuum pump functions, and is capable of operating at optimum discharge under pressures from approximately 1000 Pa to a high vacuum. Transitional flow pumping speed is increased by a well-designed connecting element. Pumping performance is predicted and examined via two computational approaches, namely the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In CFD analysis, comparisons of measured and calculated inlet pressure in the slip and continuum flow demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} calculation. Meanwhile, in transition flow, the continuum model of CFD is unsuitable for calculating such rarefied gas. The pumping characteristics for a full 3 D model on a rotating frame in transition and molecular regimes thus are simulated using the DSMC method and then confirmed experimentally. However, when the Knudsen number is in the range 0. 5 < Kn < 0. 1, neither CFD computation nor DSMC simulation is suitable for analyzing the pumping speed of the turbo <b>booster</b> <b>pump.</b> In this situation, the experimental approach is the most appropriate and effective method for analyzing pumping speed. Moreover, the developed pump is tested using assessment systems constructed according to ISO and JVIS- 005 standards, respectively. Comparisons are also made with other turbo pumps. The compared results show that the turbo <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> presented here has good foreline performance...|$|R
