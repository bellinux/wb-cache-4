50|$|The Yokohama {{is a small}} {{chicken with}} an unusually long tail, and long {{trailing}} <b>saddle</b> <b>feathers.</b> It has a pea- or walnut-comb. The beak, legs and feet are yellow.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedFeather {{is known}} for its robust {{regenerative}} ability. Stem cells in the feather have recently been mapped. However different parts of the chicken body have different size feathers. How stem cells are managed differently in these different feathers has not been elucidated. Here we analyze the growth pattern of feathers from neck and <b>saddle</b> <b>feather.</b> We analyze the topological arrangement of stem cell, TA cell, differentiated cell during different regenerative feather cycling. We found the stem cell is in a ring configuration during growth phase but shifted down to smaller ring or to assume a Ushape flanking the dermal papilla. The number of stem cells remains rather constant during stem cell cycling but also changes around three folds. On the contrast the number of TA cells change up to twenty thirty fold differences. There also appear to have higher stem cell number and a larger dermal papilla in the saddle compared to the neck feather. We found N-CAM and Tenascin-C expressed in the niche next to the stem cells. We also found TGF-beta 2 enriched in the stem cells in the resting phase of the dermal papilla. This work suggests there is a dramatic shifting of stem cell topology during feather cycling, probably to accommodate the different homeotic relationship between stem, TA and differentiated cells. The dynamic changes of molecules also refract the dynamic changes of the microenvironment in the stem cell niche. Further investigation would be required to understand their molecular mechanism and regulation...|$|R
50|$|They have {{a single}} comb and a red face with black eyes while the legs are slate or black. Plumage is attractively marked and the male has a {{beautiful}} silver hackle striped with black as is the neck, back, <b>saddle</b> and wing <b>feathers,</b> {{while the rest of}} the plumage is black. The hen's hackle is similar to the cockerels but she has an otherwise rich black feathering all over apart from the throat which is silver laced.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012 a {{visit to}} Pioneertown by the San Diego Reader was called a [...] "bizarre experience":"Strolling down Mane Street is a bizarre experience. An {{abandoned}} bowling alley stands opposite a reconstructed jail, bathhouse and bank. Carts of “dynamite” sit like props in the dusty street, presumably from the weekly Old West re-enactments. Unsettlingly realistic dummies slouch in rocking chairs on porches, and fake crows are tied to rails and posts. We pass a grave with a wooden sign proclaiming “Welcome.” It {{is hard to tell}} what is real and what has been purposefully set up to unnerve.On the day we visited, the four-block town was empty aside from locals selling handcrafted <b>saddles</b> and <b>feathered</b> dreamcatchers, and a couple of tourists who seemed as confused by the place as we were. The houses on Mane Street look more like live-in works of art than homes; some residents had installed a display of broken chinaware, 50s-era toys and colored glass in the front yard." ...|$|R
50|$|The American Standard of Perfection recognizes three Brahma varieties: light, dark, and buff. The light Brahma has a base {{color of}} white, with black hackles edged {{in white and}} a black tail. The cock's <b>saddle</b> <b>feathers</b> in a light Brahma are striped with black. The dark Brahma has the most notable {{difference}} between cock and hen. The hen has a dark gray and black penciled coloration with the same hackle as the light whereas the cock has black and white hackles and <b>saddle</b> <b>feathers,</b> and a black base and tail. The wings of a dark Brahma are white-shouldered and the primary feathers (remiges) are edged with white. Buff Brahmas have {{the same pattern of}} black as light Brahmas, except with a golden buff base color instead of white.|$|E
5000|$|The Ayam Kampong {{is a small}} dual-purpose chicken. They are slow-growing breed {{that contributed}} to its low productivity. Both its {{physical}} characteristics and its colouring are highly variable. Three principal colour types are recognised. The commonest is the black-red variety, in which cocks are mainly green-black with glossy red-brown back, neck hackles and <b>saddle</b> <b>feathers.</b> Other varieties are the red type and the naked-neck type.|$|E
5000|$|The Sebastopol is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} goose, {{descended from the}} European graylag. First exhibited in England in 1860 under the name 'Sebastopol goose'; they were {{also referred to as}} Danubian geese; a name first used for the breed in Ireland in 1863. 'Danubian' was used as a synonym in the 19th century; and only given precedence by Edward Brown {{after the turn of the}} 19th century. The Sebastopol is a medium-sized goose with long, white curly feathers. The feathers of the neck are smooth and sometimes greyish brown. Crosses have produced all-gray, buff, and <b>saddle</b> back variants. <b>Feathers</b> on the breast may be curly (frizzle) or smooth. The gander weighs 12-14 lbs while the goose weighs 10-12 lbs. The legs and shanks are orange and the eyes bright blue. On average, females produce 25-35 eggs per year.Though domesticated breeds of geese generally retain some flight ability, Sebastopols cannot fly well due to the curliness of their feathers and have difficulty getting off the ground. [...] They need plenty of water to keep themselves clean, and to clean their sinuses (as do all waterfowl).|$|R
