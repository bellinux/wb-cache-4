5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime {{probably}} has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside {{the tail of a}} comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, a {{group of}} spies have {{abducted}} Matsuda and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device the disguised Pairan warned him about. Matsuda does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building. As the Earth's atmosphere heats up due to the approaching world, Ginko again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed. They locate Matsuda through Pairan technology and gather the formula for the device. The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> space station and destroys Planet R, cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat. Ginko then changes back to her original form aboard the space station.|$|E

5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City started sprightly, {{managing}} {{to create some}} chances which forced saves from Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen and steady defending to keep Stoke City in {{the game in the}} first half. Yaya Touré unleashed a 30-yard strike in the 11th minute which went only inches wide of the top corner of the goal, while Mario Balotelli had a curling <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner of the penalty area in the 24th minute which was destined for the goal but for a strong, one-handed save from Sørensen.|$|E
5|$|Swanigan {{chose to}} major in general education/educational studies. Swanigan chose the number 50 to honor his father who had died, as that was his age when he died. Swanigan started every game his {{freshman}} year. His highest scoring game was in a win against Wisconsin in Purdue's last regular season game, where he scored 27 points and missed only one <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field. He scored 6 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in #4 Purdue's loss to #13 Arkansas-Little Rock, and did not play at all during the overtime period.|$|E

50|$|As Italian {{troops of}} the Forli Division {{advanced}} into France on 24 June 1940, they were bombarded by Saint Ours Haut's 75mm guns and 81mm mortars, supported by fire from Roche Lacroix, stopping the advance. Saint Ours Haut fired 92 <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guns and 379 <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mortars. The armistice of 25 June brought fighting to an end.|$|R

5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E

5|$|Embuscade was {{the next}} to surrender, having been {{battered}} in the opening exchanges by Magnanime, and further damaged by long-range fire from Foudroyant during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, Captain de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. Magnanime, suffering the effects of her engagement with Hoche, took possession of Embuscade and continued to follow slowly behind {{the rest of the}} fleet, while Robust, which had suffered severely in her duel with Hoche, remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took them across the path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the Foudroyant. Most of the frigates were able outrun this ponderous enemy, but Bellone was less fortunate and a speculative <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by Melampus and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling Coquille surrendered after being outrun by the approaching Canada; Warren ordered the slowly following Magnanime to take possession.|$|E
5|$|Ingham {{made several}} {{important}} saves as York drew 0–0 away to Ebbsfleet. The {{first leg of}} the FA Trophy semi-final tie against A.F.C. Telford United ended in a 2–0 away win, with goals in each half from Rusk and Purkiss. A late goal from Sodje with a <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of the penalty area earned the team a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green Rovers, after Kaid Mohamed had given the home team a first-half lead. A 2–1 home win over A.F.C. Telford in the second leg of the FA Trophy semi-final, with goals in each half from Brodie and McBreen, saw York progress into 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium with 4–1 aggregate victory. This {{was followed by a}} 0–0 home draw with Kettering in the league. Wilkinson joined divisional rivals Altrincham on loan {{until the end of the}} season, having failed to feature in the team since January 2009. York drew 0–0 with play-off contenders Kidderminster at home, which was followed by a 2–0 home defeat to Stevenage.|$|E
5|$|Neither side made a {{substitution}} at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left of the area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham {{made a series of}} attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught César Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona got back into the lead when Lionel Messi <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of the area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|The New Year {{began with}} a second defeat of the season to Burton, this time being beaten 3–1 at home, in which Brodie scored {{in the first half}} with a <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of the penalty area. Wrexham defender Kyle Critchell was signed on a one-month loan, who Foyle knew while he was a coach at the club. Adam Smith {{returned}} to Gainsborough following the conclusion of his loan, while a permanent move had been stalled as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee. Progression to the third round of the FA Trophy was ensured with a 2–1 away victory over Oxford, with goals from McBreen and Brodie. Further signings from Wrexham took place when striker Simon Brown and midfielder Christian Smith signed on loan and permanently respectively. Hirst was released having failed to break into the first team. Lewes were beaten 3–0 at home; Brodie opened the scoring with a volley into the top corner from outside the penalty area, and Christian Smith scored from 30yards before Brodie finished the scoring with a low shot into the bottom corner. Henderson was released having fallen out of the reckoning for a first-team place.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} the barricades {{at the front of}} the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E

5|$|The {{perspective}} now hovers {{high above}} Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds {{a baby to}} whom she whispers Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> perspective of a baby being born to Oscar's mother. (According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's own birth {{in the form of}} a false memory).|$|E
5|$|Wilcox's first {{match in}} charge was a 1–0 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town, who scored their {{goal in the}} 87th minute through James Collins, and this result saw York move into the relegation zone in 23rd place. Coulson gave York a 77th-minute lead away to Morecambe with a low <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of the penalty area, before the home team {{equalised}} in stoppage time. Former Australia under-20 goalkeeper Alex Cisak was signed on a one-month loan from Premier League club Burnley. He debuted in York's 1–1 home draw with Mansfield Town, in which York {{took the lead in}} the 20th minute when De Girolamo turned and scored from close range having been set up by a Penn cross, before the away team equalised during the second half through Daniel Carr. Former Jamaica international striker Deon Burton, who played under Wilcox at Scunthorpe, was signed on a one-month loan.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} 1–0, Arsenal pushed forward but Liverpool still held the advantage. In the 74th minute an unmarked Thomas latched onto a pass from Richardson near the penalty spot, but shot weakly {{and it was}} smothered by Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal manager George Graham brought on Martin Hayes and Perry Groves, and {{switched}} to a more attack-oriented 4–4–2 formation. This gave Liverpool space to counter-attack through John Barnes and Aldridge. Aldridge and Ray Houghton both had late chances to equalise but did not capitalise on them; Houghton sliced a <b>shot</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of the box wide, while Aldridge was caught offside meeting a Barnes throughball and scored a disallowed goal after the whistle had gone. As full-time approached the game was heading for a 1–0 scoreline, and thus Liverpool would win the title.|$|E
