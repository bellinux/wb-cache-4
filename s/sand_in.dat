5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in the <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three major Canadian oil <b>sands</b> <b>in</b> Alberta, there is a fourth major oil <b>sands</b> deposit <b>in</b> Canada, the Melville Island oil <b>sands</b> <b>in</b> the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future.|$|R

50|$|An upgrader is a {{facility}} that upgrades bitumen (extra heavy oil) into synthetic crude oil. Upgrader plants are typically located close to oil sands production, for example, the Athabasca oil <b>sands</b> <b>in</b> Alberta, Canada or the Orinoco tar <b>sands</b> <b>in</b> Venezuela.|$|R
5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> the narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to jarrah forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to Boys in the <b>Sand.</b> <b>In</b> 1984, they finally shot Boys in the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E

Frank Black and the Catholics {{released}} Pistolero in 1999 and Dog in the <b>Sand</b> <b>in</b> 2001. Dog in the Sand added Dave Philips on pedal steel guitar and lead guitar, and Santiago and Feldman began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record. Both Pistolero and Dog in the Sand were produced by Nick Vincent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes. He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state. Tanaka breaks into convulsions and displays a high fever, but refuses any help from Mulder or Scully. When he is put on a stretcher for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a throbbing bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> his lungs, indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad weather {{had such a}} {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited <b>Sand</b> <b>in</b> the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona {{was used as the}} model for the CG <b>sand.</b> <b>In</b> a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E

5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum {{occurs in}} all Australian {{mainland}} states and territories, {{as well as}} Tasmania. Widespread, it is found from North Queensland across to Western Australia, and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas. It grows as an annual in patches of red <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> Central Australia, responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle. It is common among granite outcrops in southwest Western Australia, and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the Sydney region, such as basalt-, shale-, or limestone-based soils, generally in areas with a high water table. Associated species in the Sydney Basin include blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in open forest, and the shrubs Empodisma minus and Baloskion australe in swampy areas. It has been reported growing in disturbed soil, along roadsides and in fields in the New England region in the United States.|$|E
