The prediction {{of the performance of}} different biomass energy sources in gasifiers is needed for the implementation of this technology to fulfil the need of decentralized heat and power applications, relevant to remote villages. This study presents the theoretical and experimental studies conducted on a 50 kW downdraft biomass gasifier with various biomass materials such as wood, coconut <b>shell,</b> <b>rubber</b> seed kernel and coir pith which are generally available in villages. Two-zone kinetic equilibrium model approach is used to predict the composition and temperature of the producer gas. The influence of equivalence ratio on the reaction temperature, quality of producer gas and gasifier conversion efficiency are discussed.

Several polymer nanocomposite systems with modified montmorillonite (MMT) or ?-zirconium phosphate (ZrP) nanofillers were prepared with epoxy matrices of different ductility and properties. The successful nanofiller's exfoliations were confirmed with X-ray diffraction and transmision electronic microscopy (TEM). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) on the prepared epoxy nanocomposites revealed the significant increase in rubbery plateau moduli of the epoxy nanocomposite systems above Tg, as high as 4. 5 times, and tensile test results showed improved modulus by the nanofiller addition, while the fracture toughenss was not affected or slightly decreased by nanofillers. The brittle epoxy nanocomposite systems were toughened with core <b>shell</b> <b>rubber</b> (CSR) particles and showed remarkable increase in fracture toughness (KIC) value up to 270 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of soft elastic {{biomaterials}} {{in medical}} devices enables substantial function integration. The consequent increased simplification in design can improve reliability {{at a lower}} cost in comparison to traditional (hard) biomaterials. Functional bi-stable buckling {{is one of the many}} new mechanisms made possible by soft materials. The buckling behavior of shells, however, is typically described from a structural failure point of view: the collapse of arches or rupture of steam vessels, for example. There is little or no literature about the functional elastic buckling of small-sized silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>shells,</b> and it is unknown whether or not theory can predict their behavior. Is functional buckling possible within the scale, material and pressure normally associated with physiological applications? An automatic speech valve is used as an example application. METHOD OF APPROACH: Silicone <b>rubber</b> spherical <b>shells</b> (diameter 30 mm) with hinged and double-hinged boundaries were subjected to air pressure loading. Twelve different geometrical configurations were tested for buckling and reverse buckling pressures. Data were compared with the theory. RESULTS: Buckling pressure increases linearly with shell thickness and shell height. Reverse buckling shows these same relations, with pressures always below normal buckling pressure. Secondary hinges change normal/reverse buckling pressure ratios and promote symmetrical buckling. All tested configurations buckled within or closely around physiological pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Functional bi-stable buckling of silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>shells</b> is possible with adjustable properties in the physiological pressure range.

40|$|Acoustic {{metamaterials}} {{provide the}} remarkable ability to control, direct, and manipulate sound waves. Within this infant field, a promising approach to fabricate locally resonant acoustic metamaterials {{is the use}} of resonators composed of a heavy core surrounded by a <b>rubber</b> <b>shell</b> dispersed in an epoxy matrix. At their resonant frequency, the cores vibrate 180 ° out-of-phase with the matrix, and a band gap in transmission is observed making these materials excellent sound absorbers. A significant challenge in the study and adoption of these materials is the lack of techniques to easily fabricate resonators {{with a wide range of}} sizes and properties. Here, we present a robust yet simple technique to fabricate resonators with diameters ranging from 50 µm to 5 mm from core-shell drops generated in microfluidic and millifluidic devices. We started by fabricating resonators with core diameters ranging from 50 µm to 1 mm from double emulsion drops composed of a concentrated ceramic suspension in the core (inner drop) surrounded by a UV-crosslinkable <b>rubber</b> <b>shell</b> (outer drop) using microcapillary microfluidic devices. The double emulsion drops were collected and exposed to UV to crosslink the shell material forming resonators with resonant frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 25 kHz based on the core mass. Even lower resonant frequencies were obtained by fabricating resonators with core diameters ranging from 1. 2 mm to 1. 7 mm from core-shell drops extruded in air from a coaxial nozzle at rates up to 6 drops/minute. The effects of core density were studied by utilizing suspensions composed of ceramic particles of increasing density including silica, alumina, and lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The transmission properties of the acoustic metamaterials made with resonators with different core diameters, core materials, and level of ordering within the matrix, were measured using a piezoelectric transducer setup capable of testing from 1 kHz to 50 kHz. For example, acoustic metamaterials composed of randomly dispersed 1. 4 mm alumina-core resonators at about 25 vol% concentration in epoxy showed a well-defined band-gap around 11 kHz. A finite element model was also developed by collaborators to capture the acoustic transmission physics of these materials. Overall this technique offers a robust path for the fabrication of acoustic resonators and locally resonant acoustic metamaterials. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{combined}} approach including experimental investigation and constitutive modelling was followed {{in this work}} to study the stress–strain behaviour of rubber-toughened glassy polymers. The large inelastic deformation response of rubber-toughened poly(methyl methacrylate) (RT-PMMA) was experimentally studied under uniaxial compression tests at different strain rates and temperatures. The studied composite system consists of spherical core–shell (PMMA hard <b>shell</b> and soft <b>rubber</b> core) particles embedded in a PMMA matrix. The influence of particle concentration (ranging from 0 % to 45 %) on the macroscopic behaviour was also investigated from small to large strain. The physically based hyperelastic–viscoplastic constitutive model of Boyce–Socrate–Llana was extended to describe the stress–strain behaviour of rubber-toughened glassy polymers. The model accounts for the effective contribution of the two polymeric phases to the overall composite macroscopic behaviour, by including in the original model the hyperelastic deformation of rubber particles. The capabilities of the model to describe the rate-dependent yield and post-yield behaviour of PMMA {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and strain rates are pointed out. The model is able to successfully capture the significant features of the stress–strain behaviour including the initial linear elasticity, the gradual rollover to yield, the strain softening after yield (when it exists) followed by the strain hardening.

However, it is best when such replacements are done at optimum replacement levels. In view of this, a laboratory investigative test was carried out to evaluate the shear strength of concrete with coarse aggregate replacement by Coconut Shell and by Waste Rubber Tyre. The coarse aggregate replacement was done at recommended optimum proportions for compressive strength of 25 % and 10 % by volume for Coconut <b>shell</b> and Waste <b>Rubber</b> tyre respectively. Test results revealed that at the levels of replacement, the concrete can still be classified as dense concrete with densities above 2200 kg/m 3. Furthermore, the compressive strengths of concrete with replacement were about 92 % and 83 % of corresponding normal aggregate concrete. However, the concrete shear strengths for concrete mixes with aggregate replacement {{were not significantly different}} from those of normal concrete of comparable compressive strength. Therefore, a regression equation was developed to estimate the shear strength of concrete with coarse aggregate replacement not beyond these levels of replacement.

Hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl-groups and the carbonyl-groups of polybutylacrylate enhanced the miscibility and lead to randomly distributed polyolefin particles surrounded by a homogeneous PBA/PS matrix. Morphol. parameters such as the size of the dispersed phase or extent of interpenetration between the components are controllable simply by changing the amt. of interacting groups in the blend.

40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructural properties on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour {{has been studied}} by finite element predictions of the response of different microstructures of polystyrene (PS) or polycarbonate (PC) containing voids or rubbery particles, subjected to unidirectional extension. The voids represent a low-modulus non-adhering dispersed phase. The rubbery inclusions, which {{are assumed to be}} pre-cavitated and perfectly adhering, idealise core-shell particles with a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>shell</b> and a soft non-adhering or pre-cavitated core. The predictions show that the inclusion properties strongly affect the averaged post-yield response of the heterogeneous systems. Especially the post-yield strain softening can be eliminated by the introduction of voids in PC or rubbery particles in PS. Since macroscopic strain softening {{is believed to be the}} main cause of catastrophical stress or strain localisations, the softening elimination is believed to be primarily responsible for toughness enhancement of the polystyrene or polycarbonate systems. The results and experiences are extrapolated in order to explain the {{influence of}} the absolute length scale of a sub-micron sized morphology on the macroscopic behaviour, especially toughness. Two potential sources of particle-size effects are presented that may result in a stabilised, and thus tougher, macroscopic mechanical response, i. e. the yield stress reduction near a surface or interface because of a locally enhanced mobility of the polymer segments, and the temporary excessive hardening because of a sufficiently small size of the yield zones which results in a reduced effective entanglement distance. The paper concludes with a discussion on the extension of this knowledge to all other, for the moment amorphous, polymers. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publisher...|$|R
40|$|The {{rubber seeds}} oil are readily available, cheap {{and help to}} improve the {{socioeconomic}} issues it is also easy to abtain because Malaysia is a biggest country that produce natural rubber. The rubber seed oil is extracted using the Soxhlet Extraction method. The cleaned, <b>shelled</b> and milled <b>rubber</b> seeds are placed into a thimble in the main chamber of the extractor. The solvent in the receiving flask is left to boil until it vaporizes and condensed, filling up the main chamber, extracting the RSO from the rubber seeds. The catalytic cracking {{of the mixture of}} 25 mL of RSO, using variable mass of zeolite catalyst that is 1 grams, 2. 5 grams, 5 grams and 10 grams of catalyst first been weighed after and before the cracking. At 300 0 C the furnace has been set up to 15 minutes using zeolite catalyst is to boost up the rate of reaction so that more successful reactions between the reactant particles can occur. The presence of Isooctane in a sample detected using Gas Chromatogram indicating that bio-petrol can be produced. Standards of different ratio mixtures of hexane and Isooctane were used to obtain chromatograms for Isooctane until a calibration curve is plotted from which the Isooctane produced can be determined. The results show that the actual concentration of Isooctane is very big. This could be explained using the cause of interlayer spacing of catalyst structure, larger surface area for reactions to occur, various types of fatty acid mixture present in rubber seed oil, the incorrect chromatogram modifications and the contamination in rubber seed oil. The mass of catalyst, volume or dilution factor of rubber seed oil, temperature of the cracking process used will affect the percentage of concentration of Isooctane in samples. As a conclusion, Bio-petrol can be produced from rubber seed oil using zeolite catalyst in the catalytic cracking process. And if the mass of catalyst increase it will increase the concentration of isooctane produced...|$|R
40|$|Mining mill linings are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} wear {{induced by the}} charge, and thus, mill operation has to be interrupted {{on a regular basis}} for inspections. Stoppages due to inspections and replacement of linings lead to large production and monetary losses; especially in case of unplanned corrective maintenance. Condition monitoring during mill operation can assist in the maintenance planning and decision process to increase the availability and the overall performance of the material processing. In this pilot study, the feasibility of using waterflow ultrasonics for condition monitoring of the lining of mining mills during operation is to be investigated. The proposed waterflow ultrasonic technique uses a water beam to transmit the ultrasound to the mill shell and lining. By measuring the time of flight (TOF), it can be possible to monitor the thickness of mill linings, without the need of interrupting operation. The method can lead to significant energy and monetary savings by reducing inspections and corrective maintenance stoppages, and possibly increase product quality by optimised performance. Since steel has a very high acoustic impedance in comparison to rubber, TOF measurements on aluminium-rubber has been used as an intermediate step towards the goal of measuring steel-rubber combinations. TOF measurements of aluminium-rubber layers have been achieved, and advancement towards the understanding of TOF measurements in steel-rubber laysers have been achieved. The following conclusions have been reached:- Rubber thickness can be measured through aluminium. In practice, aluminium plugs/rivets can be mounted on the steel shell of a mill to measure TOF of <b>rubber</b> <b>shell</b> plates and lifter bars. - Ultrasound signals can be measured through steel-rubber layers in through-transmission and pitch-catch set-ups. - Ultrasound signals measured in pulse-echo or pitch-catch set-up on a solid steel plate connected to rubber, give rise to reverberations (ringing signal) that mask the rubber backwall echoes. For avoiding reverberations of steel plate sides, an experimental set-up requires the steel plate to be at least eight times wider and deeper (x- and y-axis) than the thickness (z-axis) of the rubber under inspection.

40|$|Petrol is {{the most}} {{demanding}} fuel nowadays. Petrol is used especially as a fuel for cars, aircraft and other vehicles. The declining petroleum source that we face today causes the increasing of the petroleum prices all over the world. This problem can be solved by using an alternative source to replace the usual commercial petrol we are using now. This {{can be done by}} producing biopetrol or biofuel. Currently, most of the bio-petrol is produced from oils such as the utilization of palm oil for the production of more environmental friendly bio-fuels. The objective {{of this study is to}} synthesize biopetrol from fatty acid in rubber seed oil via catalytic cracking using zeolite as catalyst. Extracting rubber seed oil from the rubber seeds,is a favorable method as rubber seed oil contains more fatty acid to be produced into bio-petrol. The rubber seeds are readily available in our country for ages, cheap and help to improve the socioeconomic issues. The rubber seed oil is extracted using the Soxhlet Extraction method. The cleaned <b>shelled</b> and milled <b>rubber</b> seeds are placed into a thimble in the main chamber of the extractor. The solvent,hexane in the receiving flask is left to boil until it vaporizes and condenses filling up the main chamber,extracting the rubber seed oil from the rubber seeds. The catalytic cracking of the mixture of 0. 1 L of rubber seed oil, 20 g of catalyst which is in this case zeolite and anti-bumping granule(to assist well distributed boiling) at 300 0 C for 45 minutes is to boost up the rate of reaction so that more successful reactions between the reactant particles can occur. The presence of Isooctane in a sample detected using Gas Chromatogram indicating that bio-petrol can be produced. Standards of different ratio mixtures of hexane and Isooctane were used to obtain chromatograms for Isooctane until a calibration curve is plotted from which the Isooctane produced can be determined. The results show that the actual concentration of Isooctane is very high. This could be explained using the cause of interlayer spacing of catalyst structure, larger surface area for reactions to occur,various types of fatty acid mixture present in rubber seed oil,the incorrect chromatogram modifications and also the contamination in rubber seed oil. The volume of solvent used will affect the percentage of concentration of Isooctane in samples obtained. As a conclusion,bio-petrol can be produced from rubber seed oil using zeolite catalyst in the catalytic cracking process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the stability of cantilevered coaxial cylindrical shells conveying incompressible, viscous fluid inside the inner shell and/or in the annulus between the two shells. Two analytical models are developed with experimental verification. In the first model, fluid viscous effects are partially taken into consideration. Both shells are generally considered flexible. Shell motions are described by Flugge's shell equations, modified {{to take into account}} the steady viscous loads [...] flow pressurization and skin friction [...] acting on the shells. These equations are solved by means of the extended Galerkin method, in which the shell equations and the free-end boundary conditions can be satisfied simultaneously. The unsteady viscous forces are approximated by their inviscid counterparts, the formulation of which is based on linearized potential-flow theory with the assumption that the fluid is inviscid. The solution for these forces is obtained with the Fourier-transform technique; in connection with this technique, different so-called out-flow models are examined, concerning the effect of the downstream flow perturbations on the dynamics of the system. The second analytical model, on the other hand, fully accounts for the viscous effects of the flow. Here, only the inner shell is flexible, while the outer shell is replaced by an identical rigid cylinder. Shell motions are also described by Flugge's modified shell equations, which incorporate the steady viscous loads exerted on the shell. These equations are solved numerically with the finite-difference method. The unsteady viscous forces are evaluated from flow perturbations which are the solution of the linearized, unsteady Navier-Stokes equations subject to the divergence-free constraint on the flow velocity perturbation. A recently developed, time-marching finite-difference method using "artificial compressibility" is applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equations; for the problem under consideration, this method employs the pressure and velocity perturbations as the dependent flow variables on a staggered grid. In the experimental part of the thesis, tests involving either annular or inner flow are conducted on cantilevered silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>shells</b> concentrically located within rigid plexiglas cylinders. Measurements are made of (i) the critical flow velocity of the system for various lengths of the shell and annular widths, and (ii) the dominant frequencies of oscillation of the shell for certain selected cases. Both divergence- and flutter-type instabilities are observed. Comparisons between analytical results and test measurements show that the agreement between experiment and the two proposed analytical models is generally good, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of the overall (lowest) critical flow velocities and frequencies of oscillation (first model only) of the tested shells. Finally, future work is suggested with regard to improving the second model and conducting further calculations...|$|R
