30|$|The {{comparisons}} between risk groups emphasize {{the improvement in}} risk <b>stratification</b> <b>after</b> 24  h but also suggest that the proposed classification by SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP in four risk groups is dependent on other factors. The fact that differences between group III and the other groups did not reach significance could be explained {{in part by the}} small number of patients in this group after 24  h. Also interestingly, differences in outcomes between groups separated by PEEP were not significant (group I vs. II and group III vs. IV). This does not weaken the improvement in risk <b>stratification</b> <b>after</b> 24  h, but probably suggests that our findings are driven more by SpO 2 /FiO 2 than by PEEP. Hence, although PEEP is an attractive stratification tool due to its ubiquity, alternative variables might result in a better classification when combined to the SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio.|$|R

Striking about most of the latter works was that, although heart rate regulation was the focus of nonlinear dynamics (NLD) and was seen as a particularly lucid ex-ample of chaos in physiology (see for example Gleick (8)), there were very few scientific papers on which such claims could be based.

30|$|After {{the reform}} and opening, Chinese society {{provided}} a natural laboratory for discussing the dynamic changes of social stratification. The reform and opening up is a watershed that separated “political stratification” from “economic stratification” in Chinese society (Li 1997). After experiencing radical and chaotic revolutions, upper-class culture and lifestyles have almost disappeared (Qiang Li 2011). This {{provides an excellent}} {{opportunity for us to}} observe the emergence and development of cultural <b>stratification</b> <b>after</b> the reform. Bourdieu’s (1984) emphasis on economic capital, cultural capital, and stratification of habitus provides a good framework for this analysis.|$|R
