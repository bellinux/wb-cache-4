The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) No distinct variation in chemical composition of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> could be found between the various varieties, nor between beet tops harvested at different times. Crude protein content of blades was over 20 per cent. (2) Oxalic acid contents in various parts of sugar beets were determined. (cf. Table 4). Beet tops contained 0. 25 - 0. 51 per cent. oxalic acid. In beet tops of such varieties as KL-E. Verna and Polish content of oxalic acid was comparatively high, but in those of KL-AA and Cesena rather low. (cf. Table 5). (3) Carotene content was 2. 9 mg. / 100 g. in beet tops in the bolting Period and 2. 7 mg. / 100 g. in beet top silage. (4) The results of digestion experiments on rabbits using beet tops (with dry matter content 12. 2 percent.) showed that the digestibility of organic matter was 91. 7 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 1. 64 per cent. and the total digestible nutrient 9. 5 per cent.

Therefore the harvest of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> (including leaves) can be considered as current task for the sugar beet growing system. Modern technologies involve harvest of the tops of sugar beet in two stages: flat basic cut and collecting of the entire green mass at higher altitude and the subsequent cutting of the heads of root crops from the residues. Therefore, topical issues of the sensing of the heads of sugar beet roots arranged in rows, are related to the majority of the sugar beet toppers, cleaners of the sugar beet heads, leaves cutters and, digging up working bodies of some designs. The aim of this study is theoretical determination the optimum design and kinematic parameters of a new sensing mechanism of the sugar beet heads located in the soil {{on the basis of the}} theory of interaction of flat passive swath board sensing organ with the sugar beet heads during their topping when located in the soil. In the study there are used methods of creation of mathematical models of functioning of the agricultural machines and their working bodies with the using of main provisions of mathematics, theoretical mechanics, programming and numerical calculations on the PC. In this paper, there is presented a theoretical study of the interaction of passive sensing organ with the head of the sugar beet root when there are located residues of the leaves on a root head spherical surface in the form of short elastic rods. Thus, for such an interaction of the sensing organ and the head of sugar beet root head there is taken into account elastic-damping properties of the sugar beet leaves residues. In the study there was first of all developed a new design of the topper for sugar beet heads with the use of a flat swath board sensing organ, there was developed the equivalent scheme of the interaction of the sensing organ with a fixed sugar beet root head.

The factors favoring <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the district include: adequate land area suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and the high <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield that can be attained per unit suitable land area, farmers' awareness of the positive aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation, and the willingness of many farmers to grow the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop. Notwithstanding these favorable conditions, some socio-economic factors-mainly the affordability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production and possible lack of appropriate farming technologies, will present challenges to widespread <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption, particularly to those farmers in the low-and medium-income categories. The <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> profit analysis showed that depending on the market price, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> can potentially increase household net income. However, since the majority of households are in the low-and medium-income categories, for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> to pull the smallholder farmers out of poverty, interventions from government and other stakeholders is of vital necessity.

The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farms and a reduction in those areas of tillage surfaces intended for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. It is worth mentioning that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were used for biogas production.

5000|$|In 2013, Russia, France, the United States, Germany, and Turkey {{were the}} world's five largest <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> producers. In 2010-2011, North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe {{did not produce}} enough <b>sugar</b> from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> to meet overall demand for sugar and were all net {{importers}} of sugar. The US harvested 1,004,600 acre of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in 2008. [...] In 2009, <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> accounted for 20% of the world's sugar production.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{profitability of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and competitive crops were studied in Box Elder and Cache counties, Utah. Profitability ratios based on enterprise budget data and resource use requirements {{were used as}} a basis for comparison. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets</b> was found to be more profitable than competing crops in returns per acre, in returns to water used and in returns to fixed investment and management. However, <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> was found to be less profitable than certain other crops in returns to operating capital and returns to labor. Also, on land rated low in productivity <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> was found to be less profitable than most competing crops. Linear programming techniques were used in studying the production response of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> at various price levels. An aggregated supply curve was developed showing the acreage response in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production at varying <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices for the two county area. The price range over which <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> acreage was responsive ranged from $ 11. 70 per ton to a high of $ 16. 70 per ton where the maximum acreage permitted in the model was attained...|$|R
40|$|The translog cost {{function}} {{is applied to}} analyze input demand in Turkey <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production from 1975 to 2003. <b>Sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production became an important issue after the sugar act changed in 2001. Although the political aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production have been studied extensively, few studies {{are available on the}} quantitative aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Turkey. The main goal {{of the study was to}} estimate input substitution and the elasticity of demand for the factors of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. The computed factor demand elasticities show that the demand for the four factor inputs (labor, land, energy and fertilizer) considered in the analysis is inelastic with respect to changes in factor prices. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production has a feature of traditional labor-intensive farming in Turkey. Current <b>sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> policy may induce the farmers to adopt more efficient production and management techniques, enabling them to remain viable in a liberalized market setting...|$|R
40|$|Abolishment of EU sugar quotas {{will lead}} to lower <b>sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices in the EU, leading to lower margins for farms. At the same time, {{expansion}} of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> growing and processing in a quota-free situation can decrease fixed cost per ha of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and per kg of sugar, making both <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> growing and processing more efficient. Besides, lower sugar price levels will make Europe a more attractive continent for investments by sugar-based industries...|$|R

Counties producing <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> include Grant, Adams, Franklin, Lincoln, Walla Walla, and Benton. The Washington State <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop has a farmgate value of $ 22 million. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processing provides seasonal employment for 300 to 400 people in Washington State during the processing year or campaign.

50|$|Studies {{conducted}} on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crops {{found that some}} root-colonizing bacteria were deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB). <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> seeds inoculated with DRB had reduced germination rates, root lesions, reduced root elongation, root distortions, increased fungi infection, and decreased plant growth. In one trial the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield was reduced by 48%.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{economic}} evaluation of sugar production chain. The {{first part of the}} work includes general charasteristic of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> with detailed description of its attributes and importance, its quality, realization of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> together with an economy of suger beet growing. Another part of the work is orientated on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> manufacturers. It contains sugar industry development in the Czech Republic and technology of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> process for <b>sugar</b> and bioethanol production. Also results of 2014 a  2015 campaign and future vision situation after 2017 is included. The third part of the thesis deals with sugar consumers and a foreign trade of sugar. The own part of the work focuses on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cost and rentability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> growing and <b>sugar</b> or bioethanol production. Also an impact of selected variables on sugar consumption is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The Rural Economic Department, University of Nebraska, after a {{study of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{production}} records, concluded that the area immediately {{in the vicinity of}} Gering, Nebraska, produced <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> consistently low in sugar percentage. In addition, the area near the Costin and Haig <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> dumps produced <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> of below average sugar content. It was suggested that the low percentage of sugar in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> produced in these areas may be due to an excess of available nitrogen in the soil, to an inadequate supply of available phosphorus in the soil, or to a lack of balance of available nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil. In order to test these ideas, three experiments were conducted to determine the influence of nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the soil on the sugar percentage of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> Advidor: H.
