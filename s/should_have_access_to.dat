5|$|The final report, of {{the same}} name, was {{released}} in 1997. It recommended that Australia should adopt a single system following detailed trials of potential systems, {{that it should be}} implemented with high definition capabilities from the outset, that each licensed commercial or public service <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a full 7MHz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of analog PAL services should be driven by market factors and subject to regular review. The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital terrestrial broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by {{theological}} controversies, some {{of which}} turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{the text of the}} Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.|$|E

25|$|When Brunel {{was eight}} {{he was sent}} to Dr Morrell's {{boarding}} school in Hove, where he learned the classics. His father, a Frenchman by birth, was determined that Brunel <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the high-quality education he had enjoyed in his youth in France; accordingly, at the age of 14, the younger Brunel was enrolled first at the University of Caen Normandy, then at Lycée Henri-IV in Paris.|$|E
25|$|When the {{fisheries}} policy was originally {{set up the}} intention {{was to create a}} free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all waters. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations.|$|E

25|$|Wald's {{vision for}} Henry Street was one unlike any {{others at the}} time. Wald {{believed}} that every New York City resident was entitled to equal and fair health care regardless of their social status, socio-economic status, race, gender, or age. She argued that everyone <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> at-home-care. A strong advocate for adequate bed-side manner, Wald believed that regardless of if a person could afford at-home-care, they deserved {{to be treated with}} the same level of respect that some who could afford it would be.|$|E
25|$|Sir Andrew Clarke, {{just weeks}} after his arrival in Singapore, had already found {{evidence}} of the continuing disturbances in Perak and Selangor. Apart from his executive council, he talked to Tan Kim Ching. Clarke decided that both the Hai San and Ghee Hin <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Larut with neither side being excluded, a complete reversal of the policy of his predecessor, Sir Henry Ord. Tan Kim Ching agreed and wrote to the Ghee Hin at Penang to put this to them and advocate peace.|$|E
25|$|In the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), France had {{acknowledged}} British {{ownership of}} the island. However, in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), control of Newfoundland once again became {{a major source of}} conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. Britain's victories around the globe led William Pitt to insist that nobody other than Britain <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Newfoundland. The Battle of Signal Hill took place in Newfoundland in 1762 when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.|$|E

He was trying to combine the most recent technology with the improvement of his worker’s quality of life. He also upholded that they <b>should</b> <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a healthy amusement.

25|$|Like its predecessors, the 1913 Act {{deliberately}} omitted {{inclusion of}} inhabited buildings, {{whether they were}} castles or palaces. The catalyst for the 1913 Act had been the threat to Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire. An American millionaire wished to purchase the uninhabited castle, and ship it to the USA in its entirety. To frustrate the proposal, the castle had been purchased and restored by Lord Curzon and thus the export of Lord Cromwell's castle was prevented. The 1913 Act was {{an important step in}} highlighting the risk to the nation's many historic buildings. The Act also went further than its predecessors by decreeing that the public <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the monuments preserved at its expense.|$|E
25|$|The son of rich parents, Clark was {{introduced}} to the fine arts at an early age. Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin, which instilled in him the belief that everyone <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> great art. After coming {{under the influence of the}} connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson, Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, when he was twenty-seven, and three years later he was put in charge of Britain's National Gallery. His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public. During the Second World War, when the collection was taken away from London for safe keeping, Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the right}} of free {{movement}} to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply be being a human being. But although the Court of Justice stated that 'Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States', political debate remains on who <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> public services and welfare systems funded by taxation. In 2008, just 8 million people from 500million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority workers. According to TFEU article 20, citizenship of the EU derives from nationality of a member state. Article 21 confers general rights to free movement in the EU and to reside freely within limits set by legislation. This applies for citizens and their immediate family members. This triggers four main groups of rights: (1) to enter, depart and return, without undue restrictions, (2) to reside, without becoming an unreasonable burden on social assistance, (3) to vote in local and European elections, and (4) the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host state, but for social assistance only after 3 months of residence.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} {{judiciary}} Denning firmly believed that the press <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the courts and freedom to criticise magistrates and judges. He believed all legal proceedings should be held in public, quoting Jeremy Bentham {{when he said that}} [...] "in the darkness of secrecy all sorts of things can go wrong.

500|$|Although the {{popularity}} of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, {{was one of the few}} women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was [...] "almost subversive" [...] that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, [...] "Since last summer... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty... There has of course been no question of formal lessons... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody." ...|$|E
