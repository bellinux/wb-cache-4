Seven of these species are generally not <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E

The Confederate Army took this {{as a sign that}} God was on their side, as the lights were rarely <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> south. The {{painting}} Aurora Borealis by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{candidate}} was fired, {{despite the fact}} that Sir Alan had previously said that three people were going to get fired. This was because he felt that he could not separate the four finalists based on what he had <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> so he chose to have them face one last test to help him with his final decision. While Lucinda was not shown to be fired with regret, it was shown on Why I Fired Them that she was.|$|E

In these lines the young man Phaedria pleads with the slave-owner Dorio for more time {{to raise the money}} to buy his girlfriend; Phaedria’s cousin Antipho and the slave Geta secretly listen in on the conversation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw {{administrative}} graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness. For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city. The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then began to do their duties with a rare diligence, not <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy. This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.|$|E
25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E
25|$|Fanta's older {{homosexual}} brother, {{and is a}} half-faerie like her. He shows extremely discriminative {{attitude towards}} all females except his sister, presumably because he had traumatic childhood relationship with his cold and distant mother. This also is implied to be the reason his romantic interests lie within males. He and his sister are close, {{even if they do}} argue sometimes like most siblings. Pain is the one who enchanted Ryang's skateboard (after hitting on him) so he could fight the evil affinities along with Fanta. Pain's best friend is Charon, the Prime Minister of Avalon and Medea's brother. Although the full extent of Pain's power is unknown, {{the fact that he has}} attained the position of Royal Inspector, a job which requires both power and precision, as well as being the only character <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> that is able to hold off evil affinities. Like Fanta, he is much more powerful than the other inhabitants realize; as a child, he was able to detect Seraphina's spells when Charon and others could not. Pain also possesses powers to trace magical energy back to the original performer of magic.|$|E

She could <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> as far as eternity--yet she saw nothing. She was suspended in perfect consciousness--and of what was she conscious? ...|$|R

[...] Variety critic Brian Lowry considered the opening sequence to be {{the best part of the}} episode. M.

Scheduled to resume filming in Los Angeles in January 1986 after a holiday break, the network instead ended production on Dalton entirely and in early February ordered Universal Television to re-edit these four completed episodes into two feature-length movies.

In UI the solution is to tax savings (i.e., the balances not used to cover unemployment benefits). In UISAs savings are not taxed and either the government mobilizes resources from other types of taxes to finance negative balances or it defaults on R.|$|R

She was listed ninth in io9's [...] "Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks (And Canucks) Of Science Fiction", with Meredith Woerner stating [...] "I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show, especially since the monsters look amazing – but I'm worried Tapping's dreadful accent will get in the way. It sounds completely forced in all the clips I've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> but I'll guess I'll {{have to wait until}} October 3 to make my full assessment." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an [...] "iffy accent," [...] but added she would be of interest by fans of Tapping's previous works, notably Stargate. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Tapping's English accent [...] "unremarkable", whilst calling the show an [...] "unremarkable series." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Night in Sickbay" [...] {{was first}} aired in the United States on the UPN network on October 16, 2002. It {{received}} Nielsen ratings of a 3.9/6 percentage share among all adults, including 6 {{percent of all}} adults watching television {{at the time of}} the broadcast. Although overnight figures had shown a slight decrease from the previous episode, the final numbers showed that the ratings were the highest <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> during season two and the third week of increased ratings for Enterprise in succession. This meant that 6.26 million viewers watched the episode, an increase of 860,000 viewers from the previous week's episode, making it the highest viewed episode since season one's [...] "". Alexander Chase at USA Today said the numbers [...] "confirm a ratings turnaround for the newest Trek series". The episode placed Enterprise fourth in a list of the most highly rated science fiction/fantasy shows on television for that week, behind Alias, Smallville, and John Doe.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V.

[...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are going to keep bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E

500|$|Season 4 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewing the season premiere, Mark McGuire of The Times Union wrote: [...] "...the first {{minute or so}} of the resurrected Family Guy ranks among the funniest 60 seconds I've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> this season." [...] The Pitt News reviewer John Nigro felt that the show had not lost its steam while it was on hiatus, and was surprised that the show had been canceled because of its [...] "wildly extravagant shock factor". Nigro cited [...] "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do", [...] "Petarded" [...] and [...] "Perfect Castaway" [...] as the season's best episodes. In 2007, BBC Three named the episode [...] "PTV" [...] "The Best Episode...So Far". The episode has also been praised by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, who called it [...] "Family Guys most rebellious outing yet". The Boston Globe critic Matthew Gilbert felt Family Guys fourth season was as [...] "crankily irreverent as ever".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Shaunna Murphy was {{a little}} more {{critical}} of the episode, though she did call it [...] "game-changing." [...] Noting that it [...] "felt rushed," [...] she [...] "would have preferred a slow-burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic, Nikki and Paulo-style stand-alone sendoff." [...] Murphy however concluded that Graham's death was [...] "one of the coolest sequences we've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> on this show." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] with a C. He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost, explaining, [...] "Remember when Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were stuck in the polar-bear cages, and the plot just wandered in an aimless haze? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers? What took Lost 44 episodes, OUAT has done in seven." [...] Unlike other reviewers, Sava called the ending a [...] "frustrating conclusion," [...] and believed that [...] "Horowitz and Kitsis [...] one step forward and two steps back with this development." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Brennan of Slant Magazine {{summarised}} {{the episode}} as being [...] "among the best hours of television I've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> this year" [...] and {{an example of}} [...] "unrelenting brilliance". He praised the exploration of Rachel's character and especially Maslany's [...] "nothing short of masterful" [...] performance in the role, and described the satire of suburbia presented through Alison and Donnie as [...] "impeccably wry". Writing for The A.V. Club, Caroline Framke gave the episode an A– grade and found it much more focused and with more of an [...] "emotional core" [...] than the preceding episode. She highlighted the [...] "gorgeous" [...] cinematography, the chemistry between Maslany and Bruun as Alison and Donnie, and the [...] "stunning" [...] montage of Rachel's emotional breakdown. IGN's Eric Goldman has described the episode as a [...] "very busy, very strong" [...] episode and among {{the best of the}} season. He praised the [...] "darkly funny" [...] storyline involving Alison and Donnie, although he found the pacing of some of the subplots to be rushed.|$|E
