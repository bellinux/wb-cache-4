METHODS: <b>Serial</b> <b>operations</b> with preserving spleen {{were performed on}} 211 cases in our hospital from 1980 to 2000. The patient’s age ranged from 13 to 56 years, averaging 38 years. Diseases included splenic injury in 171 cases, portal hypertension in 9 cases, splenic cyst in 10 cases, and the lesion of pancreatic body and tail in 21 cases. RESULTS: All the cases were cured, and 129 patients were followe dup from 3 months to 3 years with the leukocyte phagocytosis test, detection of immunoglubin, CT, 99 mTc scanning and ultrasonography. The results were satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} the hypothesis that separate phenotypes of Crohn's disease exist which display differing patterns of recurrence with a tendency to preservation of phenotype between <b>serial</b> <b>operations.</b> METHODS: Some 483 abdominal operations (278 patients) were identified from a prospectively compiled database. Patterns of recurrence (reoperation) were analysed by Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank tests according to disease phenotype (perforated, stenosed or ulcerated). <b>Serial</b> <b>operations</b> were analysed by agreement of phenotype and microscopic features of disease using kappa statistics and correlation coefficients. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in recurrence according to disease phenotype (median reoperation-free survival time 43. 0, 50. 2 and 47. 9 months for perforated, stenosed and ulcerated types respectively; log rank chi(2) = 3. 5, P = 0. 18). There was poor agreement in phenotype between <b>serial</b> <b>operations</b> (kappa = 0. 22 for first/second operation and kappa= 0. 15 for second/third operation) and no significant correlation between pathological features was identified (r between - 0. 19 and 0. 48).

50|$|The {{implementation}} of the idiom relies on the initialization phase of execution within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS). When the class Something is loaded by the JVM, the class goes through initialization. Since the class {{does not have any}} static variables to initialize, the initialization completes trivially. The static class definition LazyHolder within it is not initialized until the JVM determines that LazyHolder must be executed. The static class LazyHolder is only executed when the static method getInstance is invoked on the class Something, and the first time this happens the JVM will load and initialize the LazyHolder class. The initialization of the LazyHolder class results in static variable INSTANCE being initialized by executing the (private) constructor for the outer class Something. Since the class initialization phase is guaranteed by the JLS to be serial, i.e., non-concurrent, no further synchronization is required in the static getInstance method during loading and initialization. And since the initialization phase writes the static variable INSTANCE in a <b>serial</b> <b>operation,</b> all subsequent concurrent invocations of the getInstance will return the same correctly initialized INSTANCE without incurring any additional synchronization overhead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Since telecom {{networks}} {{consume a}} large (and increasing) amount of energy, green-supported strategies are desirable to help Service Providers (SP) operate their networks and provision services more energy-efficiently. In this study, {{we focus on}} designing and operating optical backbone networks with green strategies. First, a number of approaches from component layer to network layer are discussed, which should help improve the power efficiency of the Internet. Then, we consider a typical layered optical backbone architecture, and minimize the Operational Power for connection provisioning following a Traffic Engineering (TE) approach. Connection provisioning is schematically decomposed as multiple <b>serial</b> <b>operations,</b> and power efficiency is analyzed for both optical bypass and traffic grooming. We propose a novel auxiliary graph, which can capture the flow of operations and their associated power. Based on the auxiliary graph, we present a Power-Aware scheme that minimizes the Operational Power at operation level.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Successive {{approximation}} register analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADCs) {{have been}} widely used for medium-speed, medium-resolution applications due to their excellent power efficiency and digital compatibility. Recently, SAR ADCs are also penetrating into the applications which have been earlier dominated by delta-sigma ADCs and pipeline ADCs. However, the resolution of SAR ADCs is limited by component mismatch, and their speed is generally slow due to <b>serial</b> <b>operation.</b> In this work, several system innovations and design techniques are investigated for SAR ADCs. First, a semi-synchronous clocking is proposed to optimize the comparator resolving time and DAC settling time in the SAR conversion. Simulations show a 40 % speed-up compared with conventional synchronous processing. A self-calibration technique to correct the capacitor mismatch error is also introduced. The proposed calibration algorithm is verified to be insensitive to the non-idealities in the calibration DACs...|$|E

30|$|Specifically, {{we propose}} that extracting a between-value graph {{comparison}} (e.g., “Are there more X than Y?”) elicits a <b>serial</b> <b>operation</b> that {{we refer to}} as a visual routine (Cavanagh, 2004; Ullman, 1984) in which attention shifts {{to at least one}} of the objects in the relation to guide the comparison process.

The requirement of using a visual routine to extract such relations is not unique to graphs – people also judge color configurations of objects (e.g., “green circle left of red circle?”) by shifting attention to one of the colored objects (Franconeri, Scimeca, Roth, Helseth, & Kahn, 2012; Holcombe, Linares, & Vaziri-Pashkam, 2011; Yuan, Uttal, & Franconeri, 2016).|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of the present work is showing that the known convergence properties of the Hopfield model {{can be reduced to}} a very simple case, for which an elementary proof is provided. The convergence properties of the Hopfield model are dependent on the structure of the interconnections matrix W and the method by which the nodes are updated. Three cases are known: (1) convergence to a stable state when operating in a serial mode with symmetric W, (2) convergence to a cycle of length 2, at most, when operating in a fully parallel mode with symmetric W, and (3) convergence to a cycle of length 4 when operating in a fully parallel mode with antisymmetric W. The three known results are reviewed and it is proven that the fully parallel mode of operation is a special case of the <b>serial</b> model of <b>operation.</b> There are three more cases than can be considered using this characterization: <b>serial</b> mode of <b>operation,</b> antisymmetric W; <b>serial</b> mode of <b>operation,</b> arbitrary W; and fully parallel mode of operation, arbitrary W.
