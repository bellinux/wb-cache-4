5|$|The novel <b>Soon</b> <b>I</b> Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman {{had come from a}} literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He always had an interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>I</b> {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E

But <b>soon,</b> <b>I</b> suspect." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>I</b> Will Be Invincible is a {{novel by}} Austin Grossman, {{published}} by Pantheon Books and released on June 5, 2007. The novel uses two alternating first person narrativesâ€”the first told {{from the point of}} view of Fatale, a female cyborg recruited by the superhero group The New Champions as they investigate the disappearance of a superhero named CoreFire. The other narrative is told {{from the point of view}} of Dr. Impossible, a supervillain possessing super-human strength and intellect who suffers from Malign Hypercognition Disorder ("evil genius" [...] syndrome). The plot follows Impossible's thirteenth attempt to take over the world after escaping from prison.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fuse in August 2012, Q-Tip confirmed that {{he was working with}} Carey on material for her fourteenth studio album. In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with me because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him <b>soon...</b> <b>I</b> think we need to get that ready." [...] She also stated that {{it was the first time}} they had worked together since composing [...] "Honey" [...] for Carey's sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} Waugh's intention {{to attempt a}} novel appears in a letter dated May 1924, to his schoolfriend Dudley Carew. Waugh writes: [...] "Quite <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> am {{going to write a}} little book. It is going to be called The Temple at Thatch and will be all about magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century folly, where he set up house and practised black magic.|$|E

500|$|In 1954, Thatcher was {{defeated}} when she sought selection {{to be the}} Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: [...] "I really just felt the twins were... only two, I really {{felt that it was}} too <b>soon.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do that." [...] Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill (the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.|$|E
500|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>I</b> Will Be Invincible was {{published}} by Pantheon Books, an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday division of Random House, and released on June 5, 2007, as a hardcover. In the UK it {{was published}} by the Penguin Group imprint Michael Joseph. An audiobook was released {{at the same time}} featuring the voices of J. Paul Boehmer and Coleen Marlo. Grossman promoted the book by attending book signings in major American cities. In the UK it was promoted by wrapping telephone booths in advertising, in reference to Superman changing outfits in such booths. The cover art, which features photos of stereotypical comic book character clothing like a mask and gloves, by Chip Kidd was called [...] "excellent... sure to attract readers". By contrast, Bryan Hitch's cover art on the British edition, which features hand-drawn illustrations of the book's characters, was called [...] "counter-productive... unnecessary" [...] due to its graphical interpretations of characters that were deliberately written in prose only. The book was short-listed for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize. Work on a film adaption began in 2008 through Strike Entertainment with scripts being written Dan Weiss and Grossman.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>I</b> Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan andâ€“ quite possiblyâ€“ the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show." [...] He concluded by writing [...] "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place {{as one of the top}} contemporary Japanese animators. And it's good to know that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> hope!) there's people capable of following his steps." [...] The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.|$|E
