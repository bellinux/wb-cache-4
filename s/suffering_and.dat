5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> rebirth.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan was a {{powerful}} hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great <b>suffering,</b> <b>and</b> that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
5|$|The Grosvenor Sanatorium {{opened in}} 1915 to help {{patients}} suffering from tuberculosis, and could cater for 110 male patients, and 78 female. The philosopher Simone Weil lived in Ashford after escaping from France during World War II. She {{felt guilty about}} leaving French people behind in <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> did not eat well. She subsequently contracted tuberculosis and {{was moved to the}} sanatorium where she died in 1943. A section of the old Ashford Bypass is now named Simone Weil Avenue, while the sanatorium subsequently became the Ashford Police Training Centre.|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (<b>suffering)</b> <b>and</b> argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E

5|$|To Mahavira, {{the metaphysical}} {{nature of the}} {{universe}} consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva. The jiva gets attached and bound to samsara (wordly realms of <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> existence) because of karma (activity). Karma, in Jainism, includes both actions and intent, and it colors (lesya) the soul; its particles stick to the soul and affect how, where, and what the soul is instantaneously reborn into after a being dies.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some life forms are {{more capable of}} <b>suffering,</b> <b>and</b> non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi {{was not only a}} source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is <b>suffering,</b> <b>and</b> questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E

5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, and knowledge of the <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
