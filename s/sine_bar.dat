50|$|Angles are {{measured}} using a <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> {{with the help}} of gauge blocks and a dial gauge or a spirit level. The aim of a measurement is to measure the surface on which the dial gauge or spirit level is placed horizontally. For example, to measure the angle of a wedge, the wedge is placed on a horizontal table. The <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> is placed over the inclined surface of the wedge. At this position, the top surface of the <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> is inclined the same amount as the wedge. Using gauge blocks, the top surface is made horizontal. The sine of the angle of inclination of the wedge is the ratio of the height of the gauge blocks used and the distance between the centers of the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface plate}} {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with accessories such as a square, straight edge, gauge blocks, <b>sine</b> <b>bar,</b> sine plate, dial indicator, parallels, angle plate, height gauge, etc.|$|E

40|$|Adjustable drill bar {{incorporates}} a micrometer screw which, {{when used in}} conjunction with standard gage blocks, provides rapid method of drill hole location and reduces time and skill requirements for precision drilling on large surfaces.

5000|$|An {{important}} feature of gauge blocks {{is that they can}} be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultra-flat surfaces to cling together. A small number of gauge blocks can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or [...]3000 to [...]3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). Gauge blocks were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson. [...] They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as micrometers, <b>sine</b> <b>bars,</b> calipers, and dial indicators (when used in an inspection role). Gauge blocks are the main means of length standardization used by industry.|$|R

50|$|A {{sine table}} (or sine plate) {{is a large}} and wide <b>sine</b> <b>bar,</b> {{typically}} equipped with a mechanism for locking it in place after positioning, {{which is used to}} hold workpieces during operations.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical Engineering Laboratory {{facilities}} include CNC machines (both lathe {{and milling}} machines), Toolmaker’s microscope, profile projectors, <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> and other measuring instruments. PLC programmer and Hydraulic power pack {{are the new}} additions in this lab. Programmable Robotic Arm will soon join the list. The Mechanical Engineering Lab of seventh semester is conducted in the lab.|$|E
50|$|The RFU took strong {{action against}} the clubs {{involved}} {{in the formation of}} the NRFU, all of whom were deemed to have forfeited their amateur status and therefore to have left the RFU. A similar interpretation was applied to all players who played either for or against such clubs, whether or not they themselves received any compensation. Such players were effectively <b>barred</b> <b>sine</b> die from any involvement in organised rugby union. These comprehensive and enduring sanctions, combined with the very localised nature of most rugby competition, meant that most northern clubs had little practical alternative but to affiliate with the NRFU in the first few years of its existence.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> {{is placed}} on a level surface the top edge will be {{parallel}} to that surface. If one roller is raised by a known distance, usually using gauge blocks, then {{the top edge of}} the bar will be tilted by the same amount forming an angle that may be calculated by the application of the sine rule.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> {{consists}} of a hardened, precision ground body with two precision ground cylinders fixed at the ends. The distance between the centers of the cylinders is precisely controlled, {{and the top of}} the bar is parallel to a line through the centers of the two rollers. The dimension between the two rollers is chosen to be a whole number (for ease of later calculations) and forms the hypotenuse of a triangle when in use.|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{levels are}} {{designated}} for the precise measurement of inclination angles {{within the range}} of +- 3 mm/m. They are very often used for checking the straightness of machine tool guides as well as the flatness of different kindsof machine tool tables and surface plates. Typical resolution of such instruments is 1 m/m. Electronic levels are calibrated by using very precise angle generators. One such generator is a <b>sine</b> <b>bar.</b> Sine bars are cheap and enable fast and simple calibrations. Commercial sine bars however are not precise enough. We, therefore, decided to design a special <b>sine</b> <b>bar,</b> which would be able to generate angles within an uncertainty of 1 mžm. This sine barwas designed by the laboratory staff and manufactured in our workroom. We have also created a calibration procedure, which has already been accredited. Uncertainty analysis, including experimental measurements, shows that the planned uncertainty has been reached. The <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> design, calibration procedure and uncertainty evaluation are presented in this article...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} an attachment for a <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> {{which can be}} used to perform measurements during lathe operations or other types of machining operations. The attachment can be used for setting precision angles on vises, dividing heads, rotary tables and angle plates. It can also be used in the inspection of machined parts, when close tolerances are required, and in the layout of precision hardware. The novelty of the invention is believed to reside in a specific versatile <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> attachment for measuring a variety of angles on a number of different types of equipment...|$|E
40|$|Sine-bar {{attachment}} for collets, spindles, and chucks helps machinists set {{up quickly}} for precise angular cuts that require greater precision than provided by graduations of machine tools. Machinist uses attachment to index head, carriage of milling machine or lathe relative to table or turning axis of tool. Attachment accurate to 1 minute or arc depending on length of <b>sine</b> <b>bar</b> and precision of gauge blocks in setup. Attachment installs {{quickly and easily}} on almost any type of lathe or mill. Requires no special clamps or fixtures, and eliminates many trial-and-error measurements. More stable than improvised setups and not jarred out of position readily...|$|E
