50|$|All {{spacecraft}} systems operated satisfactorily. The {{command module}} forward heat shield {{was protected by}} the hard portion of the boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> and was jettisoned satisfactorily in an apex-forward attitude at low altitude. The soft portion of the boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> remained intact until tower jettison. At tower jettison, part of the cover stayed with the command module {{for a short time}} although the rest of the cover moved away with the tower. The hard portion of the boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> remained intact until ground impact. Both drogue parachutes inflated, even under the severe conditions that existed; that is, command module apex forward and rolling. The command module was effectively stabilized and oriented for deployment of the main parachutes.|$|R

Crop residues are vital to conservation of soil and water. Keeping a <b>protective</b> <b>cover</b> of vegetative residues {{on the soil}} surface is the simplest and surest way to control both water and wind erosion. Vegetative residues on the soil surface improve infiltration of water into the soil, reduce evaporation, and aid in maintaining organic matter. Residues left upright all winter trap snow which increases soil water...|$|R

50|$|The canard {{surfaces}} deployed {{and turned}} the vehicle to the desired orientation for drogue parachute deployment. During the turnaround maneuver, the launch escape tower and forward heat shield were jettisoned as planned. The boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover,</b> which {{was attached to the}} launch escape system, protected the conical surface of the command module and remained intact through a canard-induced pitch maneuver. At tower jettison, the soft boost <b>protective</b> <b>cover,</b> as expected, collapsed because of differential pressure during removal from the command module. No recontact or interference between the major components was evident during tower jettison and parachute deployment.|$|R
