40|$|AbstractHorizontally {{scrolling}} text is, in theory, {{ideally suited}} to enhance viewing strategies recommended to improve reading performance under conditions of central vision loss such as macular disease, although it is largely unproven in this regard. This study investigated if the use <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> produced an observable improvement in reading performed under conditions of eccentric viewing in an artificial scotoma paradigm. Participants (n= 17) read scrolling and static text with a central artificial scotoma controlled by an eye-tracker. There was an improvement in measures of reading accuracy, and adherence to eccentric viewing strategies with scrolling, compared to static, text. These findings illustrate the potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> as a potential reading aid for those with central vision loss...|$|R

In certain systems, the PC connects to an external scroll device over IP to offer greater flexibility in setup, distances and cabling. The monitors are often black-and-white monochrome and have the scanning reversed {{to compensate for the}} reflection of the mirror. A peripheral device attached has a knob that can be turned to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the <b>scrolling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>text.</b> The text is usually displayed in white letters on a black background for the best readability, while cues are in inverse video (black on white). Difficult words (mainly international names) are spelled out phonetically, as are other particulars like [...] "Nine-eleven" [...] (to specify that the event 9/11 should not be pronounced [...] "nine-one-one", for example).|$|R

50|$|These megademos usually {{followed}} the same format, whereby one or two intros were first displayed, and then the main menu was presented so that the user could select which demos he or she wished to view. There were often one or more 'hidden' demoscreens available in megademos, where the access point was hidden, or a certain key combination had to be entered by the user to reveal the hidden demo. Hints to the existence and method of access to any hidden demos could usually be found by reading the <b>scrolling</b> <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the other}} demos within the megademo.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{distributed}} systems {{is a complex}} task. Even more complex is to explain to other people how a particular distributed system works. Until recently such systems could only be demonstrated by means <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> windows accompanied by pictures that explained {{the architecture of the}} system. Program visualisation can help a lot in gaining more insight in how such systems work, more than scrolling text and static pictures. In this thesis we answer {{the question of how to}} visualise applications in open distributed environments. In our approach we developed a generic method for visualising distributed applications and applied this method to CORBA systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The way the <b>scroll</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> Kerouac's On the Road creatively manifests the writer's {{unconscious}} {{concerns about}} his dichotomous hybrid French- Canadian-American heritage is analysed. The characters of Gabrielle Kerouac, Henri Cru and Neal Cassady are shown to operate metaphorically to symbolize Kerouac's tumultuous {{relationship with the}} various elements of his genealogy. How the writer's depiction of, and the protagonist's allegiances with, these characters, who, respectively, represent French- Canadian maternity, European respectability and American unreliability, betray Kerouac's covert attempts to reconcile his autobiographical feelings about the dualities implicit in his identity and mirror his efforts to navigate disparate cultural ideologies is examined. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of voice recognition technology to online lectures focusing on the efficacy <b>of</b> the <b>text</b> component <b>of</b> a multimedia presentation. Specifically, participants were provided with online access to multimedia instructional packages comprising {{an image of the}} lecturer with accompanying computer slides, plus simultaneous <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the words spoken during the lecture. Participants’ knowledge was measured before and after the lecture presentation. Contrary to cognitive load theory, the results did not show a negative redundancy effect, that is, there were no differences in learning efficacy between the conditions with and without on-screen text. Further, participants found no difference between text edited for semantic breaks compared to unedited text. The implications for online instructional design are that resources are better spent providing a combination of audio and slides rather than text and slides, and that if text is provided then editing for semantic line breaks is not warranted...|$|R
5000|$|Most tickers are {{traditionally}} {{displayed in the}} form <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> running {{from right to left}} across the screen or building display (or in the opposite direction for right-to-left writing systems such as Arabic script and Hebrew), allowing for headlines of varying degrees of detail; some used by television broadcasters, however, display stories in a static manner (allowing for the seamless switching of each story individually programmed for display) or utilize a [...] "flipping" [...] effect (in which each individual headline is shown for a few seconds before transitioning to the next, instead <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> across the screen, usually resulting in a relatively quicker run through of all of the information programmed into the ticker). Since the growth in usage of the World Wide Web, some news tickers have syndicated news stories posted largely on websites of broadcasters or by other independent news agencies.|$|R
5000|$|While the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows ports were {{essentially}} the same, the Nintendo 64 version saw {{a handful of}} minor changes. Given the limited storage capacity of the N64's cartridge system, all full-motion videos were removed. Brief segments <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> are used at the game's start and following each level to advance the plot. The platforming elements were made much easier in the N64 version, and the health-depleting adrenaline meter could also be turned off in the options menu, allowing players to explore the environments at a more leisurely pace. According to IGN, control-wise [...] "everything does feel improved over the PlayStation version." [...] Also graphically, the N64 version of Nightmare Creatures looked more crisp, clear and detailed than the PlayStation version, without the pixelization and texture-warping.|$|R

U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned to <b>scroll</b> the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing {{an article about the}} band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.|$|R

40|$|Alarms {{constitute}} a significant {{aspect of the}} operator-system interface in human supervisory control tasks: they {{have the potential to}} display information that is of critical importance to overall system safety and integrity. This paper considers the trend toward the use of visual display terminals for the presentation of alarms, specifically in the use <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> displays. It is suggested that this form of information display may not best serve all aspects of alarm handling. To illustrate why this is so, an analysis of human alarm handling activities is presented. The focus on text-based displays and annunciators allows the authors to concentrate on a number of problems associated with the alarm design using a specific medium. From this discussion, the alarm initiated activities model is developed. By considering the activities that people engage in when dealing with alarms, an insight is offered into the information requirements {{that can be used to}} inform the design of alarm systems...|$|R
50|$|Lip sync was {{for some}} time a minor focus in {{role-playing}} video games. Because {{of the amount of}} information conveyed through the game, the majority of communication uses <b>of</b> <b>scrolling</b> <b>text.</b> Older RPGs rely solely on text, using inanimate portraits to provide a sense of who is speaking. Some games make use of voice acting, such as Grandia II or Diablo, but due to simple character models, there is no mouth movement to simulate speech. RPGs for hand-held systems are still largely based on text, with the rare use of lip sync and voice files being reserved for full motion video cutscenes. Newer RPGs, have extensive audio dialogues. The Neverwinter Nights series are examples of transitional games where important dialogue and cutscenes are fully voiced, but less important information is still conveyed in text. In games such as Jade Empire and Knights of the Old Republic, developers created partial artificial languages to give the impression of full voice acting without having to actually voice all dialogue.|$|R
