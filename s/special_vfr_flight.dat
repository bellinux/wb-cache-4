50|$|The ICAO {{definition}} of <b>Special</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> is a VFR flight cleared by {{air traffic control}} to operate within a control zone in meteorological conditions below visual meteorological conditions.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, some class B airspaces prohibit <b>special</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Flights must be {{conducted}} according to Visual Flight Rules (i.e. {{in sight of}} the ground and away from cloud). This includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. <b>Special</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may be permitted on request of air traffic control, enabling transit through a control zone which would otherwise be out of bounds.|$|R
50|$|If {{the weather}} is below VMC, pilots are {{required}} to use instrument flight rules, and operation of the aircraft will primarily be through referencing the instruments rather than visual reference. In a control zone, a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> may obtain a clearance from air traffic control to operate as <b>Special</b> <b>VFR.</b>|$|R
50|$|In other {{controlled}} airspace, {{when the}} local weather {{is less than the}} minimums required for flight under visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> may request and obtain a clearance to operate as <b>Special</b> <b>VFR</b> in the control zone. Pilots may as an alternative to IFR request an SVFR clearance to enter the airspace and fly visually.|$|R
500|$|As the {{aircraft}} began taxiing to the departure runway, the rain intensified and visibility {{at the airport}} fell below the three mile minimum required for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight.</b> Cheyenne's control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the [...] "field is IFR". [...] In general, when an airport is officially IFR (normally because of reduced visibility or low cloud ceiling), only IFR or <b>special</b> <b>VFR</b> operations are allowed. Reid then requested and received from the control tower a <b>special</b> <b>VFR</b> clearance {{to allow him to}} exit the airport's control zone visually, despite the reduced visibility.|$|R
5000|$|Flight {{plans are}} {{documents}} filed by a pilot or flight dispatcher {{with the local}} Civil Aviation Authority (e.g. FAA in the USA) prior to departure which indicate the plane's planned route or flight path. Flight plan format is specified in the ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, estimated time en route, alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules IFR or visual <b>flight</b> rules <b>VFR),</b> the pilot's information, number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, flight plans are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. Flight plans are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas, such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a <b>special</b> type of <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan called a DVFR (Defense <b>VFR)</b> <b>flight</b> plan must be filed.For IFR flights, flight plans are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services. For <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required, or for use by air traffic control when flying in a [...] "Special Flight Rules Area".|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} procedures of <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> at high altitudes. It describes {{the division of}} airspace including the limitations applied and significant international organizations in relation to its management and organization. It also focuses on the rules for the execution of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> non-standard flights, and comparison of non-standard flights with adjacent states...|$|R
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. IFR flights are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated from IFR flights and are provided traffic information about other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R

50|$|Class D: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or <b>VFR.</b> All <b>flights</b> {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>Flights</b> operating under <b>VFR</b> are given traffic information in respect of all other flights.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not {{necessarily}} conducted on straight lines between ground-based radio navigation transmitters, the altitude restrictions for IFR flights are not applicable. Instead, a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> can be conducted using pilotage, watching landmarks to determine position and desired direction. In this situation, the minimum reception altitude becomes moot, and the over-riding concern is for obstacle clearance.|$|R
5000|$|To {{avoid these}} scenarios, <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> {{intending}} {{to land at}} or take off from an airport experiencing localized conditions marginally below VMC minima may request <b>Special</b> <b>VFR</b> clearance from the tower. SVFR flight is only allowed while within the portion of an airport's controlled airspace (class B, C, or D) that extends to the surface, {{and it must be}} explicitly requested by the pilot and granted by the tower (some airports, primarily large Class B facilities, do not allow SVFR operation in their airspace at all). Visibility on the ground must still be greater than one statute mile, but most other VMC minima such as ceiling are waived. The pilot is required to maintain VFR separation distances from other aircraft and, by requesting SVFR, asserts that they can do so despite the marginal conditions. For departing flights, the pilot must be flying in VMC by the time they leave the surface footprint of the controlled airspace (otherwise they would be flying VFR in IMC which is illegal).|$|R
50|$|Class C: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>flights</b> operating under <b>VFR,</b> but <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not separated from each other. <b>Flights</b> operating under <b>VFR</b> are given traffic information in respect of other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in a control zone, to fly VFR in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in the control zone but not below the lower minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in uncontrolled airspace. SVFR is never offered by Air Traffic Control. It must be requested by the Pilot in Command.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} entering class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance {{prior to}} entry {{and must be}} prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flights</b> may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some class B airspaces include special transition routes for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the class B airspace).|$|R

Upon {{contact with}} an ATC unit, they will be told to squawk a certain unique code. When changing frequency, for instance because the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> leaves controlled airspace or changes to another ATC unit, the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> will be told to [...] "squawk VFR" [...] again.|$|R

5000|$|The Bell 206B JetRanger was {{operating}} under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 91,and departed from parking lot [...] "F" [...] of the Concord Pavilion around 9:45 pm, {{bound for the}} Commodore Center Heliport (KJMC) in Sausalito, California, approximately 27 miles to the southwest. The pilot had received a weather briefing in which Visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flight</b> was not recommended due to inclement weather. Before take-off the pilot requested and received a <b>special</b> <b>VFR</b> clearance to pass though the airspace of Buchanan Field Airport on a northwest heading.When the helicopter lifted off the weather was one half mile visibility, gusty winds, heavy rain and overcast with a two hundred foot ceiling.Using pilotage to navigate from one landmark to another at an altitude just below the cloud base, the helicopter pilot proceeded through the city of Vallejo and began following California State Route 37. At 9:56 pm near the northernmost point of San Pablo Bay, the Bell 206B struck {{the top of a}} 223-foot high-voltage transmission tower, located approximately 150 feet south of Rt. 37 and became impaled on it.The aircraft exploded on impact and all three occupants suffered fatal injuries.|$|R
