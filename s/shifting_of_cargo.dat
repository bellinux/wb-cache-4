60|$|It is when {{a partial}} cargo is {{received}} that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune. Only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form {{an idea of the}} tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious. When lying-to (especially with a small bead sail), a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles {{over to the side of}} the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> or of ballast.|$|E
60|$|In {{explanation}} of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous {{to some of}} my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here state that {{the manner in which}} this most important duty had been per formed on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. The great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end, great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but {{to the nature of the}} bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo. In most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result. There have been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> A load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractContrary to liner {{shipping}}, common shipping network {{patterns are}} difficult to organize in tramp shipping as origin and destination ports are irregular and they may change based on shippers’ demands. Unlike liner shipping whereas the choice of ports is strongly related to their geographical locations among other factors and a topic of much research in the contemporary literature, the geographical issues related to bulk ports are an interesting yet currently under-researched topic. For this reason, this study aims to analyze the concentration ratios of bulk ports to reveal geographical patterns, using the case of bulk ports along {{the west coast of}} Korea including, Incheon Port (ICP), Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port (PDP), and Gunsan Port (GSP). To examine and shed more light to the above mentioned research issue, this paper adopts a series of methods, such as Hirshmann-Herfindahl Index (HHI), Location Quotients (LQ), and Shift Effects (SE). Results from the HHI analysis, indicated that de-concentration has been gradually rising because of a considerable overlapping of ports’ functions. Meanwhile, the LQs’ confirmed this result. Finally, the SE’ results effectively showed that a substantial <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> had occurred among the ports...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of work within the {{research}} project "Probabilistic Models for Ship Safety in Rough Seas". One major danger in sea transportation is the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> The aim of the project has been to develop a methodology for assessing the risk of cargo shifting as well as performing some case studies. The idea has been that a more probabilistic approach to the problem of cargo shifting is needed. In the methodology the interaction of wave, ship and cargo is modelled and combined with statistical methods in order to estimate the risk of cargo shifting. The main aim has been to assess the long-term risk of cargo shifting for a vessel on a specific route, but also short-term risk has been addressed. Linear waves and ship motion transfer functions are used to calculate the ship motion induced forces acting on a cargo unit. A basic model of a container has been used for determining shifting criteria. Comparing time series of the ship motions induced forces with the shifting criteria gives the probability of shifting for a cargo unit. During its lifetime a ship will encounter different conditions, in which the probability of cargo shifting will differ. Defining such conditions as unique combinations of wave, ship and cargo parameters, the probability of occurrence of each condition can be estimated from wave statistics and knowledge of the operating profile of the vessel. In each condition the probability of at least one cargo shift can be estimated, and in combination with the frequency of occurrence the total risk of cargo shifting can be estimated. Computational examples have shown that the influence of wave, ship and cargo parameters can be assessed, especially with short-term risk...|$|E

The study investigates: 1) long cargo movements, {{carried on}} {{coupling}} of two railway platforms equipped with turnstile-fastening devices (TFD); 2) the forces {{acting on the}} cargo by the TFD.

Authors obtained rational parameters of TFD at dry friction in supports, which provide the smallest forces acting on the cargo as a result of impact. Oringinality. Early studies of «car – cargo» system dynamics with moving TFD were carried out with insufficient accuracy. When considering such tasks one resorted to a significant simplification of the calculation schemes. The use of such devices allows producing supports <b>of</b> long <b>cargo</b> for cars movable-centered ones. TED allow more or less significant <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cargo</b> relatively to support cars in the longitudinal direction. After impact the return of the goods in the original position is ensured.

The solution of the problem to determine the nature and magnitudes acting on the cargo forces and accelerations is implemented by mathematical model, adequate to real conditions. Gaps limitations and absorbing apparatuses of the cars in TFD are taken into account. Practical value.
