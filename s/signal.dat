The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock <b>Signal</b> Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. <b>Signal</b> Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|In a {{broadcast}} system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a <b>signal</b> containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the <b>signal</b> containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast <b>signal</b> can be either analog (<b>signal</b> is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the <b>signal</b> {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback <b>signal</b> is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input <b>signal</b> to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback <b>signal</b> is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{structural}} vibration <b>signals,</b> {{many kinds}} of <b>signals</b> (such as sinusoidal <b>signals</b> and impulsive <b>signals)</b> are mixed together. Convolutive mixtures often take place in vibration <b>signals.</b> In order to separate effectively the useful <b>signals</b> from the <b>signals</b> mixed by noise, the paper firstly transforms time <b>signals</b> into frequency <b>signals</b> through FFT, then applies FastICA to separate the useful <b>signals</b> from mixed <b>signals,</b> transforms frequency <b>signals</b> into time <b>signals</b> through IFFT, finally accomplishes the separating of the useful <b>signals</b> and noise. Two different experiments have been done to separate the steel structural vibration <b>signals</b> generated by hammer and vibration exciter in laboratory. The experiments {{results show that the}} mixed <b>signals</b> can be separated successfully when the exciters and sensors are placed on the suitable locations...|$|R

5|$|The International Telecommunication Union uses {{an internationally}} agreed system for {{classifying}} radio frequency signals.

5|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>signal</b> box overlooking Norwood Road and {{a similar}} <b>signal</b> box at {{the northern end of}} the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single <b>signal</b> box adjacent to the north junction. The replacement <b>signal</b> box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{expression}} in (21), {{it can be}} seen that the first and second <b>signals</b> are still original <b>signals.</b> However, the third and fourth <b>signals</b> have different phases from the original <b>signals,</b> and the rest of the <b>signals</b> have become new <b>signals</b> which the amplitudes vary with time. That is to say, except for the first and second <b>signals,</b> the others are interferential <b>signals.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input <b>signal</b> into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input <b>signal</b> (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input <b>signal</b> of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other <b>signal</b> is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output <b>signal</b> will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency <b>signal</b> from the antenna is mixed with a <b>signal</b> from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency <b>signal</b> called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio <b>signal,</b> which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing <b>signal</b> flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with <b>signal</b> flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> lights (at night). <b>Signal</b> lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>signaling</b> {{involved}} in CLRs induced immune response, major connection has been identified between TLR and CLR <b>signaling,</b> therefore we differentiate between TLR-dependent and TLR-independent <b>signaling.</b> DC-SIGN leading to RAF1-MEK-ERK cascade, BDCA2 <b>signaling</b> via ITAM and <b>signaling</b> through ITIM belong among the TLR-dependent <b>signaling.</b> TLR-independent <b>signaling</b> such as Dectin 1, and Dectin 2 - mincle <b>signaling</b> lead to MAP kinase and NFkB activation.|$|R
30|$|The mood {{recognition}} module {{is activated}} when the perception system detects musical <b>signals.</b> Audio <b>signals</b> transmitted through a microphone of a robot {{can be either}} musical <b>signals</b> or human voice <b>signals.</b> Thus, the audio <b>signals</b> need to be classified into music and voice, since the system is programmed to process voice <b>signals</b> in the speech emotion recognition module. For the classification of audio <b>signals,</b> we employ the standard method of voice activity detection based on the zero crossing rate (ZCR) and energy [25]. When the audio <b>signals</b> indicate relatively high values in both ZCR and energy, the <b>signals</b> are regarded as musical <b>signals.</b> Otherwise, the <b>signals</b> are categorized as voice <b>signals</b> and submitted to the speech processing module.|$|R

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation <b>signal</b> was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the <b>signal</b> to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main <b>signal.</b> The received <b>signal</b> was amplified and mixed into the same video <b>signal</b> as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical <b>signal</b> generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The <b>signal</b> then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical <b>signal</b> cannot pass through, which forces the <b>signal</b> to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The <b>signal</b> then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the <b>signal</b> is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E

25|$|In {{the domain}} of digital <b>signal</b> processing, the term {{interpolation}} refers {{to the process of}} converting a sampled digital <b>signal</b> (such as a sampled audio <b>signal)</b> to that of a higher sampling rate (Upsampling) using various digital filtering techniques (e.g., convolution with a frequency-limited impulse <b>signal).</b> In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content of the original <b>signal</b> be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content of the original <b>signal</b> above the original Nyquist limit of the <b>signal</b> (i.e., above fs/2 of the original <b>signal</b> sample rate). An early and fairly elementary discussion on this subject can be found in Rabiner and Crochiere's book Multirate Digital <b>Signal</b> Processing.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) <b>signal</b> {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the <b>signal</b> to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak <b>signal</b> at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the <b>signal,</b> and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the <b>signal.</b> That is, the resulting <b>signal</b> has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input <b>signal.</b> In conventional AM radio, this <b>signal</b> is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting <b>signal</b> can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum <b>signal</b> energy. Normally the maximum <b>signal</b> energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E
25|$|The SSRT test is similar, {{except that}} the 'stop' <b>signal</b> is {{presented}} after the 'go' <b>signal.</b> This small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the 'go' response, because the participant has typically already initiated the 'go' response {{by the time the}} 'stop' <b>signal</b> is presented. The participant is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the 'go' <b>signal</b> while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy (on no-go trials). During the task, the time at which the 'stop' <b>signal</b> is presented (the stop <b>signal</b> delay or SSD) is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the 'go' <b>signal</b> at which the participant is just able/unable to inhibit their 'go' response. If the participant fails to inhibit their 'go' response, the 'stop' <b>signal</b> is moved slightly closer to the original 'go' <b>signal,</b> and if the participant successfully inhibits their 'go' response, the 'stop' <b>signal</b> is moved slightly ahead in time. The SSRT is thus measured as the average 'go' response time minus the average 'stop' <b>signal</b> presentation time (SSD).|$|E
25|$|In a {{multicellular}} organism, <b>signaling</b> between cells occurs {{either through}} release into the extracellular space, divided in paracrine <b>signaling</b> (over short distances) and endocrine <b>signaling</b> (over long distances), or by direct contact, known as juxtacrine <b>signaling.</b> Autocrine <b>signaling</b> {{is a special}} case of paracrine <b>signaling</b> where the secreting cell {{has the ability to}} respond to the secreted <b>signaling</b> molecule. Synaptic <b>signaling</b> is a special case of paracrine <b>signaling</b> (for chemical synapses) or juxtacrine <b>signaling</b> (for electrical synapses) between neurons and target cells. <b>Signaling</b> molecules interact with a target cell as a ligand to cell surface receptors, and/or by entering into the cell through its membrane or endocytosis for intracrine <b>signaling.</b> This generally results in the activation of second messengers, leading to various physiological effects.|$|R
