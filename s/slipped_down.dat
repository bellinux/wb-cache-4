5|$|The E Series Clubsport R8 {{takes its}} {{fundamental}} body structure {{from the mainstream}} VE Commodore. It is also the standard model in the HSV line-up. With the deletion of lower lines of V8 HSV models the Clubsport <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> to the entry level HSV V8, {{on a par with}} the Manta of the VR-VS-VT series. As such the sales of E Series Clubsports has been over shadowed by the sales of the E Series GTS.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the release}} debuted at number33 on the Billboard 200 with 25,000copies sold {{in its first}} week. It also debuted at number three on the Top Soundtracks chart, number13 on the Top Internet Albums chart and debuted atop the Top Music Videos chart. The next week, the album <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> to number107 on the Billboard 200, while holding atop the Top Music Videos chart. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 85,000copies in the US as of August 2010. In Canada, the album debuted and peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey was {{replaced}} by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games – one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit after just one full season and {{was replaced}} by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967–68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers. McGarry left to manage Wolves and {{was replaced by}} Bobby Robson in January 1969.|$|E

5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Stoke <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> {{the league}} in an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled enough {{not to be a}} liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E

About fifteen people were buried, and eight of these died. A pub in South Street is named The Snowdrop in memory of the event.|$|E

25|$|Ronald W. Clark, in his 1984 {{biography}} of Darwin, commented that Only the transparent honesty of Darwin's character... {{makes it possible}} to believe that by the 1850s he had no recollection of Matthew's work. This begs the question, for it assumes he did read Matthew's book. Clark continues by suggesting: If Darwin had any previous knowledge of Arboriculture, it had <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> into the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} season {{back under the}} Internapoli name, they almost {{achieved}} promotion, but came runners-up to Cavese, missing out by three points. In the following two seasons {{they were unable to}} equal or better this; they <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> to 7th and in the next season they were placed in a group with many Sicilian teams, this proved to be their downfall as all the traveling proved tough and they were subsequently relegated.|$|E

25|$|The Labour Party was {{committed}} to home rule for Scotland in the 1920s, but it <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> its agenda in the following years. The Scottish National Party (SNP) was founded in 1934, but did not achieve significant electoral success until the 1960s. A document calling for home rule, the Scottish Covenant, was signed by 2,000,000 people (out of a population of 5,000,000) in the late-1940s. Home rule, now known as Scottish devolution, did not become a serious proposal until the late-1970s as the Labour Government of James Callaghan came under electoral pressure from the SNP.|$|E
25|$|Although Watford twice {{occupied}} a playoff position in late 2009, they gradually <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> the table {{over the course}} of the season. With five games to go, they were in 21st position in the Championship, separated from the relegation zone only on goal difference. A 3–0 win over Reading secured Watford's Championship survival in their penultimate match of 2009–10. They eventually finished in 16th position out of 24 teams. In other competitions, Watford were defeated in the third round of the FA Cup by eventual winners Chelsea, and eliminated from the League Cup in the second round by Leeds United.|$|E
25|$|Birech beat Emmanuel Bett in {{a sprint}} finish at the Cross Internacional de Itálica in January 2013.

On the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit he appeared regularly in the steeplechase but only twice made the top three (third at the London Grand Prix and second at the Weltklasse Zürich) A fourth place at the Kenyan trials saw him miss a major tournament again and <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> the end-of-year steeplechase rankings, coming ninth for 2013. He performed well in long-distance races, however, coming runner-up at the Cross Internacional de Venta de Baños and fourth in a 10K best of 29:00 minutes at the BOclassic.|$|E

25|$|While {{the allies}} were at Brussels making dispositions to {{march to the}} relief of Mons, Saxe <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> the Scheldt with {{the main body of}} the army towards his real target; one column on the left bank of the river, and two columns on the right to cover the march and engage the allies in battle. The capture of Tournai would {{consolidate}} and extend the gains that had been made in the previous campaign, and provide the French with the key to the approaches of Ghent and Oudenarde, threatening British communications with Ostend and the sea. Yet the siege was also a decoy for a much more original manoeuvre – the prompt engagement of the enemy in a place favourable to the French army, and at a time before the allies could reach their full strength. Although Saxe favoured movement over siege warfare he knew there was nothing more likely to provoke an early encounter than to threaten one of the allies' larger fortresses, which only the most confident and able commander could ignore.|$|E
25|$|Robert E. Lee {{once again}} began an {{invasion}} of the North, in June 1863, and Lincoln urged Hooker to pursue and defeat him. Hooker's initial plan was to seize Richmond instead, but Lincoln immediately vetoed that idea, so the Army of the Potomac began to march north, attempting to locate Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> the Shenandoah Valley into Pennsylvania. Hooker's mission was first to protect Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and second to intercept and defeat Lee. Unfortunately, Lincoln was losing any remaining confidence he had in Hooker. Hooker's senior officers expressed to Lincoln their {{lack of confidence in}} Hooker, as did Henry Halleck, Lincoln's General-in-chief. When Hooker got into a dispute with Army headquarters over the status of defensive forces in Harpers Ferry, he impulsively offered his resignation in protest, which was quickly accepted by Lincoln and General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck. On June 28, 1863, three days before the climactic Battle of Gettysburg, Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. George Meade. Hooker received the Thanks of Congress for his role {{at the start of the}} Gettysburg Campaign, but the glory would go to Meade. Hooker's tenure as head of the Army of the Potomac had lasted 5 months.|$|E
500|$|In Hindu mythology, Vega {{is called}} Abhijit.

Then the star Abhijit <b>slipped</b> <b>down</b> in the sky." [...] P. V.
