5|$|East of the railway, {{the route}} crosses below US1. The {{eastbound}} lane has an exit ramp that connects to both directions of US1; in contrast, the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US1 northbound and a loop to US1 southbound. The road continues to the east, crossing a small inlet and a <b>small</b> <b>island</b> before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges. At {{the eastern end}} of the bridges, the route again crosses a <b>small</b> <b>island</b> and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island. There, the causeway intersects with CR3. The route crosses a series of islands, forming another twin set of bridges over the Banana River. After reaching land for the final time, the route enters South Patrick Shores. It has a partial interchange with SR513, with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing north of a housing development, the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A.|$|E

5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a <b>small</b> <b>island,</b> after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another <b>small</b> <b>island.</b> Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E
