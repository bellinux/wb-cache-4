2500|$|Calling {{the game}} {{refers to the}} act of {{catchers}} to decide the type of pitch delivered to home plate. Catchers comprise {{a high percentage of}} baseball managers. [...] 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. Because the catcher is considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), he is often in charge of planning defensive plays. The catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown. The majority of the time it is done through a number system. Each number will represent a different pitch, and then the pitcher can either agree or disagree with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her head. These signals get more complicated when a runner is on second base, because the runner's vantage point when he takes his lead gives him a direct view of the catcher's hand and a simple signal can be relayed by the runner to the batter. Signals are not always done by the number system. Varitek was known for giving signals by touching certain parts of his chest protector.|$|E

60|$|Mr. George was at {{this time}} just writing the address on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letter. He did not say any thing, but Rollo {{observed}} a very slight and almost imperceptible <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
60|$|With {{his desire}} to please, and urged by Mr. Castle's words and the ominous <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> whip, Toby's {{preparations}} were soon made, and he stood before his instructor clad only in his shirt, trousers, and stockings.|$|R

60|$|In his drowsy chuckling, and the <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, he put {{his hands}} into his {{waistcoat}} pockets. In one of them he found a bit of holly (left there, probably last night), which he now took out, and looked at.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yet," [...] {{said the}} lady, [...] "I {{scarcely}} think {{anything can be}} worse than what he undergoes at home.

60|$|He had {{to steady}} {{himself against the}} table again {{for a moment or}} two, ere he turned his back on the hospitable board, and started to walk round towards the forge: no doubt the <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knees was {{attributable}} to the strong liquor which he had consumed.|$|R
60|$|Kells rose in {{wonderful}} calmness, {{with only}} his pallor {{and a slight}} <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands to betray excitement. An uneasy stir and murmur ran through the room.

6000|$|... "You're {{foolish to}} carry it loose. Any one could take it from you," [...] said the cabin boy, with a knowing <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
6000|$|... "They couldn't {{have seen}} the firelight," [...] {{returned}} Dick, with a sorry <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. [...] "It beats all where they went to, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose it might! By the Lord, you may suppose so. By George!' said Mr. Bounderby, with sundry menacing {{nods and}} <b>shakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. 'It {{might have been}} twice twenty. There's no knowing {{what it would have}} been, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the fellows' being disturbed.' ...|$|R

60|$|About this time, Dicky was {{overtaken}} {{with the}} nervous, haunting fear that besets married men {{when they are}} out of sorts. He had no pension to look to.
