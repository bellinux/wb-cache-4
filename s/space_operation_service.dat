40|$|A large {{increase}} in <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> activities is expected because of Space Station Freedom (SSF) and long range Lunar base missions and Mars exploration. <b>Space</b> <b>operations</b> will also increase {{as a result}} of space commercialization (especially the {{increase in}} satellite networks). It is anticipated that the level of satellite <b>servicing</b> <b>operations</b> will grow tenfold from the current level within the next 20 years. This growth can be sustained only if the cost effectiveness of <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> is improved. Cost effectiveness is operational efficiency with proper effectiveness. A concept is presented of advanced avionics, autonomous spacecraft control, that will enable the desired growth, as well as maintain the cost effectiveness (operational efficiency) in satellite <b>servicing</b> <b>operations.</b> The concept of advanced avionics that allows autonomous spacecraft control is described along with a brief description of each component. Some of the benefits of autonomous operations are also described. A technology utilization breakdown is provided in terms of applications...|$|R
40|$|Interoperability {{of mission}} {{operation}} software systems {{is a key}} requirement in <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> domain, both within an organisation and {{in the context of}} cross-organisation cooperation scenarios. This interoperability is traditionally achieved through deployment of dedicated integration adapters, for bridging discrepancies between proprietary data models, data formats, communication protocols and software implementation technology of each interacting application. The CCSDS Spacecraft Monitoring and Control (SM&C) working group has defined a service-oriented framework, which allows the specification of mission <b>operation</b> <b>services</b> in an implementation and communication technology agnostic manner. One of the main objectives of this framework is to increase the interoperability of mission <b>operation</b> <b>services</b> and reduce the required integration effort for federating services of different stakeholders. Domain specific design standards are a key factor for achieving service interoperability. They specify a reference Service Model for all services within a service inventory, addressing both functional and non-functional aspects of service contracts such as service taxonomy, service addressing, service security, Quality of Service (QoS), transaction management and reliable messaging.

40|$|Because {{of the low}} boiling {{temperature}} of cryogenic propellants to be used on the Space Shuttle, loss of cryogens from boiloff could become very costly. This paper describes how this shuttle problem is being solved at Kennedy Space Center. Cryogenic losses are categorized relative to the particular cryogenic involved, the <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>servicing</b> <b>operation</b> causing boiloff and {{the magnitude of the}} loss. The techniques under consideration are discussed in detail. These techniques include reclaiming the boiloff by reliquefaction, upgrading the reclaimed boiloff by purification, and interim boiloff storage in metal hydride prior to reprocessing. One of the reliquefaction processes discussed in detail utilizes the cooling effect of venting some of the liquid hydrogen boiloff to provide a simple hydrogen reliquefaction unit. Possible future applications of these cryogenics recovery techniques to industry and transportation systems using liquid hydrogen for energy storage and fuel are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|NASA {{over the}} years has {{developed}} many types of technologies and conducted various types of science resulting in numerous variations of operations, data and applications. For example, operations range from deep space projects managed by JPL, Saturn and Shuttle operations managed from JSC and KSC, ISS science operations managed from MSFC and numerous low earth orbit satellites managed from GSFC that are varied and intrinsically different but require many of the same types of services to fulfill their missions. Also, large data sets (databases) of Shuttle flight data, solar system projects and earth observing data exist which because of their varied and sometimes outdated technologies are not and have not been fully examined for additional information and knowledge. Many of the applications/systems supporting operational services e. g. voice, video, telemetry and commanding, are outdated and obsolete. The vast amounts of data are located in various formats, at various locations and range over many years. The ability to conduct unified <b>space</b> <b>operations,</b> access disparate data sets and to develop systems and services that can provide operational services does not currently exist in any useful form. In addition, adding new <b>services</b> to existing <b>operations</b> is generally expensive and with the current budget constraints not feasible on any broad level of implementation. To understand these services a discussion of each one follows. The Spaceflight User-based Services are those services required to conduct <b>space</b> flight <b>operations.</b> Grid <b>Services</b> are those Grid services that will be used to overcome, through middleware software, some or all the problems that currently exists.
