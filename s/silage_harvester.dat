50|$|Claas Jaguars are {{the most}} common type of <b>silage</b> <b>harvester</b> in the world. Of the forage {{harvesters}} sold in Ireland from 2000 to 2003, 60% were Claas Jaguars.Claas Jaguars held 41% of forage harvesters sold in United Kingdom in 2005 and 2006, with John Deere selling just 23%. Claas also sell very well in North America. The Claas Jaguar has been in production for 35 years.|$|E
50|$|A forage {{harvester}} (also {{known as a}} <b>silage</b> <b>harvester,</b> forager or chopper) is a farm implement that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A corn <b>silage</b> <b>harvester</b> using a shredding/crushing {{mechanism}} was designed, fabricated, {{and tested}} during two harvesting {{seasons with the}} objective of improving the feed value of corn silage. Two pairs of toothed rolls turning at different speeds shredded whole-plant corn. Corn stalks were shredded, kernels were broken, and cobs were crushed. Average specific energy required to shred whole-plant corn ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 9 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy for an added flail cutter/blower ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 7 kWh/Mg DM for a total harvester specific energy requirement of 4. 5 to 10. 6 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy requirements for shredding varied significantly among different roll speed treatments at a unit roll force of 15 N/mm (front and rear), but no significant effect of roll speed configuration was found at other unit roll forces. Packed density was lower for shredded silage than for chopped silage, but shredded and chopped samples both ensiled well with pH values of 3. 8 to 4. 1 after fermentation. Particle size distributions of shredded and flail-cut samples were similar at moisture levels of 60 % and 65 % w. b.; however, the 70 % moisture crop was coarser. Shredding produced fewer small particles ( 9 mm) than chopping, while shredded and flail-cut samples had more small particles and more large particles than chopped samples...|$|E
5000|$|The Claas Jaguar Speedstar {{was first}} sold in 2003. Before then, most <b>silage</b> <b>harvesters</b> went at a normal speed of 20 km/h during roading. With the Speedstar however, {{the machine was}} much faster at 40 km/h.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. During forage harvest for <b>silage,</b> the <b>harvesters,</b> {{transport}} units, {{and equipment}} at the storage site (blower, bagger, or bunker packing) must {{work at a}} similar rate to avoid idle equipment and labor. Harvester power (which determines potential harvester capacity) {{was used as a}} basis for sizing transport and unloading equipment and their power units. Cycle analysis was employed to determine transport unit needs to keep the harvester fully utilized. An empirical model of transport needs was developed and guidelines for silage harvest machinery sets are provided...|$|R
