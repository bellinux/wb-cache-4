50|$|Upon Olin's retirement, Olin Corporation's {{new chief}} {{executives}} sought to maximize company profitability, giving corporate preference to its flourishing chemical business over gun production, which was unprofitable and labor-intensive. As a result, Winchester ceased machining both {{the receiver and}} many small parts of the Model 94 out of solid steel billet as of 1964. <b>Sintered</b> <b>steel</b> was used on the receiver, stamped sheet metal for the cartridge lifter, and hollow rather than solid steel roll pins used in the action. While the rifle's function, safety, and accuracy were not adversely affected, the changes—in particular the sintered receiver, which was as strong as its solid-steel predecessor but which did not respond well to a traditional blued finish—were conspicuous and came as Winchester made even more fundamental changes to its flagship Model 70 bolt-action rifle. Taken together, they were seen as a retreat from quality production across the company's whole range, seriously damaging Winchester's reputation for making quality firearms in the process. In response, many sought out rifles made before 1964, (pre '64), which command a markedly higher resale value on the gun market to this day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Finish {{machining}} of <b>sintered</b> <b>steel</b> {{is increasingly}} important for near net shape technology.

When cutting fluid is necessary for chip control and disposal, air jet assisted wet machining with a K 10 uncoated cemented carbide and wet machining with a P 10 cermet are recommended.
