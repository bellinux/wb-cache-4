5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. also {{promoted}} the album with {{an appearance on}} the [...] "Late Show with David Letterman", during which she performed [...] "Born Free" [...] with Martin Rev of Suicide playing keyboards, backed {{by a group of}} dancers styled to look like M.I.A. In November 2010 she appeared on the British television show Later... with Jools Holland, performing [...] "Born Free" [...] and [...] "It Takes a Muscle", the latter with members of The Specials. While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times, who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between what she <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> was reported. The piece was criticised for its yellow journalism by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media. Benjamin Boles wrote in Now that, while Hirschberg's piece came across as a [...] "vicious ... character assassination", M.I.A's subsequent actions were [...] "childish" [...] and made her [...] "the laughing stock of the internet". The paper later printed a correction on the story, acknowledging that some quotes had been taken out of context. The incident prompted Boots Riley of the band Street Sweeper Social Club to comment on how artists had access to media that allowed writers to be held accountable and that M.I.A.'s move was [...] "brilliant".|$|E

500|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} 2011, {{only a few}} core staff members {{were working on the}} game, forming a skeleton team. At this time, Yamazaki said that the player should be able to use emotions and analytical psychology to reach the truth, in addition to using evidence: he thought that previous Ace Attorney games had only focused on evidence versus statements, and wanted to introduce a third element. Natsuki Ikawa, one of the game designers, read books on psychology and talked to the other staff members about what to do. She wrote down several ideas for how to handle it, including goggles that show the witness's personality as a specter, or a large computer that analyzes brain waves and heart rates, and showed them to Yamazaki, who would say [...] "that's a pretty nifty idea" [...] but still reject them; this contradiction between what he <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he felt made Ikawa realize the basic concept for the mood matrix system, which was revised through feedback from everyone on the team and was implemented in the game. Another game designer, Yoriki Daigo, worked on several new features, including making the player able to move between locations freely and designing the revisualization system. Because the game was built from the ground up, the user interface for investigation sections was overhauled completely to be more visually appealing. The developers tried to keep the game simple, keeping it in line with Takumi's original vision of a game simple enough for his mother to play.|$|E

2500|$|Rusty Barrett {{suggests}} {{that the idea of}} the homogeneous speech community could perhaps be more accurately replaced by one of a queer community based on community spirit or a queer cultural system, since language use varies so greatly. Kulick proposes, instead of studying speech communities that he concludes [...] "do not and cannot exist" [...] because of methodological problems, researchers should study [...] "language and desire" [...] through examining repression in the context of linguistics, considering both what is <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is not or cannot be said. Kulick addresses the need for consideration of the role of sexuality in sexual identity, unlike some lavender linguists who neglect sexuality in favor of linguistic features that might be more likely than sexuality to legitimize gay identity.|$|E

2500|$|Undergraduate Shakespeare {{students}} {{were required to}} read six plays extremely slowly and to virtually memorize the texts. “It {{is the purpose of}} this course”, Kittredge used to remark, “to find out what Shakespeare <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he meant when he said it.” Where Professor Child had often been imposed on in the classroom by students who took advantage of his extremely sweet nature, Kittredge's dramatic classroom manner kept his students on the edge of their seats [...] lateness, wearing of hats, yawning, and coughing (one student was permanently expelled from the class for this offense) were strictly forbidden. His manner with his graduate students was entirely different. With them he was extremely collegial and invited them to his home for weekly fireside gatherings. There, in dim light, the students read papers which, with his encouragement, would often form the nucleus of subsequent dissertations.|$|E
2500|$|When first released, [...] "Brand New Key" [...] {{was banned}} by some radio {{stations}} because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged {{the possibility of}} reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, [...] "I wrote [...] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories {{as to what the}} lyrics <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio [...] My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in their life afterward [...] People will take it any way they want to take it." ...|$|E
2500|$|English {{private schools}} {{at the time}} of Niven's boyhood were noted for their strict and {{sometimes}} brutal discipline. Niven suffered many instances of corporal punishment owing to his inclination for pranks, which finally led to his expulsion from Heatherdown Preparatory School at the age of 10½. This ended his chances for Eton College, a significant blow to his family. After failing to pass the naval entrance exam because of his difficulty with maths, Niven attended Stowe School, a newly created public school led by headmaster J.F. Roxburgh, who was unlike any of Niven's previous headmasters. Thoughtful and kind, he addressed the boys by their first names, allowed them bicycles, and encouraged and nurtured their personal interests. Niven later wrote, [...] "How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he did were of real importance to the headmaster." [...] He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, graduating in 1930 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the British Army.|$|E

2500|$|For {{many years}} Grant stood by his {{original}} {{version of the}} orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for The Century Magazine that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road {{on the first day}} of battle. After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind. Grant wrote a letter to the editors at Century, which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter [...] "modifies very materially what I have <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh." [...] While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.|$|E
2500|$|The Funeral Oration was {{recorded}} by Thucydides in book {{two of his}} famous History of the Peloponnesian War. Although Thucydides records the speech {{in the first person}} {{as if it were a}} word for word record of what Pericles said, there can be little doubt that he edited the speech at the very least. [...] Thucydides says early in his History that the speeches presented are not verbatim records, but are intended to represent the main ideas of what was <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> was, according to Thucydides, [...] "called for in the situation". [...] We can be reasonably sure that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war, but there is no consensus as to what degree Thucydides' record resembles Pericles' actual speech. [...] Another confusing factor is that Pericles is known to have delivered another funeral oration in 440 BC during the Samian War. [...] It is possible that elements of both speeches are represented in Thucydides' version. [...] Nevertheless Thucydides was extremely meticulous in his documentation, and records the varied certainty of his sources each time. [...] Significantly he begins recounting the speech by saying: [...] "Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου ... ἔλεγε τοιάδε", i.e. [...] "Pericles, son of Xanthippos, spoke like this". [...] Had he quoted the speech verbatim, he would have written [...] "τάδε" [...] ("this", or [...] "these words") instead of [...] "τοιάδε" [...] ("like this" [...] or [...] "words like these").|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

The Rabbis confronted Rava, saying [...] "hiding of the face" [...] and [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] did not apply to Rava. Rava asked the Rabbis whether they knew how much he was forced to send {{secretly}} to the Court of King Shapur of Persia. Even so, the Rabbis directed their eyes upon Rava in suspicion. Meanwhile, the Court of King Shapur sent men who seized Rava's property. Rava then said that this bore out what Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel taught, that wherever the Rabbis direct their eyes in suspicion, either death or poverty follows. Interpreting [...] "I will hide My face," [...] Rava taught that God said although God would hide God's face from them, God would nonetheless speak to them in a dream. Rav Joseph taught that God's hand is nonetheless stretched over us to protect us, as [...] says, [...] "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania was once at the Roman emperor Hadrian's court, when an unbeliever gestured to Rabbi Joshua in sign language that the Jewish people was a people from whom their God had turned His face. Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania gestured in reply that God's hand was stretched over the Jewish people. Emperor Hadrian asked Rabbi Joshua what unbeliever had said. Rabbi Joshua told the emperor what unbeliever had <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> Rabbi Joshua had replied. They then asked the unbeliever what he had said, and he told them. And then they asked what Rabbi Joshua had replied, and the unbeliever did not know. They decreed that a man who does not understand what he is being shown by gesture should hold converse in signs before the emperor, and they led him forth and executed him for his disrespect to the emperor.|$|E
