5000|$|... 43 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> many <b>localities</b> in the United States impose {{an income}} tax on individuals. 47 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> many <b>localities</b> impose a tax on the income of corporations. Tax rates vary by <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality,</b> <b>and</b> may be fixed or graduated. Most rates are {{the same for all}} types of income. <b>State</b> <b>and</b> local income taxes are imposed in {{addition}} to federal income tax. State income tax is allowed as a deduction in computing federal income tax, subject to limitations for individuals.|$|R

25|$|Some <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> place {{additional}} restrictions on certain semi-automatic firearms {{that they have}} defined as assault weapons, or on magazines that can hold more than {{a certain number of}} rounds of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Other taxpayers must file {{income tax}} returns {{each year to}} self assess income tax. These returns may be filed electronically. Generally, an individual's tax return covers the {{calendar}} year. Corporations may elect a different tax year. Most <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> follow the federal tax year, and require separate returns.|$|E
25|$|NFA {{weapons are}} weapons that are heavily {{restricted}} at a federal level by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. These include automatic firearms (such as machine guns), short-barreled shotguns, and short-barreled rifles. Some <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> place additional restrictions on such weapons.|$|E
30|$|The {{sample was}} {{stratified}} by <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> (urban/rural) resulting in 12 strata and is nationally representative.

The survey implemented a multistage cluster sampling design resulting in nationally representative cohorts.|$|R
50|$|Most {{individual}} U.S. states {{collect a}} {{state income tax}} in addition to federal income tax. The two are separate entities. Some local governments also impose an income tax, often based on state income tax calculations. Forty-three <b>states</b> <b>and</b> many <b>localities</b> in the United States may impose an income tax on individuals. Forty-seven <b>states</b> <b>and</b> many <b>localities</b> impose a tax on the income of corporations.|$|R
50|$|The company {{started to}} change course in the late 1990s, {{shifting}} from a traditional mortgage provider to an online-focused lender. Traditionally, the home mortgage business in America has been fragmented due to varying regulations in each <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality.</b> Gilbert challenged this orthodoxy, however, by offering loan applications online that were reviewed by experts versed in the regulations of each region but who were located in a central headquarters.|$|R
25|$|The {{rate of tax}} at {{the federal}} level is {{graduated}}; that is, the tax rates on higher amounts of income are higher than on lower amounts. Some <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> impose an income tax at a graduated rate, and some at a flat rate on all taxable income. Federal tax rates in 2013 varied from 10% to 39.6%.|$|E
25|$|The <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> had to {{organize}} and equip the volunteer regiments until later in 1861, {{when the federal government}} became sufficiently organized to take over the project. Soon after President Lincoln's calls for volunteers, many volunteers from Illinois gathered in various large public and private buildings in Chicago and then overflowed into camps on the prairie on the southeast edge of the city. Senator Stephen A. Douglas owned land next to this location and had donated land just south of the camps to the original University of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|As Commerce Secretary, Hoover also hosted two {{national}} conferences on street traffic, in 1924 and 1926 (a third convened in 1930, during Hoover's presidency). Collectively the meetings were called the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover's chief {{objective was to}} address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities.</b> Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets.|$|E
5000|$|In most cases, this {{complexity}} {{is part of}} {{the underlying}} sales tax laws; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location, remote sellers {{have to deal with the}} use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> that assesses them, if the company has a presence or [...] "nexus" [...] in every state (as large [...] "brick-and-mortar" [...] sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do).|$|R
5000|$|The health {{services}} {{are provided in}} addition to the ministries of health (federal, <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities),</b> by health sub-systems like insurance schemes, armed forces, and private providers. For provision of service, health care is organized at three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary level. The national health insurance fund, in addition to being an actor for financing, has its own health facilities. The armed forces and parastatal organizations like railways and Sudan Air etc. have their own network of health facilities and insurance schemes.|$|R
40|$|Historical {{scholarship}} {{on the politics}} of nineteenth-century Chinese immigration emphasizes the interests of labor and management in the genesis of congressional legislation in 1882 that limited Chinese immigration into the United States. This article examines early state attempts at the exclusion of Chinese workers after the first major wave of Chinese immigration during the California Gold Rush. Opposition to exclusion occurred in California in the early 1850 s because Chinese immigrants were important taxpayers when both the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> were experiencing major fiscal difficulties. State attempts to legislate exclusion were successful only after financial conditions improved in the late 1850 s. ...|$|R
500|$|In 1993, the Congress {{passed the}} Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), seeking {{to restore the}} {{compelling}} interest requirement applied in Sherbert and Yoder. In City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), the Court struck down the provisions of RFRA that forced {{state and local governments}} to provide protections exceeding those required by the First Amendment, on the grounds that while the Congress could enforce the Supreme Court's interpretation of a constitutional right, the Congress could not impose its own interpretation on <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities.</b> According to the court's ruling in Gonzales v. UDV (2006), RFRA remains applicable to federal laws and so those laws must still have a [...] "compelling interest".|$|E
500|$|Title II {{established}} the Public Works Administration. [...] Title II, Section 201 {{established the}} agency and provided for a two-year sunset provision. Section 202 outlines the types of public works which the new agency may seek to fund or build. Title II, Section 203 authorized the Public Works Administration to provide grants and/or loans to <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> in order to more rapidly reduce unemployment {{as well as to}} use the power of eminent domain to seize land or materials to engage in public works. [...] Title II, Section 204 explicitly provided $400 million for the construction of public highways, bridges, roads, railroad crossings, paths, and other transportation projects.|$|E
500|$|Scalia {{generally}} {{voted to}} strike down laws that make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring {{a certain percentage of}} contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> could institute race-based programs if they identified past discrimination and if the programs were designed to remedy the past racism. Five years later, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences, ...|$|E
50|$|In the U.S. as of 2005, {{there are}} 21 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> {{numerous}} <b>localities</b> that have keg registration laws. The laws vary widely {{in terms of}} whom they target, what their intended purpose is, and how strongly they are enforced.|$|R
50|$|<b>States</b> <b>and</b> some <b>localities</b> offer {{a variety}} of credits that vary by jurisdiction. States {{typically}} grant a credit to resident individuals for income taxes paid to other states, generally limited in proportion to income taxed in the other state(s).|$|R
50|$|Historians {{have formed}} scores of {{scholarly}} organizations, which typically hold annual conferences where scholarly papers are presented, and which publish scholarly journals. In addition, every <b>state</b> <b>and</b> many <b>localities</b> {{have their own}} historical societies, focused on their own histories and sources.|$|R
500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E
2500|$|<b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> tend to tax {{all income}} of residents.

[...] Many states require partnerships to pay tax for nonresident partners.|$|E
2500|$|Tax {{returns are}} filed {{separately}} for <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> imposing income tax, {{and may be}} due on dates that differ from federal due dates. [...] Some states permit related corporations to file combined or consolidated returns. [...] Most <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> imposing income tax require estimated payments where tax exceeds certain thresholds, and require withholding tax on payment of wages.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1997, {{the federal}} {{government}} designed the overall program requirements <b>and</b> guidelines, while <b>states</b> administered the program and determined eligibility for benefits. Since 1997, states have been given block grants and both design and administer their own programs. Access to welfare and amount of assistance varied quite a bit by <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> under AFDC, both because {{of the differences in}} state standards of need and considerable subjectivity in caseworker evaluation of qualifying [...] "suitable homes". [...] However, welfare recipients under TANF are actually in completely different programs depending on their state of residence, with different social services available to them and different requirements for maintaining aid.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} to cluster and model network-level traffic states {{based on a}} {{geometrical}} weighted similarity measure of network-level traffic <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> preservative non-negative matrix factorization. The geometrical weighted similarity measure makes use of correlation between neighboring roads to describe spatial configurations of global traffic patterns. Based on it, we project original high-dimensional network-level traffic information into a feature space of much less dimensionality through the matrix factorization method. With the obtained low-dimensional representation of global traffic information, we can describe global traffic patterns {{and the evolution of}} global traffic states in a flexible way. The experiments prove validity of our method for the case of large-scale traffic network...|$|R
2500|$|The Romney {{campaign}} {{told reporters}} in October 2012, as the nation's East coast braced for Hurricane Sandy, that [...] "Gov. Romney believes that states should {{be in charge of}} emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions.... As the first responders, states are {{in the best position to}} aid affected individuals and communities and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA." [...] The Romney campaign released a statement following the storm stating, [...] "I believe that FEMA plays a key role in working with <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. As president, I will ensure FEMA has the funding it needs to fulfill its mission, while directing maximum resources to the first responders who work tirelessly to help those in need, because <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> are in the best position to get aid to the individuals and communities affected by natural disasters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, Prohibitionists {{succeeded in}} {{amending}} the Constitution to prohibit {{the sale of}} alcohol. [...] Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall, banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs which trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition was repealed in 1931. <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>localities</b> retained {{the right to remain}} [...] "dry", and to this day, a handful still do.|$|E
2500|$|Taxable {{income is}} defined in a {{comprehensive}} manner in the Internal Revenue Code and [...] issued by the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. [...] Taxable income is gross income as adjusted minus deductions.

[...] Taxable income for a company or business {{may not be the}} same as its book income.|$|E
5000|$|Both paper {{claims and}} manual {{substantiation}} of FSA debit card charges often required the submission of receipts with [...] "full names" [...] of OTC items; but many stores abbreviate item names {{in such a}} way that it is almost impossible to tell if the item is eligible or not. Also, most providers did not reimburse sales tax on paper claims with [...] "mixed" [...] FSA/non-FSA receipts because they could not [...] "split" [...] the tax line item without being versed in the sales tax laws of every <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>locality</b> in the U.S., a near impossibility. IIAS avoids this by having the retailer itself verify item eligibility and [...] "split" [...] the sales tax.|$|R
