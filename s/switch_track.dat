500|$|Kingda Ka's {{layout and}} {{experience}} is {{nearly identical to}} Top Thrill Dragster. After the train has been locked and checked, it moves slowly {{out of the station}} to the launch area. It passes through a <b>switch</b> <b>track,</b> which allows four trains (on two tracks) to load simultaneously. When the signal to launch is given, the train rolls back slightly (to engage the catch car) and the brakes on the launch track retract. There is a voice that says, [...] "Arms down, head back, hold on!". The launch occurs five seconds after the hissing sound of the brake fins retracting or the warning voice. Kingda Ka's horn previously sounded before each launch, but it was silenced due to noise complaints from nearby residents; the horn now sounds only when Kingda Ka first launches after being idle for a length of time. When the train is in position, the hydraulic launch mechanism accelerates the train from 0 to 128 miles per hour (0 to 206km/h) in 3.5 seconds. At the end of the launch track, the train climbs the main tower (or top hat) and rolls 90 degrees to the right before reaching a height of [...] The train then descends [...] straight down through a 270-degree right-hand spiral. The train climbs the second hill of , producing a moment of weightlessness before being smoothly brought to a stop by the magnetic brakes; it then makes a left-hand U-turn and enters the station. The ride lasts 28 seconds {{from the start of the}} launch.|$|E

50|$|Storm Runner is {{the first}} {{accelerator}} coaster to utilize over-the-shoulder restraints {{and the first to}} have a dual-loading station with <b>switch</b> <b>tracks.</b> Likewise, it was also the first accelerator coaster to feature inversions; Kanonen at Liseberg was the second.|$|R
50|$|A single {{slip switch}} works on the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or <b>switch</b> <b>tracks</b> to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot <b>switch</b> <b>tracks.</b> This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|R
50|$|The player must {{test the}} new system, the Switchy5000. This {{state-of-the-art}} system prevents players from controlling the switches; rather, it <b>switches</b> <b>track</b> whenever a train drives over the switch. The {{job is to}} outsmart this computerized system by navigating two trains to their respective load drop-off points.|$|R
50|$|On April 27, 1953, Locomotive 4005 {{was pulling}} {{a freight train}} through {{southern}} Wyoming and jumped the <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> at 50 mph, throwing the engine onto its left side and derailing its tender and the first 18 freight cars of the 62-car train. The engineer and fireman were killed instantly on impact and the brakeman died in a hospital {{a few days later}} from his severe burns. The cab of the locomotive was destroyed by the tender, and the loads from the 18 derailed cars were scattered near the site of the accident. After this incident, the locomotive was repaired by Union Pacific at its Cheyenne facility.|$|E
5000|$|The Site Selection Board {{selected}} {{this site}} {{because it was}} centrally located with ready accessibility from several large cities.

The soil type was satisfactory with gravel being locally available for concrete. Could be serviced by the Pennsylvania Railroad, with a station only [...] away and construction of a <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> easily possible; also paved highways and bus lines nearby. Electrical power available from Peru. Satisfactory climate conditions, as indicated by Weather Bureau Reports. Water treatment for the steam boilers seemed to be the only draw back.|$|E
5000|$|Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store is a {{historic}} warehouse and retail building located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a mammoth 8-story (plus penthouse) concrete structure and is roughly shaped like a squared-off number [...] "4." [...] The front features a penthouse tower at the main entrance bay with a balcony and capped by a flagpole. The building houses over 1200000 sq ft of floor space flooded by light from approximately 1,000 large multi-paned, steel frame windows. It was built about 1925 as a mail order and retail warehouse for Montgomery Ward adjacent to the railroad <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> {{and was one of}} nine large warehouses built by them in the United States.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, the {{original}} layout {{was extended to}} feature a loop {{around the base of}} the newly added Dreamworld Tower (which houses The Giant Drop and Tower of Terror II). Similar to {{the original}} layout, the track began with a right hand turn out of the station before crossing under the track of the Tower of Terror twice and then going underneath a bridge. It then turned left and travelled alongside the Murrissippi River before running parallel to the Dreamworld Railway tracks and circling the base of the Dreamworld Tower. It then returned over that bridge and into the station. Despite the addition to the circuit, the original track remained intact and allowed both routes to operate through the use of a <b>switch</b> <b>track.</b> This extended layout was primarily utilised from 1997 until 2007, however, the original circuit was utilised for a short period of time during one Xtremeworld event.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 6020 Central Unit provided track power & generated locomotive commands but {{required a}} separate 6035 locomotive Control 80 with speed controller, keypad for decoder address, Function / Off buttons, and Start / Stop buttons to <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> power. The red Stop button was provided {{as an emergency}} stop to immediately halt all trains. A two digit display showed the selected locomotive address (01 - 80). Solenoid devices, such as turnouts, were controlled by the 6040 Keyboard. Up to ten controllers could {{be added to the}} right hand side of the Central Unit, and up to 16 keyboards could be added to the left hand side, with each keyboard controlling 16 accessories (signals, turnouts, lights, etc.) for a total of 256. For large layouts 6016 Boosters and their own power supplies would provide additional power to additional layout sections with all Boosters linked to the Central Unit by a ribbon cable.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} 2012 {{has shown that}} using a foreign {{language}} reduces decision-making biases. It was surmised that the framing effect disappeared when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. As human reasoning is shaped by two distinct modes of thought: one that is systematic, analytical and cognition-intensive, and another that is fast, unconscious and emotionally charged, {{it was believed that}} a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. Therefore, those who speak two languages have better critical thinking and decision making skills.A study published a year later found that switching into the second language seems to exempt bilinguals from the social norms and constraints such as political correctness.In 2014, another study has shown that people using a foreign language are more likely to make utilitarian decisions when faced with a moral dilemma, as in the trolley problem. The utilitarian option was chosen more often in the fat man case when presented in a foreign language. However, {{there was no difference in}} the <b>switch</b> <b>track</b> case. It was surmised that a foreign language lacks the emotional impact of one's native language.|$|E
