5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (<b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> {{places in the}} body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such {{as the use of}} central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E
