5000|$|Tricare Reserve Select is a premium-based {{health plan}} that active status {{qualified}} National Guard and Reserve members may purchase. The classification is {{sometimes referred to}} as Tricare Reserve Component (RC). It requires a monthly premium and offers coverage similar to Tricare Standard and Extra for the military member and eligible family members. It has a partial premium cost sharing arrangement with DoD similar to civilian private or public sector employer plans, although typically at a lower cost than civilian plans. The program coverage is available worldwide to Selected Reserve (SELRES) members of both the Title 10 USC Federal Reserve Components (Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve), Title 14 USC Federal Reserve Component (Coast Guard Reserve) and the Title 32 National Guard (Army National Guard and Air National Guard) in a drill pay (also known as [...] "paid") status. As of February 2008, retired Reserve Component personnel under the age of 60, actively drilling Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) personnel in a non-paid status, or actively drilling Volunteer Training Unit (VTU) personnel in a non-paid status do not qualify for TRS. IRR and VTU members are eligible for reinstatement under TRS is they return to a SELRES status. Reserve Component personnel who are also Federal civil servants (to include Army Reserve Technicians and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) in the Army Reserve, Army National Guard, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard) and eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) are also excluded from TRS. Retired Reserve Component personnel and eligible dependent family members become eligible Tricare Standard, Tricare Extra or Tricare Prime on the service member's 60th birthday {{in the same manner as}} Active Component retirees and their eligible dependents are eligible immediately upon retirement from active <b>service.</b> <b>Qualification</b> questions should be referred to Tricare.|$|E

Preferred the latter to be the most complete, qualiquantitative technique and able to accurately align the goals of the IT service firm's to competitive contracting strategy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} comprehensive framework for conceptual, methodological and instrumental contribution to urban intervention planning {{and public policy}} design. For a Latin American case study, a prospective multi-methodology modeling platform was developed to support the novel proposed approaches for intervention assessment, {{as well as to}} establish a knowledge building dynamic for planners using multidisciplinary discussion and, most importantly, paradigm confrontation and change. Paradigm analysis of both planning and modeling fields drives the strategy to establish a scientific bond between underlying analytical approaches and planning agents’ visions. The analysis thereby offers a greater understanding of the urban problem and an inclusive definition of the city´s selected path for urban development, focused on the complex exchange of formal approaches, real practice issues, and agents’ professional and methodological biases. The compared paradigm analysis allows insertion of the modeling paradigm discussion – traditionally reserved to the theoretical arena - into a wider philosophical framework for urban planning, intended to facilitate the multiple urban analysts’ paradigm confrontation and to establish a strategy based on multi-paradigm thinking capable of uncertainty and complexity comprehension in practice. This analysis drives the planning modeling tools development and the communication and appropriation proposals. For the case study Medellín Metropolitan Area (Colombia), considering that planning is a non-neutral value discipline, City Object/City Subject are presented as the main paradigms for urban planning practice and their methodological approaches are contrasted with Normative/Descriptive modeling paradigms. A stronger bias on physic-spatial focused planning related to the City Object proposed paradigm was identified and formalized. A multi-paradigm modeling platform was then built to bridge the City Object + City Subject multi-paradigm, which is capable of combined territorial and social actor dynamic envisioned through the Normative + Descriptive OR multi-methodology. This development enhances the descriptive and explicative power of the urban intervention evolution analysis, exploring urban occupation as both a driver and driven dynamic of the social actors’ transactions and as a strategic link to assess the demand cycles for planning. The demand is redefined as a dynamic variable in time and space instead of as an input. The developed multi-paradigm multi-methodology platform offers contributions to different levels of urban planning modeling and assessment, related to the general chain of analysis as well as to each implemented methodology. It especially redefines the modeling exercise as an active part of the planning exercise, configuring an information added value chain (source, base and results) that feeds the knowledge building process and highlights new analysis lines and niches. As a result, analysts are compelled to exchange, discuss and confront their position on the building impacts of Urban Futures. For the case study, the platform offers prospective information on density; socioeconomic composition, urban <b>service</b> <b>qualification</b> (distribution, accessibility, connectivity) and externality estimation (congestion), among many other indicators linked to versatile information systems (geographical and relational). It has been supported by several of the local and regional planning agencies and progressively integrated into their planning exercises. The research offers an analysis framework that acknowledges the urban planning exercise’s impact on the evolution of spatial and social exclusion patterns. This framework aims for innovation in the planning field in order to build the basis of a truly comprehensive planning strategy that tackles the most urgent problems of our current and future urbanization processes...|$|E
