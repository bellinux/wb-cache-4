In 2004 and 2006 they <b>screened</b> <b>Bend</b> It Like Beckham, Mr Bean the Disaster Movie and Bride and Prejudice, each film seen by over 12,000 locals. They assisted the British Embassy with the nationwide broadcast of ‘Bend It Like Beckham’ on December 26, 2010 (the first western feature film to be broadcast in DPRK).|$|R

40|$|Equipment wear is a {{major concern}} in the mineral {{processing}} industry, which dramatically increases the maintenance cost and adversely affects plant operation efficiency. In this research, wear problems of mineral processing equipment including <b>screens,</b> sieve <b>bends,</b> heavy media vessel, dewatering centrifuge, etc., were identified. A novel surface treatment technology, high density infrared (HDI) surface coating process was proposed for the surface enhancement of selected mineral processing equipment. Microstructural and mechanical properties of the coated samples were characterized. Laboratory-simulated wear tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological performance of the coated components. Test results indicate that the wear resistance of AISI 4140 and ASTM A 36 steels can be increased 3 and 5 folds, respectively by the application of HDI coatings...|$|R
40|$|Electro-optic {{techniques}} {{are becoming increasingly}} im-portant in ultrafast electron bunch longitudinal diagnostics and have been successfully implemented at various acceler-ator laboratories. The longitudinal bunch shape is directly obtained from a single-shot, non-intrusive measurement of the temporal electric field profile of the bunch. Further-more, the same electro-optic techniques {{can be used to}} measure the temporal profile of terahertz / far-infrared opti-cal pulses generated by a CTR <b>screen,</b> at a <b>bending</b> magnet (CSR), or by an FEL. This contribution summarizes the re-sults obtained at FELIX and FLASH...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the continuing problem of {{noise induced hearing loss}} NIHL among mine workers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has conducted numerous noise surveys in coal preparation plants. The research, consisting of worker dose monitoring, task observations, and equipment noise profiling, was completed in eight separate preparation plants. Worker dose monitoring was conducted for three shifts in most cases. Workers experiencing higher than allowable doses were task-observed for one full shift to correlate dose to noise source(s). Finally, noise levels on all floors, and in lunchrooms and control rooms, were characterized. Results indicate that only workers who routinely spend a significant portion of their shift in the plants (away from the control rooms) are susceptible to overexposure from noise. Certain pieces of equipment (<b>screens,</b> centrifuges, sieve <b>bends)</b> are the loudest primary noise sources responsible for the worker noise exposures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{partial discharge}} (PD) inves-tigation of dierent cable termination defects. The medium voltage power cables as rated of 3. 6 / 6 (7. 2) kV are applied. Finite Element Method Magnetic (FEMM) program {{is used as}} a simulation tool for electric eld stress investigation. The partial dis-charges patterns are detected by using a commer-cial High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT). The simple cases for internal, surface and corona dis-charge are rstly observed in order to investigate the performance of the HFCT. Then eight dierent case studies of cable termination defects are further in-vestigated, which includes non-terminator, voids be-tween XLPE and stress control, 20 mm. overlaps be-tween semiconductor and stress control, particles on XLPE, non-smooth XLPE, needle tip on insulation <b>screen,</b> impropriate cable <b>bending,</b> and proper termi-nation. The results are then compared with the re-sults from a conventional PD diagnosis tool according to IEC 60270 standard. The results of PD detection show that the commercial product can detect the PD waveform and measure the electric charge when it is highly enough. The test can also identify trends to-ward breakdown and there severity due to improper cable termination defects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{distress}} {{was observed}} in a distortion screen during testing. This screen is positioned {{in front of an}} aero engine during testing to check the engine performance with a distorted air intake. To ensure a distorted air intake, the screen contains dense meshes in some areas whereas in other areas they are less dense. Non-uniformity in the mesh density results in distorted air flow into the engine thereby facilitating evaluation of the engine performance with disturbed aerodynamic inlet. The component, i. e. the distortion screen was under development and was subjected to aerodynamic tests on the test bench. It was found to have fractured from a rib connecting two meshes. Loose end of the mesh had detached and resulted in permanent deformation of the adjoining ribs and meshes. The fractured surface exhibited glossy crystalline appearance. Scanning electron microscope revealed striations at higher magnifications (> 500 X) as {{was observed in}} the case of fatigue failure. Two crack fronts were adjacent and near to one corner of the rib, and the third crack front had originated from the other corner placed diagonally opposite to the other two crack fronts. This observation indicated failure of the <b>screen</b> under reverse <b>bending</b> fatigue condition. Design and material condition were reviewed. After modification {{it was found that the}} newly modified distortion screen did not show any sign of deformation after testing...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{atmospheric}} multipath conditions, both canonical transform (CT) and full spectrum inversion (FSI) method can {{solve the problem}} of calculating bending angle profiles within the multipath area. The atmospheric propagation of GPS signals under atmospheric multipath conditions is simulated using multiple phase <b>screens</b> (MPS) technique. <b>Bending</b> angle profiles computed by CT method are compared with corresponding solutions to Abel integral (taken as the true value). The results show that CT method is close to the true value in the multipath area. The retrieval accuracy of CT method is degraded to some extent when Gaussian noises are added to the phase of simulated signal. About 4500 COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate) atmPhs profiles from DOY (day of year) 71 to DOY 73 in 2007 are retrieved by CT method. Statistical comparisons of the retrieved refractivity profiles, together with atmPrf data (retrieved by FSI method), with those from corresponding ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analysis show that CT method contains greater systematic negative bias than atmPrf data below 5 km. A possible reason is that the signal aperture is decreased for back-propagating the signal from LEO position to the back-propagation plane in CT method. The small aperture means low accuracy in the refractivity. The influence of signal truncation on both retrieval accuracy and occultation number is also discussed...|$|R
