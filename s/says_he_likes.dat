5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

He earned the nicknames [...] "Planet Zito" [...] and [...] "Captain Quirk" [...] when with Oakland.

6000|$|... "That {{is hard to}} tell," [...] {{said the}} man thoughtfully. [...] "You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some <b>say</b> <b>he</b> looks <b>like</b> a bird; and some <b>say</b> <b>he</b> looks <b>like</b> an elephant; and some <b>say</b> <b>he</b> looks <b>like</b> a cat. To others he appears as a {{beautiful}} fairy, or a brownie, {{or in any other}} form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} case with our lodger downstairs, sir. He does not often sleep here--not more than one night in the week. He travels, I believe, for some house of business; but, as he <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> to have a quiet place to come to when here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{kind of a}} plain room," [...] Mrs. Arty said, doubtfully. [...] "The {{furniture}} is kind of plain. But my head-waiter man--it was furnished for a friend of his--he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> it {{better than any other}} room in the house.

What style of music do you like best?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Sad fellow,’ he replied, ‘very sad. He {{positively}} {{refused to}} work on the wheel; so, after many trials, I was compelled to order him into solitary confinement. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> it very much though, and I am afraid he does, for he lies on his back on the floor, and sings comic songs all day!’ ...|$|E
60|$|I visited him, {{the morning}} after my arrival, in his chamber, which is in a remote corner of the mansion, as he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> to be to himself, {{and out of the}} way. He has fitted it up in his own taste, so that it is a perfect epitome of an old bachelor's notions of {{convenience}} and arrangement. The furniture is made up of odd pieces {{from all parts of the}} house, chosen on account of their suiting his notions, or fitting some corner of his apartment; and he is very eloquent in praise of an ancient elbow-chair, from which he takes occasion to digress into a censure on modern chairs, as having degenerated from the dignity and comfort of high-backed antiquity.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Striker eyed his {{old friend}} for {{a moment with a}} look of some displeasure; he saw that this was but a cunning {{feminine}} imitation of resignation, and that, through some untraceable process of transition, she was now taking more comfort in the opinions of this insinuating stranger than in his own tough dogmas. He rose to his feet, without pulling down his waistcoat, but with a wrinkled grin at the inconsistency of women. [...] "Well, sir, Mr. Roderick's powers are nothing to me," [...] he said, [...] "nor no use he makes of them. Good or bad, he 's no son of mine. But, in a friendly way, I 'm glad to hear so fine an account of him. I 'm glad, madam, you 're so satisfied with the prospect. Affection, sir, you see, must have its guarantees!" [...] He paused a moment, stroking his beard, with his head inclined and one eye half-closed, looking at Rowland. The look was grotesque, but it was significant, and it puzzled Rowland more than it amused him. [...] "I suppose you 're a very brilliant young man," [...] he went on, [...] "very enlightened, very cultivated, quite up to the mark in the fine arts and all that sort of thing. I 'm a plain, practical old boy, content to follow an honorable profession in a free country. I did n't go off to the Old World to learn my business; no one took me by the hand; I had to grease my wheels myself, and, such as I am, I 'm a self-made man, every inch of me! Well, if our young friend is booked for fame and fortune, I don't suppose his going to Rome will stop him. But, mind you, it won't help him such a long way, either. If you have undertaken to put him through, there 's a thing or two you 'd better remember. The crop we gather depends upon the seed we sow. He may be the biggest genius of the age: his potatoes won't come up without his hoeing them. If he takes things so almighty easy as--well, as one or two young fellows of genius I 've had under my eye--his produce will never gain the prize. Take the word for it {{of a man who has}} made his way inch by inch, and does n't believe that we 'll wake up to find our work done because we 've lain all night a-dreaming of it; anything worth doing is devilish hard to do! If your young protajay finds things easy and has a good time and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> the life, it 's a sign that--as I may say--you had better step round to the office and look at the books. That 's all I desire to remark. No offense intended. I hope you 'll have a first-rate time." ...|$|E
