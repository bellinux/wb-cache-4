5000|$|Remington {{manufactured}} {{more than}} 150,000 over-under double-barreled derringers from 1866 {{until the end}} of their production in 1935. The gun was made only in [...]41 Short rimfire. There are four models with several variations. The first model, first variation is only the first 100 made and were marked [...] "MANUFACTURED BY E.

5000|$|In 1888 Remington went {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} Hartley and Graham of New York. The company name was changed to Remington Arms Co., and beginning in 1889 all Remington guns were marked with that name. The third model was made in 6 variations, all marked, [...] ""REMINGTON ARMS CO, ILION NY". on the top rib. The variations {{are determined by the}} font style. The first variation of the third models were serialized, but all other variations were marked in batches, not with serial numbers. After the merger between Remington and UMC Cartridge Co in 1910, beginning in 1911, the fourth models were marked [...] "REMINGTON-U.M.C.CO.ILION,N.Y." [...] and were serialized. Starting in 1922, all Remington guns were stamped with a two letter date code for the shipping month and year. The second variation has strengthened hinges and serial numbers that begin with the letter [...] "L", These were marketed as the Model 95. The third and final model has no <b>side</b> <b>rib</b> and is referred to as a [...] "monoblock". About 500 monoblocks were made through 1935, with only ten guns shipped after that.|$|E

40|$|A 57 -year-old female {{underwent}} whole-body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron {{emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) study for health examination. There is increased FDG uptake in the left scapula, the left <b>side</b> <b>ribs</b> and bilateral femora. Fibrous dysplasia, sexual precocity and hyperthroidism history was then told. She also received thyroidectomy and 131 I radioiodine therapy for hyperthyroidism. She then underwent 99 mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy {{the next day to}} evaluate the extent of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. The location of FDG uptake showed similar pattern as the blood pool phase bone scintigraphy. Discrepancy was noticed in the skull, the left humerus and the right <b>side</b> <b>ribs</b> between FDG-PET images and delayed phase bone scintigraphy.

40|$|A hot gas is {{used for}} heating the cavity surface of a mold. Different mold gap sizes were designed. The mold surface {{temperature}} was heated to above the glass transition temperature of the plastic material, and the mold then closed for melt filling. The cavity surface can be heated to 130 °C to assist the melt filling of the microfeatures. Results show that hot gas heating can improve the filling process and achieve 91 % of the high aspect ratio microgrooves (about 640. 38 μm of the maximum of 700 μm). The mold gap size strongly affects the heating speed and heating uniformity. Without surface preheating, the center rib is the highest. When the heating target temperature is 90 °C or 100 °C, the three microribs have a good uniformity of height. However, when the target temperature exceeds 100 °C, the left <b>side</b> <b>rib</b> {{is higher than the}} other ribs...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} two {{case reports}} of living victims, in which imaging {{studies of the}} chest conducted at a medical facility were {{an essential part of}} the medico-legal opinion. The first case was that of a young male hospitalized due to CT evidence of bilateral rib fractions, who claimed to have been assaulted by police officers. The other case was that of a six week old baby hospitalized due to chest X-ray evidence of right hand <b>side</b> <b>rib</b> fractions. The chest X-ray was performed due to one bruise found on the baby’s forehead and two small bruises on the back, which gave rise to suspicions of child abuse. In both cases, expert witnesses in radiology definitively excluded the presence of any fractures. These cases indicate that a new assessment of imaging studies contained in medical records is needed.
