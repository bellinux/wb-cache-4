5000|$|As {{common law}} jurisdictions {{around the world}} {{abolished}} petty treason, the concept of high treason gradually faded, and today {{use of the word}} [...] "treason" [...] generally refers to what was historically known as high treason.

In Canada, the main difference in law between treason and high treason depends on whether the nation is at war.

40|$|POLICY Criminal {{harassment}} may {{consist of}} a series of <b>separate</b> <b>offences.</b> Where that is the case, both a charge of criminal harassment and charges arising from the <b>separate</b> <b>offences</b> may be appropriate. The decision on which charges to prosecute should ensure that the criminal conduct of the accused is appropriately reflected and that an adequate sentencing range is provided to the court. The victim’s safety should always be a priority given the intimidating and volatile nature of this offence. Particular attention should be paid to issues such as bail, victim notification and sentencing. Criminal harassment often involves persistent behaviour over a period of time, and it causes victims to fear for their safety or the safety of persons known to them. Such offences may be referred for alternative measures and specific alternative measures recommended in an Alternative Measures Report, used only in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of Regional or Deputy Regional Crown Counsel. No case of criminal harassment should be considered for alternative measures without consultation with the victim. Given the nature of these cases, Crown Counsel should request an early trial date and should consider the importance of an early trial date in assessing any adjournment application. Crown Counsel or suppor t staff should ensure the victim is aware of available victim assistance programs. The processing of Reports to Crown Counsel must be expedited, as unnecessary delay increases the emotional stress and intimidation experienced by the victim...|$|R
50|$|In such cases, {{the suspect}} {{may have to}} produce a blood or urine sample for analysis. About 27,500 drug use {{verification}} tests and 10,000 drugged driving and drug use tests (two <b>separate</b> <b>offences)</b> were carried out in 2006. If the sample contains drugs or traces of drugs, the person is guilty of a personal use minor drug offence. One of the justifications for this legislation was {{to make it possible}} to find and apprehend people to offer care and treatment at as early a stage as possible. The police have an obligation to inform the social services of all cases of drug use that come to their attention.|$|R
