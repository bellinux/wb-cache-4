5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> grain of truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Common {{manifestations of}} sensory issues include {{numbness}} or painful sensations {{in the arms}} and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on {{the severity of the}} polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others.

25|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils. As the top soils are filled with water and become heavy, slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils. <b>Say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> slope with silt and sand as its top soil and bedrock as its bottom soil. During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand. As the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy, it can start to slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide.|$|E

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to de Candolle's [...] "warring of the species" [...] of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the [...] "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes", so that [...] "One may <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."

2500|$|The atomistic void {{hypothesis}} {{was a response}} to the paradoxes of Parmenides and Zeno, the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments in favor of the idea {{that there can be no}} movement. They held that any movement would require a void—which is nothing—but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was [...] "You <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void". The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is something, for instance light waves.|$|E

The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational.
