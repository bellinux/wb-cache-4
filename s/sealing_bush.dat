The result is a sealless pump with provision for a backup mechanical seal (or close fitting <b>sealing</b> <b>bushing)</b> and an outer housing that withstands full working pressure as a secondary containment means. Included are optimized arrangements of recently recognized innovations, including nonmetallic (eddy current eliminating) shells, performance monitoring instrumentation, laser shaft treatments, and a circulation path to lubricate the bearings and cool the magnet area within the shell...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic tester {{for testing}} {{vibration}} damping seals and bearings is constructed having a hollow shaft extending through the seal or bearing, with the shaft internally supported {{at each end}} by fluid bearings on hollow bosses connected to an interior of an enclosure, with no rolling members connected to the shaft is described. A high pressure working fluid is forced through the hollow bosses to operate the bearings. Additionally, the shaft is provided with a reaction turbine that angularly vents {{a portion of the}} high pressure working fluid in order to rotate the shaft at high speed, up to 40, 000 rpm. The seal or bearing is mounted in a bushing, in turn supported by rods to a shaking device that vibrates the seal or bearing as the shaft is rotated. A plurality of proximity sensors are mounted from outside the enclosure to sense shaft and <b>seal</b> <b>bushing</b> vibrations, and a plurality of pressure ports are disposed in the enclosure to allow sensing of dynamic and static pressures of the testing apparatus...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} experimental rotordynamic coefficients for laminar, smooth <b>bushing</b> oil <b>seals</b> to theoretical predictions from XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal. The experimental results come from a new test rig developed at the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University. The two software programs were developed to predict the static and dynamic characteristics of seals. XLLubeGT is a Reynolds equation based program while XLAnSeal {{is based on a}} bulk-flow Navier- Stokes model that includes temporal and convective acceleration terms. XLAnSeal was used to predict the added-mass terms of the seals since XLLubeGT assumes those terms to be zero or negligible. The data used for input into the two seals code was the actual measured conditions from the test rig. As part of the input parameters, inlet inertia effects and thermal gradients along the seal were included. Both XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal have the capability to analyze straight bore seals with different inlet and outlet clearances ? essentially a tapered seal ? but seal expansion caused by the radial differential pressure across the <b>seal</b> <b>bushing</b> was not included. Theoretical and experimentally determined dynamic characteristics include stiffness, damping, inertia terms and Whirl Frequency Ratio (WFR). Seal static characteristics are also reported. They include: leakage, shaft center line loci and Reynolds numbers. Test conditions include three shaft speeds: 4000, 7000 and 10, 000 rpm, three test pressures: 21, 45 and 69 bar [300, 650, and 1000 psi] and multiple eccentricities from 0. 0 to 0. 7. The results for the dynamic characteristics show good correlation of the experimental data to the theoretical values up to an eccentricity of about 0. 5. At higher eccentricities, the theory generally under-predicts the dynamic characteristics. Inertia terms are greatly under-predicted. The results for the static characteristics also show good correlation to the experimental data, but they also have a tendency to be under-predicted at higher eccentricities...|$|R

He subsequently named the bay after one of his ships. In 2003 {{the remains of a}} garden planted by the French were found and a reserve was created to protect the area, and subsequent archeological sites associated with the expedition have also been located.|$|R
40|$|The {{heart of}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{is a set of}} turbopumps that propel {{cryogenic}} fluids at very high pressures and flow rates, at rotor speeds up to 37, 000 rpm. <b>Bushing</b> <b>seals</b> that cause the flow in the fluid film to become turbulent, by means of a multiplicity of pockets, were shown theoretically not only to inhibit subsynchronous whirl, but to reduce leakage as well. However, experimental data that relate these two desirable characteristics to such parameters as pocket depth, Reynolds number (based on clearance and axial flow rate), and rotating speed are limited. To obtain the required data, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) commissioned Wyle Laboratories to design, build and operate a test rig in which the damping efficacy and leakage reduction of typical candidate seals are to be evaluated...|$|R
5|$|London was {{instrumental}} in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate <b>Bush,</b> <b>Seal,</b> the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine. London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{element of}} the seal is {{significant}} for its relevance to the ship’s namesake, naval aviation, naval service, and the nation. There are six prominent features of the seal, beginning with the 41 white stars, symbolizing the ship’s namesake (the 41st President). The rays of light that appear on the <b>seal’s</b> horizon represent <b>Bush’s</b> concept of a [...] "thousand points of light", wherein he urged Americans to find meaning and reward by serving a purpose higher than themselves. The graphic depiction of the aircraft carrier reflects the carrier, as both a symbol and instrument of American strength as a force for freedom. Above the carrier are the overhead profiles of a TBM Avenger torpedo bomber (representing Bush's days as a Navy pilot), an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter, and an F-35C Lightning II, superimposed one upon the other in reverse chronological order of the individual aircraft's service entry date, and in diminishing scale so each outline is contained within that of the newer aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The {{automation}} on {{front fork}} assembly machine is the project design {{to improve the}} quality as well as productivity of manual machines. Manual operating process consist of lots of errors like parts missing in assembly, parts fitment in the wrong direction, misalignment during assembly, inconsistency in process, etc. We are designing the automated multipurpose machine which will eliminate the errors generated by a manual operating process. Propose machine is also focused to reduce operator fatigue during working. Reduction in operator fatigue, improves working efficiency of operator which will result in an increase in productivity. This proposed automation is the combination of four individual process, namely Oil <b>seal</b> pressing, Guide <b>bush</b> pressing, Washer insertion & Oil seal greasing. The machine is controlled by a programmable logical control (PLC). It consists of number of pneumatic cylinders which will apply for pressing, pick & place & clamping of component, etc. The operator function is just to load & unload the component all the rest process is automatically done by the machine itself. This automation is beneficial in quality & productivity of the product; it will also reduce manpower cost as the proposed automation saves nine men per day...|$|R
5000|$|In late 2015 Vurtego's latest pogo stick, the V4, was introduced. The V4 was {{the first}} major {{redesign}} since the V1. The entire design of the V4 was centered around the new Air Piston, which combined the spacer and piston designs from the V1-V3 in order to increase air volume by 10%. This additional air volume creates a smoother, softer bounce that feels very similar to a trampoline. The V4 jumps higher with less effort than its predecessors. In order to reduce friction during the bounce a smaller o-ring <b>seal</b> and new <b>bushing</b> were implemented. A much harder, 90a urethane donut with sound dampening nubs was integrated into the design, and four additional breather holes were added to the cylinder in order to increase the air flow. The stroke was extended by 1" [...] on the V4 and 3" [...] on the V4 Pro, allowing for riders to jump higher without bottoming out the stroke. The last major update was a round Grip Tip, which provides the same amount of surface area no matter what angle a rider lands at. The V4 is offered in white, and the V4 Pro is offered in a bright green.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increase}} interest in polymeric composite materials for high-performance in many industrial applications. In other words, the tribo-studies on polymeric materials are growing fast to enhance the polymeric products such as bearings, <b>seals,</b> ring and <b>bushes.</b> The current work presents an attempt to study {{the correlation between the}} type of counterface material and frictional heating at the interface surfaces for different, normal loads (23 N, 49 N and 72 N), sliding velocities (0. 18, 1. 3 and 5. 2 m s Ë 1) and interval time (0 - 720 sec). Sliding friction experiments are performed on a pin-on-ring (POR) tribometer under dry contact condition. Interface temperature and friction force were measured simultaneously during sliding of glass fiber reinforced epoxy (GFRE) composite against three different counter face materials, hardened steel (HS), cast iron (CI) and Aluminum alloy (Al). Experimental results showed that the type of counterface material greatly influences both interface temperature and friction coefficient. Higher temperature and friction coefficient were evident when sliding took place against HS surface, compared to sliding against CI and Al under same condition. When sliding took place against HS, the friction coefficient of GFRE composite was about an order of magnitude higher than sliding the GFRE composite against the other counter face materials. Based on the optical microscope graphs, the friction and induced temperature results of GFRE composite are analyzed and discussed...|$|R

It also explored the possibilities of overcoming the negative impacts of floods on sources of safe drinking water and sanitation. The study result shows that, about 54 % of the overall latrines were included ring slab with water <b>seal,</b> pit latrine, <b>bush</b> or hanging toilet of the flood affected people during the flood. Around 19 % of the respondents use to do toilet in the open area during flood. Different NGOs e. g. Jamuna Char Development Project (JCDP), Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), CARE and Red Crescent Society of Bangladesh works for rehabilitation of the flood affected people and give early warning on the flood. Depending on location and sanitation conditions, drinking water sources may be contaminated by flood water during flood and many waterborne diseases can spread out like Cholera, Dysentery, Diarrhoea, diseases of the skin, Typhoid etc. meantime. The conducted survey also reports that, drinking water and sanitation condition is not dependable (on the commentary of 64. 8 % of the responders). Therefore, the flood affected people of Bhuapur are usually underprivileged from appropriate sanitation facility on flood. They somehow conform themselves while a chain of problems strikes hardly during flood...|$|R
