5|$|In October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian {{soldiers}} on Lissa while Hoste <b>searched</b> <b>in</b> vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic. The island {{had been left}} in the command of two midshipmen, James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew {{the entire population of}} the island into the central mountains along with their supplies. The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, Port St. George. The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned. The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the third-rate ship of the line HMS Montagu.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Strachan's {{squadron}} {{was ordered}} to prepare for sea during December at Plymouth, but like Warren's force, Strachan was trapped by strong winds in Cawsand Bay and could not sail until mid-January. Strachan's orders were to sail for Saint Helena and search for signs of the French squadrons. If their whereabouts could not be discovered, Strachan was to join the squadron under Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham detailed to invade the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. During February and March Strachan <b>searched</b> <b>in</b> vain, eventually receiving the news that Willaumez had anchored in neutral Salvador in Brazil during April. Steering northwest {{in the hope of}} intercepting the French squadron, Strachan was hampered by the presence of HMS St George, which proved too slow for a flying squadron. Returning to Plymouth, Strachan detached St George and Centaur, which had been made the flagship of the Rochefort blockade squadron and was given HMS Belleisle, HMS Audacious and HMS Montagu as replacements, as well as two frigates.|$|E

40|$|In [1] {{we address}} the problem of "searching in domains" in order to locate a buggy element. The domain itself is {{structured}} such that we can query parts of it, and, if the queried part contains a buggy element, continue <b>searching</b> <b>in</b> that part alone. If the answer to the query is negative, then the part has no buggy elements, and the searching process continues checking the complementary part of the domain. We ilisturate how automatic bug elimination can be done by mapping program sematics and strucutre to a <b>search</b> <b>in</b> domain problem. Specifically, we apply pre-postconditions to the flow graph and diffrent other control graphs and program slicing to the D-U graph to obtain a <b>search</b> <b>in</b> domain problem.

40|$|Extract] Studies of the {{organization}} of <b>search</b> <b>in</b> ants suggest that individual and colonylevel patterns are related to foraging ecology and may be adaptive [1, 2]. The organization of <b>search</b> <b>in</b> termites has received far less attention, in part because of their cryptic, subterranean foraging habits. <b>Search</b> <b>in</b> subterranean termites involves the construction of a gallery system, a series of branching tunnels in the soil that brings termites into contact with food.

40|$|Summary. When private {{information}} {{is stored in}} databases that are {{under the control of}} others, the only possible way to protect it, is to encrypt it before storing it. In order to efficiently retrieve the data, a search mechanism is needed that still works over the encrypted data. In this chapter an overview of several search strategies is given. Some add meta-data to the database and do the <b>searching</b> only <b>in</b> the metadata, others <b>search</b> <b>in</b> the data itself or use secret sharing to solve the problem. Each strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages. 13. 1 Why Should We <b>Search</b> <b>in</b> Encrypted Data? In a chapter about <b>searching</b> <b>in</b> encrypted data we should first ask ourselves the questions: Why should we want to protect our data using encryption? Why not use access control? Why should we want to <b>search</b> <b>in</b> encrypted data? Why not decrypt the data first and then <b>search</b> <b>in</b> it? Access control is a perfect way to protect your data as long as you trust th...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design a laboratory experiment for an infinite-horizon sequential committee <b>search</b> model <b>in</b> order to test some of the implications obtained by the model in Albrecht, Anderson, and Vroman (2010) (AAV). We find that, compared with single-agent search, the search duration is longer for committee search under the unanimity rule, but is shorter for committee <b>search</b> <b>in</b> which at least one vote is required to stop <b>searching.</b> <b>In</b> addition, according to estimates from round-based search decisions, subjects are more likely to vote to stop <b>searching</b> <b>in</b> committee <b>search</b> than <b>in</b> single-agent <b>search.</b> This confirms that agents are less picky <b>in</b> committee <b>search.</b> Overall, the experimental outcomes are consistent with the implications suggested by the AAV model. However, despite the prediction from the AAV model, we could not obtain a significant outcome in relation to the size order of the probabilities of voting to stop <b>searching</b> <b>in</b> committee <b>search</b> for the various plurality voting rules...|$|R

25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be <b>searched</b> <b>in</b> about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
