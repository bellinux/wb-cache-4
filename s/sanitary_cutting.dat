40|$|While oaks {{contribute}} to the ecology and economy of temperate lowland forests, recruitment into larger size classes is generally scarce. Ungulate herbivory is a limiting factor for tree recruitment, thus natural structures protecting against ungulates may be important for recruitment success. We studied oak recruitment in relation to coarse woody debris (CWD) in the Bialowieza National Park, Poland, {{one of the last}} remaining reference sites for undisturbed temperate lowland forests in Europe that contains the full natural assemblage of large ungulate species and their predators. We compared two contrasting management types: one that excludes all forestry activities (the strict reserve) and one where <b>sanitary</b> <b>cutting</b> and removal of bark-beetle infested Picea abies occurs to prevent further spread. We sampled 4 m wide transects (19 ha in total, of which 15. 8 ha in the strict reserve) and recorded sapling height and sapling browsing, distance from, height of and CWD encirclement, distance to and diameter of mature oaks, tree composition, distance to and diameter of nearest trees, canopy openness and cover of herbs, mosses, bare soil and litter in an equal number of plots with and without saplings. We found 161 oak saplings (8. 5 /ha). CWD was predominantly formed by P. abies. Sapling plots contained more often CWD than plots without saplings. Also, the distance to CWD was smaller and the CWD encirclement was higher in sapling plots, while canopy cover did not differ. Sapling height increased and sapling browsing decreased with increasing presence of CWD. Both CWD and recruitment beyond 50 cm were reduced in the managed zone. Our study shows that CWD plays an essential role for the recruitment of oaks in old-growth temperate forest systems, predominantly via protection against ungulate browsing. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>cutting</b> of infested trees, a common management practice in temperate forests, prevents the natural accumulation of CWD and so can be counter-productive for the recruitment of appreciated species.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the scientific achievements and heritage of Alexey Ivanovich Buzykin, a well-known Siberian forest researcher, the Honored Forester of the Russian Federation, who contributed remarkably {{to improve the}} knowledge of the forests of Siberia. He was the first to explore the possibility to increase Siberian forest productivity by its scientifically justified regulation. He accurately estimated forest productivity responses to increasing soil nitrogen using a large amount of data, studied structural, species composition, and density changes that occur in young mixed stands after tending felling, revealed stand productivity dependence on stand density, and showed how structure and dynamics of forest generations are manifested through vegetation succession. Along with studies of natural ecosystems, Alexey I. Buzykin did large-scale experiments on managing forest ecosystems by different types of <b>sanitary</b> <b>cutting,</b> application of fertilizers to soil, regulation of cold soil thermal regime, and by establishment of Scots pine, spruce and larch plantations covering a range of stand densities. To achieve his forest management objectives, he developed original forest research methods, among them methodologies to assess seedling and sapling amounts, to estimate forest response to fertilizer application, and to classify young forest stands by formation type. He also developed tables of small-sized young tree trunk volumes. During his last years, Alexey I. Buzykin, in collaboration with other researchers, accomplished a series of theoretical studies. He suggested that mathematical tools should be used for interpreting different kinds of events and changes occurring in forest ecosystems including the use of phenomenological models of stand establishment processes, stand growth models, forest succession models, and other models. The results of Alexey I. Buzykin’s research studies are still very important regarding large-scale forestry activities. They have been used for many years to improve forest management practices in Siberia and have been considered in the forest use normative documents of the federal level. A list of Alexey I. Buzykin’s major research works concludes the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogen}} Gremmeniella abietina causes {{severe damage}} to native Pinus sylvestris and introduced Pinus contorta var. latifolia in Sweden. The recent G. abietina outbreak in 2001 – 2003, {{caused by the}} large tree type (LTT), affected at least 480, 000 ha of middle-aged P. sylvestris stands and forced Swedish forest owners to sanitary clear-cut large areas of valuable forests. There was, however, little knowledge of survival and growth loss of infected trees and risks involved in replanting P. sylvestris in the G. abietina-infected slash. In this thesis, G. abietina disease incidence on P. sylvestris seedlings planted after sanitation felling was studied, with and without removal of infected P. sylvestris slash. Furthermore, survival and vitality of G. abietina in the slash was studied by spore germination tests of pycnidia collected from infected slash at regular intervals. One year after planting, G. abietina pycnidia were found on 32 % of the control seedlings and total infection, including stem cankers, reached 44 %. Removal of infected slash {{reduced the number of}} infected seedlings by 50 % and seedling mortality by 27 %, one year after planting. The vitality of G. abietina in the slash was as high in pycnidia collected in 13 - to 18 -months-old slash as in pycnidia collected in fresh slash. It is recommended to wait at least two years after sanitary fellings before replanting with P. sylvestris. To improve the accuracy of predictions of mortality and growth losses in infected, pole-sized P. sylvestris stands, mortality, diameter growth and insect colonisation were monitored and related to crown defoliation in four 40 -year-old stands in 2001 – 2005. Of the killed trees, 84 % were at least 90 % defoliated the year before they died and trees with less than 90 % defoliation were only killed in the initial phase of the outbreak. A majority of the trees were killed directly by G. abietina whereas less than one third died after colonisation by pine shoot beetle (Tomicus piniperda), a pest that was mainly found on dead trees or trees with at least 95 % defoliation. A greater fraction of small trees died and generally did so more rapidly than larger trees. Regression analysis indicated that a mean defoliation of 2 / 3 of the crown resulted in an average loss of 50 % in diameter increment. Based on this study, a defoliation limit of 75 – 80 % is recommended for <b>sanitary</b> <b>cutting</b> of P. sylvestris trees in the initial phases of an outbreak, and a limit of ca. 90 % for trees that survive the initial phases of an outbreak. The interest in the productive P. contorta as an alternative to P. sylvestris is currently increasing in Sweden. To study the resistance of P. contorta to LTT G. abietina, seedlings of P. contorta and P. sylvestris were planted in gaps of an infected 40 -year-old P. sylvestris stand in 2005. After two years, 45 % of the P. contorta seedlings and 32 % of the P. sylvestris seedlings were infected. However, mortality was lower and the mean length of infected tissue on surviving seedlings significantly shorter in P. contorta (3. 9 cm) compared to P. sylvestris (10. 4 cm). Furthermore, 47 % of the P. contorta seedlings had developed new leader shoots in 2007, compared to 19 % of the P. sylvestris seedlings. Histopathological examinations of infected shoots showed that both P. contorta and P. sylvestris produce ligno-suberised boundaries that are involved in the active defence in the shoots, preventing major crown dieback. The results indicate that P. contorta is more resistant to LTT G. abietina than P. sylvestris...|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{considering}} {{if the situation}} in Romania could be changed. The basis for a mitigation policy would be to support “future trees” and reduce stand density in an early stage, since it would improve productivity according to our results. This would provide more wood to the market without depressing the forest stock. However, these objectives cannot be reached by the forest manager without a legal basis. It is mainly the current technical norms that prohibit mitigation in Romania. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>cuttings,</b> essentially implemented to remove trees damaged by bark beetles and windthrows, cannot be in excess of 15  % of the standing volume, which is too low to be economical. Therefore, cuttings are either not realised or push owners to go illegally beyond 15  %. The freezing period should also be abandoned as it prohibits harvests {{at the moment when}} trees reached their maximum economical value. Thus, {{it is not only the}} prescriptions upon thinning in the earlier age but also the “freeze” between 100 and 125  years that hinder mitigation. In addition, the management plans should not perpetuate existing growth rates, but be based on achievable growth under best practice of management, and the burden of proof for sustainability needs to be brought by local management and not by the government. In summary mitigation must start at the governmental regulations and constraints. The problems that were presented here for Romanian forests may exist in other regions of the world and may be considered globally in countries with constrained management rules as well as countries having experienced historic over-use.|$|R
30|$|In Romania, {{the forest}} law (Forest Code 2008) {{and the system}} of 8 volumes of {{technical}} norms regulate the management of all forests, irrespective of ownership. Boișoara forest management is therefore prescribed in detail by law. The thinning operations should start when forest stand mean DBH is[*]>[*] 10  cm and canopy cover is at least 90  %. However, the stand volume (not number of trees) can only be reduced, according to the official technical norms, by a maximum of 18  % for spruce and a maximum of 17  % for beech every 10  years, which of course can hardly be operationalised in situ. This likely results in removing the “best” trees to make the operation viable. By law, at 2 / 3 of the rotation period (generally at age 75), the stand enters into a 25  years “freeze” period, where no forest operation is permitted, besides <b>sanitary</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Eventually, at age 100 stands can enter into a phase of final harvest, but only 1 / 3 – 1 / 7 of the volume can be harvested by law every 10  years, depending on the ecological conditions and stand composition. Harvest may be by clear cutting (but only for pure spruce stands) or by selective cutting. Thus, {{at the time of}} its final harvest the stand may be as old as 170  years, when trees reached[*]>[*] 50  cm DBH, and most stems are rotten in the core or have red heart. Trees are cut to the length of healthy stems (rotten stem bases are left in the forest if there is no demand for firewood from the local communities) and are generally transported as long wood to the main roads.|$|R
40|$|Među širokim rasponom čimbenika koji definiraju odumiranje stabala hrasta lužnjaka, najznačajniju ulogu zauzima upravo oštećenost krošanja koja predstavlja prvi vidljivi simptom slabljenja vitalnosti stabla. Osim toga, u šumarskoj je praksi oštećenost krošnje ključni kriterij pri doznaci stabala u redovnim i sanitarnim sječama. Cilj je ovoga rada bio istražiti dinamiku oštećenosti krošanja stabala hrasta lužnjaka i utjecaja oštećenosti krošnje na prirast temeljnice tijekom duljeg razdoblja u dvije najvažnije šumske zajednice hrasta lužnjaka u Hrvatskoj. Istraživanja su obavljena na trajnim pokusnim plohama u zajednici hrasta lužnjaka i običnoga graba na gredi (II-G- 10) i u zajednici hrasta lužnjaka s velikom žutilovkom u nizi (II-G- 20). Obuhvaćeno je ukupno 38 pokusnih ploha od kojih je na 13 obavljena ponovna izmjera i procjena oštećenosti krošanja s intervalima izmjere od 9 do 17 godina. Udio stabala sa značajno oštećenom krošnjom naglo se povećava nakon starosti sastojine od oko 70 godina. Najveći intenzitet odumiranja (70 % u II-G- 10 i 50 % u II-G- 20) zabilježen je kod stabala s oštećenošću krošnje preko 60 %. U sastojinama V. i VI. dobnog razreda, stabla sa značajno oštećenom krošnjom imala su i značajno manji prirast temeljnice u usporedbi s vitalnim stablima sličnih prsnih promjera i širina krošnje. Udio značajno oštećenih stabala, kao i utjecaj oštećenja krošnje na prirast temeljnice, vrlo su slični u obje istraživane zajednice. Međutim, zabrinjava činjenica da je u sastojinama II-G- 20 u samo jednom desetljeću evidentirano značajno povećanje sa 26 % na 70 % udjela značajno oštećenih lužnjakovih stabala, pa se postavlja pitanje u kojem će se smjeru dalje razvijati ove sastojine. Samo se nastavkom motrenja i daljnjim istraživanjima može razlučiti radi li se o velikim oscilacijama u toj šumskoj zajednici ili ipak o početku nepovratnoga procesa propadanja sastojina. The crown {{damage of}} a tree has a very {{prominent}} place among the broad spectrum of factors defining the pedunculate oak (Quercus roburL.) decline and dieback, {{largely due to the}} fact that it represents the first visible symptom of the decline in tree‘s vitality. Besides, crown damage is a key factor for the selection of trees with high risk of dying during the <b>sanitary</b> and salvage <b>cuttings,</b> in order to salvage high value timber that would be otherwise lost or severely degraded when the tree dies. Aim of this contribution is to investigate dynamics of crown damage of pedunculate oak trees, as well as the effect of the crown damage on tree’s basal area increment during longer time period in two most important types of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia. Research was done on permanent experimental plots situated in the stands of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam (II-G- 10) and stands of pedunculate oak and Genista elata (II-G- 20). In total, 38 permanent experimental plots were used, out of which 13 were re-measured with intervals of 9 to 17 years (Table 1). In first measurement, all trees on plots were permanently tagged, and map of tree locations and crown projections was made. Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height and height to crown base. Crown length was calculated as the difference between the total tree height and height to crown base, while the crown ratio was calculated as the ratio of crown length and total tree height. From the map of horizontal crown projections the average crown width was calculated as a mean of the maximal and minimal crown diameters. Assessment of the crown damage was done according to the methodology of the ICP Forests Programme, whereby the trees were tallied into following five crown damage (CD) classes: 0 ( 25 %) and stand age was examined for the 33 plots of forest type II-G- 10 spanning almost entire rotation length of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia (II. to VII. age class). Linear regression with logarithmic transformation of independent variable (stand age) was used for this analysis. According to the model, significant increase of severely damaged trees occurs after the stand age of 70 years (Figure 2 A). The stands in the type II-G- 20 departed significantly from the model in the first measurement, with only 26 % of severely damaged trees compared to 76 % in stands of II-G- 10. By the second measurement, however, these plots also conformed to the behavior predicted by the model (Figure 2 B), due to the deterioration of the overall crown condition. Distributions of oak trees by the CD classes in two measurements (Figure 3) reveal the direction of the crown damage dynamics, which is in more detail presented in the Figure 4. In both forest types, the change in crown class of the oak trees was predominantly in the direction of the worsening crown health status. Negative trend is more pronounced in the II-G- 20 forest type. According to the CD classes recorded in the first measurement (Figure 5), decline intensity was most pronounced in the CD class 3, from which 70 % and 50 % of trees in forest types II-G- 10 and II-G- 20, respectively, died off by the second measurement. This result provides further foundation for the use of the CD assessments in the day-to-day forestry as a reliable indicator of the tree’s imminent death. Effect of crown damage on the basal area increment of oak trees was examined through: (i) the regression analyses of basal area increment per year per tree over DBH (Figure 6) and crown width (Figure 7), comparison of distributions of healthy and severely damaged trees over basal area increment classes (Figure 8), and by comparison of median values of basal area increment of healthy and severely damaged trees by forest types and stand age classes (Figure 9). Crown damage was found to have a significant impact on the basal area increment of pedunculate oak trees, with severely damaged trees having significantly lower basal area increment compared to healthy trees of the similar dimensions. These differences were very similar for both forest types...|$|R

The {{research}} problem, {{raised by}} Croatian Forests Ltd., Forest Administration Delnice, is the frequent discrepancy in planned versus realised yields during selecting cutting in fir-beach forests. This discrepancy between planned and realised wood assortments structure {{and at the same}} time between revenues, is significant for fir-beach stands affected by fir trees dieback. The result is that performed sylvicultural activities in such disturbed stands, in order to get timber assortments, have questionable cost-effectiveness, and in some cases are fully unprofitable. The key point in process of calculating planned values according to timber assortments are so called “Assortment tables”, empirical models for estimation of timber assortments structure, which are definitely inappropriate for current climatic and disturbed stand conditions. Hence, the aim of this research is to study existing Assortment tables for fir, which are used by the Production department of Forest Administration branch Delnice, in order to satisfy criteria for sufficiently reliable planning in the production of timber assortments. Material and methods. In order to ensure quality and uniformity of research from the be ginning, the detailed plan of field activities was designed and agreed for implementati on with Production department. On the research area in target Forest management un i ts, a few forest compartments were chosen for field data acquisition each year. In each of selected forest compartments it was required to collect data for around 100 marked fir tr ees, which were felled during selecting cutting. Diameter distribution of those hundred tr ees should represent fir diameter distribution of whole compartment. Each of those fir tr ees got measured diameter at breast height, total height, height of the first branch, and all bucked timber assortments. From those data we got volumes (per trees and per timber assortment). Ultimately, assortment structure data were collected from seven forest co mpartments. Each compartment has two dataset, one representing produced timber assortments (done by foresters) versus planned assortment structure (calculated using assortments tables). Concerning research aim, two hypotheses (H 1, H 2) were constructed. H 1 states: If planned and realised timber assortments production from forest compartment significantly affected by fir dieback is compared, than statistically significant differences between planned and realised values according to assortments classes will be confirmed. H 2 states: If timber assortments production is compared according to three general health categories of fir stands, than statistically significant differences between same assortment classes will be confirmed. For testing H 1, One-way ANOVA was used together with Test of Homogeneity of Variances. Analysed variables are veneer logs volume, sawlogs (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd class), pulp-wood and firewood, and volume of wood residues (recovered wood). Pulp-wood and firewood are in the same category, because only 14 pieces of firewood were measured in whole sample. Wood residue category refers to timber assortments thicker than 16 cm and left on forest floor because of its uselessness for technical purposes (damaged, decayed). Statistical significance of differences between samples of planned and realised volume according to assortment classes was analysed. Testing homogeneity of variances between these two samples showed in most cases that variances of the same assortment classes’ volumes are not homogenous. Considering this findings, Independent-samples T test was used for analyzing H 1. Analog to H 1 testing, the same tests were used for H 2 analyzing. Forest compartments which were compared represented two of three health categories of fir stands (stands of moderately damaged health condition were missing). Those two compared groups of data were unequal in size, one consisting of data acquired from 5 forest compartments, and another of data acquired from two forest compartments. This research was partially extended with sampling of fallen fir trees to get a clue about insect and pest species which could be one of main factors causing fir dieback. So, in the 2008 woody samples collected from fallen trees in one forest compartment, were analysed in CFRI laboratory. Research area. In wider context, research area represents fir-beach stands of Gorski Kotar region, and narrower area is determined by boundaries of Forest Administration Branch Delnice i. e. forest area affected by intensive fir trees dieback. The stands in focus represent main fir-beach forest community in Gorski Kotar, Abieti-Fagetum illyricum Ht. Research activities on field data acquisition were started in forest management unit “Brloško”. Data about forest compartments included in research are presented in Table 1. Results of research and discussion. Firstly, the results of H 1 are presented and discussed. Statistically significant differences between planned and realised volumes were confirmed for veneer assortment, for all forest compartments except one. The results were expected because five of seven compartments are considered as stands of significantly disturbed health condition, where possibility for production of high quality timber assortments from fir trees is minimal. Another fact considerably affects on differences between planned vs realised timber assortment structure is assortments tables, according to which each tree with dbh higher than lowest threshold for veneer class gets certain veneer volume from tree volume. Veneer volume participates in the whole sample of produced timber assortment volume with 0. 59 %, and concerning forest compartments from 0. 00 % to maximum 3. 01 % (see Table 2). T-test results for 1 st class saw logs confirmed discrepancies between realised and planned quantities for all forest compartments except compartment no. 15 in forest management unit “Brloško” (t value is 0. 80). Volume of 1 st class saw logs participates in the whole sample of produced timber assortment volume with 5. 85 % to 35. 95 %, concerning forest compartments. Different from previous, t-test for 2 nd class saw logs confirmed discrepancies between realised and planned quantities for three forest compartments, two representing category of good health condition, and one category of worse health condition (table 3). Volume of 2 nd class saw logs participates in the whole sample of produced timber assortment volume with 13. 93 % to 31. 28 %, concerning forest compartments. Testing volume of 3 rd class saw logs confirmed discrepancies between realised and planned quantities for four forest compartments (two in category of good health condition, and two in category of worse health). This assortment class after pulp-wood and firewood has the highest share in whole sample volume of assortment classes. Volume of 3 rd class saw logs participates in the whole sample of produced timber assortment volume with 16. 29 % to 36. 90 %, concerning forest compartments. The most frequent timber assortment is pulp-wood and firewood category, leading by number of logs. This fact is in line with disturbed wood quality of standing fir trees which are in process of dieback or completely dead trees in the felling moment. Analysing discrepancies between realised and planned quantities for this assortment category, tests confirmed statistically significant difference for all forest compartments except one. Tested wood volume of the category participates in the whole sample of produced timber assortment volume with 6. 38 % to 54. 41 %. Recovered wood (i. e. wood residue) assortment is problematic because of its technical inapplicability. This assortment category consisted of small number of pieces, and according to assortment tables each tree gets certain volume of the assortment (so called wood waste). This discrepancy is supported with T-test results confirming significant differences between realised and planned quantities for all forest compartments. Hence, further consideration of the recovered wood assortment was cancelled. Regarding to obtained results, it can be concluded that H 1 is accepted because statistically significant differences have been confirmed for majority of tested combinations. Testing H 2 by ANOVA and T-test, for each assortment class were confirmed differences between assortment volume variances comparing two health categories of stands (table 4). Other words, the relationship between health categories of fir stands and realised assortment structure has been confirmed. Concerning this, in process of timber assortment production planning more attention on assortments tables should be done (carefully choosing and constructing new ones adapted for different health categories). Conclusions. This project was aimed to give additional contribution in resolving discrepancy between planned and realised timber assortment production from fir-beech stands with different degree of fir trees dieback. The main reason for this discrepancy, especially in case of same health category stands, most probably lays on current assortments tables which were constructed in 90 ’is and updated a few times mostly on empirical basis. Another reason, but with considerably smaller influence on final production plan than assortment tables is inappropriate tariff selection. Performed statistical tests confirmed significant differences between planned and realised timber assortment quantities in case of veneer. And such results are in strong correlation with worse health condition of the majority ofresearched forest compartments (except the ones in f. m. unit “Široka Draga”). Tests have been confirmed H 1 on other timber assortments mostly for 1 st and 3 rd class of saw logs, pulp-wood and firewood category, and for 2 nd class saw logs haven’t. Worse wood quality of fir trees from stands with significant fir dieback resulted in the statistically significant differences between planned and realised values of pulp-wood and firewood assortment volumes. Recovered wood category hasn’t been further analysed because of quite a small sample collected on the field. Testing H 2 on realised production data of the same timber assortment types between forest compartments belonging different health category, significant discrepancies in quantities of assortment volumes between two observed health categories have been confirmed. Final recommendation or question to forest Management is “Would it be possible to adjust spatio-temporally the realisation of <b>sanitary</b> selecting <b>cutting</b> in fir-beach forests on yearly basis, in order to minimise timber production costs?...|$|R
