50|$|For {{those who}} are {{traveling}} outside Japan for longer than 1 year, are required to have a re-entry permit. Normally, the re-entry permit will be applied to a passport {{in the form of}} a <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>sticker.</b> For those who do not have a valid passport, a booklet type Re-entry Permit will be issued at the same time as the re-entry Permit stamp issues.|$|E
30|$|A {{flexible}} {{reflective material}} {{in the form of}} a commercial polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film coated with reflecting aluminum, which is a <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>sticker,</b> with a thickness 0.1  mm and a reflecting rate ≥[*] 90 % (purchased from Benefit K&J associate Co., Ltd., Thailand), was used as a solar reflector. The PET reflector film was carefully mounted on the smooth surface of the metal sheet to maintain a precise solar reflection to the focal line along the parabolic trough.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{conventional}} painted designs {{and the recent}} popularity for stencil graffiti, these new works are essentially a form of poster art. Smaller designs are typically monochrome photocopies (some {{of which may be}} hand coloured) while others have been printed as <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>stickers</b> which are often affixed to roadside traffic signs.|$|R
50|$|Some artists {{also use}} <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>stickers</b> {{as a quick}} way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within {{graffiti}} culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.|$|R
5000|$|From 1964 to 1967, {{the company}} had a license from the National Football League to produce trading cards of leading {{football}} players, while Topps produced cards for the rival American Football League. The company also produced a set of 55 <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>stickers</b> of Marvel Comics superheroes, as well as trading cards based upon [...] "World War II," [...] "Men of the Green Berets," [...] "The Story of Robert F. Kennedy," [...] Daktari (TV show), and many others. It briefly produced novelty baseball items, including baseball cards.|$|R
50|$|Between 1993 and 2012, <b>self-adhesive</b> {{validation}} <b>stickers</b> {{in primary}} colours were issued annually to every car that had valid road tax and insurance and had passed its latest biannual safety and emissions test. The stickers included {{the registration number}} {{in the form of}} a bar code, and changed colour every year on a three-year cycle: red, blue and yellow.|$|R
50|$|R. Stanton Avery (January 13, 1907 - December 12, 1997) was an inventor, most {{known for}} {{creating}} <b>self-adhesive</b> labels (modern <b>stickers).</b> In 1935 he founded {{what is now}} the Avery Dennison Corporation.|$|R
40|$|An {{opportunistic}} rubella screening programme in {{a general}} practice is described. <b>Self-adhesive</b> <b>stickers</b> placed on the medical records envelope were used to alert staff and to record information on rubella status. Out of the total target population of women aged between 10 and 40 years, three sample cohorts were audited: the 15, 20 and 30 years age groups. Between {{the first and second}} audits a practice policy on rubella immunization screening was implemented over a period of 11 months. After 11 months the proportions of 20 - and 30 -year-olds whose rubella status was known had risen from 50 % to 88 % and from 67 % to 87 % respectively. For the 15 -year-old cohort, which would have been included in the schools immunization programme, the increase was negligible. Serological testing in the practice identified 24 women (7 % of all those tested) who were seronegative and to date 19 of these women have been vaccinated. The screening method was shown to be simple and effective and to involve little extra staff time...|$|R
40|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{recognizing}} themselves in a mirror, which {{is considered to be}} demonstrated by passing the mark test. Mirror self-recognition capacity has been found in just a few mammals having very large brains and only in one bird, the magpie (Pica pica). The results obtained in magpies have enormous biological and cognitive implications because the fact that magpies were able to pass the mark test meant that this species is at the same cognitive level with great apes, that mirror self-recognition has evolved independently in the magpie and great apes (which diverged 300 million years ago), and that the neocortex (which is not present in the bird’s brains) is not a prerequisite for mirror self-recognition as previously believed. Here, we have replicated the experimental design used on magpies to determine whether jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are also capable of mirror self-recognition by passing the mark test. We found that our nine jackdaws showed a very high interest towards the mirror and exhibited self-contingent behavior as soon as mirrors were introduced. However, jackdaws were not able to pass the mark test: both sticker-directed actions and sticker removal were performed with a similar frequency in both the cardboard (control) and the mirror conditions. We conclude that our jackdaws’ behaviour raises non-trivial questions about the methodology used in the avian mark test. Our study suggests that the use of <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>stickers</b> on sensitive throat feathers may open the way to artefactual results because birds might perceiv...|$|R
