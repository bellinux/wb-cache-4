40|$|Pigs {{from four}} sire lines were {{allocated}} {{to a series}} of low energy (LE, 3. 15 to 3. 21 Mcal ME/kg) corn-soybean meal-based diets with 16 % wheat midds or high energy diets (HE, 3. 41 to 3. 45 Mcal ME/kg) with 4. 5 to 4. 95 % choice white grease. All diets contained 6 % DDGS. The HE and LE diets of each of the four phases were formulated to have equal lysine:Mcal ME ratios. Barrows (N = 2, 178) and gilts (N = 2, 274) were fed either high energy (HE) or low energy (LE) diets from 27 kg BW to target BWs of 118, 127, 131. 5 and 140. 6 kg. Carcass primal and subprimal cut weights were collected. The cut weights and carcass measurements were fitted to allometric functions (Y = A CWB) of carcass weight. The significance of diet, sex or sire line with A and B was evaluated by linearizing the equations by log to log transformation. The effect of diet on A and B did not interact with sex or sire line. Thus, the final model was B) where Diet = − 0. 5 for the LE and 0. 5 for HE diets and A and B are sire line-sex specific parameters. cut weight = (1 +bD(Diet)) A(CW Diet had no affect on loin, Boston butt, picnic, baby back rib, or <b>sparerib</b> weights (p> 0. 10, bD = − 0. 003, − 0. 0029, 0. 0002, 0. 0047, − 0. 0025, respectively).

50|$|Christmas is, as {{everywhere}} else, {{an occasion}} celebrated with food. Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas smörgåsbord (julbord), {{a display of}} several Christmas food items.

40|$|The KSU Lean Value Marketing Program was {{developed}} to assist producers in understanding {{the quality of their}} market hogs by marketing on a wholesale cut basis. The program also allowed analysis of the current marketing practices of the producer in relation to sort loss.

Wholesale cuts for the 34 farms indicated that percent loins, hams, and <b>spareribs</b> represented the greatest portion of carcass value, whereas percent pork fat and bellies most accurately predicted the farms with low value carcasses. Backfat measurements and wholesale cut marketing indicated a large variation in genetic quality of pigs on swine farms in Kansas.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of T. gondii in commercial cuts of pork (ham, tenderloin, <b>spareribs</b> and arm picnic) by PCR and bioassay from experimentally infected pigs, was evaluated.

All animals from G 1 were positive by at least one or both tests, and all control animals were negative. T. gondii was identified in pork by mouse bioassay and PCR in 27 / 40 (67. 5 %) and in 9 / 40 (22. 5 %) of the evaluated samples, respectively.
