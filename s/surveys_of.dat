Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> streams and other water bodies.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. <b>Surveys</b> <b>of</b> the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E
