5|$|Law was {{the subject}} Gregorson Campbell chose to <b>study</b> <b>after</b> {{completing}} his education but his primary interest was folklore, a topic that fascinated him from his college days. In 1831 he was appointed Secretary to the Glasgow University Ossianic Society. He secured a licence to preach from the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1858 {{but was unable to}} commence work as a clergyman at that time owing to ill health. His recuperation was spent beginning his collection of folklore stories.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the <b>study</b> <b>after</b> The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's time at Cambridge {{had been}} one of {{outstanding}} success; his tutor Professor FW Maitland, himself one of the most eminent legal minds of the time, described Smuts as the most brilliant Law student he had ever taught. With testimonials such as this, in summer 1894 Smuts was able to persuade the Ebden trustees to award him £100 for a further year's <b>study.</b> <b>After</b> a short holiday in Strasbourg, spent studying English conveyancing and German philosophy, Smuts returned to England. For a short time he contemplated moving to the Netherlands to seek a Dutch degree, but by October 1894 he had instead decided to read for the Bar. In December 1894 he passed the Honours Examination of the Inns of Court, passing first in his year. Smuts was called to the Middle Temple and soon received an offer of a fellowship in Law from his old college, Christ's. The possibility of a distinguished legal career in England, whether in practice or in academia, now lay before him. Instead, he rejected both paths; in June 1895, as his Ebden funding came to an end, the homesick Smuts returned to the Cape, determined to make his future there.|$|E

When he was four years old, his family moved to rural Low Hampton, New York. Miller was educated at home by his mother until the age of nine, when he attended the newly established East Poultney District School. Miller is not known to have undertaken any type of formal <b>study</b> <b>after</b> the age of eighteen, though he continued to read widely and voraciously.

25|$|Ingres {{was born}} in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, France, the first of seven {{children}} (five of whom survived infancy) of Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres (1755–1814) and his wife Anne Moulet (1758–1817). His father was a successful jack-of-all-trades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician; his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young Ingres received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a <b>study</b> <b>after</b> an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786 he attended the local school École des Frères de l'Éducation Chrétienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and {{the closing of the}} school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity.|$|E

After her parents' divorce, when Lin was seven years old, she lived with her mother, who took her to visit {{relatives}} in Japan every year.

Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody titers clearly above 50ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy. Blood samples were taken twice a month, and booster injections were given when antibody titers declined below 50ng/mL in women who wished to continue using the vaccine. At {{the completion of the}} <b>study</b> <b>after</b> 1224 menstrual cycles observed, only 1 pregnancy occurred in a woman having an antibody titer level above 50ng/mL, and 26 pregnancies occurred among women who had titers below 50ng/mL.|$|E
25|$|The first {{academic}} degrees {{were all}} law degrees- {{and the first}} law degrees were doctorates. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the glossators of the 11th century, which were schools of law. The first European university, that of Bologna, was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the glossator school in that city. It is from this history that {{it is said that}} the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century. And at the University of Bologna from its founding in the 12th century {{until the end of the}} 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive <b>study</b> <b>after</b> secondary school. The rising of the doctor of philosophy to its present level is a modern novelty. At its origins, a doctorate was simply a qualification for a guild—that of teaching law.|$|E
25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{is said to}} {{mark the}} {{transition}} from late-antique to Medieval literary <b>study.</b> <b>After</b> a period of decreased interest in the literature, the practice of mythography was picked up again in what {{is thought to be}} the 7th century by the so-called Vatican Mythographers. All three writers borrow Fulgentius’s methods in order to search the classical myths for obscured meaning. However, it was during the Carolingian period, from the 8th through to the 10th centuries, that Fulgentius’s work reached the height of its popularity. He came to be admired as one of the founding fathers of mythographic writing, and he was praised for uniting classical pagan literature and Christian teachings. This admiration led to the emergence of Fulgentian scholarship. The practice of differentiating between the author’s intention and the deeper meaning of a piece of literature -- carried to the extreme by Fulgentius -- provided the framework for the commentaries of this period. The Mythologies in particular proved to be an essential storehouse of resources for the Medieval commentators who carried on his tradition of discussing classical poetry in moral terms. Further, his exotic language and use of rare words seemed to influence the writing style of a number of poets throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E
