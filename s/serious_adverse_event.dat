In February 2009 he was criticised by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith for stating in the paper that the drug ecstasy was statistically no more dangerous than an addiction to horse-riding.

Jacqui Smith claimed to be [...] "surprised and profoundly disappointed" [...] by the remarks, and added: [...] "I'm sure most people would simply not accept the link that he makes up in his article between horse riding and illegal drug taking".

40|$|Background: Patient safety has, {{over the}} last decades, been {{increasingly}} established as an important global issue. Patient safety is jeopardized by for example <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> {{and most of the}} current evidence on <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> originates from hospitals, but many <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> also happen in nursing homes. It is clear that <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> occur in nursing care and can cause suffering and even death, which could have been avoided if adequate actions had been taken. While the literature on improving patient safety is extensive, there is a dearth of studies from the perspectives of patients and their relatives. Aim: To gain new insights about <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in nursing care from the perspective of patients and their relatives as well as health care providers, and describe contributing factors to <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> The specific aim in paper I was to examine <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in nursing care as they are experienced by patients and relatives. In paper II the aim was to identify the most common <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> that occur in nursing homes, and their most frequent contributing factors, in order to contribute to the improvement of safe nursing care. Methods: The design was descriptive, based on a total sample of data collected from national registries in Sweden. The method was content analysis with both a qualitative and a quantitative approach. Results: The findings in study I showed that experiences of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in nursing care, reported by patients and relatives, included suffering from both physical and mental injuries caused by the nursing care. Lack of participation caused negative consequences for patients or relatives, as well as physical <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> The findings from study II showed that medication errors, falls, delayed or inappropriate interventions and missed nursing care caused {{the vast majority of the}} <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in nursing homes. The most common contributing factors to <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were 1) lack of competence 2) incomplete, or lack of documentation 3) teamwork failure 4) and inadequate communication. A comparison of the results of studies I and II showed that there were discrepancies between the <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> reported by patients and their relatives and the <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> reported by health care providers. Conclusion: Carers, as well as leaders in health care, can learn from patients’ and relatives’ experiences of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in nursing care in order to improve the quality of nursing care. The contributing factors to <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> frequently interacted, yet they varied between different groups of <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> A holistic approach to improve safe care in nursing homes requires competence of the staff, safe environments as well as resident’s and relative’s participation...|$|R
