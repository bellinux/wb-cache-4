40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using oriented polymer {{technology in the}} design and manufacture of mechanical power transmission belts has been investigated. Working from an initial selection of polymers a die-drawing technique for orienting the polymers was devised, and the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the oriented polymers were investigated. These results indicated that PP, PBT, PPS and PEEK were suitable for further research. Of these 4 materials PBT was selected as the most appropriate material for belt manufacture based on cost, processability (drawing temperature, natural draw ratio) and limitations of laboratory equipment. A technique based on free-tensile drawing combined with simultaneous rotational motion was designed and used to manufacture oriented PBT flat belts from cylindrical injection moulded preforms. The technique used a tensile machine with two pulley-clamps, a fitted heated chamber and an electric motor to provide rotational motion to the belt during drawing. Two types of oriented PBT flat belts with different cross sections were produced successfully, termed 'thick' and 'thin'. These belts were tested on a purpose-built rig comprising two equal diameter pulleys, one driven by an electric motor and the other connected to a generator to provide load. The belt life and power transmission performance was investigated at various conditions of speed, transmitted torque and tension, and the results indicated that despite their smaller cross section 'thin' flat belts demonstrated up to 3 times longer life. However life was only 100 hours, which was very low compared with conventional flat belts that last for many thousands of hours at higher speeds and much greater power transmission capacity. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>belts</b> were then produced through the same manufacturing method used for flat belts. This aspect of the research concentrated on the initial pitch design and size, i. e. the timing. Initially a rectangular tooth profile was selected for its simplicity in terms of manufacture. The produced belts exhibited high pitch length variation as well as deformed teeth and were not usable for synchronous power transmission. An extra timing feature was included to control orientation; reducing the pitch length variation enabling consistent tooth production. It was observed that the areas between the extra timing feature and the tooth edges did not orient completely with some regions remaining undrawn. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to predict the drawing behaviour of different shapes and dimensions of the timing features. The results suggested that a 4 mm wide and 7 mm long slot provided the highest possible extension and the minimum non-oriented regions on the groove. Whilst, the thickness and width of the drawn belt timing features showed differences to the FEA predictions, manufactured <b>synchronous</b> <b>belts</b> based on that design had much better controlled dimensions and the lowest achieved pitch length variation (± 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} {{of a local}} reduction of stiffness in a <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> was experimentally studied by monitoring the vibrations of {{the support of the}} driven pulley. The lack of teeth in a <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> is the cause of variations in the forces exchanged between the belt and pulley compared to the forces exchanged in a healthy belt. These variations in force lead to a different vibratory behavior of the bodies of the transmission and can be highlighted by analyzing the vibratory signals. A workbench for the diagnostic study of mechanical transmissions was equipped, and acceleration measurements were performed on the support of the driven pulley under the working conditions of some healthy and defective belts. Comparing the power spectra of the measured accelerations in both cases, meaningful variations in the amplitude of the peaks were observed at frequencies multiple of the frequency of turn of the belt. This result was obtained using some particular test and measurement conditions. A diagnostic procedure for detecting defects in synchronous belts was developed...|$|E
40|$|An {{automotive}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> transmits {{power and}} assures accurate timing between the crankshaft and camshafts. The automotive industry is very competitive: there is constant pressure to increase performance and lower costs. For synchronous belts, {{this means that}} replacement intervals must be longer {{at the same time}} as the loading situation becomes more complex due to engine development. Hence, it has become important to be able to predict belt life in early design stages. This thesis covers the fundamentals of belt life predictions, namely, <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> mechanics. A quasi-static load distribution model, which includes spring stiffnesses determined by a finite element based method, is presented. Since loads in an automotive <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> drive are not quasi-static, a dynamic load distribution model was developed. These two models have a unique force decomposition that includes a radial degree of freedom for each pitch. It is shown that dynamic models must be used for belt profiles where friction forces take part in the power transmission {{at the same time as}} rapid load changes are present. This is due to the friction history dependency. Load distribution measurements were made under contrasting conditions: quasi-static in a simple two pulley rig and dynamic in a running engine. These measurements were made possible by a strain gauge equipped measurement pulley able to measure four of the force components calculated by the models mentioned above. The models show good agreement with experiments. The pitch difference was shown to be crucial to the load distribution; this finding could be used to optimize a belt-pulley interaction. The finding is also valid under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. During the experiments, wear-induced geometric changes that led to a redistribution of friction forces were observed. Descriptions of the three failure modes exhibited by automotive cambelts under normal operation are found in the thesis. For one of these failure modes, land area wear, a method to measure wear is devised. The method uses well-know roughness parameters derived from surface topology measurements. An investigation made on belts from test engines, points to effects from at least two land area wear types. The first is caused by the relative motion between belt and pulley during complete mesh; the second arises from counter-directional friction forces at seating and unseating. It is also shown that there exits an optimum pitch difference (in terms of wear durability); and that this optimum is shifted by a decrease in the extensional belt stiffness. The results and models presented can be used in the design of improved <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> transmissions...|$|E

A preliminary numerical analysis was carried out in order to estimate and compare the forces acting on the pulley in a healthy <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> and in a belt lacking one tooth. Simulation results show that the lack of a tooth causes moderate but not negligible variations in the tangential force on the pulley. These variations involve different vibration behaviours that can be studied by analysing vibration signals in the frequency domain.

40|$|Abstract: Timing {{drive systems}} of recent {{passenger}} car engines are usually equipped with chain or <b>synchronous</b> <b>belt</b> drives. The comparatively low stiffness of chains and belts, {{combined with the}} large moments of inertia, resulting from moving parts of camshafts and valvetrains, lead to natural frequencies in the frequency range between 80 and 250 Hz for the entire timing drive [1]. Obviously, engine orders dominating the noise excitation {{are in the same}} frequency range, and resonance effects cannot be avoided. Furthermore, a guarantee is requested that occurring vibration amplitudes do not exceed acceptable limits. Hence, the predicted results of the primary dynamics of the timing drive are key data for the design analysis of a combustion engine. Besides the low frequency range excitation determined by main engine orders, higher-order structure-borne noise excitation is gaining more importance. This is particularly true for chain-driven systems where specic effects lead to considerable excitation of the engine structure in a higher frequency range (typical whine noise). The excitations are caused by the polygon effect, meshing impacts between chain links and sprockets and impacts in the engagement and disengagement between chain, sprockets and guides. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-body dynamics (MBD) model and the relevant simulation environment, which takes into account the entire timing drive as a fully coupled system. While simple MBD models (e. g. longitudinal span representation) are sufcient for the prediction of the primary dynamics of th...|$|E
