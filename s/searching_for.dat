40|$|ABSTRACT Although several {{theories}} {{assert that}} understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning {{in life is}} important, empirical research on this construct is sparse. Three studies provide the first extensive effort to understand the correlates of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in a multistudy research program. Assessed were relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and wellbeing, cognitive style, and the Big Five, Big Three, Approach/Avoidance, and Interest models of personality, with a particular emphasis on understanding the correlates of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning that are independent of presence of meaning. Conceptual models {{of the relation between}} search and presence were tested. Findings suggest that people lacking meaning <b>search</b> <b>for</b> it; the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning did not appear to lead to its presence. Study 3 found that basic motive dispositions moderated relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its presence. Results highlight the importance of basic personality dispositions in understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its correlates. Several investigations have recently reaffirmed the link between meaning in life and well-being (e. g., King, Hicks, Krull, & Del...|$|R

40|$|The <b>search</b> <b>for</b> {{meaning in}} {{life has been}} {{considered}} a fundamental human motivation (Frankl, 1963). Although research has pointed toward {{the importance of the}} <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in life, the basic processes through which it emerges remain unclear. Because the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning entails schema formation in which one connects individual experiences into a coherent framework (Steger, Oishi, & Kesebir, 2011), and abstract thought instigates the organization of information into such knowledge structures (Trope & Liberman, 2010), we predicted that abstract thought would increase the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in life. Moreover, we predicted that figuratively removing oneself from the here and now would also heighten the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning. Importantly, we predicted that because schema formation is effortful (Shallice & Burgess, 1996), abstract thought and psychological distance would increase the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning to a greater extent when willingness to exert effort is high rather than low. Nine experiments corroborated these predictions, supporting a view of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning as motivated social cognition...|$|R
