5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the depths}} {{at which it}} lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few {{specimens}} have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; {{one of the few}} areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye ragged-tooth shark.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} are known as <b>scabbardfishes</b> or hairtails; others are called frostfishes because they appear in late autumn and early winter, {{around the time of}} the first frosts.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{physical}} {{output is}} low but reasonable levels of income are attained {{by virtue of}} the high commercial value of the species they capture: octopus, black <b>scabbardfish,</b> conger, pouting, hake and anglerfish. [...] Purse seine fishing is also part of the local fleet and has, on the mainland, only one target species: the sardine. [...] This fishery represents 37% of total landings.

50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> is of {{economic}} importance to fisheries associated with {{countries of the}} Iberian Peninsula, and especially with the Madeira Islands where they are prized for food. The black <b>scabbardfish</b> is also fished around areas of Iceland, France, Ireland and around some areas around the Canary Islands. Because of its good flesh quality, it usually fetches high prices. The black <b>scabbardfish</b> fish, along with the crab {{are the two most}} sought after sea products for consumption in the Madeira Islands and Portugal and therefore play a huge economic role in these locations. In areas in Portuguese waters the black <b>scabbardfish</b> has traditionally been caught by line gears. In the NE Atlantic around the areas of France and Ireland the fish are caught by trawlers. The black <b>scabbardfish,</b> has high economic value in areas such as Portugal, it is the most important deep-water fish exploited, and landings of the black <b>scabbardfish</b> increased from 2700 tonnes per year between the years of 1988 and 1993 and around the year of 2000 and increased to 2900 tonnes in landings obtained in the year of 2007. In the last decade alone landings of the black scabbard fish have increased to about 6000 tonnes, 3000 tonnes in Madeira and 3000 tonnes in mainland Portugal.|$|E

50|$|Black <b>scabbardfish</b> have 35 or more prey categories, {{including}} crustaceans, cephalopods, mesopelagic fish, shrimps, teleost fish, {{and blue}} whiting. Blue whiting {{may be a}} preferred prey; other mesopelagic fish are also preferred. When black <b>scabbardfish</b> are not feeding on these, they may chase after baitfish, feasting on Sardina pilchardus, Scomber colias, or squid.|$|E
5000|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> is a genus of Cutlassfish which {{contains}} the following species: ...|$|E
50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> is bathypelagic by day but moves upwards in {{the water}} column at night to feed at middle depths on crustaceans, {{cephalopods}} and other fishes, mostly grenadiers, codlings (family Moridae) and naked heads (family Alepocephalidae). The black <b>scabbardfish</b> coexists spatially with aphanopus intermedius Parin, which is a species commonly known as the intermediate <b>scabbardfish.</b> The narrow, elongated body of the black <b>scabbardfish,</b> along with its pointed head and long dorsal fin, are adapted for fast swimming. This fish has a large terminal mouth with large fang like teeth for efficient predation. In order to camouflage well, it has a coppery-black coloration with an iridescent tint. The fish’s large eyes which have a diameter of 1/5-1/6 of the head length, are of such a large size to facilitate sight in low light. They become sexually mature at a length of about 80 cm. Both the eggs and the larvae are pelagic, drifting with the plankton. In general, the size distribution moves towards higher values from north to south of the NE Atlantic. Eggs and larval stages of this fish are unknown and juvenile fish are rarely caught. Juveniles, however, are reported to be mesopelagic. The life cycle of black <b>scabbardfish</b> is unknown, but the most common hypothesis is that one single stock undertakes a large scale clockwise migration around the NE atlantic. Spawning is restricted to certain areas including Madeira, the Canary Islands, and possibly further south. The juvenile black <b>scabbardfish</b> stay to feed and grow for a few years in the fisheries south of the Faroe Islands and the west of the British Isles. Afterwards, the juveniles then move south towards mainland Portugal and even further south to the spawning areas. The most recent studies indicate that the maximum age of the black <b>scabbardfish</b> from Madeira was about 14 years and the maximum age in Mainland Portugal was about 12 years. As opposed to most shelf demersal and pelagic commercial fish, the black <b>scabbardfish</b> exhibit a slow growth rate in adults. This slow growth rate results from energy investment of growth and reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scabbardfish</b> {{returned}} to Guam in late April and underwent voyage repairs by submarine tender. On 29 April, she departed for the East China Sea. A change of orders assigned {{her to the}} Life Guard League, and, on 4 May, she rescued five crewmen from a ditched B-29 Superfortress. They were transferred to submarine [...] two days later, and <b>Scabbardfish</b> continued to the Yellow Sea area. On 17 May, <b>Scabbardfish</b> fired a spread of torpedoes at a small freighter which was accompanied by two escorts. This {{proved to be a}} hunter-killer group, and when the torpedoes missed, they subjected the submarine to a grueling four-hour depth charge attack.

50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the NE Atlantic in differing stages of growth through its life. This fish performs a clockwise migration during its life cycle driven by reproduction and feeding habits. The black <b>scabbardfish</b> spawns near the Madeira Islands and the Canary Archipelago during the months of October through December. It has been hypothesized that they then head north to cooler waters where they will feed and grow. Upon reaching adulthood, they will then move south again to the waters off Portugal until they are of reproductive maturity age when they will then return to their spawning grounds. There is some debate on the spawning areas of the black <b>scabbardfish.</b> Though the Madeira spawning area is well known, {{there may be some}} other spawning areas off the northwestern coast of Africa as mature females have been found in this region during the reproductive time of its life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The silver <b>scabbardfish</b> (also frostfish, beltfish), Lepidopus caudatus, is a {{cutlassfish}} of {{the family}} Trichiuridae found throughout the temperate seas of the world. It grows to over 2 m in length.|$|E
50|$|On 31 August, she sighted {{her first}} enemy ships, an inter-island steamer with two escorts. <b>Scabbardfish</b> fired two spreads of three torpedoes but all missed. After a light depth charge attack, she {{surfaced}} and continued steaming west.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> is a {{suitable}} host for the parasite Anisakis. This is mainly {{due to the}} fishes’ diet of infected hosts such as crustaceans (euphausiids, copepods and amphipods), fish and cephalopods. This parasite is a nematode {{that is capable of}} entering the hosts stomach wall or intestines. Scientists can and have used these parasites to track where the black <b>scabbardfish</b> has traveled. The parasite Anisakis is commonly used for tracking since they are prevalent in waters nearby Portugal and the Madeira Islands. A study has been conducted on the infectivity of the Anisakis app. Larvae (Nematoda: Aniskidae) in the black <b>scabbardfish</b> near Portuguese waters. The three regions that were observed in the study was the mainland coast of Portugal, Madeira, and Azores. The mainland and Madeira regions were observed throughout four seasons by scientists and the Azores was observed in two seasons. In all fish observed all were infected by Anisakis L3 larvae. Consumption of raw or under cooked black scabbard fish can result in health complications for humans. The only reliable treatment for a human affected with Anisakiasis is the removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.|$|E

She sailed from there on 6 September under orders which sent her to Eniwetok for ASW training duties. She remained there for a month; sailed to Guam for a month; and, on 14 November, stood out of Apra Harbor en route to San Francisco, California, via Midway Island. On 29 November 1945, the submarine arrived at Mare Island for her first overhaul, which was not completed until mid-March 1946.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scabbardfish,</b> {{as a unit}} of Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, {{arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 24 July.

50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish,</b> Aphanopus carbo, is a bathypelagic {{cutlassfish}} of {{the family}} Trichiuridae found in the Atlantic Ocean between latitudes 69° N and 27° N at depths of between 180 to 1700 m. Its length is up to 110 cm, but it reaches maturity at around 80 to 85 cm.|$|E
50|$|The {{razorback}} <b>scabbardfish</b> attains {{a maximum}} length of 2.5 m. Its diet consists of fishes, {{such as the}} Californian anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and the North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and squid. The only known parasite of the razorback <b>scabbardfish</b> is the copepod Avitocaligus assurgericola. Reproduction is presumably oviparous with pelagic eggs and larvae as {{with other members of}} the family, though eggs and newly hatched larvae have not been described. Flexion (the bending of the notochord as part of caudal fin formation) occurs at around a length of 14 mm. Post-flexion larvae have slender bodies and pointed heads, with the pelvic and first dorsal spines elongated. They can be distinguished by the presence of pigment on the top of the head, snout, and opercles. This species is not targeted by fisheries; it is sometimes hooked or netted, or found washed ashore.|$|E

50|$|Despite having huge {{market value}} {{and a strong}} hold in the typical Southern European diet, there are several health risks {{associated}} with consumption of the black scabbardish due {{to the presence of}} several toxic metals found within the fish including lead, mercury, and cadmium.

Portuguese processed fish products are exported through several companies under a number of different brands and registered trademarks like Ramirez, Bom Petisco, Briosa Gourmet, Combate, Comur, Conserveira, General, Inês, Líder, Manná, Murtosa, Pescador, Pitéu, Porthos, Tenório, Torreira, Vasco da Gama, etc.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>scabbardfish</b> are deep-sea creatures, {{existing}} in abundance in between 800 and 1300 meters deep. They are mainly captured in mixed trawl fisheries {{along with other}} deep-water species, and are highly vulnerable to overfishing. The Marine Conservation Society ranks this species as a number five out of five on the sustainability chart. This means that the species is vital to their ecosystem. Preservation of this species is highly recommended. However, this species is of high commercial importance, with annual catches reaching up to 14,000 tonnes.
