25|$|The UN counterattack in the {{aftermath}} of the Chinese Spring Offensive stabilized the front along the 38th parallel. The rest of the war involved little territory change, large-scale bombing of the population in the north, and lengthy peace negotiations, which started in Kaesong on July 10, 1951. Even during the peace negotiations, combat continued. For the South Korean and allied forces, the goal was to recapture all of what had been South Korea before an agreement was reached in order to avoid loss of any territory. The Chinese attempted similar operations at the Battle of the Hook and the Battle of Kumsong. A major issue of the negotiations was repatriation of POWs. The Communists agreed to voluntary repatriation, but only if the majority would return to China or North Korea, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not occur. The war continued until the Communists eventually dropped this issue.|$|E
25|$|Volador Jr. had {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of dressing up like various super heroes for significant matches, especially Marvel Comics super heroes such as Spider-Man, Venom and Iron Man, {{and for the}} 81st Anniversary continued the tradition coming to the ring dressed in black with a giant white skull on his chest to resemble the character The Punisher. While he wore a mask during his introductions, Volador Jr. removed it for the match as {{he was no longer}} allowed to wrestle while masked, due to a loss he suffered at the previous anniversary show. Mr. Niebla, along with his Mascota Perico came to the ring dressed in garb resembling members of the Rock band KISS, with Mr. Niebla's mask resembling the face paint that Gene Simmons wears when performing on stage. This was Thunder's first match as a rudo, showcasing a new mask that was primarily black with a few red and yellow highlights. Before the match Thunder attacked Volador Jr. again and threw him outside the ring. To sell the brutality of Thunder's attack Volador Jr. was on the floor {{for the majority of the}} first fall, leaving Máscara Dorada and Valiente to wrestle the first fall by themselves. During the first fall Thunder stayed on the apron, seemingly more focused on Volador Jr. than the other opponents. The first fall was won by Valiente and Dorada when Valiente pinned Euforia while Máscara Dorada pinned Mr. Niebla. Between the falls Volador Jr. returned to the match, ready to fight. During the second fall Thunder finally entered the ring, throwing his opponents around to showcase his greater size and strength compared to his opponents. At one point Dorada, Valiente, Eurforia and Mr. Niebla were all on the floor when Thunder grabbed Volador Jr. by the trunks and the throat and tossing him over the top rope onto the other four wrestlers. The brutality of his actions got Thunder's team disqualified, losing the match in two falls, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not bother Thunder as he was more interested in showing his physical dominance against the smaller opponents.|$|E

500|$|In November 1970, {{the cover}} of Time {{magazine}} featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail {{than any of the}} show's human hosts. The magazine declared, [...] "...It is not only the best children's show in TV history, {{it is one of the}} best parents' shows as well". [...] David Frost, speaking about the versions of Sesame Street that were being produced in other countries, declared it was [...] "a hit everywhere it goes". [...] An executive at ABC, while recognizing that Sesame Street was not perfect, said the show [...] "opened children's TV to taste and wit and substance" [...] and [...] "made the climate right for improvement". [...] Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children's programming, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not substantially occur until the 1990s.

500|$|With this {{increase}} in his practice, Blackstone also saw an increase in his out-of-court work, writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges, the MP Jonathan Rashleigh and the fourth Earl of Abingdon, who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament. In April 1765 Blackstone began to actively seek judicial appointment. In December 1761 he asked Lord Shelburne, a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester, writing again in July 1762 to [...] "prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty's Notice", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas. Parliamentary service was considered a [...] "desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges", <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and [...] "indifferent" [...] speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees {{to provide them with}} technical expertise in drafting legislation. He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of Lord Camden (a Whig) as Lord Chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|For example, Harlow's {{statement}} that Gage [...] "continued {{to work in}} various places; could not do much, changing often, and always finding <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not suit him in every place he tried" [...] refers only to Gage's final months, after convulsions had set in. But it has been misinterpreted as meaning that, after his accident, Gage never held a regular job, [...] "was prone to quit in a capricious fit or be let go because of poor discipline", [...] "never returned to a fully independent existence", [...] "spent {{the rest of his}} life living miserably off the charity of others and traveling around the country as a sideshow freak", and ("dependent on his family" [...] or [...] "in the custody of his parents") died [...] "in careless dissipation". In fact, after his initial post-recovery months spent traveling and exhibiting, Gage supported himselfat a total of two jobsfrom early 1851 until just before his death in 1860.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to World War II Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania each {{experienced}} an authoritarian {{head of state}} {{who had come to}} power after a bloodless coup: Antanas Smetona in Lithuania (December 1926), Konstantin Päts in Estonia (March 1934), and Kārlis Ulmanis in Latvia (May 1934). Some note that the events in Lithuania differed from its two more northerly neighbors, with Smetona having different motivations as well as securing power 8 years before any such events in Latvia or Estonia took place. Despite considerable political turmoil in Finland no such events took place there. Finland did however get embroiled in a bloody civil war, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not happen in the Baltics.

I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere." [...] He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best.

He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students [...] "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations." ...|$|E

[...] According to an entry in one of Kelly's diaries, discovered afterwards by his daughter Rachel at his home, this meeting did not take place in February 2003, but in February 2002.
