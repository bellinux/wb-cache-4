40|$|Efficient {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{energy conversion}} depends on efficient light absorption and photo-carrier collection. In a PV device, photo-carrier concentration exponentially decreases from surface to bulk due to light absorption. Meanwhile, since a conventional PV device {{relies on the}} built-in electric field in the p-n junction to separate photo-carriers, naturally <b>shallow</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> should benefit efficient carrier collection. However, shallow junction, especially ultra-shallow junction photovoltaic devices have to be well designed otherwise the expected performance cannot be achieved. Here we investigated open circuit voltage loss at the Schottky top contact of ultra-shallow junction PV devices using Silvaco semiconductor device simulation package. It {{was found that the}} property of top contact has significant effect on Voc especially for ultra-shallow junction devices. Particularly, diode I-V characteristics of ultra-shallow junction photovoltaic devices with flat band and Schottky top contacts in dark condition were simulated. And the latter case showed larger reverse saturation current resulting in Voc loss. This behavior is attributed to increased hole tunneling to top contact through n-type region for small junction depth, with existence of Schottky contact barrier for electrons. Furthermore, the simulation results clearly showed there is a critical junction depth for <b>shallow</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> when it is applied for ultra-shallow junction PV solar cell, which may be generalized to provide a guideline for design of shallow junction photovoltaic device made of other materials. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The buried-type {{p-channel}} LDD MOSFET’s biased at high positive {{gate voltage}} exhibit new characteristics: 1) {{the ratio of}} the drain to gate currents is about 1 X to 5 X 10 - 3; and 2) the gate and drain currents both are functions of only the gate voltage minus the n-well bias. Such characteristics are addressed based on the formation of the surface n + inver-sion layer due to the punchthrough of the buried channel to the underlying <b>shallow</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction.</b> The measured gate current is due to the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling of electrons from this inversion layer surface and the holes generated within the high-field oxide constitute the drain current.

Due to their extremely <b>shallow</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction,</b> with the depletion zone starting only a few nanometers below the surf ce, and nm-thin pure-boron-layer coverage of the anode surface, PureB-diodes have so far demonstrated the highest reported spectral responsivity in all sub-visible ultraviolet (UV) ranges: DUV (deep ultraviolet), VUV (vacuum ultraviolet) and EUV (extreme ultraviolet), covering a spectrum from 220 nm down to few nanometers [1][2][3][4]. Moreover, the measured responsivity at 13. 5 nm wavelengths (EUV) approaches the theoretical maximum (~ 0. 27 A/W) [5][6].

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} the Etch/TEM and Etch/AFM methods to obtain quantitative 2 -D dopant profiles for the ultra <b>shallow</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> of the next generation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). For these methods, thin foil (TEM) or bulk (AFM) cross-sectional specimens were etched using a dopant selective chemical so that local areas of the dopant implanted source/drain (S/D) regions were etched to different depths. The surface topography of the S/D regions was determined from the thickness fringes for the TEM method and by the direct measurement for the AFM method. The local etched depths were converted to etch rates, and these were then converted to corresponding 1 -D and 2 -D dopant profiles by the experimentally independent etch rate calibration curves. Shallow junction MOSFET samples were designed and fabricated with junction depths 60 nm (n"+/p), 80 nm (n"+/p) and 120 nm (p"+/n) using 0. 25 #mu#m process technology. A new method using SOG (Spin-on-Glass) contributed to the high quality XTEM thin foil specimens. Controlled stirring of the etchant increased the dopant concentration selectivity and etching consistency. Computer modelling simulated the isotropic etching behaviours, which can introduce the significant error in dopant profiling for shallow and abrupt junction samples. Comprehensive quantitative results enabled the optimum etching time to be determined for the first time. Etch/TEM method gave 1 -D dopant profiles that showed good agreement with 1 -D Spreading Resistance Probe (SRP) dopant profiles for determining junction depths. 2 -D dopant profiles gave L_e_f_f, i. e. the shortest lateral distance between the S/D junctions, of major importance for MOSFET performance. Values for L_e_f_f of 161, 159 and 123 nm were determined from 60, 80 and 120 nm junction depth samples respectively, compared with the 215 nm MOSFET gate length. The resolution and accuracy of the Etch/TEM method are estimated as 2 and 10 nm respectively. For the Etch/AFM method, to overcome the artefact induced by tip size, {{for the first time a}} detailed investigation was made of the convolution occurring for the etched MOSFET structures and a double deconvolution method was developed. The resulting 2 -D dopant profiles for n"+/p 80 nm deep junction sample showed reasonable agreement with Etch/TEM method demonstrating the advantage of the developed deconvolution method. For the first time, the present work successfully achieved quantitative 2 -D dopant profiles for sub- 100 nm deep junctions. The developed dopant profiling methods are expected to contribute to the research and development for next generation devices.

Photoexcited carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are separated into mobile carriers by the built-in-electric field, or band bending, at the junction between the p- and the n-type semiconductors [12, 13, 14]. The photovoltage in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> is the difference in quasi-Fermi levels (i.e., the band bending) of n-type and p-type regions. A typical device consists of a 5  μm-long n-type semiconductor and 300  μm-long p-type ones, i.e., the minority carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are expected to travel ~ 300  μm for efficient charge collection, which requires rigorous control on their chemical purity [12, 15].

By {{connecting}} several <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> together, researchers have been able to create the basis of all logic circuits: the AND, OR, and NOT gates have all been built from semiconductor nanowire crossings.|$|R
40|$|Focusing of {{electron}} waves in graphene <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> {{is a striking}} manifestation of fermionic negative refraction. We analyze lensing in smooth <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> and find that it differs in several interesting ways from that in the previously studied sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions.</b> Most importantly, while the overall negative-refraction behavior remains unchanged, the image at the focal point undergoes additional broadening due to Klein tunneling in the junction. We develop a theory of image broadening and estimate the effect for practically interesting system parameter values. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical methodology for realistic simulation on reverse characteristics of Wide Bandgap (WBG) SiC and GaN <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions.</b> The adjustment on certain physic-based model parameters, {{such as the}} trap density and photo-generation for SiC junction, and impact ionization coefficients and critical field for GaN junction are described. The adjusted parameters were used in Synopsys Medici simulation to obtain a realistic <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> avalanche breakdown voltage. The simulation results were verified through benchmarking against independent data reported by others.

40|$|The {{classical}} Shockley {{boundary conditions}} {{are used for}} {{the determination of the}} minority carrier concentrations {{at the edges of the}} space-charge region of semiconductor <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions.</b> They are usually employed for the calculation of the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> current/ voltage characteristic. This work demonstrates that they are valid only at low injection current levels. New analytical expressions for these boundary conditions are obtained for medium and high injection levels. These expressions are verified by calculating the current/ voltage characteristics of <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> operated at high current levels. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
