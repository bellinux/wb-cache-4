25|$|Despite {{wanting to}} avoid making the {{character}} a composite, Judi Beecher provided Madison's voice, {{as well as her}} facial motion capture. Heavy Rain marked Beecher's first role in a video game, having previously had a background in theatre. Beecher came on late to the project, and the first demo – The Taxidermist, in which Madison was voiced by Barbara <b>Scaff</b> – had already been made, before it was decided to recast the character. Beecher was contacted by her French agent in July 2008, after Quantic Dream had heard her voice demo and requested her, and told to audition. The audition involved a cold reading of 5 or 6 different scenes with different endings. The developers considered having her do the body capture, but were concerned that it would not match the movements of the shorter Ainsley, and were not willing to redo all the motion capturing. Madison had 150 pages of scripted dialogue; due to the motion capture, the script could not be seen and thus had to be learnt, which took Beecher roughly a month.|$|E

2500|$|Life in the {{university}} was interrupted when World War II came. On 26 May 1942, some {{three weeks after the}} fall of Corregidor, two Japanese transports anchored in Dumaguete. Silliman was occupied by the Japanese forces and was converted into a garrison. One of its buildings, Channon Hall, became the headquarters of the dreaded Japanese kempeitai or military police where many Filipinos were tortured and killed. During the occupation, many members of the faculty and the student body were forced to evacuate to four localities within the province. Under the leadership of Dr. Arthur Carson, then president of Silliman, the remaining members of the faculty continued the operations of the University in the mountains of Negros Oriental. This {{led to the formation of}} what was then called the [...] "Jungle University" [...] in Malabo, Valencia, one of the localities in the province. [...] Professor Roy Bell became a major in the Negros Island guerrilla forces, established a Free Government, printed the Victory News, and used his radio transmitter to establish contact with the South West Pacific Area (command). [...] Many students, alumni, faculty members and ROTC officeers joined the resistance forces, while theology professors Alvin <b>Scaff,</b> Proculo Rodrigues, Paul Lindholm and James McKinley [...] "carried on pastoral and teaching duties for the resistance soldiers and civilians in guerrilla-dominated territory." [...] The Carson and Bell families, plus other faculty members, were evacuated by the USS Narwhal (SS-167) on 7 Feb. 1944.|$|E
