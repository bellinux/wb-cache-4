40|$|Unrealised design {{capacity}} in computerised seamless knitting technology is highlighted in emerging research. The adoption of this technology, both in New Zealand and internationally, is largely {{driven by the}} economic gains it affords knitted garment manufacturers rather than the opportunities it presents for new design (Challis, Sayer, & Wilson, 2006; Evans-Mikellis, 2011; Smith, 2013; Yang, 2010). Complexities of the machinery and its user interface have constrained textile designers, impacting on their creative output, leaving the technology largely unexplored (Black, 2002; Mowbray, 2002). By acquiring technical skills {{and understanding of the}} seamless environment through practice-based enquiry, this research integrates computerised <b>seamless</b> <b>knit</b> technology into small-scale textile design practice; the goals are to exploit the creative potential of the technology and realise crafted design outcomes. This research results in prototypical soft furniture and homeware products...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in seamless knitting technology are opening up signiﬁcant {{opportunities in the}} design, production and application of knitted textile preforms. Introduced in the mid 1990 ’s, seamless machinery enables shaped, 3 -dimensional knitted forms to be produced entirely by machine. While garment producers globally adopted the technology for its economic efficiencies, the standardised templates in the technology’s software have generally reduced the sophistication of designs produced. Although the signiﬁ cant unrealised potential in seamless technology is widely acknowledged, designers and manufacturers are facing diffi culties in understanding and integrating the complex technology into their practice. There remains a fundamental gap in knowledge and skills, {{in part due to}} a simpliﬁed and modular garment based user interface, which fronts a complex and sophisticated technology. Of the limited research in this area, most relates to garment shaping. More recently, we have started to see sophisticated applications of this technology in highly technical or artisanal design outcomes emerging from textile research centres. The design and production of knitted textile forms in 3 -dimensions, as opposed to the 2 -dimensional ﬂ at pattern and construction of the past, is a signiﬁcant conceptual shift for traditional textile design practice. Traditional craft and design practices are often disrupted by the emergence of new technologies. We believe that the disruption created by <b>seamless</b> <b>knit</b> technology has the potential to vastly change both the design and application of knitted textiles, moving knitted textile manufacturing up the value chain. This installation showcases the advanced capabilities of seamless knitting technology for innovative, 3 -dimensional form building and high-end design outcomes. The group submitting this proposal consists of a knitwear designer, knitted textile designer and knit technician. All are experienced in this ﬁeld, and will draw on current research and developments to work collaboratively in producing a collection of seamless knitted products that demonstrate unique shaping, 3 -dimensionality, pattern and texture. The collection includes both garment and non-garment applications and may incorporate smart textile applications...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{production}} {{initiated the}} first industrial revolution, with James Hargreaves’ {{invention of the}} Spinning Jenny in 1766 introducing the beginning of systems of mechanized mass production. More recently, {{the development of new}} forms of digital manufacturing has given rise to a “New Industrial Revolution”. This paper considers the introduction of digital textile technologies in relation to this new “maker” economy and to traditional industrial textile and apparel design and production systems. While factors such as high investment costs, technology limitations and the need for specialized technical knowledge initially restricted the uptake of new technologies by traditional textile and fashion design manufacturing companies, technology developments are overcoming many of these problems. However, a lack of access and usability has limited engagement and innovation by designers, makers and technology entrepreneurs. This paper discusses the achievements, opportunities, limitations and impacts of work conducted through a university-based research and development centre that provides access to advanced technologies and associated technical, research and design expertise in areas of digital textile printing and seamless knitting for product development, sampling and training. Drawing on case studies developed from client and staff interviews, product and market analysis, recent theoretical writings and a contextual review, the paper will consider ways in which these technologies are helping designers and companies to do things differently and create value. More immediate and localized design development strategies can support on demand production of specialized, high value products locally and internationally. They have also provided more effective design and production methods to other industries; for example, costume designers for film, theatre and television companies. This facility also provides support for new areas of application and new manufacturing processes, for example in the areas of shaped, <b>seamless</b> <b>knit</b> and e-textiles. Through these studies, traditional fashion production and market problems such as remote global supply chains, the separate and highly specialized roles of designers and technicians in the knitwear industry, the production of pre and post-market textile waste and the minimizing of stock levels are reconsidered. Business concepts and strategies, enabled by new forms of digital manufacturing are related to approaches discussed in the case studies...|$|E

40|$|<b>Seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> {{for making}} bras {{is a novel}} approach. The fitting {{evaluation}} of these products remains unknown and there is limited knowledge {{about the effects of}} knitting parameters on the bra tension. This study developed 3 styles of <b>seamless</b> <b>knitted</b> bras with various loop length and elastic yarn tension based on a 2 2 full factorial experimental design with one additional centre level. Therefore, a total of 3 × 5 = 15 new seamless bra samples have been knitted. The skin pressure exerted by the new bras was compared with 4 commercial bras including 2 "cut and sewn" wired bras and 2 <b>seamless</b> <b>knitted</b> bras. Six women subjects of breast size 75 B*in our newly developed breast sizing system were invited to wear all the bra samples. The skin pressure exerted by the bra was measured by the Novel pliance-X pressure sensors on 11 body positions. The results indicated that newly developed seamless bras showed lower pressure than the commercial bras, but had a considerably higher pressure at the cup base point. The new seamless bras with the largest loop length presented the lowest pressure values. Furthermore, empirical equations were established to predict 2 critical pressure points at "apex" and "side bottom band" from two major knitting parameters. This study provides the new knowledge of <b>seamless</b> <b>knitted</b> bra fitting and the resulted bra pressure, as well as some guidelines for <b>seamless</b> <b>knitted</b> product design and manufacturing.

40|$|The ‘hypothesis’ of this practice-led {{research}} is that seamless knitwear processes, recognized as mass- production tools within a post-Fordist {{system of the}} mass-production of difference, may be rethought as design innovation processes for three-dimensional assemblage. This opens to a design-led rather than a production-led understanding of innovation. The thesis outcome {{is a collection of}} knitwear garments, each of which is singular though iterative; a collection produced as repetitive difference. Engaging with the computerized design capability of the Shima Seiki seamless knitwear system, this research opens critical approaches to an understanding of design, technology, garment, surface and form. Contexts associated with the work of the philosopher, Gilles Deleuze and the ethos of Wabi-Sabi ground the research questioning of production’s relationship to form, materiality and the fashioning of things. The thesis outcome of a ‘seriality’ of singular garments is accompanied by an exegesis that engages the historical and critical contexts of the advent of seamless knitwear processes, and current research on <b>seamless</b> <b>knit</b> production and aesthetics. Though now twenty years since its inception, its model of production does not realize the potential for three dimensional design-led capabilities, tending to perpetuate already established knitwear production models of two-dimensional symmetrical design processes that traditionally required seams. This research investigates the impact of whole garment knitwear technologies, particularly the role of design and its applications to production. The thesis suggests that the designer’s ability to create singularities in knitwear design has been bounded by mass-production design and manufacturing processes, exemplified by current commercial applications of seamless knitwear techniques. When knitwear encounters the potential for a paradigm shift in its modes of production, there is also the potential to rethink design itself. Singularities in Design is a PhD research project that localizes such a paradigm shift in seamless knitwear processes. The research methodology works at the nexus of a triple engagement that of ‘concept’, ‘affect’ and ‘function’. The thinking of Gilles Deleuze, particularly The Fold, informs this engagement and opens to a reflection on the designer’s approach to her craft, invoking the tradition of Wabi-Sabi ethos and the broad technology imperatives of seamless knitwear and global techno cultural traditions. This research project aims at creating original modalities of understanding fashion other than with in traditional legacies of a science and art dualism...|$|E
40|$|<b>Seamless</b> <b>knitting,</b> {{as a new}} technology, has a great {{potential}} {{in the development of}} lingerie products. Bra <b>knitting</b> using <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology is a difficult engineering problem {{due to the lack of}} knowledge on how to achieve proper underband tension and cup strain for optimal comfort and shape. In this study, we aim at identifying the key knitting parameters and experimentally investigating their relationships with the knitted bra tension. The knitting parameters under investigation were loop density, elastic yarn tension, cover yarn tension and nylon yarn tension. Factorial experimental design was used to explore the most significant factors affecting the underband tension and cup strain of <b>seamless</b> <b>knitted</b> bra. The results show that the loop density and elastic yarn tension were the two main factors affecting the underband tension. The cup strain was mainly affected by the loop density.

40|$|The {{separation}} of the design and technical roles within commercial knitwear design {{has led to a}} 'technical skills gap' between designers and industrial knitting technology, which has contributed to the communication problems between designers and technicians. Historically, these issues have been ignored and designers have accepted compromised versions of their original ideas. However, the advent of <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology has exacerbated the issue and the skills gap has grown exponentially, as designers struggle to engage with <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> processes. The nature of seamless garment design is that all aspects must be considered simultaneously, and pattern-­‐cutting principles for two-­‐dimensional garment blanks are no longer relevant. The most crucial aspect of the design process is the programming of the garment, from which designers are generally excluded. The complexity of the programming has led to manufacturers creating wizard-­‐based functions that simplify and speed up the process, and produce standardised garment styles. The database of pre‐programmed garment styles has been held responsible for uniformity of garment silhouettes within the commercial fashion industry. This research develops a craft theory, that has broadly developed from David Pye and Peter Dormer’s seminal work up to the 1990 s, and locates it in relation to more contemporary work on digital craft. Programming is acknowledged as a form of digital craft and the Shima Seiki APEX CAD system and SWG-­‐N knitting machine are the craft tools. The creative experimental practice explores the possibilities of taking control of the programming and <b>knitting</b> of <b>seamless</b> garments, in terms of the creative design development of new seamless sleeve head styles. The practice is carried out within an 'experimental system' away from the constraints of industry. The data from semi-­‐structured interviews with commercial knitwear designers and technicians is discussed in relation to the 'communication bottleneck' identified by Claudia Eckert and the 'technology skills gap' identified by Sayer et al. Four scenarios for the design and manufacture of knitwear are identified and analysed in terms of the creative management of the design and sampling of seamless garments. The outcomes reflect on how the roles of designer and technician could be more interchangeable to better exploit <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology. Concurrent design practices are considered in the light of a new slow fashion framework that exploits the new possibilities afforded by <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology. This study presents the case that the design and technical aspects of knitwear design need to be reunited in order to create innovative seamless garments, and that this could either be as one role, such as technical designer, or within a design team made up of designer and technician. The artifacts created as part of this research illustrate the possibilities of a designer taking control of the whole process, and are products of a design methodology that incorporates digital tools with traditional design skills. However, it is acknowledged that to fully exploit the software one needs to be an expert craftsman, which, due to the complexity of the software, can take many years to achieve. Therefore, the culture of the knitwear industry needs change to actively encourage and facilitate teamwork, and the training of designers and technicians needs to reflect this change, if <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology is to be fully exploited...|$|R

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{have created a}} gap in designer {{knowledge and understanding of}} the design capabilities and production potential of new CAD software driven equipment. Significantly, within some sectors of the fashion industry, there is an assumption that CAD software run production technologies can eliminate the need for a designer, with production-based technologies “driven” by a technician. Our work with the garment industry supports the emergence of an assumption amongst production machinery manufacturers that CAD software systems can eliminate design input and associated costs (Mohammed, May, & Alavi, 2008; Eckert, Cross, & Johnson, 2000; Eckert, Kelly, & Stacey, 1999). CAD driven production technologies such as the Shima Seiki WholeGarment® knitting system have “predefined garment templates” (preregistered garment shapes in Shima Seiki’s terms) embedded in the software. The manufacturer of this machine claims that these preregistered garment shapes can minimize the creativity gap between the designer and technician. However it is our experience that the system is too complex for cost effective implementation of design innovation. Recent developments in CAD driven knitwear production systems have resulted in changes to the conventional relationships between the client, the designer and the technician. In this context, we have identified a new role, the “designer-interpreter”. Designer-interpreter denotes a professional knitwear designer with additional training in managing computerized <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> machines. Research carried out at Curtin University has identified this as a creative role that is required to optimize design and production using computerized flat V-bed <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> systems. Within current applications of computerised V-bed <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> systems, the textile and garment design processes are fully integrated and cannot be effectivelymanipulated in isolation. There is a current assumption that a knitwear technician can be a design-interpreter. However the designer-interpreter is required to facilitate the creative integration of textile and garment design. This is achieved through the application of their specialist knowledge of knit design, CAD driven software and machine operation. The designer-interpreter can work with either another designer or the end user to develop fully customized garments. With the creative support of the designer-interpreter, a consumer without any design background effectively becomes a “designer”. This system repositions the relationship between designer, manufacturer and consumer. This paper presents research carried out by the Fashion Design & Research HUB at Curtin University into the creative potential of the design process using computerized flat V-bed <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting</b> technology for the client with little or no garment design experience. It reflects on observations made during workshops, of the changing nature in the relationships between designer-interpreter, client, design process and technology...|$|R

40|$|This PhD {{applied a}} {{participatory}} action research approach {{to address the}} organizational problems that compromise the use of computerized seamless V-bed knitwear systems in the high-fashion knitwear sector. The research {{is a response to}} a widely acknowledged conflict between high-fashion design processes and processes by which designs are developed on computerized <b>seamless</b> V-bed <b>knitting</b> systems. The social, organizational, and technical aspects of design and manufacturing using computerized <b>seamless</b> V-bed <b>knitting</b> technology in high-fashion knitwear design were analyzed as a socio-technical system (STS). This approach led to a review of the workflows, tasks and roles; identifying and testing new design and manufacturing processes, design methods, and garment solutions; creating a theory model of a new integrated design process; and developing and testing new design processes, design methods, and fashion design education courses that teach these new fashion knitwear approaches. The research was undertaken using a Shima Seiki WholeGarment® system, a current computerized <b>seamless</b> V-bed <b>knitting</b> design and manufacturing technology. The studio workspace, yarn, use of the Shima Seiki system; involvement in fashion projects, and associate supervision were provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA). The research demonstrated a high-fashion knitwear designer can undertake all aspects of managing computerized seamless V-bed knitwear design and production to the completion of 1 st sample, the first successful sample of a new fabric or garment, was produced using the computer knit data.

They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For <b>seamless</b> garments <b>knitted</b> with circular <b>seamless</b> machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|This {{research}} project explores knitting three-dimensional (3 D) preforms suitable for fibre-reinforced composite structures utilising Shima Seiki’s industrial knitting technology. The research positions weft knitting as a 3 D additive fabrication {{process that has}} potential applications in a wider design context away from the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry. The knitting machine could expand its usefulness from being purely a manufacturing process, to become a design tool for creating innovative 3 D forms. Within this context, 3 D shape knitting offers enormous potential to achieve efficiencies of systems, waste minimisation and material optimisation. Technological advances in flat-bed <b>seamless</b> <b>knitting,</b> such as Shima Seiki’s WholeGarment® allow for the automated production of 3 D forms that once could only be handmade. These advances provide a unique opportunity for new applications not traditionally associated with knitted textiles. The research undertaken is set out in three parts. Part one focuses on the background knowledge {{required in order to}} understand the significance of the research. Part two, the Shape Lexicon, is a visual record of 3 D shape knitted preforms, organised into three broad groups and described in detail. To communicate the 3 D shape knitted forms, a new methodology focusing on the essential design parameters within a framework of technical constraints was developed via design specifications. Part three shifts to design issues evolving out of the technical explorations of the Shape Lexicon. A small case study CraFormaTion of knitted artefacts demonstrates how the research could be a useful tool for designers to develop new ways of thinking about form and the potential of 3 D shape knitting to contribute to a wider design discourse. The Shape Lexicon establishes a link between 3 D shape knitting and parametric design principles. By focusing on the relationship of a shape’s variables and not specific values, a more flexible and systems orientated approach to form building was developed. Understanding the basis of parametric design within a knitting context also points to the next generation of digital knit software technology. To date, there has been no concentrated survey of 3 D shape knitting techniques or generic knitted 3 D forms in one informative document. Therefore this {{research project}} fills a significant gap in academic literature. 3 D shape knitting informs current design debates including; considerations of design optimisation in nature, new technology and materials for design, the reconsideration of craft in a digital context, and the interplay between design and science. Innovations occurring with textile technology and material science are expanding the creative possibilities for designers to reconsider the relationship between surface and form in a more integrated manner. The Shape Lexicon potentially instigates these exchanges and enacts new ways of thinking about form. Trans-disciplinary approaches are necessary to creatively respond to the nexus of technology and craft, and to be able to blend scientific and technical know-how, with a poetic and aesthetic sensibility. In this context, the potential for Textile Design and Architecture to work more closely together is considered. For textile designers such exchanges assist the discipline to reposition itself beyond the surface...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} develop an {{argument}} for a more nuanced language in our critical understanding of the cultural and contextual significance of hand knitting within contemporary craft practice, towards developing a clearer articulation of the intrinsic complexities within this craft practice set against emergent digital contexts, technologies and new modes of collaborative socially engaged practices. The physical activity of hand knitting is a relatively simple repetitive action that has often been described as requiring limited skill or ability. Knitting {{at its most basic}} can be described as the transformation of a linear thread into an interwoven layered construct, whether as a hand-knitted flat panelled jumper knitted on two pins or a complex multi panelled whole garment produced on a high-end computer controlled <b>seamless</b> 3 D <b>knitting</b> machine. However, these basic actions and processes, the transformation of yarn into artefacts is not the whole story or the starting point of this chapter. Instead the author suggests deeper levels of complexity that are embedded within the hand knitting language informed by: haptic, temporal and cultural indices. There are greater levels of embodied tacit and experiential knowledge together with complex associations across culture[s] and customs that call {{for the development of a}} far more precise and appropriate language in contextualizing knitting against preconceptions of craft...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} sixty years, {{knitting}} has evolved through new technology {{developments in the}} area of commercial knitwear. The birth of seamless knitwear in 1995 by Shima Seiki has become the pinnacle in cutting edge technology, with a women’s pleated pull over with structure design recently being knitted in 23 minutes and 19 seconds, on the newest ‘MACH 2 X 15 L’ machine (Rodie, 2009). Accompanying this manufacturing capability, designers have been introduced to a range of digital tools and methods that have changed the way they approach the development of commercially knitted apparel products. However, while this technology is being taken up across the Fashion/Textile Industry, generally knitwear designers are still not confident in using this technology to produce creative, innovative designs through the virtual interface of CAD Design systems. A recent study based upon a comprehensive survey from the 2006 UKHEI (United Kingdom Higher Education Institution) recognised the conceptual shift required in integral knitting: 3 D <b>seamless</b> machine <b>knitting</b> presents a new way of making clothing, forcing the designer to reassess ancient hand techniques [...] . the introduction of this complex technology forces a conceptual shift in the way knitted garments are designed and created (Sayer, Wilson & Challis, 2006, p. 41). This research aims to investigate technical and aesthetic directional choices made by the designer in WholeGarment® knitwear design. Hunter (2004) has recognised that that the automation of knitting software is a key element limiting flexible pattern creation in the revolution of integral garment technology. Though the technical machinery and programming has developed and become highly sophisticated this has tended to leave the designer bewildered as to where to begin with computer aided design in a virtual realm. As a researcher-practitioner in the field of knitwear design, I have taken an exploratory approach conducting a series of informal experiments based on a series of design parameters through the production of sample swatches in different yarn types, various fabric construction techniques, digital textile printing and half scale knitted prototypes, which can be assessed for fit and garment construction. This practice-based, experimental research will assist in understanding and evaluating designing through technology, resulting in the completion of various knitted garments and a written exegesis. The Appendix in this thesis is a report on a TEC (Tertiary Education Commission) funded summer studentship project, conducted at the Textile & Design Laboratory between December 2009 and March 2010. It is titled Analysing the New Zealand Fashion Market: New Opportunities in Knitwear Design (Gover, A. 2010). The project documented in the report has contributed immensely to the background research and understanding of the commercial application of machine WholeGarment® knitting. A capsule collection was developed as part of this project was used in industry to showcase some of the possibilities of WholeGarment ® knitting and digital printing. The report demonstrates the value of applying educational research for practical industry application. Although the appendix is a separate body of work from the thesis, it is included as a foreground to this project. It provides information about the current New Zealand context and demonstrates insight into the background and rationale of this project in relation to the New Zealand knitwear market. In the report, the works of various designers and researchers working with these technologies have been documented to provide insight into a wider international context, alongside local applications...|$|R
