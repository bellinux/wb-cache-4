These patterns are organized into three categories, corresponding to distinct architectural levels of scale: foundation, <b>scaffolding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>framework.</b> In addition to identifying well-known patterns at each of these levels, this {{article describes}} three new patterns: the Concrete Bridge pattern at the foundation level, and the Library and Strategized Concurrency patterns at the framework level. ...|$|R
50|$|In recent times, {{the bridge}} has {{included}} a ropelight display on a framework in {{the centre of}} the eastern arch, which is used to complement the fireworks. As the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>and</b> <b>framework</b> are clearly visible for some weeks before the event, revealing the outline of the design, there is much speculation as to how the effect is to be realised. The bridge effect has been designed by Brian Thomson since 2006, with the lighting designed by Mark Hammer since 2008.|$|R

50|$|Men {{collected}} and pieced together boulders <b>and</b> <b>framework.</b> Lacking <b>timber,</b> the <b>framework</b> was usually made of bone, preferably whale bone. Women and children gathered tundra moss for crevices, and prepared skins for roofing and siding. After winter snow arrived, the men used long knives to cut up blocks of snow, {{placing them in}} an outwardly direction for further protection. When the outer casing was attacked by the weather or gnawed on by wolves or foxes, women patched it up again and again, often with numb fingers in the freezing cold and biting wind.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, {{the mill}} was restored. A {{tremendous}} amount of work went into the restoration, which included fixing water damage to the wheel, rebuilding several walls around the wheel pit, installing a new steel axle, replacing millstones <b>and</b> their <b>timber</b> <b>framework,</b> replacing floorboards, windows and more. Great care was taken to use old materials, mostly obtained from demolition sites.|$|R

Derrick in Romanesque style and a Victorian restoration in 1865 was in Gothic Revival style. [...] Another restoration took place in 1926.|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of teleconferencing technologies, human users are collaborating online more than ever today. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of online human coalitions, one needs to support and facilitate collaborations among human users {{who may or may}} not know of each other well and of how to work well together as a team or in a team. Here we propose the Integrated Human Coalition Formation <b>and</b> <b>Scaffolding</b> (iHUCOFS) <b>framework.</b> This multiagent framework considers the roles of an agent as both an advisor and a representative to a human user, the tradeoffs between forming <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> human coalitions, <b>and</b> how <b>scaffolding</b> could impact human behaviors for future coalitions. Based on the axioms and design principles of iHUCOFS, we have developed VALCAM—an iterative auction based coalition formation algorithm. To investigate the feasibility and impact of VALCAM, we have conducted an experiment in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment and obtained promising results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Technological {{advances}} in cyberinfrastructure have {{paved the way}} for research grade computational simulation tools, such as those available on nanoHUB. org. Even though benefits have been acknowledged for incorporating these tools into teaching and learning environments, difficulties have also been identified. To address some of these difficulties researchers have emphasized that inquiry learning with simulations, in order to be successful, needs adequate but not intrusive scaffolding. As a response to this need, nanoHUB. org affiliated faculty have proposed toolbased curricula to be used for training 21 st century engineers in the nanoelectronics field. Motivated and informed by our previous work and related literature on inquiry learning with simulation, a transparency <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> <b>framework</b> is proposed to be integrated into existing nanoHUB tool-based curricula.

40|$|Aim of {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to design}} <b>and</b> assess <b>timber</b> <b>framework</b> of roofing multipurpose building. The building will be situated in Trebic. Ground plan {{dimensions of the}} building are 80. 6 × 54. 5 m and building height is 17. 1 m. The building will have a curved shape with a radius of 30 m. The structure is designed from glued laminated timber, solid timber and steel connecting elements. Substructure will be solved by concrete anchor blocks on foundation strips. The main supporting element are trusses which statically acting as a double-jointed arches. Stability of trusses is securing by purlins together with bracings. Bracings are composed of four fields of cross bracings and longitudinal bracings. Gable walls will consist of columns with braces...|$|R
40|$|Support for novice {{learners}} {{of computer}} programming {{can be provided}} by scaffolding the construction of programs. The ubiquity of mobile phones allows us to support learners whenever they wish {{to work on a}} program outside the classroom. This paper describes the development of an application that scaffolds the construction of programs on a mobile phone. The application was designed based on a five-level <b>scaffolding</b> <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> implemented on the Android platform. The application scaffolds the construction of programs on a mobile device by: (i) representing a program in parts; (ii) restricting a learner to complete the program in a certain order; (iii) enabling construction of a program one part at a time; (iv) providing instructions, steps, default code to be edited, hints, and error prompts where appropriate; and (v) fading the scaffolds as the learner progresses from one successfully completed and compiled program, to the next. Experiments are currently ongoing to test and evaluate the mobile application...|$|R

Specifically, the volume examines {{the extent to}} which study quality, assessment type, <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> characteristics (strategy, intended outcome, fading schedule, <b>scaffolding</b> intervention, <b>and</b> paired intervention) influence cognitive student outcomes. It includes detailed descriptions of the theoretical foundations of scaffolding, scaffolding strategies that have been proposed to meet different intended learning outcomes in STEM, and associated efficacy information. Furthermore, the book describes assessment strategies and study designs which can be used to evaluate the influence of <b>scaffolding,</b> <b>and</b> suggests new fields in which scaffolding strategies that have proven efficacious may be used...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} correlations between four dimensions of maternal <b>scaffolding,</b> maternal beliefs <b>and</b> values, children’s temperament, and children’s performance {{and use of}} self‑regulation strategies on problem‑solving tasks. There are two foci of this study: examining factors that predict the quality of maternal <b>scaffolding,</b> <b>and</b> assessing the relationship between quality of maternal <b>scaffolding</b> <b>and</b> children’s problem solving. Participants consisted of 10 mother‑child dyads {{in the experimental group}} and 10 children in the control group. Using a pre- and post‑test design, children were given near and far transfer independent problem‑solving tasks. The experimental group also worked with their mothers on one task during a scaffolded interaction. Maternal beliefs predicted quality of maternal <b>scaffolding,</b> <b>and</b> quality of maternal scaffolding predicted children’s monitoring during the post‑test. Mothers’ scaffolding techniques appear to be related to their beliefs about parenting and educating children, and children appear to learn certain self‑regulation strategies during optimal scaffolded interactions...|$|R
