Effects of {{variation}} in water content, clay fraction and sodium carbonate additions on the <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> properties of Igbokoda clay and silica sand. Appl. Clay Sci., 5 : 165 - 181. In this investigation, the Igbokoda pure silica sand is characterised and used as a base sand for the Igbokoda clay- sand mixture {{in an attempt to}} develop an efficient <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> sand. The mechanical properties of the clay-sand-water mixture were determined. The effect of additions ofNa 2 C 03 to the moulding sand was examined with particular attention to its influence on mechanical properties of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> sand. The fineness number, screen bulk fraction, total coarse fraction and the total fine fraction of Igbokoda silica sand were found to be within the range that could give good mouldable properties. The values obtained for the green compressive strength, the dry compressive strength, the green and dry shear strengths, collapsibility and toughness indicate that Igbokoda clay has good values as a binder for <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> sand. In general, the addition of Na 2 C 03 gives improved properties to the moulding sand though with a tendency towards impaired collapsibility values...|$|R

40|$|Clay {{obtained}} from lgbokoda {{in the southwestern}} part of Nigeria has been analysed and developed as a binder for <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> sand. The analysis was compared with the analytical results obtained for the pre-treated bentonite clay imported from the U. S. A. and used by the Nigerian Foundries Ltd. (NFL). X-ray analysis indicated the presence of kaolin, illite and montmorillonite (parent mineral of bentonite), with kaolin having the highest percentage in the lgbokoda clay and montmorillonite was further confirmed by the flame test which shows the existence of exchangeable cations not present in kaolin. The effects of mixing varying amounts of clay, tempering water and sand on moulding properties were investigated. The green and dry strength and shatter index of the mixtures were determined. The green and the dry strength (both in shear and compression) of the lgbokoda test clay, mixed with the sub angular lagoon silica sand and determined at optimum water content, give good values for <b>synthetic</b> <b>moulding</b> sand. The shatter index test shows a decrease in collapsibility as the water content decreases at constant clay addition. lgbokoda clay is more collapsible but less tough than bentonite {{as shown by the}} shatter inde...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} has been to evaluate how the caps used to close wine bottles can influence {{the composition of the}} volatile fraction during storage in the case of white wines produced in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. For this purpose, three wines by three local producers have been analyzed. At the beginning, analyses have been carried out on wine samples in the tanks; then wines have been bottled, closed by employing different types of caps and kept at cellar temperature. Employed closures have been classical cork cap, co-extruded <b>synthetic</b> cap, <b>moulded</b> <b>synthetic</b> cap and screw cap. Subsequent analyses have been carried out at 6, 12 and 24 months after bottling. That way it was possible to compare composition both of the same wine during time and of different wines depending on type of closures utilized. Neither clearly identifiable trends nor statistically significant differences between different types of caps utilized have been observed for most volatile components; however, changes that may influence sensory characteristics have been observed for some volatile components...|$|R

5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the <b>mould</b> causes the <b>slides</b> to move forward along the angle pins.|$|R
40|$|Compression moulded {{contact lenses}} are {{produced}} by placing fluid between two moulds and squeezing the fluid outwards to form {{the shape of the}} lens. A common problem seen in this process is that at times the fluid moves outwards asymmetrically, resulting in partially formed lenses. In this article, the system is modelled using the thin film equations and the results are analysed to find the optimal operating setup to reduce asymmetrical flow. A simple model with one curved surface and one flat surface is considered first. This assumption is verified by a more realistic model that investigates the effects of curvature on the dynamics of the fluid. The simple model is modified to include the effect of surface tension. The results of this model show that surface tension plays no role in the fluid dynamics for this particular fluid. A second modified model allows for lateral movement of the lower mould. The model shows that allowing the lower <b>mould</b> to <b>slide</b> hinders the symmetrical flow of the fluid...|$|R
50|$|With prototypes {{rolled out}} in September and December 1951, the SZD-8 Jaskółka (Swallow) was a {{high-performance}} glider for its day, introducing several innovations to glider design {{such as a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>moulded</b> Plexiglas canopy, recessed handle in the rear fuselage for ground handling and a semi-retractable mainwheel. The all-wood wings were covered with plywood and fabric incorporating Fowler flaps on the trailing edges, which could be lowered to 12° or 25°, and Schemp-Hirth style airbrakes aft of the mainspars. Main designer was Tadeusz Kostia. The first prototype was flown on 21 September 1951 (test pilot Adam Zientek), but it revealed faults. After reconstruction, with longer fuselage and enlarged rudder (designated SZD-8-2) it appeared successful and was ordered into production, becoming the most popular competition glider in Poland from 1953 to 1957. Many of the 135 production aircraft were exported, garnering at least fifteen world records from May 1954 to May 1960. Licensed production was also {{carried out in the}} DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik - German Democratic Republic) and the PRC (People's Republic of China). Several variants were produced which introduced various improvements and modifications.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Field Hockey is {{a popular}} sport played {{predominantly}} on artificial sports surfaces requiring sustained periods of locomotion at various velocities. During human locomotion the body is exposed musculoskeletal transient shocks that {{have been linked to}} various injuries (Aguinaldo and Mahar 2003). The magnitude of the impact shocks have been reported as being affected by the velocity of locomotion, movement strategies, the surface and the footwear worn (Clarke et al 1983). Therefore choosing appropriate conditions should reduce the levels of impact shock experienced reducing the risk of injury. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The Purpose {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of footwear, surface and speed on the magnitude of tibial shock. METHODS Nine male participants, (Age 21 + 1. 69, Height 175. 75 + 6. 56 and Mass 78. 13 + 12. 11) volunteered to take part in this study. All participants were injury free at the time of data collection and completed an informed consent form. A tri-axial accelerometer (Biometrics ACL 300) sampling at 1000 Hz was mounted to a lightweight carbon-fibre plate via a securely glued lightweight bolt and thread. The accelerometer signal was recorded by a Biometrics DataLog system (Biometrics Ltd, Gwent, UK). The accelerometer signal was filtered at 60 Hz using a Butterworth 4 th order zero-lag low-pass filter. The concrete surface at the side of the pitch was typical of the sort of surface on which field hockey participants would warm up prior to matches. Participants were required to run in each of the footwear at 5 m. s- 1 (running) and 3. 3 m. s- 1 (jogging). RESULTS Significant differences were observed between running and jogging for the different surfaces. Significant differences in the tibial axial peak were also reported when comparing the effects of surface during running, however during jogging significant differences were not found. Significant differences between mean tibial acceleration values in the Saucony Running, Umbro Soccer Astroturf, and Gryphon Venom, when compared to Umbro Soccer Moulded during running on synthetic surfaces. No other significant differences were found across the population of participants between the shoes for the 3 other surface and velocity conditions (running on synthetic surface, jogging on concrete, running on concrete). DISCUSSION It appears that footwear only has a measureable effect across the population of participants, during running at a higher speed (5 m. s- 1). The significant differences recorded were all cases where the Umbro Moulded shoes exposed the athlete to higher tibial axial accelerations than the other shoe conditions. This occurred only in the running group on the synthetic sports surface This may have been replicated on the concrete but it was considered not safe for participants to run in Umbro Moulded shoes on a concrete surface. Furthermore, the same footwear (Umbro Moulded) as in the previous chapter was highlighted as exposing the population to a significant increase in detrimental kinetic factors. The results of this research suggest that participating in high velocity activities on hard concrete surfaces, exposes the musculoskeletal to significantly larger impact shocks. This information can be used by coaches to select suitable activities with the surfaces available to them. This investigation also identified that during running on <b>synthetic</b> sports surfaces, <b>moulded</b> soccer shoes with hard deep cleats expose the body to larger impact shocks than shoes designed for running and synthetic sports surfaces. Therefore these types of shoes should not be used in field hockey participation on such surfaces. Significant differences in the magnitude of tibial shock between similar footwear designs used by field hockey participants were also identified using the methodologies in this study. The evidence from individual participant provides some assistance for footwear selection. However, the findings of this study demonstrated that shoes can reduce impact shock for one individual while increasing it for another. Therefore, for a participant to be confident of making the correct choice of footwear in relation to exposure to tibial shock, the footwear needs to be tested on an individual basis...|$|R
