5|$|At the time, many {{ingredients}} were <b>scarcely</b> obtainable, but {{the book}} was quickly recognised as serious, {{and within a few}} years it profoundly changed English cooking and eating habits.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is without}} {{comparison}} the best colour for light troops with dark accouterments; and if put {{on in the}} spring, by autumn it nearly fades with the leaves, preserving its characteristic of being <b>scarcely</b> discernible at a distance.|$|E
5|$|During March, in {{preparation}} for the landings on the peninsula, Robinson led four sorties into the extensive sea minefields around the beaches and bays of Gallipoli. On one of these, his minesweeper was struck by small calibre shells 84 times and the other operations were <b>scarcely</b> less dangerous but, in spite of the Turkish resistance, Robinson was able to clear wide lanes for the invasion forces.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could <b>scarcely</b> have {{satisfied}} in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E
5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either <b>scarcely</b> mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E
5|$|Gurnemanz {{knows that}} the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite. The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk he seems to <b>scarcely</b> move, yet feels as if he is {{traveling}} far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as <b>scarcely</b> touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman {{soldiers}} and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E
5|$|New villages appeared, {{consisting}} of timber houses built {{side by side}} in equal parcels of land. For instance, the <b>scarcely</b> inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses {{consisting of}} a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The most advanced agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy ploughs, also spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{includes}} stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 {{sound and}} presents the video {{in its original}} 1.33:1 aspect ratio. An error in the sound mix on this DVD left much of Peter Frampton's guitar playing <b>scarcely</b> audible. Pegg claimed that as a result, although the picture quality is superior on the DVD release, the original VHS or 1999 DVD remain a superior choice for audio.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is <b>scarcely</b> mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: {{it is seen as}} an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} built using red bricks and white mortar. Architecturally, {{it is of}} a simple Byzantine cross-in-square design, with a single nave and apse. The frescoes in the {{interior}} are only <b>scarcely</b> preserved. It was reconstructed in 1937 after falling into ruin, and it was listed as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer {{to enjoy a}} triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control <b>scarcely</b> reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were <b>scarcely</b> affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some alleys, the pools on the two terraces and the rockery.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are <b>scarcely</b> any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{of these}} titles were <b>scarcely</b> marketable.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{completely}} {{surrounded by}} mountains, Cosenza {{is subject to}} a microclimate <b>scarcely</b> influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, with cold winters and hot summers.|$|E
25|$|According to scholar Mridu Rai, the {{majority}} of Kashmiri Muslims believe they are <b>scarcely</b> better off under Indian rule than the 101 years of Dogra rule.|$|E
25|$|Loss of habitat, water {{pollution}} and downstream effects have been <b>scarcely</b> looked at, because insufficient economic resources have limited {{the involvement of}} institutions responsible for environmental preservation.|$|E
25|$|The victims, when <b>scarcely</b> at {{the edge}} of the opening, {{disappeared}} like a drop of water on a red-hot plate, and white smoke rose amid the great scarlet colour.|$|E
25|$|In 1808 Brown {{took out}} patents for twisted open chain links, joining {{shackles}} and swivels. His shackle and swivel designs were <b>scarcely</b> improved {{on for the}} next 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Aleppo has <b>scarcely</b> {{been touched}} by archaeologists, since the modern city {{occupies}} its ancient site. The site has been occupied from around 5000 BC, as shown by excavations in Tallet Alsauda.|$|E
25|$|While {{they possess}} the general points of {{similarity}} {{that have been}} mentioned, <b>scarcely</b> any two are identical in form. Some are flat and thin, others are thick, or rise in the center upon each side into a shape like the hub of a wheel.|$|E
25|$|Classmates recall Fred as scruffy, dim, lethargic, and {{regularly}} in trouble. Throughout his life, he remained <b>scarcely</b> literate, {{but with an}} aptitude for woodwork and artwork. He left school in December 1956 at age 15, initially working as an unskilled labourer at Moorcourt Farm.|$|E
25|$|Marc Gabolde {{contends that}} Tutankhaten never reigned {{for more than}} a few months at Amarna. He notes that while Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten and even Smenkhkare are attested as kings in Amarna, {{evidence}} for Tutankhaten is limited to some bezel rings. That is, evidence typically associated with a royal residence is lacking: there are no stamped bricks, reliefs or paintings; he is not mentioned or depicted in any private tombs, cult stela, royal depictions or documents; the result is that there is no evidence of King Tutankhaten in Amarna at all. Ring bezels and scarabs bearing his name found only shows the city was still inhabited during his reign. With Neferneferuaten <b>scarcely</b> attested outside Amarna and Tutankaten <b>scarcely</b> attested at Amarna, a coregency or regency seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|In 1806 {{the family}} {{obtained}} a farm, upon which he worked without horses, without capital, and with <b>scarcely</b> any other appliances than a spade and a hoe. At eighteen {{years of age}} he apprenticed himself to a builder and a sawyer, and laboured for some years in a saw-pit.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's House, {{though it}} was <b>scarcely</b> being used, {{provided}} the distant focal centre for Sir Christopher Wren's Greenwich Hospital, with a logic and grandeur that has seemed inevitable to architectural historians but in fact depended on Mary II's insistence that the vista to {{the water from the}} Queen's House not be impaired.|$|E
25|$|The cow is {{considerably}} lighter in make and in colour than the bull. The horns are more slender and upright, with more inward curvature, and the frontal ridge is <b>scarcely</b> perceptible. In young animals the horns are smooth and polished. In old bulls they are rugged and dented at the base.|$|E
25|$|On {{its first}} flight in September 1964 the engines of the TSR-2 were <b>scarcely</b> flightworthy being derated and cleared for one flight. Nevertheless, the risk was deemed {{acceptable}} {{in the political}} climate of the time. With new engines, the TSR-2 XR219 flew another 23 times before the project was cancelled in 1965.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Gustav {{cannot be}} said to have been well educated, but he read widely; there was <b>scarcely</b> a French author of his day with whose works he was not intimately acquainted. His enthusiasm for the ideas of the French {{enlightenment}} was as sincere as that of his mother, if more critical.|$|E
25|$|KCC2b, on {{the other}} hand, is <b>scarcely</b> present during {{prenatal}} development and is strongly upregulated during postnatal development. The upregulation of KCC2b expression {{is thought to be}} responsible for the “developmental shift” observed in mammals from depolarizing postsynaptic effects of inhibitory synapses in early neural networks to hyperpolarizing effects in mature neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Female. Similar, {{with similar}} but {{larger and more}} clearly defined ocelli and markings; the basal half of the {{forewings}} and hindwings on the upperside fuliginous (sooty) brown, <b>scarcely</b> any trace of blue on the hindwing. Antennae brown, head reddish brown, thorax and abdomen above brownish black: palpi, thorax and abdomen beneath dull white.|$|E
25|$|The band {{is unusual}} in several respects. It started as a típico, then became a charanga, then became (in the 1940s) what Cubans call a 'jazzband', meaning a big band. The band has always been based in Holguín, and <b>scarcely</b> ever left Oriente. It is still {{organized}} around family members. It is now called Orquesta Hermanos Avilés.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} of Sluis was now {{reduced to}} great straits by famine, the 4,000 half-starved garrison troops, {{some of them}} <b>scarcely</b> able to walk could not hold out any longer. On 20 August 1604, upon hearing {{the news of the}} retreat of Spinola and Velasco, Governor Serrano {{had no choice but to}} surrender the city to Maurice.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of September 25, the fire emitted was quite {{extraordinary}} and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. The strangest thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would <b>scarcely</b> ever disappear during two months.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, Hussey {{had a major}} {{slump in}} form {{with an average of}} only eight in over 10 innings, which <b>scarcely</b> {{improved}} in the World Cup where he gained an average of 17.4 with 87 runs. However, this was also {{due to a lack of}} opportunities to bat because of Australia's top-order dominance.|$|E
25|$|Bassman's {{later life}} {{was marred by}} tragedy—his {{personal}} life involved three marriages, and the last had a duration of <b>scarcely</b> a year. By the late 1970s, he was cut loose from his career, and he later fell in with the wrong people. He died forgotten by his profession and alone in Los Angeles in 1997.|$|E
