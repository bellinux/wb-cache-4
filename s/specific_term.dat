5|$|There {{are also}} many {{cases where the}} remains of the fetus are found {{separate}} from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

25|$|Note: There is here a {{possible}} confusion between two {{meanings of the}} word transition. (i) In the context of Markov chains, transition is the general term that refers to the change between two states. (ii) In the context of nucleotide changes in DNA sequences, transition is a <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> that refers to the exchange between either the two purines (A ↔ G) or the two pyrimidines (C ↔ T) (for additional details, see the article about transitions in genetics). By contrast, an exchange between one purine and one pyrimidine is called a transversion.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} subtypes of God-Blooded, mostly named for their supernatural parentage: God-Blooded are the {{children}} of gods and elementals, Demon-Blooded are the offspring of demons, Ghost-Blooded {{are the children}} of ghosts using powerful Charms to help them reproduce with mortals, and Half-Caste are the children of powerful Exalts (although exceedingly rare). The Fae-Blooded are the children of a union between the Raksha and mortals. The Mountain Folk can also produce God-Blooded offspring, {{but there is no}} <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> for them. Rules for playing God-Blooded characters are presented in the Exalted Player's Guide in 1st edition, and Scroll of Heroes in 2nd edition.|$|E
25|$|Because only 3 of the 7 DSM-IV {{criteria}} for alcohol dependence are required, not all patients meet the same criteria {{and therefore not}} {{all have the same}} symptoms and problems related to drinking. Not everyone with alcohol dependence, therefore, experiences physiological dependence. Alcohol dependence is differentiated from alcohol abuse by the presence of symptoms such as tolerance and withdrawal. Both alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are sometimes referred to by the less <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> alcoholism. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two major differences between alcohol dependence and alcoholism as generally accepted by the medical community.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol abuse, as {{described}} in the DSM-IV, is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of alcoholic beverages despite its negative consequences. Alcohol abuse is sometimes referred to by the less <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> alcoholism. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking {{for long periods of time}} but are unable to control themselves once they start. Binge drinking is another form of alcohol abuse. Frequent binge drinking or getting severely drunk more than twice is classed as alcohol misuse. According to research done through international surveys, the heaviest drinkers happen to be the United Kingdom's adolescent generation.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} was the liberation of the socii from the perpetual intertribal warfare of the pre-hegemonic peninsula. Endemic chaos {{was replaced by the}} pax Romana. Each socius' remaining territory was secure from aggression by neighbours. As warfare between socii was now prohibited, inter-social disputes were settled by negotiation or, ever more frequently, by Roman arbitration. The confederation also acted as the peninsula's defender against external invasion and domination. Gallic invasions from the North were, from 390 BC when the Senones Gauls destroyed Rome, seen as the most serious danger and continued into the 1st century BC. Many were so large that they could only realistically be turned back by a common effort of all Italians, organised by the confederation. The Romans even coined a <b>specific</b> <b>term</b> for such a mobilisation: the tumultus Gallicus, an emergency levy of all able-bodied men, even men over 46 years of age (who were normally exempt from military service). During the 3rd century BC, the confederation successfully repulsed the invasion of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, which threatened to subject the whole peninsula to Greek and Punic domination respectively. The last such levy was as late as 60 BC, on the eve of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul itself.|$|E
