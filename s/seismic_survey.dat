The most notable include the wells of the Appling Field segment, a mile offshore from Port Alto, which is believed to contain 33 billion cubic feet (0.93 billion cubic meters) of natural gas. The field was first discovered in the 1950s, but later abandoned.

The Treasure Finder semi-submersible accommodation platform supported {{a number of}} offshore oil rigs and normally carried a group of four Bell 212 support helicopters for inter-rig transfers of passengers and freight and medical evacuation. Treasure Finder was also the location of hospital facilities servicing the Brent oilfield. On 14 September 1982, a crewman on the Baffin Seal <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> vessel suffered an injury and the captain placed a request for medical assistance to the Treasure Finder. [...] The Baffin Seals helicopter deck was obstructed so the rescue helicopter {{would not be able}} to land on the vessel but instead would have to winch the casualty aboard.

40|$|Marine <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> use intense (eg >= 230 decibel [dB] root {{mean square}} [RMS]) sound impulses to explore the ocean bottom for {{hydrocarbon}} deposits, conduct geophysical research, and establish resource claims under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The expansion of <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> necessitates greater regional and international dialogue, partnerships, and planning to manage potential environmental risks. Data indicate several reasons for concern about the negative impacts of anthropogenic noise on numerous marine species, including habitat displacement, disruption of biologically important behaviors, masking of communication signals, chronic stress, and potential auditory damage. The sound impulses from <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> - spanning temporal and spatial scales broader than those typically considered in environmental assessments - may have acute, cumulative, and chronic effects on marine organisms. Given the international and transboundary nature of noise from marine <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys,</b> we suggest {{the creation of an}} international regulatory instrument, potentially an annex to the existing International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, to address the issue.

Although most passive seafloor observations use teleseismic waves because part or all survey areas are distant from seismically active regions (e.g., Brillon et al. 2013), the high-frequency components of such waves are insufficient relative to those of active sources. If converted waves could be retrieved from passive <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> at high frequencies, signals obtained from different approaches could be compared or interpreted.|$|R
