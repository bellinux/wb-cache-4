40|$|Work at the University of Newcastle and {{by others}} in {{developing}} methodologies for the Condition Assessment {{of cast iron}} water mains suggests a degree of correlation between the long- term corrosion rates of various cohorts of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> and their method of manufacture. Recent, preliminary data indicates that the older, statically cast pipes perform better than the spun Delavaud pipes introduced into Australasia in 1929 and these, in turn, have better performance than the 'Super Delavaud' pipes manufactured between 1941 and the mid 1970 's when cast iron was superseded by Ductile iron material. These observations differ somewhat from the classical conclusions by Romanoff for USmade pipes. Samples from various cast and <b>spun</b> cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> exhumed in the Sydney and Newcastle region of NSW and originally installed in the period 1909 to 1974 were subjected to metallographic and chemical analysis, {{as well as a}} micro hardness survey, in order to determine differences that may account for this behavior. Elemental segregation mapping of minor elements of each pipe sample was also obtained by SEM/EDS. The preliminary results show that elemental segregation of phosphorus, silicon and other elements did not show any pattern that might account for the better corrosion resistance of the older statically cast pipes and that microstructural differences caused by widely different regimes of cooling rate and heat treatment offer the best basis for the corrosion performance variations. However, at this time the precise relationships between complex microstructures and corrosion resistance remain to be established...|$|R

50|$|Cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> is a pipe {{which has}} had {{historic}} use as a pressure pipe for transmission of water, gas and sewage, and as a water drainage pipe during the 19th and 20th centuries. It comprises predominantly a gray cast iron tube and was frequently used uncoated, although later coatings and linings reduced corrosion and improve hydraulics. Cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> was superseded by ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe,</b> which is a direct development, with most existing manufacturing plants transitioning to the new material during the 1970s and 1980s. Little cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> is currently manufactured.|$|R

5000|$|Ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> is a pipe made of ductile {{cast iron}} {{commonly}} used for potable water transmission and distribution. This type of pipe is a direct development of earlier cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe,</b> which it has superseded. The ductile iron used to manufacture the pipe {{is characterized by the}} spheroidal or nodular nature of the graphite within the <b>iron.</b> Typically, the <b>pipe</b> is manufactured using centrifugal casting in metal or resin lined moulds. Protective internal linings and external coatings are often applied to ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> to inhibit corrosion: the standard internal lining is cement mortar and standard external coatings include bonded zinc, asphalt or water-based paint. In highly corrosive environments loose polyethylene sleeving (LPS) to encase the pipe may also be used. Life expectancy of unprotected ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> depends on the corrosiveness of soil present and tends to be shorter where soil is highly corrosive. However, a lifespan in excess of 100 years has been estimated for ductile iron pipelines installed using [...] "evolved laying practices", including use of properly installed LPS (polyethylene encasement). [...] Studies of ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe's</b> environmental impact have differing findings regarding emissions and energy consumed. Ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> manufactured in the United States has been certified as a sustainable product by the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life of corroded cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior of cast iron, little research has been undertaken to understand how cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form of corrosion of cast <b>iron</b> water <b>pipes.</b> It has also been found that the microstructure of cast irons is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

5000|$|Ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> in the {{developed}} world is normally manufactured exclusively from recycled material including scrap steel and recycled <b>iron.</b> The <b>pipe</b> can be recycled after use. In terms of environmental impact, several studies have compared ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe's</b> impact on the environment with that of other pipe materials. A study by Jeschar et al. in 1995 compared the energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced in manufacturing pipes of various materials including concrete, ductile iron, cast iron and PVC, based on pipes with nominal diameter of 100mm to 500mm. The energy consumed in manufacturing ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> was 19.55 MJ per kg and volume of emissions released during manufacture was 1.430 kg CO2 per kg, compared to 68.30 MJ per kg of energy and 4.860 kg CO2 per kg emissions for PVC pipes, and 1.24 MJ per kg and 0.148 kg CO2 per kg for concrete pipes of the same diameter. Another study the following year, by the Forschungsinstitut für Chemie und Umwelt, had similar findings. However, it also took the lifetime of pipes into account. This study found improved environmental performance for ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> in terms of energy consumed and emissions produced during manufacture due to its longer life span. A more recent study, published August 2012, by Du et al., carried out a life cycle analysis on six types materials used for water and waste water <b>pipes,</b> including ductile <b>iron,</b> PVC, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and concrete. They found that at diameters of ≤ 24 in, ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had the highest [...] "global warming potential" [...] based on emissions from manufacturing, transportation and installation. At larger diameters, ≥ 30 in, ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had a lower [...] "global warming potential", while PVC had the highest. According to a 2008 study by Koo et al., ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had the lowest impact on natural resource depletion, compared to HDPE pipe and PVC pipe. [...] In November 2012, ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> manufactured in the United States received certification as a sustainable product from the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|R

40|$|Cast iron {{was used}} in the water {{industry}} prior to 1970 and a large number of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> still remain as trunk mains. These pipes have been subjected to different levels of corrosion and variety of loading conditions. This leads cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> to fail in the field without prior warning. Water utilities are seeking solutions to optimise cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> renewal and rehabilitation programs for critical water mains (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A new experimental set-up has been developed at Monash University in order to perform burst testing of large diameter cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A section of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe,</b> extracted during maintenance in Sydney, was laser scanned to determine the remaining thickness of the pipe (minimum of 7 - 8 mm at the most critical patches). Although the pipe was pressurised to 3. 6 MPa, catastrophic failure did not occur. Water leakage from the two critically corroded patches was observed at around 3. 25 - 3. 45 MPa internal pressure. Strain results on the outer pipe surface were greater than the strain measured during tensile testing of the same pipe material. A 3 -D finite element model using the scanned pipe dimensions was able to predict the maximum pressure at pipe failure (~ 3. 7 MPa) within the range of leaking water pressure level observed in the experiment...|$|R
