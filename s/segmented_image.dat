40|$|Many image {{compression}} techniques involve segmentation of a gray level image. With such tech-niques, information is extracted {{that describes the}} regions in the <b>segmented</b> <b>image,</b> and this information is then used to form a coded version of the image. In this paper we present a region-growing-based seg-mentation technique that incorporates human visual system properties, and describe {{the use of this}} tech-nique in {{image compression}}. We also discuss the effect of requantizing a <b>segmented</b> <b>image.</b> Requantization of a <b>segmented</b> <b>image</b> is useful because it can lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} bits required to code the description of the regions in the <b>segmented</b> <b>image.</b> This results in a lower data rate. We show that the number of gray levels in a <b>segmented</b> <b>image</b> can be reduced by a factor of at least twelve, without noticeable degradation in the quality of the <b>segmented</b> <b>image.</b> This result is attributable to human visual system properties having to do with contrast sensitivity, and to the fact that requantization of a <b>segmented</b> <b>image</b> does not usually reduce significantly the number of distinct segments in the image. In addition, in this paper we explore the relationship between the number of segments in an image, and the extent of requantization possible before noticeable degradation occurs in the image...|$|E

Given an over <b>segmented</b> <b>image</b> that entails of many small regions, our algorithm automatically combines those neighboring regions that produce the largest increase in modularity index. When the modularity of the <b>segmented</b> <b>image</b> is increased, the method stops merging and produces the final <b>segmented</b> <b>image.</b> To preserve the repetitive patterns in a homogeneous region, we propose a feature {{on the basis}} of the histogram of states of image gradients and use it together with the color feature to characterize the similarity of two regions.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of two conventional clustering-based segmentation methods and proposes an improved method for <b>segmenting</b> <b>images</b> captured under natural environment. Image segmentation refers to a process that separate area of interest from the background with the aim to extracts object of interest only for further image analysis. However, the segmentation process is very challenging for experiment conducted in outdoor environment due to the non-uniform illumination. Different illuminations produce different colour intensity for the object surface which leads to inaccurate <b>segmented</b> <b>images.</b> The widely used clustering-based segmentation methods are K-means and Fuzzy c -means (FCM). However, both methods have several limitations in producing good quality <b>segmented</b> <b>images</b> of objects that {{are exposed to the}} natural illumination. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved clustering-based segmentation method (Adaptive K-means) that is able to partition natural images accurately. The performance of three segmentation methods are evaluated on fruit images and compared quantitatively using similarity index (SI) and Tanimoto Coefficient (TC). The results show that Adaptive K-means has the ability to produce more accurate and perfect <b>segmented</b> <b>images</b> compared to the conventional K-means and FCM...|$|R

40|$|Computer vision {{techniques}} have opened doors for practical, reliable and much safer methods for monitoring the animal populations {{in comparison with}} traditional methods. Old methods such as capturing the animals and installing sensors on their bodies are time consuming and may cause stress to the animals and affect their behavior. In this study, an automatic image based identification algorithm to identify endangered Saimaa ringed seals is proposed. The identification algorithm consists of three main steps including image segmentation, image enhancement, and identification. The image segmentation method contains two steps: unsupervised segmentation and classification of the superpixels. The algorithm provides promising results by {{using a combination of}} different feature descriptors and classifiers. In the enhancement step, morphological operations, contrast enhancement, and color normalization are applied for <b>segmented</b> <b>images</b> to increase the performance. In the identification step, two algorithms were tested: Wild ID and Hot spotter. The identification algorithms were implemented on original <b>images,</b> <b>segmented</b> <b>images</b> and enhanced <b>segmented</b> <b>images.</b> The best results were obtained using Hot spotter tested with the enhanced <b>segmented</b> <b>images.</b> With a challenging data set used, 44 % of the seals were correctly identified within the first match.

The <b>segmented</b> <b>images</b> are used for making 3 D images, which are helpful to medical education and research. To achieve this purpose, the following trials were performed. The entire body of a volunteer was scanned to make 557 MRIs. On Adobe Photoshop, contours of 19 anatomical structures in the MRIs were semiautomatically drawn using MAGNETIC LASSO TOOL and manually corrected using either LASSO TOOL or DIRECT SELECTION TOOL to make 557 <b>segmented</b> <b>images.</b> In a similar manner, 13 anatomical structures in 8, 590 anatomical <b>images</b> were <b>segmented.</b> Proper segmentation was verified by making 3 D <b>images</b> from the <b>segmented</b> <b>images.</b> Semiautomatic segmentation using Adobe Photoshop is expected to be widely used for segmentation of anatomical structures in various medical images...|$|R
