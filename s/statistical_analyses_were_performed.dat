40|$|AbstractThis paper studies {{whether there}} is an {{association}} between the risk of developing an eating disorder in adolescence and social attitudes concerning appearance, especially those circulated in the media. The sample was composed of 119 subjects, and the instruments used were EAT- 26 and SATAQ. The results indicate the existence of statistically significant correlations between the risk of eating disorders in adolescence and all facets of social and cultural attitudes regarding appearance: importance, pressure, internalization/TV-magazines, internalizing/athlete, internalizing/comparison, awareness. When <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> differently in boys and girls, we see the existence of different intensities of these correlations. This result indicates that future studies could orientate to test the hypothesis of the existence of gender differences in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Catholics {{have lived}} in the United States since colonial times and have become {{increasingly}} important culturally and politically throughout the nation's history. Catholics were primarily constituents of the Democratic Party throughout the 19 th Century but this affiliation fell apart after World War II. Today, Catholics are nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. This paper addresses the question, what is the impact of Catholicism on party affiliation? Using data from the University of Chicago's General Social Survey, <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> to answer this question. The paper comes to the conclusion that Catholicism is not a statistically significant factor to party affiliation and that socio-economic factors are more relevant to political identity.

This case-control study was initiated in France to determine the possible etiologic relation between tobacco smoking and lower limb venous insufficiency. A total of 1, 806 cases suffering from lower limb venous insufficiency, recruited by 460 general practitioners between April 1997 and April 1998, were matched by age and gender to 1, 806 controls. Data were collected on the physical examination, medical reason for consulting, current treatments, smoking habits, and known risk factors of lower limb venous insufficiency.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 With the {{increased}} prevalence of virtualization {{in the modern}} computing environment, the security of that technology becomes of paramount importance. Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) {{is one of the}} technologies that has emerged to provide security for virtual environments by examining and then interpreting the state of an active Virtual Machine (VM). VMI has seen use in systems administration, digital forensics, intrusion detection, and honeypots. As with any technology, VMI has both productive uses as well as harmful uses. The research presented in this dissertation aims to enable a guest VM to determine if it is under examination by an external VMI agent. To determine if a VM is under examination a series of <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> on timing data generated by the guest itself...|$|R

Both motions and air gap time-histories <b>are</b> available: <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> both for the absolute near-structure wave elevation (with respect to a fixed observer), and the relative wave elevation (with respect to the moving structure). Several probabilistic models are studied to predict these near-structure wave elevations: a linear diffrac-tion model typical of standard practice, and several new hybrid model that include second-order effects in the incident wave, {{but not in the}} diffracted wave. The first of these hybrid models is moment-based, while the second relies on narrow-band theory. Either model can be implemented in place of the standard linear-only model with little additional computational effort, as onl...|$|R

Two <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> to evaluate their impact on precipitation, which is determined by averaging the records from eight weather stations in Taiwan from 1897 to 1993. One analysis utilizes the so-called El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon as a co-factor, while the other does not. It is very note-worthy that both analyses show a statistically significant drought effect on this local region's precipitation as brought on by such sulfur-rich volcanic activities. The timing of the occurrence of these volcanic events are highly correlated with the drought periods in Taiwan, and the magnitudes of their influence are found to be two to ten times greater than those by the ENSO...|$|R
