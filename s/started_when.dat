5|$|All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire {{during the}} 6th century BC. The Greco-Persian Wars <b>started</b> <b>when</b> the Greek city {{states on the}} coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule in 499 BC. The {{territory}} of Turkey later fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC, which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area.|$|E

5|$|O'Gara's {{last minute}} {{conversion}} against Gloucester on 18 January 2003 helped Munster to a 27-point victory which took them {{through to the}} Heineken Cup quarter final; this match {{has come to be}} known in Munster folklore as the Miracle Match. He was part of the Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat Neath 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium. O'Gara turned down the chance to join NFL side Miami Dolphins in March 2003.

5|$|On March 28, {{the second}} phase of the {{operation}} <b>started</b> <b>when</b> several hundred rebels marched into Saigon dressed all in white, armed with only sticks and spears. Before the march, they had ingested potions that purportedly made them invisible. However, the French military were able to capture more than 80 of the supposedly invisible rebels during demonstrations against French rule. The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E

His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music <b>started</b> <b>when</b> he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Saad, {{opposition}} in Mecca <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the polytheism {{practiced by the}} Meccan forefathers. However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching. As his followers increased, Muhammad became {{a threat to the}} local tribes and rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Ka'aba, the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba. Powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching; he was offered admission to the inner circle of merchants, as well as an advantageous marriage. He refused both of these offers.|$|E

5|$|Although Arsenal and Manchester United had {{previously}} contested many significant matches, Sir Alex Ferguson believed the rivalry started in January 1987 when David Rocastle was sent off for retaliating against a foul on Norman Whiteside. It is, however, generally perceived {{to have begun}} in October 1990, when a brawl between both sides at Old Trafford resulted in both clubs being docked points in the 1990–91 First Division. The scuffle <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Arsenal's Anders Limpar, who scored the only goal of the game, contested for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin. Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn tackled Irwin, which prompted Brian McClair and Irwin to retaliate. Winterburn was pushed onto the advertising hoardings and all the players bar goalkeeper David Seaman partook in a 20-second mêlée. As well as a points deduction, both clubs fined several of their players, and in Arsenal's case, their manager too. Arsenal and United next faced each other at Highbury {{a little over a}} month later in the Football League Cup fourth round. 19-year-old winger Lee Sharpe scored a hat-trick as United won the tie 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Both sources {{agree that}} Alfano imposed his {{position}} when he defeated the Camorra head, the capintesta Totonno 'o Pappagallo (The Parrot) – so-named for his beak parrot nose – in a zumpata – {{a kind of}} ritual initiation knife duel – {{despite the fact that}} his adversary sent his Mastino dog to attack Alfano. The conflict <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Pappagallo returned from prison and found Alfano in control of his former territory. Other sources mention that after the death of Cappuccio, Giuseppe Chirico, 'o Granatiere (The Grenadier), from the Porta San Gennaro neighbourhood was elected. He was defeated in a zumpata by Totonno 'o Pappagallo, who took over the reign before being defeated by Alfano {{around the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739's {{designation}} is {{from the}} Henry Draper catalogue. The star was also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations {{that led to the}} discovery of the planet HD 205739 b <b>started</b> <b>when</b> the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 205739, the star was observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal-rich star; the N2K collaboration biased their search towards metal-rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets, hoping to find a connection between a star's metallicity and its planets' masses.|$|E

5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is <b>started</b> <b>when</b> a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
5|$|Jacob {{attends a}} lecture given by Gekko and {{introduces}} himself. Gekko {{tells him that}} KZI's collapse <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Bretton spread rumors of KZI having toxic debt. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors {{to invest in the}} fusion project through Church.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80.|$|E

5|$|Quarterback Doc Kuhn {{started the}} second half after sitting out the first because of injuries, invigorating the Commodores. The second scoring drive <b>started</b> <b>when</b> Paul Stumb intercepted a pass. Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end before Kuhn {{connected}} with Tot McCullough for a 25-yard pass. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining few yards for the touchdown. Alabama {{had a chance to}} score, making it to Vanderbilt's 18-yard line. The Commodore defense prevailed, Alabama's forward passes failed, and the ball went over on downs. Other chances included Alabama halfback Rosenfeld intercepting a pass with a clear field ahead of him, returning it 32 yards before Vanderbilt's Red Rountree tackled him from behind. Alabama back Charles Bartlett also returned a punt 25 yards before he was tackled by the last Commodore who could have done so. The Crimson Tide was captained by sophomore end Al Clemens, later captain of the first Alabama team coached by Wallace Wade.|$|E

She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph. Whilst doing a piece for GMTV, he asked Constantine to report the women's World Cup Final in cricket on finding out that it was her passion. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Morotai, {{part of the}} Pacific War, {{began on}} 15 September 1944, and {{continued}} {{until the end of}} the war in August 1945.

The invading forces greatly outnumbered the island's Japanese defenders and secured their objectives in two weeks. Japanese reinforcements landed on the island between September and November, but lacked the supplies needed to effectively attack the Allied defensive perimeter. Intermittent fighting continued {{until the end of the}} war, with the Japanese troops suffering heavy loss of life from disease and starvation.|$|E
