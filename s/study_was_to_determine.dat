25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption. The purpose of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014–2015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy beverages at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} study, {{subjects}} {{were invited to}} watch a short film and to answer some questionnaires two days later. The goal of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the same social sharing occurs in the real life. [...] The results showed once again that {{a higher level of}} sharing results from exposure to the intense emotion condition. The findings observed in the first two experiments were therefore reproduced in this third study, despite the different method of measuring social sharing. Together, these results strongly suggest that the emotional intensity of the event determined the extent of social sharing.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{study in}} the Journal of Orthopaedics the {{prevalence}} of a rotator cuff tear was considerably greater in males than in females within the ages of 50–60 years old, within the ages of 70–80 years old there wasn’t much difference in prevalence. The data of this study showed that the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear in the general population is 22.1% [...] Yamamoto et al. performed a medical examination on 683 people whom live in a mountain village. The purpose of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear among a population. Yamamoto found that among the mountain village population, rotator cuff tears were present in 20.7% of the village population. In both of these studies we see that the percentages of the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear are very close in number so these numbers show us the prevalence of rotator cuff tears in the general population.|$|E

50|$|An {{extensive}} {{study was}} done to determine how thick the sole of a soldier's boot could be before it interfered with his/her actions. It was found that a 2-inch thick sole affected certain squatting positions and was less comfortable than a thinner sole, but can ultimately be implemented in exoskeleton designs.

50|$|Experimental {{research}} {{is used to}} determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental {{research is}} a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed {{no significant difference between}} the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire.|$|E

50|$|In {{one study}} {{it was found}} that the putamen {{controls}} limb movement. The goal of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether particular cell activity in the putamen of primates was related to the direction of limb movement or to the underlying pattern of muscular activity. Two monkeys were trained to perform tasks that involved the movement of loads. The tasks were created so that movement could be distinguished from muscle activity. Neurons in the putamen were selected for monitoring only if they were related both to the task and to arm movements outside the task. It was shown that 50% of the neurons that were monitored were related to the direction of movement, independent of the load.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the safety and effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle {{in an attempt to}} promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing. This study recruited patients who had heart failure, but would no longer benefit from other forms of standard treatment such as surgery or coronary artery repair procedures such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement. The results of this study were presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Meeting in 2012 and simultaneously published in JAMA.|$|E
50|$|One {{particular}} {{study used}} patients with focal lesions on the basal ganglia (specifically the putamen) due to stroke {{in order to}} study category learning. The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the prefrontal cortex {{are more likely to}} be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.|$|E

5000|$|The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study {{examined}} the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The {{aim of the}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The initial study was published in 1976 by Sandra Scarr and Richard A. Weinberg. A follow-up study was published in 1992 by Richard Weinberg, Sandra Scarr and Irwin D. Waldman. Another related study investigating social adjustment in a subsample of the adopted black children was published in 1996. One of the studies' findings was the IQs of adopted black children reared by white families {{did not differ significantly}} from that of black children raised by their biological parents.|$|E
5000|$|Rudolf Werner Georg Hippius (9 June 1905 in Schadriza, Pskov Oblast - 23 October 1945 in Prague) was a German-Baltic psychologist. He is {{best known}} for his work in [...] "racial psychology" [...] carried out under the auspices of the Nazi regime, and {{specifically}} his study of the [...] "suitability" [...] of German-Slavonic mischlinge which he carried out in the occupied University of Poznan from 1942-1944. The objective of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether individuals who were of mixed German and Slavonic heritage were suitable to be considered for German citizenship or if they should be deported. It was during this period that Konrad Lorenz worked with him on the project, and which was to affect the later reputation of Lorenz. He died in a Soviet prison camp in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, {{the then}} Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, tasked the then Brigadier Baker to: [...] conduct {{a study of}} the {{existing}} ADF command arrangements in order to recommend further development to meet likely requirements into the 21st century for both low and high levels of operations. [...] One of the principal aims of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the optimal command arrangements for ADF air power. The final report, commonly referred to as the Baker Report, was published in March 1988. Despite extensive reference being made to the command and control challenges posed by air power, Baker did not provide definitive guidance on how the ADF should structure its command arrangements to optimise the development and employment of air power. However, Chapter 7 of the report strongly advocated the creation of NORCOM, a recommendation that was soon adopted by the ADF.|$|E
