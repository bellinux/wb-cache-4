Woods <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Johnson {{pointed out}} that an appeal to {{conscience}} should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson, {{was nothing more than}} a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known. [...] "No man's conscience", <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> [...] "can tell him the right of another man... it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another." ...|$|E
500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Johnson.</b> [...] "I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent. If you wait for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Johnson said {{he could}} [...] "still feel" [...] the lower-back injury that bothered him {{throughout}} his rookie season. Johnson took five weeks off after the 2007 season and was {{taking part in the}} Lions' offseason program. [...] "I know it's there but it doesn't hurt," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Johnson</b> revealed that he needed Vicodin to play through the final three months of the 2007 season. He needed the medication to help him play with a bone bruise in his back. [...] "I was on meds the rest of the season," [...] he said. [...] "I was taking Vicodin twice a game just to get through the game. I stayed hurt the whole season, probably because I was trying to come back too soon." [...] Johnson averaged 15.8 yards on 48 catches in the 2007 season.|$|E
500|$|On the Declaration of Independence {{the colonies}} became {{sovereign}} states. They were so acknowledged by {{the treaty of}} peace of 1783, and Great Britain by that treaty ‘relinquished all claims to the government, property, and territorial rights' within the several colonies. It is the received opinion that the colonies succeeded to {{the title of the}} crown to all the ungranted lands within their respective boundaries, with the exclusive right to extinguish by purchase the Indian title, and to regulate dealings with the Indian tribes. ‘There was no territory in the United States,’ <b>said</b> <b>JOHNSON,</b> J., in Harcourt v. Gaillard, 12 Wheat. 523, ‘that was claimed in any other right than that of one of the confederated states; therefore there could be no acquisition of territory made by the United States distinct from or independent of some one of the United States.’ ...|$|E
500|$|As his {{contract}} {{was due to}} expire in the summer, Johnson signed a one-year extension with Northampton keeping him at the club until 2013 on 16 May 2012. After signing, manager Aidy Boothroyd said he expected Johnson to realise his full potential in the coming season. However, Johnson suffered a cartilage injury in October 2012 that ruled him out for four to six weeks. He made a return in a 1–1 draw against York City, but his return was short-lived when he came off at half-time and was out until January after undergoing knee surgery. After making his return on 19 January 2013 against AFC Wimbledon in a 1–1 draw, Boothroyd <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> made the team tougher and more aggressive. Later in the 2012–13 season, Johnson regained his first team place and the club finished in sixth place, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. Johnson described the team as [...] "the strongest" [...] he had played in. Johnson was an unused substitute in the play-offs as Northampton Town lost 3–0 on aggregate against Bradford City. He was released by Northampton {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E

500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, <b>said</b> <b>Johnson,</b> they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E
500|$|T.C. {{was portrayed}} by Rodney Van Johnson from July 5, 1999 to June 19, 2007; Johnson was dropped to {{recurring}} status in December 2006 before his last appearance in June 2007. On March 19, 2001, Jerry Gaona played the character in flashbacks. Once T. C. was developed beyond {{the role of}} [...] "the angry black man" [...] and {{it became clear that}} the contents of his secret shed were not important to the plot, Johnson felt that his presence in the show was dramatically reduced. After being reduced to the status of a recurring cast member, he expressed doubt that he would return to the show in its final episodes. T.C.'s relationship with Eve, and Johnson's chemistry with Ross, did not receive much attention from the fans or the media. Other Passions cast members and representatives commented on the preference for Julian over T.C.; Masters said his character Julian should [...] "just kick T.C. out of his house" [...] and beat him with a 4x4, and a spokesperson from the show pushed Julian and Eve's romance to the forefront as [...] "a new supercouple in Harmony" [...] without any mention of T.C. Internationally, T. C. received a more positive response. African newspaper Mmegi <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> was invited to the 2005 Miss Culture and Heritage contest in Botswana due to his performance of T.C. as a [...] "husband and father in the soap that warms the hearts of many in different countries".|$|E

5000|$|Chief Brown <b>said</b> that <b>Johnson,</b> who was black, {{was upset}} about recent police shootings and the Black Lives Matter movement, and [...] "stated {{he wanted to}} kill white people, {{especially}} white officers." [...] A friend and former coworker of Johnson's described him as [...] "always being distrustful of the police." [...] Another former coworker said he seemed [...] "very affected" [...] by recent police shootings of black men. A friend <b>said</b> that <b>Johnson</b> had anger management problems and would repeatedly watch video of the 1991 beating of Rodney King by police officers.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were you," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "I should {{push for}} a {{first-class}} place in London--take almost nothing and live on my reserves. That's what I should do." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2010, Amy Goldson, {{counsel for}} the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, <b>said</b> that <b>Johnson</b> {{violated}} organizational rules by awarding scholarship money to four relatives of her own and two children of a top aide. Awards come with an anti-nepotism rule, and winners must live or study in the Congress member's district. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> she [...] "unknowingly" [...] {{made a mistake in}} awarding the grants and would work with the foundation to rectify it.|$|R
2500|$|The house {{builds on}} ideas of German architects from the 1920s ("Glasarchitektur"). In {{a house of}} glass, {{the views of the}} {{landscape}} are its [...] “wallpaper” ("I have very expensive wallpaper," [...] Johnson once <b>said.)</b> <b>Johnson</b> was also inspired by the design of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House. Glass House contains several pieces of furniture designed by Mies.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmie Johnson {{held off}} Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick to score his 70th career win. “It’s a {{testament}} to this team {{and the fact that}} we’ll never give up,” <b>said</b> <b>Johnson.</b> “We’ll always keep fighting and keep trying to make our cars better. We’re not in the Chase and not where we want to be - fighting for the championship.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson’s {{biggest impact}} on the {{business}} was his role in diversification. <b>Said</b> <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "The primary objective for a corporate leader is to ensure institutional survival.... To survive you have to grow. To grow you have to diversify... When a company is diversified into various fields, it is rarely seriously vulnerable to {{the ups and downs}} that ravage individual business. And if you are geographically diversified... then you have some insulation between yourself and localized political and economic trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll {{have to be}} {{a walking}} party," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Johnson</b> cheerfully. [...] "There's only two coaches. I daresay we can put in six in each, but that leaves three over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's not hating them now," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Johnson,</b> [...] "you may {{be sure of}} that. It's {{just because}} of that I {{think they ought to}} come--all of them--even your Aunt Mildred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{a lovely}} place you've got here!' <b>said</b> Miss <b>Johnson,</b> when the miller had {{received}} {{her from the}} captain. 'A real stream of water, a real mill- wheel, and real fowls, and everything!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Johnson {{incorporated}} {{environmentally responsible}} behavior into his business and believed that all businesses could be successful with the same mindset. <b>Said</b> <b>Johnson</b> of his involvement with the council, [...] "We aggressively seek out eco-efficiencies--ways of doing more with less--because it makes us more competitive when we reduce and eliminate waste and risk from our products and processes. And it saves us money. By developing products that are as safe as possible for people and the environment, we improve our market share." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Said</b> <b>Johnson</b> in 1988, [...] "For voluntarism to {{take hold}} {{as part of a}} company's culture, there must be a key {{executive}} who sets the example by personal involvement.... I spend a good twenty to thirty percent of my time, or about two days of every seven, on what I call ‘not-for-profit’ activities.... Raising money is only one part of voluntarism; indeed it is not the most important. A more important part is the devotion of time by the people who actually service the organizations and spend a good portion of their free time working at no pay." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Quandt {{wrote about}} Johnson's meeting with Eban on October 24, 1967, {{and noted that}} Israel had annexed East Jerusalem. He <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> forcefully told Eban he thought Israel had been unwise when it went to war and that he still thought they were unwise. The President {{stressed}} the need to respect the territorial integrity of the Arab states. Quandt said [...] "'The President wished to caution the Israelis that the further they get from June 5 the further they get from peace.' Meaning the more territory they insisted on holding beyond the 1967 lines, the worse would be the odds of getting a peace agreement with the Arabs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope everyone'll take a {{glass of}} sherry and a biscuit," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Johnson.</b> [...] "We don't stand on ceremony," [...] and a {{decanter}} appeared {{in the place of}} Uncle Pentstemon's vegetables.|$|R
50|$|Sidney A. Marchand in his Story of Ascension Parish <b>said</b> that <b>Johnson</b> had bequeathed {{the land}} in Donaldsonville on which was built the present-day Ascension Episcopal Church (at the corner of Attakapas/Nicholls and St. Patrick streets).|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it strange," [...] <b>said</b> John <b>Johnson</b> to Robin, as they {{leaned over}} the side and {{looked down into the}} clear water, [...] "that a Englishman should become a Rajah, and get {{possession}} o' this here country?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 1998, Columbus Mayor Greg Latshukta {{announced}} he would not seek a third term in 1999. [...] Johnson briefly considered {{a run for the}} seat, but decided against it. [...] The same month, Johnson told The Columbus Dispatch he was investigating overturning the city council's vote to grant benefits to domestic partners of city employers, according them the same treatment as spouses. [...] Johnson objected to the idea itself, the cost, {{and the manner in which}} the question was rushed through the council without any public notice or debate. [...] "No matter what you think of the merits, the process on an issue they knew could raise serious questions from the public was circumvented," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Johnson.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father’s {{journey with}} his two sons. Johnson {{undertook}} the journey, documented in a 2001 film called Carnauba: A Son’s Memoir, in a replica Sikorsky S-38 amphibious plane like the one his father used. During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. <b>Said</b> <b>Johnson</b> of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey. [...] Gene said I was doing it {{to spend more time with}} my father after all these years... in the end that turned out to be true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historians have debated {{just why}} Johnson quit {{a few days}} after his weak showing in New Hampshire. Jeff Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the {{indicators}} turned negative he decided to leave. Lewis L. Gould maintains that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the very last minute, when {{it was too late for}} Johnson to recover. Randall Bennett Woods <b>said</b> <b>Johnson</b> realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. [...] Robert Dallek writes that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. [...] His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. [...] Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. [...] Anthony J. Bennett, however, claims Johnson [...] "had been forced out of a re-election race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia".|$|E
