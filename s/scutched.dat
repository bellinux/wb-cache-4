50|$|<b>Scutching</b> {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The <b>scutching</b> process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers. <b>Scutching</b> can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand <b>scutching</b> of flax is done with a wooden <b>scutching</b> knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of <b>scutching</b> flax are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|R

50|$|Fine {{spinning}} {{produced a}} lot of waste so naturally this was recycled. This waste was the raw material of a condensor spinning mill. It came in three forms, loose staple, unspun rovings and spun thread (hard waste) that had been pirned but rejected.

After these processes the staple was very short, and the processing of the lap was different - a Derby Doubler was used to mix slivers into sliver lap. A notable feature of the mule was that the rovings weren't on individual bobbins but on a beam. As the fine spinning of cotton contracted so did the need for condensing.|$|E

50|$|The <b>scutching</b> knife is scraped {{down with}} a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically.

5000|$|The linen {{should be}} sown in March, in the {{beginning}} of the Spring season. In the Summer, the harvest is done - people pull out the linen, to make good use the textile fiber, which is found in the stalk. Then, we must hackle the linen, which consist of taking of the seed with the “ripo” (a comb made of iron). The next action is to soak - the linen stays for two weeks in current but not very strong water. Then, it will dry in a previously cut and cleaned field. The linen balls are placed on the field. Once dry, the linen is <b>scutched.</b> This action is made in “espadeladouro”, with a flax-comb (a wooden board and a hive (cylinder made of cork). The purpose is to separate the fibres. The linters are taken out (rough, thick and short fibre, which is also used to make some kind cloth, like mattress liners, kitchen rags and flour sacs). The fibre that remains, after the separation of the linters, is put in a machine, which repeatedly tramples the linen in the river. The linen can also be made with a maul. In this way the linen is squeezed. Now it is time to go to the next step, which consists of putting the fibre that remained in a machine that softens the linen and makes it glossy, separating the linen from the cotton waste (that remains trapped inside the machine making the linen become finer). The linen is now ready to be sharpened. For its spinning, the distaff and the spinning wheel are used, turning the fibre into thread.|$|E
50|$|The {{area that}} is now Meddersheim was settled {{as far back as}} Celtic and Roman times, and perhaps even earlier. Various archaeological finds of {{remnants}} of a Roman estate on Römerstraße (“Roman road”), extensive foundations and an ancient watermain bear witness to this. The current clump village arose in Frankish times (6th century) at a favourable, flat site as a crossroads outside the River Nahe’s floodplain. Until the 13th century, the village of Meddersheim belonged to the Archbishops of Mainz, then passing by way of pledge to the Waldgraves at the Kyrburg (castle). They held it until the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century. It was administered by a Mainz Schultheiß who was responsible to the Burgrave at Disibodenberg, or beginning in 1240 in Sobernheim, and thereafter, beginning in 1279 at Castle Böckelheim. In 1239, there was a serious dispute between the Archbishop and the Counts in the Nahe region, who opposed the Prince-Archbishop-Elector’s political reach into the Nahe region. Moreover, there was the disagreement over the pledge of Meddersheim with Kirschroth, which was always bound with Meddersheim. Although the Archbishop redeemed both villages, the Waldgrave at the Kyrburg, as heir to the Counts of Saarbrücken, did not wish to give them up. The Archbishop prevailed, but later, one of his successors pledged the Schultheißerei once again, this time for good. The feudal and tithing rights were always shared out among several lordships. The oldest part of the church, the steeple, comes from the 12th century, while the nave, after several conversions and additions, comes from 1756. Particularly worthy of mention are the pulpit from the 18th century, the 1753 Stumm organ and the 16th-century baptismal font. In 1798, the French overran the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank and imposed their own administrative system on the land. Meddersheim became the seat of a mairie (“mayoralty”) in the Canton of Meisenheim, which also comprised Kirschroth and Staudernheim, and which lay in the Department of Sarre. No later than Napoleonic times, something akin to gavelkind - equal division of land among heirs - was introduced. This led to splintering of businesses and in many cases to impoverishment among smallhold farmers. After Napoleon had been driven out in 1814, Meddersheim was, after a short transitional time, assigned {{under the terms of the}} Congress of Vienna in 1816 to the Oberamt of Meisenheim, and it was then furthermore the seat of an Oberschultheißerei. Thus did Meddersheim become with the Oberamt of Meisenheim an exclave of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. In 1866, it passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Then, in 1869, the region passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, and Meddersheim now belonged to the Meisenheim district in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the Rhine Province. In 1919, after the First World War, the Bürgermeistereien (“Mayoralties”) of Meddersheim and Merxheim were merged. After the Meisenheim district was dissolved in 1932, the Amt (as it had been called since 1927) no longer existed. In 1935, Meddersheim had the same municipal administration - as it were, a “personal union” at the municipal level - but in 1940, the former Amt of Meddersheim was merged with the Amt of Sobernheim, from which arose the Verbandsgemeinde of Sobernheim in 1969. On Lehmkaut (a street), remnants of a brickworks could still be seen until the 1960s. Made here, right in the village, were field-fired bricks. In Andreas Gottfried’s former potter’s shop, pottery was made until 1968. The flax that was extensively grown here on the heaths, whose poorer soils were subjected to controlled burns, was retted in a great flax-retting tank, which is believed to have been communally organized. In the area of Brechkaut and Brechlöcher (laneways?) there were major brick kilns, and at their ends lay the hot-air shaft measuring about 2 × 3 m on which the flax was retted so that it could then be <b>scutched</b> and heckled. The former herdsmen’s houses of the herding association have been gone since the 1950s. Listed for a time within Meddersheim’s limits were five mills and one pig farm. At the Ilsberg was a quarry. The red shale sandstone were quarried until some time towards the end of the 18th century, whereafter yellow-grey quarried sandstone from surrounding villages was used. In the Reformation, the inhabitants of Meddersheim became Protestant under the then local lordship. During renovations at Saint Martin’s Evangelical church in 1964, the Baroque screen around the altar was removed. For generations, the church was shared. During Catholic Mass, the gate was closed. A few epitaphs, a ceiling-high sacramental shrine in the Gothic quire and a Stumm organ, together with a series of pictures on the gallery bear witness to the wealth of this winegrowing, farming and craft village. In 1960, Meddersheim had some 750 inhabitants. By 2010 it was nearly 1,400.|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: <b>scutched</b> fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There {{is a need}} for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of <b>scutched</b> flax and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of <b>scutched</b> flax. Tow bundles were 15 % shorter than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles and tow bundles were 25 % thicker than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of <b>scutched</b> flax allowed volume fractions of 0. 7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0. 6.

Both NHF and SHF with strong mechanical properties are good candidates as reinforcing fibres for plastics such as polypropylene (PP). The PP/NHF and PP/SHF composites were blended via internal mixing process. The effect of fibres on the morphology, thermal resistance and reinforcement of the composites were investigated. PP/NHF composites showed higher impact strength, lower flexural strength than PP/SHF at the corresponding loading because NHF has smaller diameter and better thermal resistance than SHF. Meanwhile, NHF has the similar reinforcement to tensile strength with SHF. The effect of maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) on the fibre-resin interface bonding was also comparatively studied. With increasing amount of MAPP, the tensile, flexural and impact strengths of PP/NHF and PP/SHF increased, respectively. The morphology of PP/SHF and PP/NHF results well showed that MAPP improved the interaction of the fibres with PP through chemical adhesion. ...|$|E

The first <b>scutching</b> machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The <b>scutching</b> machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in {{open air}} or by {{mechanical}} means, and are frequently stored {{for a short}} period to allow [...] "curing" [...] to occur, facilitating fibre removal.

Some machines combine breaking and <b>scutching</b> operations. Waste material from the first <b>scutching,</b> consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time.

40|$|International audienceCultivated {{primarily}} for its seeds, oleaginous flax {{could also be}} valued for the different fractions that can be extracted from the straw. However, as the straws are not harvested with the same technique and care than for the textile flax, the classical scutching technique cannot be used. As a consequence, an “all fibre” device was used to perform {{the separation of the}} different constituents of the oleaginous flax straws. The different fractions were quantified for two retting levels and for two degrees of rewetting of the stems. The physical and mechanical properties of fibres were then evaluated. It appears that the relative amount of fibres extracted from oleaginous flax straw is comparable to the one from textile flax (i. e. 40 % of the stem dry mass), and their tensile properties are situated in {{the lower part of the}} textile flax range. This work shows that the individual fibre length of oleaginous flax (between 3 and 6 cm) is comparable to that of the <b>scutched</b> textile flax fibres.

40|$|The {{influence}} of compounding and injection moulding {{on the initial}} variability and morphology of short straw flax fibres is determined and the mechanical properties for the injection moulded fibre reinforced composites are measured. It is found that {{the composition of the}} straw flax, flax fibre bundles and woody parts, together with the cutting process strongly affects the initial fibre morphology and its variability. In the initial fibres, small particles as well as long fibres with large width were found. A filter was used to reject the fibres with an aspect ratio below 15 before calculating statistics because these fibres have a negligible contribution to the composite reinforcement. After processing, the initial fibre length and width decrease strongly (− 38 % to − 66 % for length and − 22 % to − 72 % for width). Also, the variability is affected resulting in a standard deviation shifted towards lower fibre lengths and widths (− 55 % for length and − 71 % for width). The improvement of mechanical properties of the flax compound compared to the pure matrix material for the injection-moulded samples is found to be similar to the results for compounds with further processed flax fibres such as <b>scutched</b> and hackled fibres. An increase of tensile strength by 20 % was found, for stiffness the increase is in the order of 50 – 70 %.

In only one decade, plant biomass could {{in the form of}} cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin renew the 20 ZJ energy stored as conventional crude oil. Although the relatively high cost of both pretreatment and enzymes that catalyze cellulose hydrolysis [one-third of the cost of ethanol production from cellulose] still represents a major barrier to commercialization, cellulosic ethanol production is currently in the pilot plant stage, with more than 30 pilot plants being operated in both North-America and Europe. The process generally consists of a pretreatment step, a hydrolysis and a fermentation step. In these processes lignin is discharged as a byproduct {{that can be used to}} supply the process with energy. It is however generally believed that a successful bioenergy research policy should focus on biorefineries, co-producing transportation fuels, power, heat, added-value chemicals and materials from biomass. In the IWT TETRA [a grant program to stimulate innovation in Flemish companies through technology transfer] project VaLiCel, we have compared several pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation conditions using lignocellulosic residues (recycled paper pulp, loams & <b>scutched</b> short flax, wood (dust), grasses and agro-industrial waste) and dedicated energy crops (Miscanthus x giganteus, poplar and willow). The yield of fermentable sugars and ethanol is determined and compared. Ultimately, the aim is to know which lignocellulose waste is suited for complete saccharification to glucose and xylose and yields minor side products that are inhibitory to alcohol fermentation. From our results it is clear that by screening a collection of different biomass feedstocks, evaluating different pretreatment methods, screening a large set of yeast strains and optimizing the préculture and fermentation conditions, it is possible to produce second generation bio-ethanol in an economically viable way. First results of a case study will exemplify a possible integration strategy into existing industrial fuel producing plants. It is expected that the co-production of added-value products will lead to overall economic profitability in an integrated biorefinery process.
