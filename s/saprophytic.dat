5|$|Experimental work in 1986 {{showed that}} Suillus bovinus could metabolise {{proteins}} and peptides directly, causing {{a drop in}} nitrogen in growth media, which suggested the species has some <b>saprophytic</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Then in 2016 Scott Redhead and his {{associates}} created the genus Saproamanita for the <b>saprophytic</b> members of Amanita (sensu largo) but the new name Saproamanita thiersii is very controversial and not broadly accepted.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprophytic</b> fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients}} from forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some <b>saprophytic</b> tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a <b>saprophytic</b> genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be <b>saprophytic,</b> meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a <b>saprophytic</b> fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and {{woodchip}} mulch. In Europe {{it is often}} found in beech woods in alkaline soil. It is a common species found throughout Europe, where it fruits from July to November. Although also found in North America, generally fruiting from August to October, {{the full extent of}} its distribution there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations of}} several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. Studies {{have demonstrated that}} Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously thought to be <b>saprophytic,</b> the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a <b>saprophytic</b> genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E
5|$|A {{predominantly}} <b>saprophytic</b> species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing <b>saprophytic</b> tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Purpureocillium lilacinum {{is highly}} {{adaptable}} in its life strategy: {{depending on the}} availability of nutrients in the surrounding microenvironments it may be entomopathogenic, mycoparasitic, <b>saprophytic,</b> as well as nematophagous.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} black yeasts that cause phaeohyphomycosis, melanin {{appears to have}} {{defensive}} purpose, and helps protect E. dermatitidis from death within human neutrophils. Pathogenic strains of E. dermatitidis contain five times more melanin than <b>saprophytic</b> E. dermatitidis, while melanin deficient mutants of pathogenic strains have dramatically reduced virulence.|$|E
25|$|Parasites reduce host {{biological}} fitness {{by general}} or specialized pathology, from parasitic castration and impairment of secondary sex characteristics, to the modification of host behavior. Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular transmission. Although parasitism often applies unambiguously, {{it is part}} of a continuum of types of interactions between species, grading via parasitoidy into predation, through evolution into mutualism, and in some fungi, shading into being <b>saprophytic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Psilocin {{was first}} {{reported}} in this species in Benedict et al., 1962, {{and a few years}} later, Leung and Paul would report the related compound baeocystin, isolated from <b>saprophytic</b> culture, as well as the desmethyl metabolite norbaeocystin. Beug and Bigwood (1981) also reported on the concentrations of these compounds in Psilocybe baeocystis using reverse-phase HPLC and thin-layer chromatography. Concentration ranges for psychoactive compounds from these studies were reported to be 0.15–0.85% psilocybin, up to 0.59% psilocin, and up to 0.10% baeocystin.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal {{species in}} a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or <b>saprophytic</b> detritivores (i.e., the {{community}} of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer {{is a measure of}} food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} <b>saprophytic</b> lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and <b>saprophytic</b> microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E
500|$|Glutinoglossum glutinosum is a <b>saprophytic</b> species. Its fruitbodies grow {{scattered}} on soil in moss beds or in grassy areas. North American collections are {{typically associated with}} hardwoods, while European collections are often made in pasture and dune slacks. The fungus {{has been used as}} an indicator of medium-quality grassland in the UK. In India, it has been encountered on the soil of oak forests, and among mosses on stony slopes at an elevation of [...]|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its small}} size, the {{gametophyte}} stage is not generally noticed until the stalked sporangium develops, and is locatable principally because the sporangium grows upon {{and above the}} tiny gametophyte. [...] The extremely reduced state of Buxbaumia plants {{raises the question of}} how it makes or obtains sufficient nutrition for survival. [...] In contrast to most mosses, Buxbaumia does not produce abundant chlorophyll and is <b>saprophytic.</b> [...] It is possible that some of its nutritional needs are met by fungi that grow within the plant.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{has been}} found in the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon, the Coast Range on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, and in Redwood National Park in {{northern}} California. Specimens have been found at elevations of [...] Because the fungus feeds on both dead and living wood, it is both parasitic and <b>saprophytic.</b> B.nobilissimus fruit bodies do not occur on fallen logs or other forms of dead wood lacking roots or some connection to a root system. Conks have been found growing on the still-living roots of an upturned, windthrown tree, while a once-living conk died within several years after the host tree was uprooted by a fallen tree.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushroom}} {{grows in}} lawns, pastures and prairies. It is a saprotroph, living on decaying plant material, and not mycorrhizal {{as is the}} case with [...] Amanita species. [...] Previously it was placed in Amanita, but in 2016 the <b>saprophytic</b> members of that genus were separated off into the new genus Saproamanita by one research group, though this split is controversial. Fruit bodies appear during July and August, either in isolation or in groups, and often form fairy rings. The genome of A.thiersii is being sequenced as part of the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute Community Sequencing Program. It is hoped that this will provide a better understanding of the cellulose decomposition capabilities of the fungus. The toxicity of A.thiersii has not been studied but it is suspected of being poisonous.|$|E
500|$|Glutinoglossum glutinosum, {{commonly}} known as the viscid black earth tongue or the glutinous earthtongue, is a species of fungus in the family Geoglossaceae (the earth tongues). Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, it has been found in northern Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Although previously thought to exist in Australasia, collections made from these locations have since been referred to new species. G.glutinosum is a <b>saprophytic</b> species that grows on soil in moss or in grassy areas. The smooth, nearly black, club-shaped fruitbodies grow to heights ranging from [...] The head is up to [...] long, and the stipes are sticky. Several other black earth tongue species are quite similar in external appearance, and many can be reliably distinguished only by examining differences in microscopic characteristics, such as spores, asci, and paraphyses. First described in 1796 as a species of Geoglossum, the fungus has gone through several changes of genera in its taxonomic history. It was placed in its current genus, Glutinoglossum, in 2013.|$|E
500|$|M.rufobrunnea {{grows in}} {{disturbed}} soil or in woodchips used in landscaping, suggesting a <b>saprophytic</b> mode of nutrition. Reports from the Mediterranean under olive trees (Olea europaea), however, suggest the fungus {{may also be}} able to form [...] tree associations. Young fruit bodies have conical, grayish caps covered with pale ridges and dark pits; mature specimens are yellowish to ochraceous-buff. The surface of the fruit body often bruises brownish orange to pinkish where it has been touched, a characteristic for which the fungus is named, the New Latin rufobrunnea signifying [...] "rufus brown". Mature fruit bodies grow to a height of [...] M.rufobrunnea differs from other Morchella species by its urban or suburban habitat preferences, in the color and form of the fruit body, the lack of a sinus at the attachment of the cap with the stipe, the length of the pits on the surface, and the bruising reaction. A process to cultivate morels now known to be M.rufobrunnea was described and patented in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Scutellinia scutellata, {{commonly}} known as the eyelash cup, the Molly eye-winker, the scarlet elf cap, the eyelash fungus or the eyelash pixie cup, is a small <b>saprophytic</b> fungus of the genus Scutellinia. It is the type species of Scutellinia, as well as being the most common and widespread. The fruiting bodies are small red cups with distinct long, dark hairs or [...] "eyelashes". These eyelashes are the most distinctive feature and are easily visible with a magnifying glass. The species is common in North America and Europe, and has been recorded on every continent. S.scutellata is found on rotting wood and in other damp habitats, typically growing in small groups, sometimes forming clusters. It is sometimes described as inedible, but its small size means it is not suitable for culinary use. Despite this, it is popular among mushroom hunters due to its unusual [...] "eyelash" [...] hairs, making it memorable and easy to identify.|$|E
2500|$|Leptospira are {{typically}} cultivated at 30°C in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium, {{which can be}} supplemented with 0.21% rabbit serum to enhance growth of fastidious strains. [...] Growth of pathogenic Leptospira in an artificial nutrient environment such as EMJH becomes noticeable in 4–7 days; growth of <b>saprophytic</b> strains occur within 2–3 days. The minimal growth temperature of pathogenic species is 13–15°C. [...] Because the minimal growth temperature of the saprophytes is 5–10°C, the ability of Leptospira to grow at 13°C {{can be used to}} distinguish <b>saprophytic</b> from pathogenic Leptospira species. [...] The optimal pH for growth of Leptospira is 7.2–7.6.|$|E
2500|$|Leptospira (Greek leptos, [...] "fine, thin" [...] and Latin spira, [...] "coil") is a genus of spirochaete bacteria, {{including}} {{a small number}} of pathogenic and <b>saprophytic</b> species.

2500|$|Leptospira, both {{pathogenic}} and <b>saprophytic,</b> can occupy diverse environments, {{habitats and}} life cycles; these bacteria are {{found throughout the}} world, except in Antarctica. [...] High humidity and neutral (6.9–7.4) pH are necessary for their survival in the environment, with stagnant water reservoirs—bogs, shallow lakes, ponds, puddles, etc.—being the natural habitat for the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|C. immitis is a dimorphic <b>saprophytic</b> fungus {{that grows}} as a {{mycelium}} {{in the soil}} and produces a spherule form in the host organism. It resides in the soil {{in certain parts of}} the southwestern United States, most notably in California and Arizona. It is also commonly found in northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. C. immitis is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when it rains. [...] The spores, known as arthroconidia, are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake. Windstorms may also cause epidemics far from endemic areas. [...] In December 1977 a windstorm in an endemic area around Arvin, CA led to several hundred cases, including deaths, in non-endemic areas hundreds of miles away.|$|E
2500|$|Fungal {{ear canal}} infections, {{also known as}} otomycosis, range from inconsequential to {{extremely}} severe. Fungi can be <b>saprophytic,</b> {{in which there are}} no symptoms and the fungus simply co-exists in the ear canal in a harmless parasitic relationship with the host, in which case the only physical finding is the presence of a fungus. [...] If the fungus begins active reproduction, the ear canal can fill with dense fungal debris, causing pressure and ever-increasing pain that is unrelenting until the fungus is removed from the canal and anti-fungal medication is used. [...] Most antibacterial ear drops also contain a steroid to hasten resolution of canal edema and pain. [...] Unfortunately, such drops make the fungal infection worse. [...] Prolonged use of them promotes the growth of fungus in the ear canal. [...] Antibacterial ear drops should be used a maximum of one week, but 5 days is usually enough. [...] Otomycosis responds more than 95% of the time to a three-day course of the same over-the-counter anti-fungal solutions used ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, a {{study of}} the French Sahara and desert zone of Kizil Koum in Turkestan, {{identified}} a wide range of micromycetes in the uppermost layers of the soil. Many of the species present were <b>saprophytic</b> flora of dark pigmentation, including Helminthosporium, Curvularia, Alternaria and Stemphylium [...] Helminthosporium was the genus name of S. rostrata at the time. These fungi were mainly found in the mobile surface layer of the basin, becoming sparser with increasing depth. During dry periods, the Micromycetes in the mobile surface layers of the basin became mobilized by wind which accounted for the relatively uniform distributions of the surface microflora in the surrounding regions. It was discovered that the microfungal population of these superficial desert soils and sands had developed an adaptive morphology to protect them against unfavourable soil conditions. The dark pigmentation of these species is thought to protect them against light and desiccation, it can be seen in both the vegetative and reproductive states. As well, the spores of most of the Dematiaceae were reported as multicellular, septated transversely in the case of Helminthosporium which increases compartmentalization and protection. Another common characteristic of fungi isolated from desert sands is their rapid development and vast reproductive capacity.|$|E

The necessities of continuity in public activity and of a glaring consistency in public profession, have so far prevented any such fundamental reconstruction as the new generation requires. One hears of Liberty, of Compromise, of Imperial Destinies and Imperial Unity, one hears of undying loyalty to the Memory of Mr. Gladstone and the inalienable right of Ireland to a separate national existence. One hears, too, of the sacred principle of Free Trade, of Empires and Zollvereins, and the Rights of the Parent to blockade the education of his children, but one hears nothing of the greater end.
