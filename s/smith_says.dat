5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E
25|$|English {{historian}} Denis Mack <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> Cavour was {{the most}} successful parliamentarian in Italian history {{but he was not}} especially liberal. Cavour was often dictatorial, ignored his ministerial colleagues and parliament, and interfered in parliamentary elections. He also practiced transformism and other undesirable policies which were carried over into post-Risorgimento Italy.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{was born}} in Scotland, Maryland, in Saint Mary's County, the sixth of 17 {{children}} born to sharecroppers Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub where the children were bathed. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> he tried to shake the moniker several times, but it stuck incessantly. He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames {{was the last person}} to call him by his proper name, Orlando.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time says [...] "It is {{the same}} show you saw last season, the same {{weaknesses}} and strengths intact, but, as it makes clear before the first hour is over, every bit as brutal and sanguinary." [...] According to Sara Smith of The Kansas City Star, [...] "The shock and delight of the showy storytelling ... has faded a bit". <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that Barnes, Skorsky, and Goodwin's [...] "investigation sucks them down a rabbit hole into a surreal underworld no sane reporter would explore". Regarding Frank, <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> [...] "A show can successfully revolve around one man, but a flawless winning streak gets monotonous" [...] and that [...] "it's time for someone to take Frank down a notch".|$|E

500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's vocals were {{recorded}} at the KMA Studio in New York City. When the trio played Beyoncé the demo of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", she immediately approved it after making slight modifications. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that Beyoncé was literally {{jumping up and}} down after hearing the demo. One hour later Beyoncé recorded [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and two other songs. Smith recalled that Beyoncé focused solely on the recording, ignoring hunger as she worked into the night. Beyoncé has stated that every man and woman can relate to the song's subject matter because at one point, almost everyone ends a relationship because of lack of commitment by his or her partner.|$|E
500|$|Several racially {{motivated}} incidents {{occurred over}} the following days. According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar [...] "fingering the triggers of rifles" [...] and forced blacks drinking there to leave. Time also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that several would-be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to [...] "make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists". He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, {{and that it would}} not do to attack them. Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target.|$|E
5000|$|Computer {{scientist}} Vint Cerf, one of {{the founders}} of the Internet, now Google vice president, wrote to <b>Smith,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Requiring search engines to delete a domain name begins a worldwide arms race of unprecedented 'censorship' of the Web", in a letter published on CNet.|$|R
5000|$|The Crookes {{were named}} as The Guardian Band of The Day in September 2009 being {{described}} as having [...] "hints of the win some, lose some C86 brigade, The <b>Smiths</b> (<b>say,</b> circa The Boy With the Thorn in His Side), the plaintive jangle of the Housemartins, even Belle and Sebastian".|$|R
5000|$|The show also {{attracted}} {{criticism in the}} House of Commons, from Culture Secretary Chris <b>Smith,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Government cannot and should not, of course, directly intervene, but I believe that the broadcasters have a commercial and moral duty {{to take account of}} the views of the public and I urge them to do so." ...|$|R
500|$|Smith {{received}} a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992, but {{felt it was}} not worth anything, saying [...] "there's {{part of me that}} feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> [...] "if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that. Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoted to captain on August 5, 1853, Grant was {{assigned}} to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California. He arrived at the fort on January 5, 1854, and reported to its commander Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan. Grant was bored and depressed about being separated from his wife Julia, {{and he began to}} drink. An officer who roomed with Grant said he [...] "fell too much under the influence of liquor to properly perform his duties. Colonel Buchanan demanded he should resign." [...] Historian Jean Edward <b>Smith</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "The story rings true." [...] When Grant was reprimanded by Buchanan for one drinking episode, Grant told Buchanan if he did not reform he would resign. One Sunday, Grant was rumored to have been found at his company's paytable influenced by drink. Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854, without explanation. Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident. Grant was neither arrested nor faced court-martial, while the War Department stated, [...] "Nothing stands against his good name." [...] Grant said years later, [...] "the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had not a little to do with my decision to resign." [...] With no means of support, Grant returned to St. Louis and reunited with his family, uncertain about his future.|$|E
500|$|<b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> {{that his}} reply [...] "provoked {{a flood of}} rhetoric"; the nationalists evaded his words and, one by one, gave passionate speeches about being [...] "a {{suppressed}} people... denied freedom in their own country" [...] who only wanted to [...] "return home and live normal, peaceful lives". Smith sat back and waited for them to finish, then responded {{that there was nothing}} stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks [...] "preferential franchise facilities", and they themselves had chosen to use [...] "unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country." [...] The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's [...] "terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for... murders and other atrocities". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a [...] "very small thing" [...] as immunity to the nationalist leaders. The conference broke up without any agreement or progress having been made.|$|E

Rowling says that, [...] "it is the voice of the narrator, in this case 17-year- old Cassandra Mortmain, which makes a masterpiece out of an old plot." ...|$|R
60|$|However, as I {{have heard}} Captain <b>Smith</b> <b>say</b> again and again, {{everything}} comes to him who waits, and so also came {{that day when}} the winds were favoring; when Captain Newport, the admiral of our fleet, gave the word to make sail, and we sped softly away from England's shores, little dreaming of that time of suffering, of sickness, and of sadness which was before us.|$|R
500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E
2500|$|The first reports {{coming from}} China in 1898 {{referred}} to the village activists as [...] "Yihequan", (Wade–Giles: I Ho Ch'uan). The first known {{use of the term}} [...] "Boxer" [...] was September 1899 in a letter from missionary Grace Newton in Shandong. It appears from context that [...] "Boxer" [...] was a known term by that time, possibly coined by the Shandong missionaries Arthur H. Smith and Henry Porter. <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> in his book of 1902 that the name ...|$|E
2500|$|Eliot scholar Grover <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> of this poem, [...] "If {{any notion}} {{remained}} {{that in the}} poems of 1919 Eliot was sentimentally contrasting a resplendent past with a dismal present, Gerontion should have helped to dispel it." [...] Bernard Bergonzi writes that [...] "Eliot's most considerable poem of the period between 1915 and 1919 is 'Gerontion'". Kirk believes that [...] "To me, the blank verse of 'Gerontion' is Eliot's most moving poetry, but he never tried this virile mode later." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have heard}} Captain <b>Smith</b> <b>say</b> more than once, {{that he had}} seen flocks of ducks a full mile wide and five or six miles long, wherein canvasbacks, mallard, widgeon, redheads, dottrel, sheldrake, and teal swam wing to wing, {{actually}} crowding each other. When such flocks rose in the air, the noise made by their wings was like unto the roaring of a tempest at sea.|$|R
50|$|Standpoint {{feminism}} {{is a theory}} that feminist social science should be practiced {{from the standpoint of}} women or particular groups of women, as some scholars (e.g. Patricia Hill Collins and Dorothy <b>Smith)</b> <b>say</b> that they are better equipped to understand some aspects of the world. A feminist or women's standpoint epistemology proposes to make women's experiences the point of departure, in addition to, and sometimes instead of men's.|$|R
5000|$|However, the [...] "" [...] {{answer is}} {{obtained}} only by assuming P(ALOB|BG) = P(ALOB|GB) =1, which implies P(ALOG|BG) = P(ALOG|GB) = 0, that is, the other child's sex is never mentioned {{although it is}} present. As Marks and <b>Smith</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "This extreme assumption is never included in {{the presentation of the}} two-child problem, however, and is surely not what people have in mind when they present it." ...|$|R

And the spread of Islam was stopped along the road between the towns of Tours and Poitiers, France, with just its head in Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The broad {{combination}} of styles in the band's music {{has sometimes been}} referred to as [...] "progressive punk" [...] – or [...] "pronk" [...] – and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejects the term, and prefers the description [...] "psychedelic" [...] or simply [...] "pop". Musicians which the band have cited as Cardiacs influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Devo, Gentle Giant, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School and Wire. Smith has stated, [...] "I don’t know what influences us really, I wouldn’t say that we are influenced by any actual bands in particular". Tim Smith has denied that Gentle Giant was an influence on the band, but Sarah <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that they were.|$|E
2500|$|Gay's {{theological}} utilitarianism {{was developed}} and popularized by William Paley. It has been claimed that Paley {{was not a very}} original thinker and that the philosophical part of his treatise on ethics is [...] "an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues." [...] Nevertheless, his book The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy (1785) was a required text at Cambridge and <b>Smith</b> <b>says</b> that Paley's writings were [...] "once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools." [...] Although now largely missing from the philosophical canon, Schneewind writes that [...] "utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work of William Paley." [...] The now forgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of Thomas Rawson Birks's 1874 work Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley, Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared.|$|E
