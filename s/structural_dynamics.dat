Furthermore, it emphasises <b>structural</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data.

The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

25|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{an inverse}} problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse <b>structural</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Inverse rigid-body dynamics {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.|$|E

The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or steady response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body’s dynamic (typically vibrational) response.

40|$|Although {{during the}} past decade {{research}} has shown the functional importance of disorder in proteins, many of the <b>structural</b> and <b>dynamics</b> properties of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) remain to be elucidated. This review is focused {{on the role of the}} extensions of the ribosomal proteins in the early steps of the assembly of the eubacterial 50 S subunit. The recent crystallographic structures of the ribosomal particles have revealed the picture of a complex assembly pathway that condenses the rRNA and the ribosomal proteins into active ribosomes. However, little is know about the molecular mechanisms of this process. It is thought that the long basic r-protein extensions that penetrate deeply into the subunit cores play a key role through disorder-order transitions and/or co-folding mechanisms. A current view is that such structural transitions may facilitate the proper rRNA folding. In this paper, the structures of the proteins L 3, L 4, L 13, L 20, L 22 and L 24 that have been experimentally found to be essential for the first steps of ribosome assembly have been compared. On the basis of their <b>structural</b> and <b>dynamics</b> properties, three categories of extensions have been identified. Each of them seems to play a distinct function. Among them, only the coil-helix transition that occurs in a phylogenetically conserved cluster of basic residues of the L 20 extension appears to be strictly required for the large subunit assembly in eubacteria. The role of a helix-coil transitions in 23 S RNA folding is discussed in the light of the calcium binding protein calmodulin that shares many <b>structural</b> and <b>dynamics</b> properties with L 20...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} satiation of consumption and technology {{in relation to a}} model of evolutionary endogenous growth. The model represents an attempt to provide an evolutionary economic micro foundation to Pasinetti's scheme of the <b>structural</b> economic <b>dynamics</b> of an economy that is based on only labour and knowledge. The micro foundation is based on a set of rules that makes endogenous the demand coefficients, the labour coefficients, and the number of available sectors. Through process innovations firms increase their productivities with respect to individual goods, but a growth slowdown takes place unless the benefits from specialisation are exploited at still higher levels. Another cause for slowdown is related to an Engelian hierarchy of goods. As the standard of living grows, existing sectors and consumption goods satiate, so new sectors need to be provided by product innovations in a sufficient pace {{to keep up with the}} labour that is displaced from old sectors.

The wing is composed of a single layer of woven, carbon-fiber composite and behaves like a tape-spring, remaining stiff in one direction (lift) while rolling easily in the other for storage.

A vacuum chamber is used to eliminate fluid effects on the <b>structural</b> deployment <b>dynamics,</b> which are recorded using a high-speed video camera. Modal testing and finite element updating are used to estimate unknown composite material properties for the analysis.
