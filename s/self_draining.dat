50|$|The Solution is {{a single}} handed hiking dinghy {{designed}} for helms in the 65 to 85 kg (10 to 14 Stone) weight range. It has a light epoxy hull, <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> cockpit, high aspect rig, semi battened 8.5 sq. metre sail, and full complement of dual controls.|$|E
50|$|A {{version with}} a <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> cockpit, the Mark II SD, was {{introduced}} in 1986. This was especially suitable for boats kept on moorings. However, the buoyancy sealed in the floor increases the inverting tendency and, when righted after a capsize, the trapped water causes instability. To help overcome this drain tubes through the aft tank were later introduced.|$|E
50|$|The RS200 utilises {{a single}} line {{asymmetric}} spinnaker system and low sheet loads on the sail controls. It can be sailed by weights of between 16 and 26 stone. The open transom allows the RS200 to virtually <b>self</b> <b>drain</b> after a capsize and a moulded self bailer removes any remaining water.|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} Hartley Laminates {{took over}} the copyright and manufacturing licence for the design. They secured the services of Phil Morrison to redesign the deck plug to modernise {{the appearance of the}} boat, allow the hull to <b>self</b> <b>drain</b> through transom flaps and to reduce the complexity of building the hull and thus production costs while retaining the same hull shape and rig.|$|R
5000|$|Each time {{a goddess}} struck him, another Raktabija was born. Kali then licks {{up all the}} blood that oozes out of Raktabija's <b>self</b> and <b>drains</b> him {{completely}} of his pseudo-nectar, killing him.|$|R
50|$|A further {{reduction}} in late 1990s {{and a recent}} {{reduction in}} 2000 brought the minimum weight down to the currently 78 kg (this includes mast & centreboard), reflecting the ability of even amateur builders to build lightweight hulls. Today most new boats are built using carbon fibre-foam sandwich construction with a <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> floor. This makes the boats very light and stiff, adding to the responsive character of the boats.|$|E
50|$|The Wayfarer World was {{introduced}} in 1997 and {{was designed as a}} collaboration between Ian Proctor and his son Keith. Made in GRP with no woodwork it has a removable aft storage tank, a <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> cockpit, and a spinnaker chute. The rudder stock is of aluminium alloy. Until the MkIV this was the only version with an asymmetric spinnaker, although it can not be used in class races in the UK. It has proved successful in both racing and cruising, including a North Sea crossing 1998.|$|E
50|$|The RS Tera is {{suitable}} for introducing newcomers to the sport of sailing, but {{is also a good}} boat to race. The boat is highly robust, and it is built with a <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> cockpit and is easy to right after a capsize, in addition to which it has a floating daggerboard. The boat is fairly small and light, meaning it is possible to transport on a roof rack, and that it is manageable on the water by younger children. The mast comes in two pieces, and the boom is padded.|$|E
50|$|There, {{he leads}} {{everyone}} {{in a song}} to remind the Grinch {{of all of the}} love he received from his mother and implore him to change his ways and be a better person ("Deep down in your brain, must you give her more pain? / Please soften your heart, make Mum happy again"). The Grinch cries when he hears this, disassembles his machines, and continues his change of heart into the next morning. When his reflection tries to convert him back to his old <b>self,</b> though, Max <b>drains</b> out his voice with the Vacusound Sweeper.|$|R
50|$|The Buzz can be {{an exhilarating}} boat to sail and is {{claimed to be a}} safe {{starting}} point for asymmetric skiff sailing. The boat also has good performance, making it suitable for racing by more experienced crews. The Buzz has proven itself to be easy to right after capsizing, and it is straightforward to re-board the boat from the water, partly due to its low centre of buoyancy and <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> cockpit with its open transom. The open transom also means that the boat drains quickly on righting doing away with the need for self bailers.|$|E
50|$|From {{this period}} {{increased}} {{knowledge and understanding}} of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable waterproof glues saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat aft sections. Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> capabilities with transom flaps, venturi floor drains built in tanks, especially forward and false floors.|$|E
50|$|Postoperative {{autotransfusion}} {{is performed}} by connecting the double lumen autotransfusion suction line {{directly to the}} drain line placed {{at the conclusion of}} surgery. Postoperative autotransfusion begins in the operating room when the drain line is placed and the surgical site is closed. Typical postoperative cases are total knee and hip replacements. Autotransfusion is continued and is effective while the patient actively bleeds during the immediate postoperative phase of recovery. Autotransfusion is ended when bleeding is stopped or is significantly slow, and is discontinued by connecting an ordinary <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> device to the drain line(s). Available for postoperative autotransfusion are universal bifurcated connectors which can accommodate two drain lines of any size, these connectors can be attached to the standard ten foot double lumen suction line for postoperative use.|$|E
50|$|The kolibri 560 is a Dutch cabin {{sailing boat}} {{designed}} in 1963 by G.A. Pfeiffer and built by Antoon van den Brink and his sons. The boats {{were a great}} success because they were sold as a self building package which made them affordable {{for a lot of}} people. The building packages were sold until the early 1980s and delivery periods of one year were the norm. The kolibri 560 is a 5.60 m long, 2.00 m wide with a depth of 1.00 m, sailing boat which is unsinkable, has a <b>self</b> <b>draining</b> tub and is sea worthy. Four people can sleep in this boat and it was presented at the HISWA exposition (a Dutch boat exposition) in 1964. Over a thousand were sold. In 2007 a polyester version was developed and was nicknamed Polybri.|$|E
