Thirty commensal strains isolated from poultry with no signs of these illnesses were used as control strains. The purified DNA of these strains produced electrophoretic profiles ranging from 0 to 15 bands with molecular sizes varying from 100 bp to 6. 1 kb, allowing the grouping of the 79 strains into a dendrogram containing 49 REP-types. Although REP-PCR showed good discriminating power it {{was not able to}} group the strains either into <b>specific</b> <b>pathogenic</b> classes or to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. On the contrary, we recently demonstrated that other techniques such as ERIC-PCR and isoenzyme profiles are appropriate to discriminate between commensal and APEC strains and also to group these strains into <b>specific</b> <b>pathogenic</b> classes. In conclusion, REP-PCR seems to be a technique neither efficient nor universal for APEC strains discrimination. However, the population clonal structure obtained with the use of REP-PCR must not be ignored particularly if one takes into account that the APEC pathogenic mechanisms are not completely understood yet...|$|R

5000|$|Evolution from Type Three Secretion Systems. Scientists {{regard this}} {{argument}} {{as having been}} disproved {{in the light of}} research dating back to 1996 as well as more recent findings.

The needle's base has ten elements in common with the flagellum, but it is missing forty of the proteins that make a flagellum work. The TTSS system negates Behe's claim that taking away any one of the flagellum's parts would prevent the system from functioning. On this basis, Kenneth Miller notes that, [...] "The parts of this supposedly irreducibly complex system actually have functions of their own." [...] Studies have also shown that similar parts of the flagellum in different bacterial species can have different functions despite showing evidence of common descent, and that certain parts of the flagellum can be removed without completely eliminating its functionality.|$|R

40|$|The skin {{has several}} physical, {{chemical}} and immunological properties which help {{to protect the}} internal organs. In addition, there is a physiological colonisation of commensal microbes which help to suppress the expansion of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> on the skin. Genetic or acquired immunodeficiency {{will have an impact}} to these factors. Drug induced immunodeficiency is common in organ transplanted patients with the aim to prevent organ rejection. HIV infection most commonly leads without therapy to marked immune suppression. Such patients with prolonged immunodeficiency often develop atypical manifestation of mucocutaneous infections. Therefore such patients should be biopsied liberally and besides the conventional histology a part of the biopsied tissue should be used for microbiological cultures. In addition to acute infections of the skin, long-term effects of oncogenic viruses have to be taken in account which can lead to epithelial cancers (HPV), Kaposi sarcomas (HHV 8) and lymphomas (EBV). There are mucocutaneous markers for immunosuppression such as oral hairy leukoplakia, which are commonly seen in AIDS patients but may also be observed in otherwise chronically immune suppressed patients.

By incorporating inhibition (represented by an anti-inflammatory cytokine) into a classical Keller–Segel chemotaxis model, we create a novel model that produces a variety of spatial patterns. We find that the dynamical instability in both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous steady states arises only when the inhibitor dynamics are sufficiently slow. We present simulation results that motivate the nonlinear analysis of the model and illustrate a variety of interesting dynamic two-dimensional spatial patterns that form, including isolated traveling pulses, rotating waves, and patterns that do not settle to a regular behavior...|$|R
