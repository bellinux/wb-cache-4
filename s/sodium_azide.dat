5|$|Small {{amounts of}} the {{impurities}} NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate. Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b> Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that {{endogenous}} methane is produced {{not only by the}} intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial hypoxia, for example, <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen {{can be used}} as a replacement, or in {{combination}} with, carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers, particularly stouts and British ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier. A pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a [...] "widget" [...] allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles. Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns. Nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than CO2, making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive. Nitrogen gas has become the inert gas of choice for inert gas asphyxiation, and is under consideration as a replacement for lethal injection in Oklahoma. Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> is used for the inflation of airbags.|$|E
500|$|Metallic sodium is used {{mainly for}} the {{production}} of sodium borohydride, <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. [...] Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma ("vapor") lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, {{it can be used to}} reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible light telescopes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} use of hydrazine is as {{a precursor}} to blowing agents. Specific compounds include azodicarbonamide and azobisisobutyronitrile, which yield 100-200 mL of gas per gram of precursor. [...] In a [...] related application, <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> the gas-forming agent in air bags, is produced from hydrazine by reaction with sodium nitrite.|$|E
2500|$|Such salts {{are widely}} used in organic synthesis, e.g., for the Sandmeyer {{reaction}} and in the preparation azo dyes, brightly colored compounds that are {{the basis of a}} qualitative test for anilines. Nitrous acid is used to destroy toxic and potentially explosive <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b> For most purposes, nitrous acid is usually formed in situ by the action of mineral acid on sodium nitrite: ...|$|E
50|$|Like <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> {{potassium}} azide is very toxic. The TLV of {{the related}} <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> is 0.07 ppm. The toxicity of azides arise from {{their ability to}} inhibit cytochrome c oxidase.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} the azide moiety is <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b> As a pseudohalogen compound, <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> generally displaces an appropriate leaving group (e.g., Br, I, OTs) to give the azido compound. Aryl azides may be prepared by displacement of the appropriate diazonium salt with <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> or trimethylsilyl azide; nucleophilic aromatic substitution is also possible, even with chlorides. Anilines and aromatic hydrazines undergo diazotization, as do alkyl amines and hydrazines.|$|E
50|$|The azide-containing {{pyrotechnic}} {{gas generators}} contain {{a substantial amount}} of the propellant. The driver-side airbag would contain a canister containing about 50 grams of <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b> The passenger side container holds about 200 grams of <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{automobile}} airbags use <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> {{for inflation}} (...) [...] [...] A small pyrotechnic charge triggers its decomposition, producing nitrogen gas, which inflates the airbag in around 30 milliseconds. A typical airbag in the US might contain 130 grams of <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>azide</b> {{decomposes}} exothermically to {{sodium and}} nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|A common way {{to produce}} the 3-azidocoumarin is by {{condensation}} of salicylaldehyde and N-acetylglycine or nitroacetate. The intermediate is trapped with <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> {{to produce the}} 3-azidocoumarin. The isomeric 4-azidocoumarin (CAS# 42373-56-8) product can also be prepared from 4-hydroxycoumarin via the 4-chloro derivative, which reacts with <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b>|$|E
50|$|They {{can also}} be {{synthesized}} from various carboxylic acids and <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> in presence of triphenylphosphine and trichloroacetonitrile catalysts in excellent yields at mild conditions. Another route starts with aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes reacting with iodine azide which is formed from <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> and iodine monochloride in acetonitrile.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, culture {{methods for}} the {{isolation}} of E. rhusiopathiae involve the use of selective and enrichment media. Commercially available blood culture media are satisfactory for primary isolation from blood, since E. rhusiopathiae is not particularly fastidious. A number of selective media for {{the isolation of}} Erysipelothrix have been described, also. A commonly used medium is Erysipelothrix selective broth (ESB), a nutrient broth containing serum, tryptose, kanamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin [...] Modified blood azide medium (MBA) is a selective agar containing <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> and horse blood or serum. Packer’s medium is a selective medium for grossly contaminated specimens, which contains <b>sodium</b> <b>azide</b> and crystal violet. Bohm’s medium uses <b>sodium</b> <b>azide,</b> kanamycin, phenol, and water blue. Shimoji’s selective enrichment broth contains tryptic soy broth, Tween 80, tris-aminomethane, crystal violet, and <b>sodium</b> <b>azide.</b>|$|E
