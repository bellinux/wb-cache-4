40|$|Abstract: The main design {{criteria}} of ballasted railway tracks include rail deflections, rail bending stresses, rail wheel contact stresses, sleeper bending moments and ballast sleeper contact pressures. Various criteria have been defined {{for the design}} of ballasted railway tracks due to the various mechanical properties of track components and their complex interaction. Therefore, the railway track design is a difficult and time-consuming process. These complications highlight the need to focus attention on the necessity of a thorough investigation into the effect of the track and rolling <b>stock</b> <b>parameters</b> on the {{design criteria}}. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a sensitivity analysis of the main railway track design criteria was conducted in this study. Consequently, the roles of track and rolling <b>stock</b> <b>parameters</b> (including track modulus, sleeper spacing, train speed and axle load) in the design of railway track were investigated for various track design criteria. The research findings provide new and practical suggestions in the analysis and design of ballasted railway tracks...|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian fishery for Cancer pagurus {{peaked in}} the 1940 - 50 ’s with catches of 7000 to 9000 tonnes annually.

A plan for the industry took action when subsidizes were cut and the landings dropped. This, together with an increasing demand, has brought profitability into the trade again.

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{assessment of}} harvested fish populations, {{such as the}} Atlantic-Iberian sardine (AIS) stock, needs to deal with uncertainties inherent in fisheries systems. Uncertainties arising from sampling errors and stochasticity in stock dynamics must be incorporated in stock assessment models so that management decisions are based on realistic evaluation of the uncertainty {{about the status of}} the stock. The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop a stock assessment framework that accounts for some of the uncertainties associated with the AIS stock that are currently not integrated into stock assessment models. In particular, it focuses on accounting for the uncertainty arising from the catch data sampling process. The central innovation the thesis is the development of a Bayesian integrated stock assessment (ISA) model, in which an observation model explicitly links stock dynamics parameters with statistical models for the various types of data observed from catches of the AIS stock. This allows for systematic and statistically consistent propagation of the uncertainty inherent in the catch sampling process across the whole stock assessment model, through to estimates of biomass and <b>stock</b> <b>parameters.</b> The method is tested by simulations and found to provide reliable and accurate estimates of <b>stock</b> <b>parameters</b> and associated uncertainty, while also outperforming existing designed-based and model-based estimation approaches. The method is computationally very demanding and this is an obstacle to its adoption by fisheries bodies. Once this obstacle is overcame, the ISA modelling framework developed and presented in this thesis could provide an important contribution to the improvement in the evaluation of uncertainty in fisheries stock assessments, not only of the AIS stock, but of any other fish stock with similar data and dynamics structure. Furthermore, the models developed in this study establish a solid conceptual platform to allow future development of more complex models of fish population dynamics...|$|E

We derive {{an expression that}} relates the correlation of synchrotron fluctuations for an arbitrary in-dex of relativistic electrons to the correlations arising from a particular γ = 2 index that provides synchrotron emissivity proportional to the squared intensity of perpendicular {{to the line of}} sight com-ponent of magnetic field. We provide a detailed study of the statistics in the latter case assuming that the underlying magnetic turbulence is axisymmetric. We obtain general relations valid for an arbitrary model of magnetic axisymmetric turbulence and analyze the relations for the particular example of magnetic turbulence that is supported by numerical simulations. We predict that the synchrotron intensity fluctuations are anisotropic with larger correlation present along the direction of magnetic field. This anisotropy is dominated by the quadrupole component with the ratio between quadrupole and monopole parts being sensitive to the compressibility of underlying turbulence. Our work opens avenues for quantitative studies of magnetic turbulence in our galaxy and beyond using synchrotron emission. It also outlines the directions of how synchrotron foreground emission can be separated from cosmological signal, i. e. from CMB or highly redshifted HI emission.
