40|$|The ball screws are {{the machine}} {{component}} {{most frequently used}} for transforming rotational into linear motion of a feed drive, to position the machine tool components carrying the cutting tool to the desired location.

40|$|Solid {{pharmaceutical}} tablets can {{be manufactured}} via three processing technologies: direct compression, dry granulation and wet granulation {{before the final}} compaction process. Dry granulation using roll compaction generally involves production of ribbons, followed by milling to produce granules {{and the production of}} tablets. The mechanical properties of ribbons produced during roll compaction can influence breakage behaviour in a mill and hence the performance of a drug formulation. Therefore it is important to explore critical factors that determine the quality of ribbons. In this study, MCC Avicel PH- 102 was used as the model powder for roll compaction and the critical operating factors affecting ribbon quality were studied. MCC 102 ribbons were manufactured at a range of process conditions (roll speed, <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and compaction pressure) using the TF mini roll compactor with a serrated die & punch (DPS), grooved roll surface. The key ribbon properties measured are the powder feed ratio (defined as the ratio of <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed to that of roll speed) and mass throughput ratio (defined as the mass of ribbons produced in a given time to that of fines). The porosity of ribbons was observed to depend significantly on powder feed ratio into the compaction zone. Porosity remained constant at a fixed feed ratio irrespective of the absolute roll speed and the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed conditions used. Mass throughput ratio is another factor that was introduced to describe process efficiency i. e. to draw comparison between the amount of ribbons and fines. The amount of ribbons and fines generated at a given process condition depends significantly on the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and the compaction pressure. In addition, ribbon porosity decreased with increasing pressure but there was negligible effect on ribbon porosity when excessively high pressure (> 60 bar) was used. Ribbon porosity was also observed to decrease with increasing <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed but the converse is true with increasing roll speed. In conclusion, the impact of various roll compaction process parameters were critically investigated and a detailed insight into the main factors (powder feed and mass throughput ratios) that govern the behaviour of roll compacted ribbons was provided. In future, the focus is to relate these process properties (and ribbon porosity) to granule size distribution from a milling process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough basic {{investigations}} on {{wood chip}} material properties haven been carried out, only few studies deal with transport of wood chips, {{despite the fact}} that significant problems are commonly observed when feeding biomass in industrial applications. Within the work presented, basic bulk material properties were measured and experiments carried out with a system consisting of a hopper, agitator and a screw conveyor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how three different wood chip grades and two blends of wood chips influence typical design parameters, such as mass flow and driving torque, of a biomass feeding system. The measured basic bulk properties are in good overall agreement with the literature. However, discrepancies were discovered between two standardized methods for determination of the bulk density. The results for the driving torque, mass flow and mass-related energy consumption showed that different grades of wood chips can alter these values considerably. Between two wood chip grades, a twice as high torque was recorded, while a third grade could not be fed due to jamming. One of the major findings of this study is that mixing a rather small amount of a high-fine content grade with the non-feedable grade of wood chips resulted in a blend which inhibited jamming during the <b>screw</b> <b>feeding</b> process...|$|R

In {{order to avoid the}} difficulty in determining the stiffness of rolling joints theoretically, a dynamic modeling method for analyzing the feed system is discussed, and a stiffness calculation method of the rolling joints is proposed based on the Hertz contact theory.

40|$|This thesis {{studies in}} detail the {{dynamics}} of ball <b>screw</b> <b>feed</b> drives and expands understanding {{of the factors that}} impose limitations on their performance. This knowledge is then used for developing control strategies that provide adequate command following and disturbance rejection. High performance control strategies proposed in this thesis are designed for, and implemented on, a custom-made ball screw drive. A hybrid Finite Element (FE) model for the ball screw drive is developed and coded in Matlab programming language. This FE model is employed for prediction of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the ball screw setup. The accuracy of FRFs predicted for the ball screw mechanism alone is validated against the experimental measurements obtained through impact hammer testing. Next, the FE model for the entire test setup is validated. The dynamic characteristics of the actuator current controller are also modeled. In addition, the modal parameters of the mechanical structure are extracted from measured FRFs, which include the effects of current loop dynamics. To ensure adequate command following and disturbance rejection, three motion controllers with active vibration damping capability are developed. The first is based on the sensor averaging concept which facilitates position control of the rigid body dynamics. Active damping is added to suppress vibrations. To achieve satisfactory steady state response, integral action over the tracking error is included. The stability analysis and tuning procedure for this controller is presented together with experimental results that prove the effectiveness of this method in high-speed tracking and cutting applications. The second design uses the pole placement technique to move the real component of two of the oscillatory poles further to the left along the real axis. This yields a faster rigid body response with less vibration. However, the time delay from the current loop dynamics imposes a limitation on how much the poles can be shifted to the left without jeopardizing the system’s stability. To overcome this issue, a lead filter is designed to recover the system phase at the crossover frequency. When designing the Pole Placement Controller (PPC) and the lead filter concurrently, the objective is to minimize the load side disturbance response against the disturbances. This controller is also tested in high-speed tracking and cutting experiments. The third control method is developed around the idea of using the pole placement technique for active damping of not only the first mode of vibration, but also the second and third modes as well. A Kalman filter is designed to estimate a state vector for the system, from the control input and the position measurements obtained from the rotary and linear encoders. The state estimates are then fed back to the PPC controller. Although for this control design, promising results in terms of disturbance rejection are obtained in simulations, the Nyquist stability analysis shows that the closed loop system has poor stability margins. To improve the stability margins, the McFarlane-Glover robustness optimization method is attempted, and as a result, the stability margins are improved, but at the cost of degraded performance. The practical implementation of the third controller, was, unfortunately, not successful. This thesis concludes by addressing the problem of harmonic disturbance rejection in ball screw drives. It is shown that for cases where a ball screw drive is subject to high-frequency disturbances, the dynamic positioning accuracy of the ball screw drive can be improved significantly by adopting an additional control scheme known as Adaptive Feedforward Cancellation (AFC). Details of parameter tuning and stability analysis for AFC are presented. At the end, successful implementation and effectiveness of AFC is demonstrated in applications involving time periodic or space periodic disturbances. The conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the AFC are based on results obtained from the high-speed tracking and end-milling experiments...|$|E
