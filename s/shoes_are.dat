5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|In the Northover {{district}} {{industrial production}} of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed {{in conjunction with}} the growth of C Clark in Street.

5|$|C Clark {{still has}} its {{headquarters}} in Street, behind a frontage that includes the clock tower and water tower, but <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. Despite strong concerns being voiced by local retailers at the time, the retail outlets have not led to a demise of the existing shops. The Shoe Museum provides information {{about the history of}} Clarks and footwear manufacture in general, and a selection of shop display showcards from the 1930s, the 1950s and the 1960s, and television advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{and other}} {{officers}} meet with psychiatrist Dr. Kress at a restaurant, where {{he explains that}} the Phantom is a highly intelligent sadist with a strong sex drive, {{between the ages of}} 35 and 40. As Kress expresses his doubts about their chances of capturing the Phantom, the Phantom's <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> shown, revealing that he had heard the entire conversation. At the station, a man named Johnson says that he was robbed and forced to drive a man to Lufkin at gunpoint. While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues. The suspect, Eddie LeDoux, at first denies everything, then confesses to being the Phantom, but Morales is unconvinced. Johnson identifies him as his robber.|$|E

The value is almost the same as the peak shear of subjects without callus with their usual footwear (2.03 [*]±[*] 0.42 (kgf)).|$|R
5|$|Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew {{around the}} medieval weaving industry. Street {{developed}} as a centre {{for the production of}} woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C Clark's <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street. Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia.|$|E

Some <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> designed to be worn at more formal occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. There are also {{a wide variety}} of shoes designed for different types of dancing. Orthopedic <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> special types of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs.

25|$|Ballroom shoes {{fall into}} two categories: Ballroom and Latin American. Both are characterised by suede soles. Men's ballroom <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} lace-ups with one-inch heels and patent leather uppers. Ladies' ballroom <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> typically court shoes with two-inch heels, made of fabric that can be colored to match the dancer's dress. In contrast to the low Ballroom heel, which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes. Latin <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels. Ladies <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> typically open-toed and strapped.|$|E
25|$|A {{horseshoe}} is a fabricated product, normally made of metal, although sometimes made partially or wholly {{of modern}} synthetic materials, {{designed to protect}} a horse's hoof from wear. <b>Shoes</b> <b>are</b> attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the hooves, usually nailed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human toenail, although much larger and thicker. However, there are also cases where <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> glued.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "leading/trailing" [...] {{means that}} only one <b>shoe</b> <b>is</b> [...] "leading", moving into the {{rotation}} of the drum and thus exhibiting a self-servo (or self-applying) effect. The leading <b>shoe</b> <b>is</b> [...] "dragged" [...] into the friction surface of the drum and thus achieving greater braking force. [...] The other <b>shoe</b> <b>is</b> [...] "trailing", moving against the direction of rotation, is thrown away from the friction surface of the drum and is far less effective. An advantage of an SLS brake is that is equally effective whether the vehicle is travelling forwards or in reverse. [...] When the vehicle is moving in reverse, the role of the leading and trailing <b>shoes</b> <b>is</b> switched. What would <b>be</b> the leading <b>shoe</b> when the vehicle is travelling forwards becomes the trailing shoe, and vice versa.|$|R

25|$|Many {{athletic}} <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> {{designed with}} specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels {{on the bottom}} specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E
