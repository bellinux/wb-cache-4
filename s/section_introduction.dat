This section also describes how many avatars (manifestations of the deity upon the Prime Material Plane a god of a certain power level may have, and how many spells and special powers a god can grant followers based on power level. Nonhuman Deities as Archetypal Powers describes how the deities in the book are archetypal (as opposed to the ones in Legends and Lore which do not appear in every campaign), and do not vary greatly from world to world. Integrating Human and Nonhuman Pantheons suggests how human and nonhuman deities may coexist in the same game world. Avatars gives specific details on how avatar statistics work, based on those given for each deity in the book.

Classification of the musical features for the song segment or any composition in bringing emotion is a challenging problem. Since human perception for taking decision comes under subjective nature, musical arrangement of the song varies from one emotion to other. For each emotion class, this approach deals with the necessary concentration on musical features. Results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. In the first <b>section</b> <b>introduction</b> part is given. We study the fundamentals of Fuzzy Relational Maps (FRMs) in section two. Third Section deals with the adaptation of FRM to the problem.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Related work in the same field by other authors and Industry practices have been discussed in <b>Section</b> <b>Introduction</b> & overview. The analytical foundation of our proposed decision model has been elaborated in Section Related work. The decision model has been applied on data center’s real time data set and results have been analyzed in Section Analytical foundations of the decision model. We have compared our model with other mathematical models used in data center and explored the ways to overcome the drawbacks of CD function in conclusion Section Results and discussion.

40|$|Nigeria as {{a nation}} is faced with many {{challenges}} in which unemployment is paramount. Many graduate youths roam about the streets without jobs. The ones that are self-employed do not have training that could sustain their businesses. This paper attempts to look at capacity building for entrepreneurs and sustainable development. The purpose of the paper is to examine how entrepreneurship could be sustained in Nigeria through capacity building programmes. The unemployed youths will find this study useful because it will expose them to different entrepreneurships in Nigeria and make them to give more importance to traditional education that exist in their families. The entrepreneurs in Nigeria will find this study a valuable asset that will make them to go for more capacity building programmes. The study will also give the federal government of Nigeria an impetus to give more support and assistance to entrepreneurship. The paper is in four main sections. The first <b>section,</b> <b>introduction</b> contains a brief explanation of the key terms: entrepreneurship, capacity building, development and sustainable development. Section two examined capacity building programmes for entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Section three x-rayed the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Conclusion is the fourth sectio...|$|E
30|$|The first {{competency}} question (Q 1, see Section Motivating scenario) is {{the focus}} of this section. As mentioned in <b>Section</b> <b>Introduction,</b> resolution is a property of a representation. On that account, two terms are introduced: spatial resolution, and temporal resolution. The spatial resolution is the amount of spatial detail in an observation, and the temporal resolution is the amount of temporal detail in an observation. Previous work has proposed to model the spatial and temporal resolution of an observation using one of two approaches: a stimulus-centric approach and a property-centric approach. A stimulus-centric approach constrains spatial/temporal resolution using the spatial/temporal extent of the stimulus participating in the observation process. It suffers from vagueness issues regarding the determination of the spatial extent of the stimulus, and strongly depends on one’s adopted view (i.e., stimulus as process or an event) for the determination of the temporal extent of the stimulus. A property-centric approach specifies resolution based on the spatial/temporal region over which the property of interest is considered homogeneous. It avoids vagueness issues, but needs to accommodate arbitrariness since there might be various reasons for which a data provider considers the property of interest homogeneous for his/her data collection purposes. To cope with both issues, our work introduces a receptor-centric approach where the spatial and temporal resolution of a single sensor observation are specified based on the physical properties of the observer. The three approaches are discussed in detail next.|$|E
