Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no need for Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E

Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E

25|$|The anti-corruption lobby Transparency International has put Equatorial Guinea {{in the top}} 12 of {{its list}} of most corrupt states. Freedom House, a pro-democracy and human rights NGO, {{described}} Obiang {{as one of the}} world’s “most kleptocratic living autocrats,” and complained about the US government welcoming his administration and buying oil from it. Dismissing the international voices that call for more transparency, Obiang has for long held that oil revenues are a state secret. In 2008 the country became a candidate of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative – an international project meant to promote openness about government oil revenues – but failed to qualify by an April 2010 deadline. The advocacy group Global Witness has been lobbying the United States to act against Obiang's son, Teodorin, who is vice-president and a government minister. It <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> credible evidence that he spent millions buying a Malibu, California mansion and private jet using corruptly acquired funds – grounds for denying him a visa. In February 2010, Equatorial Guinea signed a contract with the MPRI subsidiary of the US defense corporation L3 Communications for coastal surveillance and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the song}} is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to {{religious}} interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the Book of Job [...] and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness. [...] Robyn Brothers suggests that ultraviolet light is [...] "a metaphor for a divine force both unseen {{to the naked eye}} and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect." [...] Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2, sees [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as being about Bono's wife Ali Hewson, and [...] "how when he feels like trash, she makes him clean," [...] but <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> good reason to interpret the song as being just as much about God. The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.|$|E

While married life was not easy, he <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing he would change. In [...] "The Quarterback", Burt is shown with Kurt and Carole after the death of Finn as they attempt to clean out Finn's room. He decides to keep the football from Kurt's first game, and the lamp from Kurt's basement re-decoration. He expresses his grief by saying that he should have hugged Finn more, and comforts Carole when she starts to break down.

500|$|Anne {{shared with}} James {{the fault of}} extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her {{considerable}} dowry. She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in Presbyterian Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in Jacobean London, where she created a [...] "rich and hospitable" [...] cultural climate at the royal court, became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish masques. Sir Walter Cope, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother Ulrik of Holstein's visit, wrote, [...] "Burbage is come and <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called Love's Labour's Lost which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly." [...] Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle, were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that [...] "in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; {{but no one else}} does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the family, except for Marge, {{watching}} a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims [...] "It's like they saw our lives and put it right on screen," [...] and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something [...] "disturbing" [...] about him, which results in Lisa imagining him as being The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is {{a reference to the}} soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the [...] "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" [...] category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.|$|E
