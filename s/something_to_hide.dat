25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone else) can no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could not talk about the submarines deal on a cell phone for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests he might have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ma Chao is {{introduced}} in Chapter 10, where he participates {{in a campaign}} led by his father and Han Sui against Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang'an in 192, during which he slays the enemy officers Wang Fang (王方) and Li Meng (李蒙). He does not reappear until Chapter 57, in which he suggests to his father that he could lead the army against Cao Cao at Xuchang in 211 to follow Emperor Xian's orders to slay Cao Cao, but his father tells him to remain in Liang Province and command the Qiang troops there. After his father is killed by Cao Cao, Ma Chao, Han Sui and another eight officers fight against Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass, during which Ma Chao fights with Cao Cao's generals Xu Chu, Yu Jin, Cao Hong and Zhang He, and slays Li Tong. Later, Cao Cao's strategist, Jia Xu, suggests to Cao Cao {{to send a letter}} containing errors and markings (making it seem as though the recipient has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide)</b> to Han Sui to make Ma Chao falsely believe that Han Sui is maintaining secret contact with Cao Cao. Ma Chao gradually becomes more suspicious of Han Sui, who also has the intention of defecting to Cao Cao's side after learning that Ma Chao no longer trusts him. Han Sui manages to escape when Ma Chao tries to kill him, but his left hand is cut off by Ma during the fight. Ma Chao is eventually defeated by Cao Cao's forces, but manages to escape and find shelter among the Qiang tribes.|$|E

Mental health difficulties were brushed under layers of silence. Stigma forced individuals <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> absolved communities of the responsibility to support them and allowed every government since the creation of the State to ignore and neglect mental health services. Underlying this stigma were basic untruths which however false were widely accepted: “mental health difficulties happen to other people”; “it’s the person’s fault”; “someone can never get over mental health problems”.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} way children’s {{literature}} {{and popular culture}} sometimes represents play-based relationships between {{the old and the}} young as <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hidden</b> from others. Using an approach to literary criticism based on Personal Construct Psychology, the author investigates the ways that depictions of relationships formed through play can lead to close bonds and shared secrets to be kept from parents, friends and teachers. Drawing upon the author’s doctoral study, the chapter includes close analyses of David Walliams’ Gangsta Granny and Richard Curtis and Rebecca Cobb’s Snow Day in order to delve into the way play is used as a literary device to develop a connection between the generations, sometimes to the exclusion of the middle (parent) group. Sociocultural questions of appropriateness and the sometimes unintentionally sinister implications of the relationships depicted are discussed, alongside the way constructions of childhood and old-age, which often lack authority within the wider narrative, are validated through shared recreation...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{concerning}} {{body and}} religion have highlighted the normative dimension of this relationship. Especially in some Christian denominations, {{the body has}} been frequently linked with sin, guilt and other negative perspectives. As some scholars suggest this association of the body with sin {{can be read as}} a strategy to keep people under control. Exploring body policy in some Brazilian Pentecostal denominations this article argues {{that there has been a}} shift in body control, from rules concerning the practical use of the body to regulations towards the aesthetic body, especially appearance and image. Although for many churches the body is still <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hidden,</b> some denominations encourage worshippers to care for their bodies and appearance, to wear fancy clothes and to be beautiful. It seems that these denominations are aware that the body is also a medium and see the aesthetically controlled body as a channel to convey religious meanings in a society saturated with media technology...|$|R
