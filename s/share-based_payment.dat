40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 <b>Share-based</b> <b>payments</b> {{have become}} a popular form of {{employee}} remuneration, largely for its potential to address the agency problem and are especially effective when made to senior employees. Accounting standards require companies to report <b>share-based</b> <b>payments</b> made to employees as expenses in their financial statements, but extant South African tax legislation does not permit a deduction where shares are awarded to serve as incentives for senior employees. This {{is due to the}} fact that the courts do not view the issue of a company‟s own shares as “expenditure”. South African tax legislation presently contains a special tax deduction for shares awarded to employees, but this provision‟s low monetary limit and restrictive requirements are considered to be inadequate, where the intention is to provide adequate incentives to senior employees in order to address the agency problem. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether sufficient grounds exist, based on the principles of sound tax policy, for the legislature to enact a special tax deduction for <b>share-based</b> <b>payments,</b> which would serve as an adequate incentive to senior employees. The evaluation found that the current tax position infringes upon several principles of sound tax policy and that an intervention by the legislature is required. Master...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE – This study aims to {{investigate}} the post-implementation impact of expensing <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> transactions on basic earnings per share. In recent years, IFRS 2 {{was one of the}} most opposed and controversial standards issued by the IASB. DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH – The sample relates to the period immediately after implementation (2006 - 2009) and consists of the 531 firm-year observations where share-based payments were present among Johannesburg Stock Exchange listed companies. The effect of share-based payments on basic earnings per share is assessed. FINDINGS – The findings of this study show a statistically significant impact on basic earnings per share, but the results are more modest than suggested by prior studies. The number of companies reporting a <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> expense increased over the five-year period 2005 - 2009. ORIGINALITY / VALUE – The introduction of IFRS 2 caused small but not necessarily immaterial changes to the income profile of companies. This is important for analysts and general users of financial information who need to be aware of these changes. The results also suggest that IFRS 2 did not merely cause accounting policy changes, but has impacted on the way <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> transactions are used by companies. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} surrounding {{whether a}} <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> constitutes expenditure, is, {{to a large}} extent, unresolved.

40|$|M. Comm. (International Accounting) The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} effect of applying a fair value model after the grant date to employee share options. The research assesses {{the appropriateness of}} the requirements of IFRS 2 <b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment</b> transactions with a specific focus on equity-settled Employee Share Options. The researcher has calculated the percentage movements or changes of fair value between each financial year including the overall percentage change. The study was mainly triggered by the IFRS 2 <b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment</b> rules and various arguments from different authors challenging the appropriateness of IFRS 2 <b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment</b> on employee share options (ESOs) transactions in capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder at exercise date when applying a grant date accounting model. The study provides insights into whether a grant date accounting model is appropriate in measuring ESOs and capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder. The application of a static fair value model in measuring the value of ESOs has the potential for both positive and negative effects on the compensation cost recognised in the financial statements over the vesting period. After analysing the descriptive financial data on fair value per option over the six year period included in the sample selection, a conclusion was reached that, IASB should consider to true-up or make a restatement of the opening balance of the fair value reserves account in order to minimise the potential permanent error in equity accounts and to minimise the potential effect of understating or overstating the compensation cost. The IASB should further consider the proper classification of equity instruments issued to employee ESOs which comply with other financial instrument accounting standards such as the IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This will ensure that transactions viewed as economic equivalents of each other are treated in the same way from an accounting perspective, and the correct measurement basis of ESOs may be achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{issuance}} of IFRS 2 – <b>Share-based</b> <b>payment,</b> in 2004, raised several criticisms, mostly related with one {{specific type of}} <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> transaction – employee stock options (ESO). The mandatory recognition and disclosure of its fair value impacted not only profitability, but also a corporate governance related issue – executives’ remuneration. Given the specificities of this particular type of call options, entities are faced with some difficulties in applying option pricing models to its valuation, but are also faced with opportunities to exercise managerial discretion over the model inputs. This thesis analyses and comments IFRS 2 guidelines in detail, supported by existing literature. It also applies the guidelines provided by this standard to a specific case study – Nestlé’s employee stock options granted in 2011 - to truly understand the difficulties and opportunities that an entity faces when estimating fair value of ESO. After providing 28 valid alternative valuations for the same ESO grant, we conclude that, in 2011, Nestlé apparently understated the amount expensed {{with regard to the}} ESO granted, possibly due to opportunistic motivations to reduce the perceived executives’ remuneration and to increase the perceived entity’s profitability.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure document on a proposed Statement, <b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment,</b> an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, which addresses the accounting for compensation to employees {{in the form of}} equity shares, including stock options. GAO recognizes that this is a complex and controversial issue on which reasonable people can and do disagree. In light of the above, there has been a renewed interest for the Congress to legislate accounting rules for stock options. Notwithstanding our and others' views on the merits of various accounting methods for stock options, GAO believes that the principle of independence, both in fact and in appearance, is essential to the credibility of and confidence in any authoritative standard-setting processes. With respect to the role of FASB in this and other areas, we support its efforts, as the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) designated independent private-sector standard-setting body, to identify issues for consideration, prepare exposure documents, conduct outreach efforts and solicit comments on exposure documents, and consider the resulting comments in finalizing and issuing new accounting standards. This time-tested and proven deliberative process has served to strengthen financial reporting and ensure general acceptance of the nation's accounting standards. This process is especially important given the complexity and controversial nature of some accounting standards, including the accounting for share-based payments. We note that FASB has an established process in place to obtain feedback from its constituent groups, including financial statement preparers, auditors, and users such as individual investors, institutional investors, lenders, creditors, professional analysts, and various other parties. These processes were established in order to balance the competing interests and demands of the various groups while providing standards that promote transparent, credible, and comparable financial information. We believe it is critical that FASB complete its analysis of comments received on its exposure document on <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> and finalize its proposed Statement in accordance with its established independent standard-setting process. As a safeguard, the Congress has provided the SEC with oversight responsibility for FASB standard-setting activities. The SEC determined that FASB met the statutory criteria established in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In our opinion, the FASB's independent standard-setting process, subject to SEC oversight, should be allowed to proceed in its consideration of accounting for stock options. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair value {{measurement}} by 228 listed companies in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (b) optional use of fair value measurement. Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and <b>share-based</b> <b>payments</b> (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair value measurement. Under IAS 39, the fair value option for other financial assets and other financial liabilities decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in other areas (intangible assets, plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair value measurement for most companies.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of listed French firms in 2005, the year of {{mandatory}} IFRS adoption in the European Union (EU), we investigate the determinants of disclosure compliance of stock option expenses under IFRS 2, <b>Share-based</b> <b>Payment.</b> Stock options are a popular means of executive compensation in France relative to other EU countries. Prior to 2005, French accounting standards and corporate governance regulations did not require recognition of option expense amounts and required minimal supplementary disclosures. There was also a perception that enforcement was imperfect, in particular with respect to IFRS 2. Given this setting, we explore what factors influence the willingness of firms to follow compulsory IFRS requirements in a weak regulatory setting. We find that overall compliance with IFRS 2 disclosure requirements increases with U. S. and U. K. institutional ownership, U. S. cross-listing, provision of English language statements, and decreases with CEO and family ownership of the firm. We also investigate how stock market prices {{are affected by the}} recognition and disclosure of stock option expenses according to IFRS 2 in this regulatory setting and find that investors value option expenses positively, particularly when accompanied by high-disclosure compliance.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the {{incremental}} valuation implication of excess realized tax benefit under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 R: <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> (123 R excess tax benefit), which is required to be reported {{as a component of}} financing cash flows by the publicly traded corporations. Design/methodology/approach – The sample comprises of Standard and Poor's (S&P); large-, mid- and small-cap firms who adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) on January 1, 2006. The study covers a time period of the first and second quarters of 2006. Findings – The multivariate regression analyses indicate that the capital market evaluates the SFAS 123 R excess tax benefit in presence of accruals, and operating, investing and other financing cash-flow components at different rates in pricing equity securities. Research limitations/implications – The primary results, however, are mostly restricted to large- and mid-cap S&P firms. No incremental valuation consequence of SFAS 123 R excess tax benefits for small-cap S&P firms is observed. Originality/value – The findings suggest that the 123 R excess tax benefit reported as a financing cash-flow component is incrementally informative in equity valuation but the timing and extent of its market valuation is impacted by firm size, its visibility and information environment, and the magnitude of the excess realized tax benefit in dollar terms.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{distinction}} between ‘equity’ and ‘liabilities’ in financial reporting {{in order to assess}} the merits of the current system of accounting for <b>share-based</b> <b>payment</b> transactions. It applies an interpretive methodology. Data were collected from a series of interviews with purposefully selected experts. Criticisms of and support for the current accounting regime are interpretively analysed and used to identify key themes or principles for evaluating the merits of three models proposed in the academic literature: the strict liability, narrow equity and ownership-settlement models. The study finds that the strict liability approach remains supported {{on the grounds that it}} provides decisionuseful information with which users are familiar. The other models are rejected as they are perceived as diminishing the usefulness of financial reporting. The study also identifies support for an obligation-centric approach, not fully developed in the literature, which may require detailed consideration by standard-setters. Overall, these findings will be useful for both practitioners and academics grappling with the difficulty of defining ‘equity’ and ‘liabilities’. In addition, the research makes a valuable contribution by addressing the need for interpretive-inspired financial reporting research.

As a result of the ever-increasing complexities brought on by a rules-based standard approach, several countries and regions including Japan, China, Hong Kong, the European Union, and the United States have all begun to converge their respective generally accepted accounting standards towards more principles-based accounting standards. The research conducted examines through a comparison of various nations and regions generally accepted accounting principles for important issues to determine which, if any, are deemed to have an objective-oriented standard; also, if the comparison does not result in an objective-oriented standard then derive any modifications that may need to be made to have the particular standard qualify as an objective-oriented or principles-based standard. The important concepts compared included: intangible assets, accounting for impairment, related party transactions, financial instruments with a specific focus on derivatives and hedges, stock options and <b>share-based</b> <b>payments,</b> business combinations, and segment reporting. This study serves as a preliminary comparison for principles-based standard setting. Taking into consideration that definitive plans for revision of current regional and national accounting standards have not been finalized, this particular study gives some insight as to the possible direction or possible revisions that will be made to implement a unified, principles-based accounting standard set...|$|R

This evidence can be also confirmed by the opposition that many high-tech companies expressed to the amendment of SFAS 123, which requires the recognition of <b>share-based</b> <b>payments</b> at the fair value measured at the grant date. Starting from this background, the study aims at summarize the accounting treatment of both SFAS 123 and IFRS 2, focusing on the alternative pricing models that could be adopted (binomial tree, Black-Scholes) and the disclosure required. Additionally, the dynamic fiscal context in Italy has been analysed in order to emphasize the potential impact that it could have, together with the accounting treatment required by IFRS 2, on the future granting of stock option by firms as incentive mechanisms. The chapter is organised as follows. Firstly, the accounting treatment of stock option in U. S. has been considered. Secondly, this treatment has been compared with those approved by the EU and applied to Italian consolidated financial statements starting from 2005 (the IFRS 2), focusing on both pricing models and corporate disclosure.

This can be also confirmed by the recent opposition that many high-tech companies expressed to the amendment of SFAS 123, which requires the recognition of <b>share-based</b> <b>payments</b> at the fair value measured at the grant date. The same accounting treatment has been chosen by IFRS 2, which has been already approved by the EU and has been applied to Italian consolidated financial statements starting from 2005. This paper aims at determining whether there is an association between the granting of employee stock option plans and the adoption of earnings management practices aimed at improving the profit during the years when plans are issued. Our investigation uses the “modified Jones model” on a sample of Italian listed companies to study earnings management behaviour. This analysis can make a preliminary contribution to assess whether recognition required by IFRS 2 will imply a future reduction in the granting of stock options as incentive means. In fact, this accounting standard not only gives rise to a change in earnings figures and corporate disclosure, but could also force entities to revise their employee incentive policies. In such a perspective, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the shift to IFRS 2 will lead companies that in the past issued stock option plans essentially for earnings management reasons to lessen the use of employee stock options as a form of compensation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of {{corporate}} scandals and excessive stock options compensation, International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) has introduced a new accounting standard, IIFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The scope of the standard extends beyond payments to employees, but {{for the purpose of}} this study, the focus is only on 'employee stock options'. IIFRS 2 requires a fair value of stock options records calculated on grant date, and recognized as compensation expenses over vesting periods. Prior to the introduction of IIFRS 2, stock options were not recognized and were only disclosed in the notes to the accounts. In Malaysia, the standard is mandatory for all companies listed on or after January 1, 2006. This study assumes the requirement existed in 2003. This study examines the impact of stock options expenses from 2003 to 2005, on the top 100 Malaysian companies. The three year observations show at least 24 % of the sample exceeds the 5 % materiality threshold on diluted EPS. The sectors that are impacted the most are the Trade/Service and Finance sectors. From the multiple-regression test, this study finds that fair value of stock options have a negative relationship with dividend yields (input of the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) Model). Most companies in the sample are found to pay dividends and grant stock options at the same time. Therefore, this study suggests that companies need to restructure their compensation plan thus balancing the stock options granted and dividends paid in the future. <b>Share-based</b> <b>payment,</b> IFRS 2, FRS 2, Malaysian companies, stock options, stock options valuation...|$|E

Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 13, 21 - 37] subsequently also use SFAS 123 disclosures to determine that the average impact of expensing stock-based compensation on diluted EPS for non-US domiciled firms listed on US exchanges will be material and approximately 40 %. In this paper, we examine whether these findings apply across international borders to firms that are required from 2005 to adopt IFRS 2 <b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment</b> to expense stock-based payments, and across a broad range of industries and firms' growth phases. Based on Australian Stock Exchange-listed firms' 2002 stock-based compensation disclosures of the value of options granted to directors and the top 5 executives, the expensing of options will have a significant negative effect on approximately 20 % of our sample firms' financial performance ratios. It appears that the materiality of the impact is neither industry specific nor restricted to high growth firms. As the IFRS 2 expensing requirement extends to stock-based compensation issued to all employees, our findings are conservative estimates of the impact. The findings suggest that a stock-based compensation accounting policy change will affect recognised financial numbers and could have consequential ramifications for contractual specifications and valuations of firms across a range of industries and growth phases. Our sample of Australian firms provides an interesting context for the study, since these firms have neither traditionally expensed nor necessarily disclosed stock-based payments but from 2005, all stock-exchange listed Australian firms will be at the forefront of IFRS 2 adoption...|$|E
40|$|The {{mandatory}} {{adoption of}} IFRS 2 and its equivalent FAS 123 R (<b>Share-Based</b> <b>Payment)</b> presented {{a radical change}} in financial reporting of Share-Option Based Compensation (SOBC). Both IASB and FASB adopted the view that disclosure is not an adequate substitute for recognition; consequently, all SOBC transactions ultimately lead to expense recognition, measured at the grant-date fair value of SOBC. This thesis identifies and evaluates the major financial reporting implications of alternative reporting methods of accounting for SOBC across a global context and over different time periods for pre and post adoption of IFRS 2 /FAS 123 R. It explores two key research questions using an international sample of US and EU banks over the period (2004 - 2011). The first research question aims to identify, analyse, compare and evaluate the total effect of the compulsory adoption of IFRS 2 /FAS 123 R, on selected banks’ performance measures. Underpinned by equity valuation and agency theories, the second question aims to assess {{the extent to which}} the mandatory recognition approach to expensing SOBC provides more value relevant information that better reflects the incentive properties of such rewards than the disclosure approach. The findings show that the expensing of SOBC has resulted in modest and statistically significant negative effects on both US and EU banks’ selected financial performance measures with the impact being more likely to be higher in the US banking sector. The reported modest impact does not reflect earlier research estimations indicating that concerns and criticism of the implementation of IFRS 2 /FAS 123 R are largely unsubstantiated. The results also indicate that the recognition regime to expense SOBC is significantly more value relevant and better reflects the intangible value attributable to such rewards, relative to the disclosure regime. The influence of the differences in the financial reporting contexts on the intangible value attributable to SOBC is less burdensome after the mandatory adoption of IFRS 2 /FAS 123 R...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} to IFRS 2 (<b>Share-based</b> <b>payments)</b> in the Italian context introduces relevant innovations to stock option accounting, {{in terms of}} accounting treatment, valuation and disclosure. According to Italian GAAPs, the only impact of stock options on the annual report of listed companies was the equity increase after option exercise, without any expense recognition in the P&L or fair value disclosure in the notes. In such a context, the adoption of IFRS 2 - requiring to recognise a stock option expense measured at fair value when options are issued – is a radical change aimed at enhancing transparency over this form of compensation. In the light of these considerations, {{the primary purpose of}} this article is to identify and discuss potential application issues of IFRS 2. In pursuit of this objective, first it outlines a picture of the Italian context, exploring the diffusion of share-based plans and their main features among the largest Italian blue chips in the manufacturing and service industry. Application issues are discussed more in detail with reference to a simulation performed on the IFRS 2 adoption for a real stock option plan. Then, the article presents the results of an analysis carried out on the first half-year reports applying IFRS 2 in the Italian context, highlighting different choices made by listed firms to manage application issues. The article is structured as follows. The first section describes the Italian context before the mandatory adoption of IFRS 2 in terms of the diffusion and main features of share-based plans (through an analysis of 2003 annual reports). Section two presents the main changes brought by IFRS 2 in terms of accounting treatment, valuation and disclosure. The next section discusses the possible application of IFRS 2 on a real case drawn by a 2003 blue chip annual report, highlighting the hypotheses that managers must develop and the degree of discretion of the IFRS 2 valuation process. Section four focuses on the analysis of the first application of IFRS 2 in 2004 half-year reports of a sample of Italian blue chips. The last section provides conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (“Act”) entitles {{taxpayers to}} deduct certain losses and {{expenses}} incurred by {{them from their}} taxable income if such losses and expenses {{comply with the requirements}} of section 11 (a) of the Act. One of the requirements of section 11 (a) is that, in order to be eligible for a deduction, the losses and expenses must have been “actually incurred” by the taxpayer. The area of tax deductions in our tax law represents the frontline in the continuous and inevitable war between the taxpayer (almost always desperately trying to maximise her deductions) and the revenue authorities (as often times desperately trying to minimise the deductions to which the taxpayer is entitled). The stage on which the various battles which make up this mighty war between citizen and state are fought is the court and the arsenal with which each party comes armed is the Act and, more specifically, the absolute belief of each party in the correctness of their interpretation of the Act, which, each party hopes, will be ably demonstrated by their able (and often extremely expensive) counsel. Such is the determination of the taxpayer and the tax authorities alike that the body of case law relating to this specific area of our law is, especially when one considers that it essentially involves on only one section of the Act, relatively voluminous. The author’s intention is to consider only one of the requirements with which the taxpayer must comply in order to be eligible for a deduction, namely, the requirement that the relevant loss or expenditure must have been “actually incurred” by the taxpayer. Despite the fact that the meaning of the phrase “actually incurred” has been considered extensively by our courts, significant uncertainty still exists as to its exact meaning. The author will deal with three specific contexts in which the meaning of this phrase remains a subject of uncertainty, namely, <b>share-based</b> <b>payments,</b> contingent liabilities and losses and expenses incurred in relation to illegal receipts. The author will begin first by dealing with the interpretation of tax statutes, the author will then, in general terms, consider the general deduction formula after which the author will delve into the meaning of the phrase “actually incurred” in the contexts of each of the transactions mentioned above.
