50|$|In the United States, <b>syndicated</b> {{programming}} <b>accounts</b> for {{a majority}} of the revenue of local network-affiliated and independent stations. Network programming (on stations that have a network affiliation), newscasts or other locally produced programs (if a station carries any), and infomercials make up the rest. Since paid programming once made up a relatively sizable portion of Ion's schedule (prior to 2008), the benefit is that it provides the main source of revenue. However, this is also a drawback as, in the past, Ion had relied more on infomercials rather than sitcoms and dramas; sponsors of television series often have qualms about their message being lost on stations whose primary content is infomercials and other paid programming. Ion Television's reliance on mostly paid programming has decreased since the late 2000s, {{as a result of the}} network's expansion of entertainment programming to additional daytime and late night timeslots, and in particular, the later creation of the infomercial-dedicated subchannel service Ion Shop. Ion Television stations also lack locally produced programming; most of its stations had aired newscasts from other local network-affiliated stations until the rebrand as i, and have even produced their own community affairs shows; however, local programming has since become virtually non-existent on most of Ion's O&Os and affiliates.|$|R

Moreover, we find that, under certain conditions and for certain classes of borrowers, the more timely syndicated credit data can provide some useful advance information about the consolidated data. Filtering {{syndicated credits}} A direct comparison of the two data sets is less than straightforward. As shown in Table 1, while syndicated credit data are a mixture of domestic and international lending facilities, the BIS banking statistics focus exclusively on international lending. The syndicated credits are gross announcements of loan facilities (ie loan commitments which need not be drawn down fully or immediately), while the changes in amounts outstanding in the BIS data are driven mainly by net new lending (actual disbursements). Since the BIS data are obtained from balance sheets, they give a more accurate picture of banks 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS. 2 Estimated outstanding stocks of syndicated loans amount to about 50 % of outstanding BIS bank loans to Latin America and developing Europe, but to around 100 % of those to Asia and the Africa-Middle East region.

5000|$|In 1880, Starbuck {{was one of}} ten men {{appointed}} to a committee to select Republican delegates {{from the state of}} North Carolina to vote in the 1880 National Convention. The other nine members of the committee were lawyer and Collector of the Port of Wilmington W. P. Cannady, former District 1 State Senator from Pasquotank County C. W. Grandy, D. A. Jenkins, James H. Harris, Orlando Hubbs, Col. Lott Williams Humphreys, the state Collector of Internal Revenue Dr. John James Mott, former District 7 Collector Pinkney Rollins, who was {{at the time of his}} committee appointment a Clerk in the Loans Division of the Treasury Department, and the committee's chairman Col. Thomas B. Keogh. Before the committee first met on January 29, 1880, it was believed that all members of the committee were supporters of president Grant, with the exception of Cannady, who was widely known to be a fervent supporter of Secretary Sherman. However, by the day of the committee meeting, when delegates would be elected, 5 new members had shifted their allegiances to Sherman. Among those five, were Darius Starbuck, along with Grandy, Harris, Mott, and Rollins. It was revealed, according to a nationally <b>syndicated</b> newspaper <b>account</b> which ran in The New York Times, that Cannady, after having been privy to a personal conference with Sherman, had agreed to secure other committee members' loyalties by promising favors and government office appointments. If a majority of committee members sided with Sherman, the delegate selection could be packed with Sherman supporters. According to the article, originally published in a Raleigh newspaper on February 3, [...] "Cannady, casting around for the next capture, fixed his eye upon D. H. Starbuck, of Winston." [...] — [...] "He has been in very comfortable worldly circumstances ever since time as US Attorney, for such an office can be made profitable." [...] — [...] "It was not known that Starbuck still had any hard feelings about choice not to reappoint Starbuck as US Attorney, but Cannady knew his man. To Starbuck was sent former Senator Joseph C. Abbott, now a Special Agent of the Treasury at $6 per day, with duties to secure Sherman delegates. Abbott approached Starbuck on the sore side of the lost District Attorneyship; he vividly portrayed to him his injuries in being so unjustly displaced, and insinuated that it would be the easiest thing in the world to get back again, especially as the term of Mr. Lusk, the present United States District Attorney, expired in May next. All he had to do was come out for Sherman. Starbuck came out." [...] The author went on to write that two days before the committee was to meet, [...] "Starbuck declared his conviction that the interests of himself and the Republican Party demanded the election of Sherman delegates to the National Convention —— Mr. Starbuck to be one of them." [...] To be stated more clearly, Starbuck chose to nominate himself as one of his state's delegates at the Republican National Convention. In a follow-up to that report, first published on March 10, it was said that, [...] "There had been so much disgust at the action of the State Committee on the 29th of January, that it is now asserted that Messrs. J. H. Harris and D. H. Starbuck have recanted and are for Grant. The pressure may become so great that they will properly represent the sentiment of the party at Chicago, but their action cannot be foretold." [...] It was also reported at this time that a new appointment deal had been struck with Starbuck in the event of a presidential win for Sherman. Gen. Rufus Barringer was to have been given the appointment of US Attorney for the Western District, though the choice to remove Lusk from his post had not yet been definitively decided, as Lusk had recently declared support for Sherman. Even so, the likelihood of Barringer's appointment was still considered to be [...] "probable", as Lusk had [...] "been compelled in the execution of his office to make himself very unpopular, and had no influence in his district." [...] Now, [...] "Starbuck stipulated that if Sherman succeeded, he Starbuck should succeed Dr. W. H. Wheeler as the Collector of the Fifth District." [...] This decision was made because of Wheeler's allegiance to Grant. John Sherman did not become president, nor did he win his party's nomination. Starbuck was never appointed as District 5 Collector.|$|R
