60|$|His {{black eyes}} flashed {{out of a}} swarthy face nearly covered with beard; his soft hat had fallen off when the captain struck him, and his black hair stood up like {{bristles}} on a <b>shoe-brush.</b> He was not a large man; he wore a loose woolen jacket; his sleeves were short, and his hands were hairy.|$|E
60|$|When {{her guests}} went {{home in the}} starlit December dusk, Miss Cornelia walked {{part of the way}} with them and had a long {{confidential}} talk with Mrs. Grant. When she returned it was to find Hannah groaning in and over the kitchen and the schoolteacher dreamily trying to clean some molasses off his boots with the kitchen hairbrush. Long-suffering Miss Cornelia rescued her property and despatched Mr. Palmer into the woodshed to find the <b>shoe-brush.</b> Then she sat down and laughed.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} M. Todgers was not up yet, for Mr Pecksniff knocked twice and rang thrice, without making any {{impression}} on {{anything but a}} dog over the way. At last a chain and some bolts were withdrawn with a rusty noise, as if the weather had made the very fastenings hoarse, and a small boy with a large red head, and no nose to speak of, and a very dirty Wellington boot on his left arm, appeared; who (being surprised) rubbed the nose just mentioned {{with the back of}} a <b>shoe-brush,</b> and said nothing.|$|E
60|$|The {{man had a}} small, shabby-looking box {{before him}} on the ground, {{with a box of}} {{blacking}} on one side of it, and several <b>shoe-brushes</b> upon the other. Holding another brush in his hand, he politely seconded his verbal invitation by gracefully flourishing the brush in the air.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} book, William Povey, a boy ghost from Victorian times, appears in Roddy's bedroom {{in the dead}} of night and frightens the wits out of him. William {{explains}} that he is being chased by a GHOST HUNTER and he needs help. After his initial fears and shock, Roddy decides to try to help his new friend. Apart from anything else, the ghost has some exciting abilities, such as passing through walls and flying, which Roddy is also able to do, thanks to the <b>shoe-brushes</b> which William lends him.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the humble}} treasures of {{furniture}} brought into Titbull's by the inmates when they establish themselves {{in that place}} of contemplation {{for the rest of}} their days, by far the greater and more valuable part belongs to the ladies. I may claim the honour of having either crossed the threshold, or looked in at the door, of every one of the nine ladies, and I have noticed that they are all particular in the article of bedsteads, and maintain favourite and long-established bedsteads and bedding as a regular part of their rest. Generally an antiquated chest of drawers is among their cherished possessions; a tea-tray always is. I know of at least two rooms in which a little tea-kettle of genuine burnished copper, vies with the cat in winking at the fire; and one old lady has a tea-urn set forth in state on the top of her chest of drawers, which urn is used as her library, and contains four duodecimo volumes, and a black-bordered newspaper giving an account of the funeral of Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte. Among the poor old gentlemen there are no such niceties. Their furniture has the air of being contributed, like some obsolete Literary Miscellany, 'by several hands;' their few chairs never match; old patchwork coverlets linger among them; and they have an untidy habit of keeping their wardrobes in hat-boxes. When I recall one old gentleman who is rather choice in his <b>shoe-brushes</b> and blacking-bottle, I have summed up the domestic elegances of that side of the building.|$|R
6000|$|The {{only one}} of the family that could not be made fashionable was the retired butcher himself. Honest Lamb, in spite of the meekness of his name, was a rough, hearty old fellow, with the voice of a lion, a head of black hair like a <b>shoe-brush,</b> and a broad face mottled like his own beef. It was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as [...] "the old gentleman,' {{addressed}} him as [...] "papa" [...] in tones of infinite softness, and endeavored to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers and other gentlemanly habits. Do what they might, there was no keeping down the butcher. His sturdy nature would break through all their glozings. He had a hearty vulgar good-humor that was irrepressible. His very jokes made his sensitive daughters shudder, and he persisted in wearing his blue cotton coat of a morning, dining at two o'clock, and having a [...] "bit of sausage with his tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the {{stranger}} owned, [...] "but I don't {{know that there}} wasn't something more extraordinary still. From time to time {{the girl in the}} stateroom kept piping up, with a shriek for help. She had got past the burglar stage, but she wanted to be saved, anyhow, from some danger which she didn't specify. It went through me that it was very strange nobody called the porter, and I set up a shout of 'Porter!' on my own account. I decided that if there were burglars the porter was the man to put them out, and that if there were no burglars the porter could relieve our groundless fears. Sure enough, he came rushing in, as soon as I called for him, from the little corner by the smoking-room where he was blacking boots between dozes. He was wide enough awake, if having his eyes open meant that, and he had a shoe on one hand and a <b>shoe-brush</b> in the other. But he merely joined in the general up-roar and shouted for the police." ...|$|E
60|$|Did {{you ever}} see a man, with his hair shaved off, and just {{recovered}} from the yellow fever? Well, just such a looking man was this sailor. He was as yellow as gamboge, had no more whisker on his cheek, than I have on my elbows. His hair had fallen out, and left him very bald, except in the nape of his neck, and just behind the ears, where it was stuck over with short little tufts, and looked like a worn-out <b>shoe-brush.</b> His nose had broken down in the middle, and he squinted with one eye, and did not look very {{straight out of the}} other. He dressed a good deal like a Bowery boy; for he despised the ordinary sailor-rig; wearing a pair of great over-all blue trowsers, fastened with suspenders, and three red woolen shirts, one over the other; for he was subject to the rheumatism, and was not in good health, he said; and he had a large white wool hat, with a broad rolling brim. He was a native of New York city, and had a good deal to say about highlanders, and rowdies, whom he denounced as only good for the gallows; but I thought he looked a good deal like a highlander himself.|$|E
6000|$|He put {{his hands}} ostentatiously in his pockets, when some others meaninglessly shook hands with Northwick, at parting, as Northwick himself might have shaken hands with another in his place; and he brushed by {{him out of the}} door without looking at him. He came {{suddenly}} back to say, [...] "If it were a question of you alone, I would cheerfully lose something more than you've robbed me of for the pleasure of seeing you handcuffed in this room and led to jail through the street by a constable. No honest man, no man who was not always a rogue at heart, could have done what you've done; juggled with the books for years, and bewitched the record so by your infernal craft, that it was never suspected till now. You've given mind to your scoundrelly work, sir; all the mind you had; for if you hadn't been so anxious to steal successfully, you'd have given more mind to the use of your stealings. You may have some of them left, but it looks as if you'd made ducks and drakes of them, like any petty rascal {{in the hands of the}} Employees' Insurance Company. Yes, sir, I believe you're of about the intellectual calibre of that sort of thief. I can't respect you even on your own ground. But I'm willing to give you the chance you ask, for your daughter's sake. She's been in and out of my house with my girl like one of my own children, and I won't send her father to jail if I can help it. Understand! I haven't any sentiment for you, Northwick. You're the kind of rogue I'd like to see in a convict's jacket, learning to make <b>shoe-brushes.</b> But you shall have your chance to go home and see if you can pay up somehow, and you sha'n't be shadowed while you're at it. You shall keep your outside to the world three days longer, you whited sepulchre; but if you want to know, I think the best thing that could happen to you on your way home would be a good railroad accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|Salem.--. [...] . Here I am, {{in my old}} chamber, where I {{produced}} those stupendous {{works of}} fiction which have since impressed the universe with wonderment and awe! To this chamber, doubtless, in all succeeding ages, pilgrims will come to pay their tribute of reverence;--they will put off their shoes at the threshold for fear of desecrating the tattered old carpets! [...] "There," [...] they will exclaim, [...] "is the very bed in which he slumbered, and where he was visited by those ethereal visions which he afterwards fixed forever in glowing words! There is the wash-stand at which this exalted personage cleansed himself from the stains of earth, and rendered his outward man a fitting exponent of the pure soul within. There, in its mahogany frame, is the dressing-glass, which often reflected that noble brow, those hyacinthine locks, that mouth bright with smiles or tremulous with feeling, that flashing or melting eye, that--in short, every item of the magnanimous face of this unexampled man. There is the pine table,--there the old flag-bottomed chair on which he sat, and at which he scribbled, during his agonies of inspiration! There is the old chest of drawers in which he kept what shirts a poor author may be supposed to have possessed! There is the closet in which was reposited his threadbare suit of black! There is the worn-out <b>shoe-brush</b> with which this polished writer polished his boots. There is--" [...] but I believe, this will be pretty much all, so here I close the catalogue. [...] .|$|E
