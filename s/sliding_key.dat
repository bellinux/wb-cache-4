Examples of an atomic vacancy and a step are analyzed. The anomaly is the result of non-trivial force interaction near defects.

40|$|Asymmetrical bending waves can be {{obtained}} by reactivating demembranated sea urchin spermatozoa at high Ca " concentrations. Moving-film flash photography shows that asymmetrical flagellar bending waves are associated with premature termination of the growth of the bends in one direction (the reverse bends) while the bends in the opposite direction (the principal bends) grow for. one full beat cycle, and with unequal rates of growth of principal and reverse bends. The relative proportions of these two components of asymmetry are highly variable. The increased angle in the principal bend is compensated by a decreased angle in the reverse bend, so that there is no change in mean bend angle; the wavelength and beat frequency are also independent of the degree of asymmetry. This new information is still insufficient to identify a particular mechanism for Ca 21 -induced asymmetry. When a developing bend stops growing before initiation of growth of a new bend in the same direction, a modification of the sliding between tubules in the distal portion of the flagellum is required. This modification can be described as a superposition of synchronous sliding on the metachronous sliding associated with propagating bending waves. Synchronous sliding is particularly evident in highly asymmetrical flagella, but is probably not the cause of asymmetry. The control of metachronous sliding appears to be unaffected by the superposition of synchronous <b>sliding.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS calcium " flagella-microtubules- motility " spermatozoa A variety of situations has been found in which the movements of cilia and flagella can be modi-fied, in vitro and presumably in vivo, by free Ca 21 ion concentrations in the range of 10 ' to 10 - 5 M. In the case of sea urchin spermatozoa, reactivated demembranated spermatozoa swim in circular paths of decreasing radius as the Ca 21 concentra-tion is increased (12) and the flagellar beat pattern becomes highly asymmetrical.

40|$|Abstract: Internal {{rotation}} contracture is {{the most}} common shoulder deformity in patients with brachial plexus birth injury. The purpose of this investigation is to describe the indications, technique, and results of the subscapularis slide procedure. The technique involves the release of the subscapularis muscle origin off the scapula, with pres-ervation of anterior shoulder structures. A standard postoperative protocol is used in all patients and includes a modified shoulder spica with the shoulder held in 60 degrees of external rotation and 30 degrees of abduction, aggressive occupational and physical therapy, and sub-sequent shoulder manipulation under anesthesia with botulinum toxin injections as needed. Seventy-one patients at 2 institutions treated with subscapularis slide between 1997 and 2010, with minimum follow-up of 39. 2 months, were identified. Patients were divided into 5 groups based on the index procedure performed: subscapularis slide alone (group 1); subscapularis slide with a simultaneous microsurgical reconstruction (group 2); primary microsurgical brachial plexus reconstruction followed later by a subscapularis slide (group 3); pri-mary microsurgical brachial plexus reconstruction followed later by a subscapularis slide combined with tendon transfers for shoulder external rotation (group 4); and subscapularis slide with simultaneous tendon transfers, with no prior brachial plexus surgery (group 5). Full passive external rotation equivalent to the contralateral side was ach-ieved in the operating room in all cases. No cases resulted in anterior instability or internal rotation deficit. Internal rotation contracture of the shoulder after brachial plexus birth injury can be effectively managed with the technique of subscapularis <b>slide.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: brachial plexus, shoulder contracture, subscapularis slid...|$|R

Some common results from music analytical practice can be accounted for with the model. The <b>sliding</b> window <b>key</b> induction gives evidence of cases in which key is established or modulation is recognised even though neither dominant nor leading tone was involved.

As it turns out, certain constructions for hash-function-based MACs can be vulnerable to forgery and even to key recovery attacks. In other cases, we can at least distinguish a given hash function from a random oracle. To illustrate our results, we describe attacks against the Grindahl- 256 and Grindahl- 512 hash functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cryptanalytic result on Grindahl- 512. Furthermore, we point out a slide-based distinguisher attack on a slightly modified version of RadioGatún.
