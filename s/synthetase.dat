5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine <b>synthetase</b> condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione <b>synthetase</b> to form glutathione.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> {{are central}} enzymes in protein translation, {{providing}} the charged tRNAs needed for appropriate construction of peptide chains. These enzymes {{have long been}} pursued as drug targets in bacteria and fungi, but {{the past decade has}} seen considerable research on aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> in eukaryotic parasites. Existing inhibitors of bacterial tRNA <b>synthetases</b> have been adapted for parasite use, novel inhibitors have been developed against parasite enzymes, and tRNA <b>synthetases</b> have been identified as the targets for compounds in use or development as antiparasitic drugs. Crystal structures have now been solved for many parasite tRNA <b>synthetases,</b> and opportunities for selective inhibition are becoming apparent. For different biological reasons, tRNA <b>synthetases</b> appear to be promising drug targets against parasites as diverse as Plasmodium (causative agent of malaria), Brugia (causative agent of lymphatic filariasis), and Trypanosoma (causative agents of Chagas disease and human African trypanosomiasis).

The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate <b>synthetase</b> superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA <b>synthetase.</b> This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA <b>synthetase.</b> This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
50|$|Both tyrosyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> and tryptophanyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> {{belong to}} Class I of the aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases,</b> both are dimers {{and both have}} a class II mode of tRNA recognition, i.e. they {{interact}} with their cognate tRNAs from the variable loop and major groove side of the acceptor stem.

In this study we characterized the division/cell wall (dcw) operon and identified a promoter driving the co-transcription of mur <b>synthetases</b> along with key cell division genes such as ftsQ and ftsW. Furthermore, we have extended our previous investigations of MurE to MurC, MurD and MurF <b>synthetases</b> from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Functional analyses of the pure recombinant enzymes revealed that the presence of divalent cations is an absolute requirement for their activities. We also observed that higher concentrations of ATP and UDP-sugar substrates were inhibitory for the activities of all Mur <b>synthetases</b> suggesting stringent control of the cytoplasmic steps of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway. In line with the previous findings on the regulation of mycobacterial MurD and corynebacterial MurC <b>synthetases</b> via phosphorylation, we found that all of the Mur <b>synthetases</b> interacted with the Ser/Thr protein kinases, PknA and PknB. In addition, we critically analyzed the interaction network of all of the Mur <b>synthetases</b> with proteins involved in cell division and cell wall PG biosynthesis to re-evaluate the importance of these key enzymes as nove...|$|R
40|$|Aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> (amino acid-tRNA ligases, EC 6. 1. 1. -) {{catalyze}} the aminoacylation {{of specific}} amino acids onto their cognate tRNAs with extraordinary accuracy. Recent reports, however, {{indicate that this}} class of enzymes may play other roles in cellular metabolism. Several aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> are herein shown to catalyze the AMP [...] ADP and ADP [...] ATP exchange reactions (in the absence of tRNAs) by utilizing a transfer of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to reactive AMP and ADP intermediates that are probably the mixed anhydrides of the nucleotide and the corresponding amino acid. AMP and ADP produce active intermediates with amino acids by entering the back-reaction of amino acid activation, reacting with labile covalent amino acid-enzyme intermediates. Gramicidin <b>synthetases</b> 1 and 2, which are known to activate certain amino acids through the formation of intermediate thiol-esters of the amino acids and the enzymes, catalyze {{the same set of}} reactions with similar characteristics. Several lines of evidence suggest that these activities are an inherent part of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> and gramicidin <b>synthetases</b> and are not due to impurities of adenylate kinase, NDP kinase, or low levels of tRNAs bound to the enzymes. The covalent amino acid-enzyme adducts are likely intermediates in the aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs. The use of gramicidin <b>synthetases</b> has thus helped to illuminate mechanistic details of amino acid activation catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases...</b>|$|R

Holocarboxylase <b>synthetase</b> deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rash, feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma.|$|E

These observations, together with the finding that an aplastidic mutant (strain W 3 BUL, which has neither significant plastid structure nor detectable chloroplast DNA) contains low levels of the chloroplastic <b>synthetases,</b> indicate that the chloroplastic <b>synthetases</b> are transcriptional products of nuclear genes and are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes prior to compartmentalization within the chloroplasts...|$|R
40|$|Aminoacylation of {{transfer}} RNAs establishes {{the rules of}} the genetic code. The reactions are catalyzed by an ancient group of 20 enzymes (one for each amino acid) known as aminoacyl tRNA <b>synthetases</b> (AARSs). Surprisingly, the etiology of specific diseases—including cancer, neuronal pathologies, autoimmune disorders, and disrupted metabolic conditions—is connected to specific aminoacyl tRNA <b>synthetases.</b> These connections include heritable mutations in the genes for tRNA <b>synthetases</b> that are causally linked to disease, with both dominant and recessive disease-causing mutations being annotated. Because some disease-causing mutations do not affect aminoacylation activity or apparent enzyme stability, the mutations are believed to affect functions that are distinct from aminoacylation. Examples include enzymes that are secreted as procytokines that, after activation, operate in pathways connected to the immune system or angiogenesis. In addition, within cells, <b>synthetases</b> form multiprotein complexes with each other or with other regulatory factors and in that way control diverse signaling pathways.

40|$|All {{living cells}} must conduct protein {{synthesis}} {{with a high}} degree of accuracy maintained in the transmission and flow of information from gene to finished protein product. One crucial "quality control" point in maintaining a high level of accuracy is the selectivity by which aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> furnish correctly activated amino acids, attached to tRNA species, as the building blocks for growing protein chains. During selection of amino acids, <b>synthetases</b> very often have to distinguish the cognate substrate from a homolog having just one fewer methyl group in its structure. The binding energy of a methyl group is estimated to contribute only a factor of 100 to the specificity of binding, yet <b>synthetases</b> distinguish such closely related amino acids with a discrimination factor of 10, 000 to 100, 000. Examples of this include methionine versus homocysteine, isoleucine versus valine, alanine versus glycine, and threonine versus serine. Many investigators have demonstrated in vitro the ability of certain aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> to edit, that is, correct or prevent incorrect attachment of amino acids to tRNA molecules. Several major editing pathways are now established from in vitro data. Further, at least some aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases</b> have recently been shown to carry out the editing function in vivo. Editing has been demonstrated to occur in both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Significant energy is expended by the cell for editing of misactivated amino acids, which can be reflected in the growth rate. Because of this, cellular levels of aminoacyl-tRNA <b>synthetases,</b> as well as amino acid biosynthetic pathways which yield competing substrates for protein synthesis, must be carefully regulated to prevent excessive editing. High-level expression of recombinant proteins imposes a strain on the biosynthetic capacity of the cell which frequently results in misincorporation of abnormal or wrong amino acids owing in part to limited editing by <b>synthetases.</b> Unbalanced amino acid pools associated with some genetic disorders in humans may also lead to errors in tRNA aminoacylation.
