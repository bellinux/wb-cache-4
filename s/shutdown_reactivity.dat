40|$|A thorium-fueled {{water-cooled}} {{reactor core}} design approach {{that features a}} radially uniform composition of fuel rods in stationary fuel assembly and is fuel-self-sustaining is described. This core design concept {{is similar to the}} Reduced moderation Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR) proposed by Hitachi to fit within an ABWR pressure vessel, with the following exceptions: use of thorium instead of depleted uranium for the fertile fuel; elimination of the internal blanket; and elimination of absorbers from the axial reflectors, while increasing the length of the fissile zone. The preliminary analysis indicates that it is feasible to design such cores to be fuel-self-sustaining and to have a comfortably low peak linear heat generation rate when operating at the nominal ABWR power level of nearly 4000 MW[superscript th]. However, the void reactivity feedback tends to be too negative, making it difficult to have sufficient <b>shutdown</b> <b>reactivity</b> margin at cold zero power condition. An addition of a small amount of plutonium from LWR used nuclear fuel was found effective in reducing the magnitude of the negative void reactivity effect and enables attaining adequate <b>shutdown</b> <b>reactivity</b> margin; it also flattens the axial power distribution. The resulting design concept offers an efficient incineration of the LWR generated plutonium in addition to effective utilization of thorium. Additional R&D is required in order to arrive at a reliable practical and safe design. Berkeley Nuclear Research CenterUnited States. Dept. of Energy (Nuclear Energy University Programs...|$|E

A unique feature of PIUS {{is the absence of}} mechanical control and <b>shutdown</b> rods. <b>Reactivity</b> is controlled by coolant boron concentration and the temperature of the moderator coolant. Los Alamos supported the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s preapplication review of the PIUS reactor.

40|$|In this paper, {{three types}} of {{operational}} and industrial absorbers used at research reactors, including Ag-In-Cd alloy, B 4 C, and Hf are selected for sensitivity analyses. Their integral effects on the main neutronic core parameters important to safety issues are investigated. These parameters are core excess <b>reactivity,</b> <b>shutdown</b> margin, total <b>reactivity</b> worth of control rods, thermal neutron flux, power density distribution, and Power Peaking Factor (PPF). The IAEA 10 MW benchmark core is selected as the case study to verify calculations. A two-dimensional, three-group diffusion model is selected for core calculations. The well-known WIMS-D 4 and CITATION reactor codes are used to carry out these calculations. It is found that the largest shutdown margin is gained using the B 4 C; also the lowest PPF is gained using the Ag-In-Cd alloy. The maximum point power densities belong to the inside fuel regions surrounding the central flux trap (irradiation position), surrounded by control fuel elements, and the peripheral fuel elements beside the graphite reflectors. The greatest and least fluctuation of the point power densities are gained by using B 4 C and Ag-In-Cd alloy, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Preliminary nuclear {{design studies}} have been {{completed}} on ten configurations of nuclear reactors for low power (1 - 30 kWe) space applications utilizing thermionic energy conversion. Additional design {{studies have been}} conducted on the TRICE multimegawatt in-core thermionic reactor configuration. In each of the cases, a reactor configuration has been determined which has the potential for operating 7 years with sufficient reactivity margin. Additional safety evaluations have been conducted on these configurations including the determination of sufficient <b>shutdown</b> <b>reactivity,</b> and consideration of water immersion, water flooding, sand burial, and reactor compaction accident scenarios. It has been found, within the analysis conducted using the MCNP Monte Carlo neutron transport code, that there are configurations which are feasible and deserve further analysis. It has also been found that solid core reactors which rely solely on conduction for heat removal as well as pin type cores immersed in a liquid metal bath have merit. The solid cores look attractive when flooding and compaction accident scenarios are considered as there is little chance for water to enter the core and cause significant neutron moderation. A fuel volume fraction effect has also been found in the consideration of the sand burial cases for the SP- 100 derived configurations...|$|E
40|$|Flexblue® is a 160 [*]MWe, {{transportable}} and subsea-based {{nuclear power}} unit, operating up to 100 [*]m depth, several kilometers {{away from the}} shore. If being underwater has significant safety advantages, especially using passive safety systems, it leads to two main challenges for core design. The first one is to control reactivity in operation without soluble boron because of its prohibitive drawbacks for a submerged reactor (system size, maintenance, effluents, and safety considerations). The second one is to achieve a long cycle in order to maximise {{the availability of the}} reactor, because Flexblue® refuelling and maintenance will be performed in a shared support facility away from the production site. In this paper, these two topics are dealt with, from a neutronic point of view. Firstly, an overview of the main challenges of operating without soluble boron is proposed (cold <b>shutdown,</b> <b>reactivity</b> swing during cycle, load following, xenon stability). Secondly, an economic optimisation of the Flexblue® core size and cycle length is performed, using the QUABOX/CUBBOX code. Thirdly, the fuel enrichment and poisoning using gadolinium oxide are optimized for full core or half core refuelling, with the DRAGON code. For the specific case of the full core refuelling, an innovative heterogeneous configuration of gadolinium is used. This specific configuration is computed using a properly adapted state-of-the-art calculation scheme within the above-mentioned lattice code. The results in this specific configuration allow a reactivity curve very close to the core leakage one during the whole cycle...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the neutronics analysis performed during 1991 and 1992 {{in support of}} characterization of the conceptual design of the Advanced Neutron Source (ANS). The methods used in the analysis, parametric studies, and key results supporting the design and safety evaluations of the conceptual design are presented. The analysis approach used during the conceptual design phase followed the same approach used in early ANS evaluations: (1) a strong reliance on Monte Carlo theory for beginning-of-cycle reactor performance calculations and (2) a reliance on few-group diffusion theory for reactor fuel cycle analysis and for evaluation of reactor performance at specific time steps over the fuel cycle. The Monte Carlo analysis was carried out using the MCNP continuous-energy code, and the few- group diffusion theory calculations were performed using the VENTURE and PDQ code systems. The MCNP code was used primarily for its capability to model the reflector components in realistic geometries {{as well as the}} inherent circumvention of cross-section processing requirements and use of energy-collapsed cross sections. The MCNP code was used for evaluations of reflector component reactivity effects and of heat loads in these components. The code was also used as a benchmark comparison against the diffusion-theory estimates of key reactor parameters such as region fluxes, control rod worths, reactivity coefficients, and material worths. The VENTURE and PDQ codes were used to provide independent evaluations of burnup effects, power distributions, and small perturbation worths. The performance and safety calculations performed over the subject time period are summarized, and key results are provided. The key results include flux and power distributions over the fuel cycle, silicon production rates, fuel burnup rates, component reactivities, control rod worths, component heat loads, <b>shutdown</b> <b>reactivity</b> margins, reactivity coefficients, and isotope production rates...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} hybrid loop-pool {{design for}} the sodium cooled fast reactor (SFR) has been recently proposed with the primary objective of achieving cost reduction and safety enhancement. With the hybrid loop-pool design, closed primary loops are immersed in a secondary buffer tank.

This paper will briefly introduce the hybrid loop-pool design concept and present the calculated thermal responses for unproctected (without reactor scram) loss of forced circulation (ULOF) transients using RELAP 5 - 3 D.

40|$|Abstract- We {{examine the}} use of {{reactivity}} feedbacks {{as a means for}} passive safety in accelerator-driven systems (ADS). In particular, we evaluate the potential for inherent <b>shutdown</b> by Doppler <b>reactivity</b> feedback in a subcritical core dedicated for transmutation of waste. Given the dynamic characteristics of a source-driven system, it is necessary to manage the external neutron source in order to achieve passive shutdown capability. Conceptual designs of self-actuated shutdown devices are suggested. Operating characteristics is obtained by studying the performance of a reference ADS subject to a set of typical accident initiators. It is shown that maximum beam output must be limited in order to protect against accident initiators that appear to be achievable in ADS. Utilizing an appropriate burnup control strategy {{plays a key role in}} that effort...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A neutronic evaluation of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (TAMU NSCR) using the General Atomic Company (GA) low enrichment uranium (LEU 30 - 20 fuel was performed to determine the feasibility of this type of fuel. To perform this evaluation, the WIMSD 4 m transport code and DIF 3 D diffusion code were utilized. These codes were provided by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). WIMSD 4 m was used to calculate macroscopic cross-sections for the various core materials and DIF 3 D was used to calculate the effective multiplication factor and thermal neutron flux for various core configurations. In order to benchmark these codes and the core model used to evaluate the proposed LEU 30 - 20 core, the current FLIP core was first modeled. Various neutronic parameters, such as excess <b>reactivity,</b> <b>shutdown</b> margin, critical rod height and control rod worths were calculated using the core model and codes, and the results compared with actual experimental results for the FLIP core. Once the core model and codes were validated, the core model was modified using LEU 30 - 20 fuel and an optimum core configuration obtained which satisfied certain design criteria, including values for excess <b>reactivity,</b> <b>shutdown</b> margin and thermal neutron flux. In addition to modeling the LEU 30 - 20 core, a control rod model was developed to generate effective macroscopic cross-sections for the control rod materials in the core, based on previous work in this area performed at ANL. The results of this analysis indicate the feasibility of converting the TAMU NSCR to GA LEU 30 - 20 fuel...|$|R
