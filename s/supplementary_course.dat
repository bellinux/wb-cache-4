There are things {{which can only be}} learnt in the crowded haunts and cities of men--in London, Paris, New York, Vienna. There are things which can only be learnt in the centres of culture or of artistic handicraft--in Oxford, Munich, Florence, Venice, Rome. There is only one Grand Canal and only one Pitti Palace. We must have Shakespeare, Homer, Catullus, Dante; we must have Phidias, Fra Angelico, Rafael, Mendelssohn; we must have Aristotle, Newton, Laplace, Spencer. But after all these, and before all these, there is something more left to learn. Having first read them, we must read ourselves out of them. We must forget all this formal modern life; we must break away from this cramped, cold, northern world; we must find ourselves face to face at last, in Pacific isles or African forests, with the underlying truths of simple naked nature. For that, in its perfection, we must go to the Tropics; and there, we shall learn and unlearn much, coming back, no doubt, with shattered faiths and broken gods, and strangely disconcerted European prejudices, but looking out upon life with a new outlook, an outlook undimmed by ten thousand preconceptions which hem in the vision and obstruct the view of the mere temperately educated.|$|E

This makes the supplementary courses remain nearly uninvestigated. This article focuses on the supplementary courses of Tokyo Prefectural Middle Schools that received high assessment among the educational joumalism. In the revision of Tokyo Prefectural Middle School Regulations of 1902, there was an argument over positioning of supplementary courses. Supplementary courses were evaluated as examination preparatory organizations in the argument definitely and the character didn't change after wards in Tokyo prefecture. The supplementary courses of Tokyo Prefectural Middle Schools gathered around 150 students from their establishment. They served lectures for three months, but movement of extension was already seen in the Meiji era, and a study period became 1 year in the former half of the Taisho era. In 1920 s when high school entrance examinations were held in March, the supplementary courses developed especially in Tokyo Prefectural First Middle School and Tokyo Prefectural Fourth Middle School, In Tokyo Prefectural First Middle School several hundred applicants gathered and they were screened for the entry to the <b>supplementary</b> <b>course.</b> But in 1930 s the prefectural authorities moved for the abolition of supplementary courses by not allocating a budget from 1930 and the supplementary courses disappeared from Tokyo Prefectural Middle School Regulations in 1935.

40|$|While curricular {{assessments}} {{can give}} insight {{as to the}} extent sustainability is integrated into higher education study programs, issues remain regarding how assessments are conducted. Previous research has identified and compared various sustainability assessment tools for higher education, {{but there is a}} gap in literature studying issues arising from measurement. This paper highlights the need for discussions on this topic by exploring validity issues arising from a case study and discusses the potential of utilizing a <b>supplementary</b> <b>course</b> file during curricular assessments. To achieve this objective, a KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business program has been assessed using two different approaches, namely 1) a scan of a European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) file and 2) an instructor self-assessment via a <b>supplementary</b> <b>course</b> file. Based on this research, these two approaches to curricular assessment yield substantially different results, which gives rise to the need to further consider the validity of such assessments. While utilizing an instructor self-assessment (e. g., a <b>supplementary</b> <b>course</b> file) during assessments can help overcome some potential shortcomings and biases of ECTS file scans, both approaches are flawed in assessing true sustainability integration into a program. The varying conceptualizations of sustainability and the lack of uniformly adopted assessment approaches has the potential to create validity issues with the assessment of sustainability in higher education. Acknowledging sustainable development as a contested concept, and developing a faculty-specific conceptualization, can help in approaching assessments in a meaningful way. status: accepte...|$|E
