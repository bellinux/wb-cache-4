40|$|The {{project of}} {{building}} a cognitive framework to formalise an archaeological language, proposed here, is oriented, not to computerise any archaeological language, but to offer a tool giving a framework mainly for the formalisation and the validation of an archaeological reasoning, {{as well as to}} deliver a readable procedure, which completes the conventional natural language of the archaeological publishing. The cognitive framework is based on a decomposition of the methodological iterative procedure into three levels: 1. Acquisition, 2. Structuring, 3. Modelling, in which a cognitive grammar is defined. A cognitive grammar normally defines statements and predicates. The statements have been classified, among the more frequent archaeological statement types, which are generally, for both real and virtual objects, the results of a correlation of intrinsic and extrinsic archaeological information. The predicates are also classified following the nature of decisions they imply, either general to Human sciences, or specific to Archaeology: – identification/differentiations (generalisation of a statement at a n+ 1 rank), – stabilisation/destabilisations (delimiting the validity value of a statement), – exploration/renunciation (reduction of the potential ways), – paradigmatisation (hypothetical introduction of a rule at an upper level), – appropriations/disappropriations (explicit projection of the archaeologist point of view in the reasoning). The cognitive grammar is used at each of the three levels of the previously defined methodological framework. The formalisation of such a cognitive framework is materialised by a set of <b>statement</b> <b>objects</b> and predicate objects, at each three different levels. Each object may be defined as trivial (needing no more formalisation) or may be linked to another similar cognitive structure, at the origins of the decomposition of the construct into a general system of nested cognitive objects. The archaeological construct, for the scientific publishing, may be materialised by a conventional natural language, to which nested formal constructs are annexed, enabling the reader to more easily validate the logic of the reasoning. The paper is illustrated by examples of applications...|$|E

In the Sikaiana grammar system, sentences that start with a noun usually do not lead with a preposition, but for noun phrases that follow a verb phrase, {{it may or may not}} lead with a preposition (Donner, 2012). As for nouns and noun phrases, there must always be a preceding article except if it is a noun of place, names, or free pronouns. The articles that usually precede a noun is either te or n The use of these articles makes nouns easily distinguishable from other parts of speech (Donner, 2012).|$|R

40|$|Gergen has {{highlighted}} three {{critiques of}} representationalism. The representationalist position, which underpins the empirical approach taken in mainstream psychology {{and much of}} first order family therapy, assumes that statements bear a map-like correspondence to the objects they describe. The ideological critique of representationalism argues that <b>statements</b> about <b>objects</b> do not correspond to the objects because accurate perception and reporting of perception is distorted by ideology. The literary-rhetorical critique of representationalism points out that <b>statements</b> about perceived <b>objects</b> do not correspond to those <b>objects</b> because all <b>statements</b> are determined more by language and than by the objects being described. In the social critique of representationalism, {{it is argued that}} <b>statements</b> about <b>objects</b> do not correspond to those objects because they are determined more by the social context within which the statements are made than by the perceived objects. Modern psychology and much of first order family therapy and traditional mental health practices which is based on representationalism must change its focuses and in future continue empirical work but within a pragmatic frame of reference; subject modernist scientific narratives to cultural and historical analysis; explore the ethical implications of choosing particular lines of inquiry and scientific frames of reference; and analyze issues such as identity or emotions within a social-constructionist rather than an individualistic framework...|$|R
