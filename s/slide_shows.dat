25|$|The group's {{earliest}} educational {{efforts were}} {{a series of}} <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> of hardcore and softcore pornography, which were shown with critical commentary by a WAP presenter. The format of a slide show with critical commentary had been used earlier by Julia London of the Los Angeles group Women Against Violence Against Women to illustrate soft-core pornographic themes in rock album covers; WAP adapted the format to discuss pornography in general, including hardcore pornography. <b>Slide</b> <b>shows</b> were generally organized by local feminist groups, and held in women's homes as part of consciousness-raising meetings. The anti-pornography movement has continued to use <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> as an educational tactic for feminist group meetings and public events.|$|E

This makes animations more flexible and interactive, similar to Adobe Flash.|$|R

25|$|When a For Sale sign {{appeared}} on a property including his favorite landscape, Walker became an activist. After {{trying to get the}} attention of local officials, Walker took matters into his own hands. He began leading hikes into the area, presenting <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> of the landscape, and having participants write postcards to government leaders asking for their support. He also brought his photos and slides to the Park District headquarters, interesting the staff and allying himself with local officials who would later hire him for a variety of projects. Eventually, the area was preserved as the first addition to Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in more than a decade.|$|E
25|$|The Esselen Lodge of the Order of the Arrow {{was named}} for the native Esselen American Indian tribe who first {{inhabited}} the area. The lodge was organized in the council on November 23, 1957 by George Ross, Ray Sutliff—who designed the lodge patch—and a third man whose last name was Alcorn. George Ross {{was also the first}} Lodge Adviser and first adult Vigil recipient in Esselen Lodge. In 1972-73, Lodge Chief Tom Quarterero built a sign for the camp at the mouth of Palo Colorado Road on Highway 1. The Lodge has supported camping in the council by writing and publishing the Where to go Camping booklet for many years. It has also produced <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> promoting the camp. Lodge members and leaders have repeatedly served on camp staff for many years.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Prokudin-Gorsky married Anna Aleksandrovna Lavrova, {{and later}} the couple had two sons, Mikhail and Dmitri, and a {{daughter}}, Ekaterina. Anna {{was the daughter of}} the Russian industrialist Aleksandr Stepanovich Lavrov, an active member in the Imperial Russian Technical Society (IRTS). Prokudin-Gorsky subsequently became the director of the executive board of Lavrov's metal works near Saint Petersburg and remained so until the October Revolution. He also joined Russia's oldest photographic society, the photography section of the IRTS, presenting papers and lecturing on the science of photography. In 1901, he established a photography studio and laboratory in Saint Petersburg. In 1902, he traveled to Berlin and spent six weeks studying color sensitization and three-color photography with photochemistry professor Adolf Miethe, the most advanced practitioner in Germany at that time. Throughout the years, Prokudin-Gorsky's photographic work, publications and <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> to other scientists and photographers in Russia, Germany and France earned him praise, and in 1906 he was elected the president of the IRTS photography section and editor of Russia's main photography journal, the Fotograf-Liubitel.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, the Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Martin Luther King Peace Committee {{produced}} {{resources to}} enable schools and churches {{to mark the}} December 1914 Christmas Truces. These included lesson plans, hand-outs, worksheets, PowerPoint <b>slide</b> <b>shows,</b> and full plans for assemblies, and carol services/Christmas productions. The authors explained that their purpose was both to enable schoolteachers to help children learn about the remarkable events of December 1914, but also to use the theme of Christmas to provide a counterpoint to the UK government's glorification of the First World War as heroic. As the Peace Committee argues, [...] "These spontaneous acts of festive goodwill directly contradicted orders from high command, and offered an evocative and hopeful – albeit brief – recognition of shared humanity" [...] – and thereby, they argue, give a rereading of the traditional Christmas message of [...] "on earth peace, good will toward men." ...|$|E
2500|$|The enthusiasm {{generated}} by the NEH lectures led Gutman to co-found the American Social History Project at CUNY Graduate Center. The project, funded by NEH and the Ford Foundation, began collecting original documents, oral histories, biographies and other historical documentation relating {{to the history of}} labor and workers in the U.S. [...] It produced a film, a series of <b>slide</b> <b>shows,</b> and a two-volume history of working people in the United States entitled Who Built America? ...|$|E

2500|$|Leading {{proponents of}} the 1960s Psychedelic Art {{movement}} were San Francisco poster artists such as: Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse & Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. The [...] "Fillmore Posters" [...] {{were among the most}} notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely [...] "trippy" [...] atmosphere for the audience.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the time}} that Akers was alive, till 1966, money was {{allocated}} to paint and display the engine. In 1969, a group of MSU students formed the Michigan State University Railroad Club as a railfan group. Steve Reeves, a student and part-time employee of the Museum, whose responsibility was to display the engine on football weekends, sent out a notice in the State News that the Railroad Club would be meeting. [...] Those early meetings did not discuss {{the restoration of the}} engine. [...] Instead, they were <b>slide</b> <b>shows</b> of engines various members had seen on trips across the US, most of which were diesels. In 1970, at the suggestion of Randy Paquette, the club investigated the possibility of restoring the locomotive to running condition and started on that goal in 1971, with Baker's permission. Baker later stated that he thought having students be occupied with restoring a locomotive was far more in keeping with his idea of the image the university should be presenting than campus protests. [...] Dr. Breslin, the university vice president, was not so sure. [...] After the club started removing the sheet metal and exposing a rusty boiler, Breslin sent Baker to the engine with two messages. The first was the instruction to paint the engine. (The university needs to look good, even when it is being worked on). The second message was the day the students stop working on the engine is the day the torches come out. [...] The locomotive was safe as long as the students kept working on it. To emphasize, he had the hopper car next to the engine cut up the next week.|$|E
