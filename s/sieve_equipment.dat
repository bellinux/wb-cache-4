40|$|The paper {{describes}} a fibrous mineral detection methodology, {{which is based}} on the use of alternating rotary motion <b>sieving</b> <b>equipment.</b> The equipment was redesigned to meet additional requirements with respect to initial ones. Under this methodology, the fine fraction passing through the sieves was recovered and analysed to determine the sedimentology, mineralogy and morphology of the potentially particulating fraction. Reliance was made on the following analytical techniques: laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) and polarised and phase contrast light microscopy (PLM, PCLM) for fibrous mineral identification and Walton-Beckett / whole field fibre counting. The samples for the analyses came from known areas with fibrous minerals, e. g. Lauria (Basilicata), and less known areas, e. g. the Natural Reserve of Mt. Rufeno (Latium) and Biancavilla (Sicily). With this methodology, fibres may be directly detected in both farmed and unfarmed soil with fibrous minerals and the process may be repeated in the various stages of farming or during works for creation of fire barriers or lanes, hydrogeological restoration etc. The goal is to identify risks arising from the natural occurrence of asbestos upon atypical activities, such as farming and forestry. With regard to exposure, consideration was given to fibrous minerals not currently classified in the relevant legislation, thus going beyond the search for asbestiform minerals in quarry sites located in ophiolite outcrop areas...|$|R
40|$|Using sieving {{and sample}} ‘‘unknowns’’ for {{instructional}} grain-size {{analysis and interpretation}} of sands in undergraduate sedimentology courses has advantages over other techniques. Students (1) learn to calculate and use statistics; (2) visually observe differences in the grain-size fractions, thereby developing a sense of specific size ranges, weight percentages being plotted, and how grain composition and properties are a function of size; (3) are enthusiastic and observant as they search for clues {{of the origin of}} their sample, but discover that determining depositional environments using grain-size analysis is not the hoped for ‘‘fingerprinting’’ technique; and (4) enjoy learning the geographic origin and depositional environment of their sample. Plus, <b>sieving</b> <b>equipment</b> generally is less costly to acquire and maintain than ‘‘black box’’ techniques, and sieving is a commonly used procedure in industry. Using unknown sand samples results in some students making ‘‘incorrect’’ interpretations, which allows for illustrating that a scientist may have an excellent data set and a valid interpretation based on that data but, although the data are sound, the interpretation may be erroneous. Moreover, using a suite of unknowns allows students in a class to collectively be exposed to sands from a range of environments and geographic locales without the need for local sediment-rich environments. Building a set of unknowns is aided by recruiting students in introductory geology courses to collect and document samples during their school-break travels for future ‘‘unknowns,’’ thereby linking courses and creating interest among nonmajors. When these students venture into the field to collect a sample and characterize the environment, they are enticed into thinking about sedimentary processes and possible anthropogenic effects, such as beach nourishment, while on break...|$|R

Each sample was mixed thoroughly to achieve homogeneity and sieved using a USS # 10 <b>sieve.</b> All <b>equipment</b> used for homogenization was cleaned thoroughly {{to minimize the}} potential cross-contamination. For each digestion procedure, a sample was weighed to the nearest 0.01  g and a 0.1  g sample (dry weight) was transferred to a digestion vessel. Concentrated HNO 3 (10  ml) was added into it. The sample was heated to 95 [*]±[*] 5 °C and refluxed for 10 to 15  minutes without boiling. The sample was allowed to cool, and then 5  ml of Concentrated HNO 3 was added and refluxed for 30  minutes. If brown fumes were generated, indicating oxidation of the sample by HNO 3, this step was repeated (addition of 5  ml of conc. HNO 3) over and over until no brown fumes were given off by the sample indicating the complete reaction with HNO 3. The solution was allowed to evaporate to approximately 5  ml without boiling and heated at 95 [*]±[*] 5 °C for two hours. The sample was cooled to room temperature and 2  ml of water and 3  ml of 30 % H 2 O 2 were added. The vessel {{was covered with a}} watch glass (care was taken to ensure that losses did not occur due to excessively vigorous effervescence). The sample was heated until effervescence subsides and the vessel was cooled. The adding of 30 % H 2 O 2 in 1  ml aliquots with warming was continued until the effervescence was minimal. The reaction mixture was poured into a 100  ml volumetric flask and diluted to 100  ml. Each fertilizer was digested in duplicates. Spiked samples (10  μg/L) in duplicates were also digested to confirm the methodology. The same procedure repeated without the fertilizer was considered as the control.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproduction (verifying if there was reproductive activity and, if so, with what intensity) of the most abundant species of the fish community in Passa Cinco stream, {{in relation to the}} dry and wet season periods and to the longitudinal gradient, through the application of the reproductive intensity index (RII). The sample collection was carried out during one year with six samplings (May, July, September and November 2005, and January and March 2006) in five different points of Passa Cinco stream, contemplating sites of orders two to six. The following fishery equipment was used: a <b>sieve,</b> electric fishery <b>equipment,</b> gill nets and fish-traps. The values of the reproductive intensity index for the dry period were 2. 86 and for the wet season 3. 17, which indicates the wet season (November to March) as the period when most of the species reproduced. The values of the index for collection point were: 0. 78 for site 1, 3. 56 for site 2 and 2. 89 for site 3. Site 2, which presented the highest value, was the main reproduction place for most of the species. The adults' prevalence in the analysed species suggests, in an isolated way, that those species use the system as a reproduction area. However, when that information was crossed with the values of RII, when intermediate values were considered, it is possible to state that the system is used by the species as much as a reproduction area as a feeding area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{particle}} size distribution (PSD) changes during nixtamalized corn kernels (NCK) {{as a function of}} the steeping time (ST). The process to obtain powder or corn flour from NCK was as follows: (i) the NCK with different STs were wet-milled in a stone mill, (ii) dehydrated by a Flash type dryer, and (iii) pulverized with a hammer mill and sieved with a 20 mesh. The powder was characterized by measuring the PSD percentage, calcium percentage (CP), peak viscosity at 90 °C (PV), and crystallinity percentage (CP). The PSD of the powder as a function of ST was determined by <b>sieving</b> in Ro-TAP <b>equipment.</b> By <b>sieving,</b> five fractions of powder were obtained employing meshes 30, 40, 60, 80, and 100. The final weight of the PSD obtained from the sieving process follows a Gaussian profile with the maximum corresponding to the average particle obtained with mesh 60. The calcium percentage as a function of ST follows a behavior similar to the weight of the PSD. The study of crystallinity versus the mesh number shows that it decreases for smaller mesh number. A similar behavior is observed as steeping time increases, except around ST = 8 [*]h where the gelatinization of starch is observed. The trend of increasing viscosity values of the powder samples occurs when increasing ST and decreasing particle size. The ST significantly changes the crystallinity and viscosity values of the powder and, in both cases, a minimum value is observed in the region 7 – 9 [*]h. The experimental results show that the viscosity increases (decreases) if the particle size decreases (increases) ...|$|R
40|$|A one-year {{subcontract}} {{sponsored by}} the Carbon Materials Technology Group of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with the Department of Geological Sciences, University Of Tennessee, has been completed. A volumetric sorption system has been upgraded, in cooperation with commercial vendor, to allow the acquisition of data relevant to {{the program for the}} production of activated carbon molecular fiber <b>sieves</b> (ACFMS). The <b>equipment</b> and experimental techniques have been developed to determine the pore structure and porosity of reference materials and materials produced at ORNL as part of the development of methods for the activation of carbon fibers by various etching agents. Commercial activated coconut shell charcoal (ACSC) has been studied to verify instrument performance and to develop methodology for deducing cause and effects in the activation processes and to better understand the industrial processes (gas separation, natural gas storage, etc.). Operating personnel have been trained, standard operating procedures have been established, and quality assurance procedures have been developed and put in place. Carbon dioxide and methane sorption have been measured over a temperature range 0 to 200 C for both ACFMS and ACSC and similarities and differences related to the respective structures and mechanisms of interaction with the sorbed components. Nitrogen sorption (at 77 K) has been used to evaluate ''surface area'' and ''porosity'' for comparison with the large data base that exists for other activated carbons and related materials. The preliminary data base reveals that techniques and theories currently used to evaluate activated carbons may be somewhat erroneous and misleading. Alternate thermochemical and structural analyses have been developed that show promise in providing useful information related both to the activation process and to industrial applications of interest in the efficient and economical utilization of fossil fuels {{in a manner that is}} friendly to the earth's environment...|$|R
