50|$|Careful {{examination}} of the collateral cartilages by palpation can give a good indication that they are solid and bony rather than firm, springy cartilage. Usually, however, sidebone is found accidentally when the foot is radiographed, as sidebone has few outward signs in most cases. In mild cases, there are small areas of calcification; more advanced cases will have ossification of the entire cartilage. Rarely, severe lameness {{can be caused by}} fracture of an ossified cartilage, or by ossification which deviates enough to impinge on the <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The pastern {{is a part}} of the leg of a horse {{between the}} fetlock and the top of the hoof. It {{incorporates}} the long pastern bone (proximal phalanx) and the <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> (middle phalanx), which are held together by two sets of paired ligaments to form the pastern joint (proximal interphalangeal joint). Anatomically homologous to the two largest bones found in the human finger, the pastern was famously mis-defined by Samuel Johnson in his dictionary as [...] "the knee of a horse". When a lady asked Johnson how he came to do so, he gave the much-quoted reply: [...] "Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ringbone can be {{classified}} by its location, with [...] "high ringbone" [...] occurring on {{the lower part of}} the large <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> or the upper part of the small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> [...] "Low ringbone" [...] occurs on {{the lower part of the}} small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> or the upper part of the coffin bone. High ringbone is easier seen than low ringbone, as low ringbone occurs in the hoof of the horse. However, low ringbone may be seen if it becomes serious, as it creates a bony bump on the coronet of the horse.|$|R
5000|$|Distal sesamoidean ligaments: {{run from}} the sesamoid bones to the two <b>pastern</b> <b>bones.</b> Important in the stay apparatus.|$|R
5000|$|The coffin bone, {{also known}} as the pedal bone (U.S.), is the bottommost bone in the equine leg and is encased by the hoof capsule. Also known as the distal phalanx, third phalanx, or [...] "P3". The coffin bone meets the <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> or second phalanx at the coffin joint. [...] The coffin bone is {{connected}} to the inner wall of the horse hoof by a structure called the laminar layer. The insensitive laminae coming in from the hoof wall connects to the sensitive laminae layer, containing the blood supply and nerves, which is attached to the coffin bone. The lamina is a critical structure for hoof health, therefore any injury to the hoof or its support system can in turn affect the coffin bone.|$|E
50|$|The pastern joint is {{evaluated}} when a {{horse is}} studied conformationally, {{as it will}} affect the gait of the horse and the soundness of the joints above it. Traditionally, the ideal pastern joint of the front leg was a 45-degree angle. However, this angle has been revised to a slightly steeper angle of 47-55 degrees, as the traditional angle, although it makes for comfortable riding, greatly increases the chance of breakdown. Because there is less need for shock absorption in the hindleg, its pasterns are somewhat more upright {{than those of the}} front leg, to increase its strength (about 49-59 degrees). If the hind pasterns are the same angle as the front, or too sloping in general, then they are likely to break down during the horse's career, especially if the horse in employed in strenuous work. The length of the pastern joint is determined by the length of the first phalanx. The <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> is less a determinant because it is smaller, at 2 inches in length, and part of it is encased in the hoof.|$|E
5000|$|Rotation is {{the most}} common form of displacement, and, in this case, the tip of the coffin bone rotates downward. [...] The degree of {{rotation}} may be influenced by the severity of the initial attack and the time of initiation and aggressiveness of treatment. A combination of forces (e.g. the tension of the deep digital flexor tendon and the weight of the horse) result in the deep digital flexor tendon literally pulling the dorsal face of the coffin bone away from the inside of the hoof wall, which allows the coffin bone to rotate. Also, ligaments attaching the collateral cartilages to the digit, primarily in the palmar portion of the foot, possibly contribute to a difference in support from front to back. The body weight of the animal probably contributes to rotation of the coffin bone. Rotation results in an obvious misalignment between PII (the <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone)</b> and PIII (the coffin bone). If rotation of the third phalanx continues, its tip can eventually penetrate the sole of the foot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{suspensory}} apparatus, {{including the}} superficial and deep digital flexor tendons {{along with the}} proximal and distal check ligaments. [...] The distal sesamoidean ligaments run from the sesamoid bones to the two <b>pastern</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The carpus is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (<b>short</b> <b>pastern).</b> Below these <b>bones</b> are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa.|$|R
50|$|Osselets usually {{occur in}} the front legs of the horse, because there is more strain and {{concussion}} on the fetlock there than in the hind legs. The arthritis will occur at the joint between the cannon <b>bone</b> and large <b>pastern</b> <b>bone,</b> {{at the front of}} the fetlock.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the bones}} of the joint will become involved, causing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and periostitis (new bone growth). The fibers of the joint capsule will also {{increase}} in size. The long <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> may also eventually chip at its front edge, which will leave bone fragments in the joint.|$|R
5000|$|The second, {{probably}} derivative, form of {{the game}} was one of pure chance, the stones being thrown upon a table, either from the hand or from a cup, and {{the values of the}} sides upon which they fell were counted. The shape of the <b>pastern</b> <b>bones</b> used for astragaloi {{as well as for the}} tali of the Romans, with whom knucklebones was also popular, determined the manner of counting.The <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> of a sheep, goat, or calf has two rounded ends upon which it cannot stand and two broad and two narrow sides, one of each pair being concave and one convex. The convex narrow side, called chios or [...] "the dog", was counted as 1, the convex broad side as 3, the concave broad side as 4, and the concave narrow side as 6.|$|R
50|$|After his recovery, Mill Reef {{was trained}} for an autumn {{campaign}} {{and a return}} to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October. During a routine training gallop, however, he stumbled and shattered his foreleg. Charles Allen, a veterinary specialist, was flown in. Mill Reef's fracture was complicated. A triangularly shaped piece of bone {{about two and a half}} inches long was broken from the lower end of the cannon bone and was considerably displaced. The inner sesamoid bone was completely shattered, and the rim of the top of the main <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> was damaged. It seemed likely that the inner sesamoid bone was the first to break, with the result on the next step that the fetlock was not braced and the foot and the pastern were pointing outwards. The sheer pressure of the horse's weight caused the crumbling of the rim of the <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> and the breaking of the cannon bone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{horse is}} capable of rapid acceleration, but is {{restricted}} to a short stride. They excel in sprint sports. The short stride {{is a result of}} both a <b>short</b> <b>pastern</b> and upright shoulder, creating a short, choppy stride with minimal elasticity and limited speed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Short</b> <b>pasterns</b> {{have less}} shock-absorption, leading to more a jarring ride and amplified {{stress on the}} lower leg. The {{concussion}} is felt over the navicular apparatus, so the horse is more at risk for navicular disease, high or low ringbone, and sidebone. Also windpuffs and windgalls occur from chronic irritation within fetlock or flexor tendon sheath.|$|R

25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone.

50|$|Fetlock is {{the common}} name for the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints (MCPJ and MTPJ) of horses, large animals, and {{sometimes}} dogs.

50|$|The Equine Dynasplint {{systems are}} also being {{integrated}} into treatments for laxity and suspensory ligament injuries. Suspensory ligament injuries are common in athletic horses.

25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|R

50|$|<b>Short,</b> upright <b>pasterns</b> are {{beneficial}} {{in that they}} decrease the chance that the horse will suffer from soft-tissue injury. However, upright pasterns increase concussion by transmitting more of the shock of footfalls to the bones rather than the tendons. This not only makes the gaits uncomfortable due to the jarring, but also increases the chance of arthritis and may shorten the animal's career. A <b>short,</b> upright <b>pastern</b> also decreases the stride length of the gait, which again makes the gait more uncomfortable and decreases {{the efficiency of the}} horse's movement (since he must take more strides per meter than a longer-strided horse).|$|R

The triceps muscle straightens the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow to the bottom of the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|R
