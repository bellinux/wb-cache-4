2500|$|In 1787 Antoine Lavoisier {{suspected}} that silica {{might be an}} oxide of a fundamental chemical element, but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough {{that he had no}} means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name [...] "silicium" [...] for silicon, from the Latin silex, silicis for flint, and adding the [...] "-ium" [...] ending because he believed it to be a metal. Most other languages use transliterated forms of Davy's name, sometimes adapted to local phonology (e.g. German Silizium, French <b>silicium).</b> A few others use instead a calque of the Latin root (e.g. Russian кремний, from кремень [...] "flint"; Greek πυριτιο from πυρ [...] "fire"; Finnish pii from piikivi [...] "flint").|$|E
60|$|Exclusively, therefore, for the {{purposes}} of illustration, I would take as an instance of the first step, the metals, those, namely, that are capable of permanent reduction. For, by the established laws of nomenclature, the others (as sodium, potassium, calcium, <b>silicium,</b> &c.) would be entitled to a class of their own, under the name of bases. It is long since the chemists have despaired of decomposing this class of bodies. They still remain, one and all, as elements or simple bodies, though, on the principles of the corpuscularian philosophy, nothing can be more improbable than that they really are such; and no reason has or can be assigned on the grounds of that system, why, in no one instance, the contrary has not been proved. But this is at once explained, if we assume them as the simplest form of unity, namely, the unity of powers and properties. For these, it is evident, may be endlessly modified, but can never be decomposed. If I were asked by a philosopher who had previously extended the attribute of Life to the Byssus speciosa, and even to the crustaceous matter, or outward bones of a lobster, &c., whether the ingot of gold expressed life, I should answer without hesitation, as the ingot of gold assuredly not, for its form is accidental and ab extra. It may be added to or detracted from without in the least affecting the nature, state, or properties in the specific matter of which the ingot consists. But as gold, as that special union of absolute and of relative gravity, ductility, and hardness, which, wherever they are found, constitute gold, I should answer no less fearlessly, in the affirmative. But I should further add, that of the two counteracting tendencies of nature, namely, that of detachment from the universal life, which universality is represented to us by gravitation, and that of attachment or reduction into it, this and the other noble metals represented the units in which the latter tendency, namely, that of identity with the life of nature, subsisted in the greatest overbalance over the former. It is the form of unity with the least degree of tendency to individuation.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{reports on}} the {{transmission}} electron microscopy structure characterization of semiconducting thin films of higher manganese silicides (HMS or MnSi 1. 7) grown on (001) Si by different UHV deposition methods (the template method, reactive deposition and surfactant mediated reactive deposition). In this work electron diffraction technique was applied for the fist time to reveal the HMS phase growing in thin MnSi 1. 7 films. The obtained results suggest {{the presence of the}} shortest in c-axis length HMS phase, namely Mn 4 Si 7, within our experiments. It has been shown that growth of epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 grains can be achieved by the template technique. In particular, the influence of the template thickness on the silicide layer quality has been investigated. It has been found that deposition of a thin Mn layer of 0. 8 nm nominal thickness at room temperature prior to the Mn/Si codeposition at 550 °C causes the formation of a silicide template that leads to the preferred epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 growth with (110) [4 - 41]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si. Silicide crystallites of two additional orientation relations, (3 - 38) [- 443]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si and (001) [110] Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si, were present at the same template thickness to a lesser extent. Due to the crystal symmetry of Mn 4 Si 7 and Si the epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 growth on (001) Si leads to the formation of a number of Mn 4 Si 7 domains for each observed orientation. Additional experiments were carried out using the reactive deposition process. It has been shown that the deposition of Mn onto (001) Si at substrate temperatures higher then 600 °C leads to the formation of large silicide islands growing with the major part of their elongated grains parallel to Si. XRD investigations show the observed silicide grains to exhibit the following texture: (110) Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) Si. The found island morphology of Mn 4 Si 7 films can be modified by the deposition of about one monolayer of Sb (surfactant) onto (001) Si prior to the Mn-deposition. This process results in an increase of the silicide island density by about two orders of magnitude and decrease of the silicide grain dimensions to nanometer range. Furthermore, in the presence of Sb the silicide layers grow with the preferential orientation: (100) [010]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [100]Si. The observed changes in the morphology and orientation of the Mn 4 Si 7 layers {{can be explained by the}} reduced diffusion of Mn and Si atoms in the presence of the Sb overlayer. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die Struktur von dünnen MnSi 1. 7 -Schichten, die mit verschiedenen UHV-Herstellungsmethoden (template-Verfahren, reaktive Abscheidung und surfactant gesteuerte Abscheidung) auf (001) Si hergestellt wurden, mittels Elektronenmikroskopie charakterisiert. Die Ergebnisse der Elektronenbeugung an dünnen Mangansilicid-Schichten können vollständig interpretiert werden, wenn von den bekannten höheren Mangansiliciden (HMS) das Mn 4 Si 7 als einzige vorliegende Phase angenommen wird. Der Hauptteil der Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit den mittels template-Verfahren abgeschiedenen Mn 4 Si 7 -Schichten. In diesen Experimenten wurde der Einfluss der template-Dicke auf die Morphologie und Orientierung der hergestellten Schichten untersucht. Es wird gezeigt, dass bei der Abscheidung von einer dünnen Mn-Schicht mit einer nominalen Dicke von 0, 8 nm bei Raumtemperatur und weiterer Mn/Si-Koabscheidung bei einer Substrattemperatur von 550 °C nahezu geschlossene Silicidschichten mit der bevorzugten Orientierungsbeziehung (110) [4 - 41]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si entstehen. Weiterhin wachsen bei dieser template-Dicke Mn 4 Si 7 -Kristallite mit den Orientierungsbeziehungen: (3 - 38) [- 443]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si und (001) [110] Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si. Bei jeder gefundenen Orientierungsbeziehung treten beim Wachstum von Mn 4 Si 7 auf (001) Si mehrere Domäne auf. Zusätzliche Experimente wurden unter Verwendung der reaktiven Schichtabscheidung durchgeführt. Sie verdeutlichen, dass bei reaktiver Abscheidung von Mn auf (001) Si ab einer Substrattemperatur von 600 °C ein Wachstum von Mn 4 Si 7 -Inseln entlang den [110]-Richtungen des <b>Siliciums</b> erfolgt. XRD-Untersuchungen zeigen, dass diese Inseln die folgende Textur haben: (110) Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) Si. Durch eine Modifizierung der Si-Oberfläche mit einer bis zu einer Monolage dicken Sb-Schicht (surfactant) kann das Mn 4 Si 7 -Inselwachstum beeinflusst werden. Die dabei gefundene Erhöhung der Mn 4 Si 7 -Inseldichte wird hier auf die reduzierte Mn- und Si-Diffusion zurükgeführt. Weiterhin wurde gefunden, dass dieser Abscheidungsprozess Mn 4 Si 7 -Kristallite der bevorzugten Orientierung (100) [010]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si liefert...|$|R

Als Vorstufen für den Aufbau zweidimensionaler oligomerer Systeme wurden Trifluormethylsilane des Typs CF 3 R 2 SiX, CF 3 RSiX 2 (X = Halogen, H, OMe, NR 2; R = Me, Ph) und (CF 3) 2 SiX 2 (X = Br, NMe 2) dargestellt und charakterisiert. Die Reaktion von HSiCl 3 mit CF 3 Br in Gegenwart von tertiären Aminen führt zu CF 3 SiCl 3 in ca. 18 % Ausbeute. [CF 3 Me 2 Si] 2 ist durch reduktive Enthalogenierung von CF 3 Me 2 SiCl oder durch Umsetzung von CF 3 Me 2 SiH mit HgR 2 (R = Me, Et) erhältlich. Höhere Oligosilane (z. B. CF 3 MeSi(SiMe 2 CF 3) 2, (CF 3 Me 2 Si) 3 SiMe, CF 3 Si(SiMe 3) 3) werden durch Trifluormethylierung der entsprechenden SiSi-Gerüste dargestellt. Die Reaktion von Si 2 Cl 6 mit P(NEt 2) 3 / CF 3 Br führt zu donorstabilisierten CF 3 SiCl, welches mit CF 3 Br zu (CF 3) 2 SiCl 2 abreagiert. In gleicher Weise wird die SiSi-Bindung der Disilane [CF 3 Me(X) Si] 2 und CF 3 Me(X) SiSiMeX 2 (X = Halogen) in Gegenwart von Basen unter Silylen-Bildung gespalten. Ausgehend von CF 3 R 2 SiX sind CF 3 -substituierte Disiloxane durch Hydrolyse oder durch Umsetzung mit Metalloxiden erhältlich. Die Hydrolyse von CF 3 MeSiX 2 (X = Cl, OMe) führt zu trifluormethylierten Oligo- und Polysiloxanen [CF 3 RSiO] n (R = Me, Ph), wobei Kristallstrukturanalysen von [CF 3 MeSiO] 3 [MeSiO 1. 5] 4 und [CF 3 MeSiO] 4 vorliegen. Der Einfluß der CF 3 -Substitution auf die Acidität des <b>Siliciums</b> wurde an den Komplexverbindungen (CF 3) 2 SiX 2 *D, CF 3 SiCl 3 *D (X = Cl, Br; D = Bipy, Phen, DMSO) sowie an [CF 3 MeSi(bipy) 2]I 2 und 1 -Trifluormethylsilatran untersucht. Alle Verbindungen wurden NMR- sowie z. T. IR/ Raman-spektroskopisch untersucht und charakterisiert. Durch Tieftemperatur-NMR-Experimente konnten Zwischenprodukte der basenkatalysierten SiSi-Spaltung von Me 2 Cl 4 Si 2 erfaßt bzw. das Austauschverhalten CF 3 -substituierter Disilane beobachtet werden. (Trifluoromethyl) organopolysilanes and -siloxanes were {{prepared}} either by coupling of (trifluoromethyl) monosilanes or by trifluoromethylation of SiSi and SiOSi backbones. The monosilanes CF 3 R 2 SiX, CF 3 RSiX 2 (X = halogen, H, NR 2, OR; R = alkyl, aryl) {{have been obtained}} by trifluoromethylation of chlorosilanes with P(NEt 2) 3 / CF 3 Br in high yields. A new approach to CF 3 SiCl 3 by the reaction of HSiCl 3 with NR 3 in presence of CF 3 Br was investigated. Reaction in diglyme at 25 °C affords CF 3 SiCl 3 in 20 % yield. The base-catalysed disproportionation of Si 2 Cl 6 with P(NEt 2) 3 / CF 3 Br leads to donor-stabilised (CF 3) 2 SiCl 2 ← P(NEt 2) 3, whereas the disproportionation of Me 2 Cl 4 Si 2 gives CF 3 MeSiCl 2. By conversion of the donor-stabilised (CF 3) 2 SiCl 2 to (CF 3) 2 Si(NMe 2) 2 bis(trifluoromethyl) silanes are readily accessible in good yields. (CF 3) 2 SiCl 2 ← P(NEt 2) 3 has been converted also into the chemically and thermally stable complex (CF 3) 2 SiCl 2 ← Bipy. The NMR parameters and the chemical behaviour of these compounds are compared with the properties of (CF 3) 2 SiX 2 ← Bipy (X = Cl, Br) and CF 3 SiX 3 ← D (X = Cl, D = Bipy, Phen, DMSO), which have been synthesised by {{the reaction of the}} free silanes and the donor-ligand. The first trifluoromethylated oligosilanes ([CF 3 Me 2 Si] 2 SiMeCF 3, (CF 3 Me 2 Si) 3 SiMe, [CF 3 Me 2 Si] 2 (SiMe) 2 [SiMe 2 CF 3] 2, CF 3 Si(SiMe 3) 3) and some new CF 3 -disilanes ([CF 3 R 1 R 2 Si] 2, R 1,R 2 = Me, R 2 = NR 2) {{were prepared}} by trifluoromethylation of the corresponding chloro-silanes and characterised by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. The yield of CF 3 substituted silanes depends on the steric hindrance of the silanes and the number of CF 3 groups, which have to be transferred. Formation of CF 3 SiSi backbones by coupling of (trifluoromethyl) monosilanes has been achieved by reaction of CF 3 Me 2 SiCl with Li/ HMPA or in the photo-induced coupling of CF 3 Me 2 SiH with HgR 2 (R = Me, Et) both leading to CF 3 Me 2 SiSiMe 2 CF 3. The lewis-acidic disilanes CF 3 Me(X) SiSi(X) MeCF 3 (X = Cl, Br) show a dynamic intramolecular halogen exchange in presence of ammonium salts. Heating the mixture to 100 °C leads to a crude product, which contains CF 3 SiSi fragments. Trifluoromethylated disiloxanes were prepared either by trifluoromethylation of the corresponding halo-disiloxanes or by hydrolyses of CF 3 R 2 SiCl leading to [CF 3 R 1 R 2 Si] 2 O (R 1, R 2 = Me; R 1 = Me, R 2 = Ph; R 1, R 2 = Ph). Coupling of CF 3 MeSi(H) Br with ZnO gives [CF 3 Me(H) Si] 2 O in low yield. CF 3 -oligosiloxanes have been obtained by hydrolyses of CF 3 MeSiX 2 (X = Cl, OMe) or CF 3 PhSiCl 2. Reaction in polar solvents like Et 2 O leads to the partiall loss of the CF 3 moiety resulting in silsesquioxane structures. The incompletely condensed silsesquioxane [CF 3 MeSiO] 3 [MeSiO 1. 5] 4 has been isolated and structurally characterised. The hydrolyses in CHCl 3 leads to the formation of the first cyclic (trifluoromethyl) siloxane [CF 3 MeSiO] 4 and linear polysiloxanes. [CF 3 MeSiO] 4 has been isolated by sublimation in vacuum and its structure was determined by X-ray analysis. The (trifluoromethyl) siloxanes were characterised by IR and NMR spectroscopy, showing a typical "CF 3 "-shift of the resonances compared to organopolysiloxanes. The electron withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethylgroup has also been studied by structure analysis of the atranes CF 3 E(OCH 2 CH 2) 3 N (E = Si, Ge). The atranes were prepared by the reaction of CF 3 E(OMe) 3 with N(CH 2 CH 2 OH) 3. They are stable complexes, which are insoluble in non-polar solvents but soluble in solvents like DMF, DMSO or NMP. The transannular E-N contact of both atranes is considerably shorter than in other organylatranes. </P...|$|R

The software tools were used to identify and propose the project partner SHELL SOLAR process conditions under which the growth of <b>Silicium</b> crystals is possible at a relatively high growth rate, but at a relatively small deflection of the solid/liquid interface and thus under conditions of relatively small thermal stress. Therefore, a comprehensive study was performed in order to analyze how the thermal conditions depend on the set-up of the growth facility and here especially on the application of heat shields above the melt crucible. Based on the modelling results proposal were made for the construction of the heat shields whose use would result in a higher growth rate at lower interface deflection resp. lower thermal stress as well as at a reduced formation of point defects. Furthermore, parameter studies were carried out to study the influence of magnetic fields on the heat and mass transport during the pulling of the trio-crystalline <b>Silicium</b> crystals. The use of magnetic fields results principally in an improvement of the process regarding higher growth rate and smaller interface deflection. However, the technological and economical effort for the application of magnetic fields is probably too high in comparison to the use of an optimized heat shield. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract- Carotenoids like {{lycopene}} {{are important}} pigments found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants. They {{are responsible for}} the bright colors of fruits and vegetables and perform various functions in photosynthesis. Our research has shown that the application of moderate salt stress on tomato plants can enhance lycopene and potentially other antioxidant concentrations in fruits. The increase in lycopene in response to salt stress in the tomato fruits varied from 20 % to 80 %. Although the specific biological mechanisms involved in increasing fruit lycopene deposition has not been clearly elucidated, evidence suggests that increasing antioxidant concentrations is a primary physiological response of the plant to salt stress. Additionally drought stress during cultivation increased the antioxidant capacity of tomato fruit while maintaining the lycopene concentration. In addition, the effects of <b>silicium</b> were investigated, added to the nutrient solution either at low concentration or at an increased concentration. The present study clearly indicates that an enhanced <b>silicium</b> supply to tomato increases markedly the lycopene contents, irrespective of the salinity status in the tomato fruit...|$|E
40|$|Sol-gel {{technology}} {{is an alternative}} method for producing nanoparticles. This paper deals with preparing UHPC mixes by using amorphous <b>silicium</b> dioxide nanoparticles specially synthesized by applying the sol-gel method. Grading of used micro and nano components {{was carried out by}} Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. The studied micro and nanoparticles have dimensions in the range from 30 to 600 nm. Proportions of filler components were selected by taking into account optimal packing models. Experimental part of research includes preparation of the mix containing traditional UHPC ingredients (Portland cement, quartz filler, silica fume) and nanoparticles synthesized by sol-gel technology in amount up to 1 % of cement. Influence of nanoparticles on concrete properties was studied. Mineralogical composition of UHPC matrix was examined by X-ray method. After summarizing the results it may be concluded that incorporation of the small amount of nano sized <b>silicium</b> dioxide nanoparticles synthesized by sol-gel technology slightly decreases compressive strength in early hardening period (7 days in normal conditions) and increases strength after intensive curing (+ 90 ºC for 3 days). ...|$|E
