Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than <b>students</b> <b>from</b> the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black <b>students</b> <b>from</b> the city on a voluntary basis.
