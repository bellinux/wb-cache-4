5|$|In {{pursuit of}} these funds he {{traveled}} to the Thracian Chersonese and attacked Selymbria. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms and imposed strict discipline to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> observed. He did their city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison in it and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance is judged as skillful by historians, since it saved time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.|$|E
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> well quartered; to their delight, {{he announced that}} since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all {{the women and children}} would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> poor.|$|E

500|$|As late as July 1997, U2 were {{pressured}} {{to accept an}} offer of approximately $4million to perform in Basel, Switzerland on the date scheduled for the Sarajevo show. At the time, rumours about the region's instability persisted. To ensure the Sarajevo show was not canceled, Sacirbey appeared at many of the band's preceding shows to lobby {{on behalf of the}} city. For the stage to reach Sarajevo, the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war-torn Bosnia. Although the trip was without incident, they had to pass through towns such as Mostar, which had been [...] "obliterated" [...] during the war. Stage and lighting designer Willie Williams commented that [...] "when the truck drivers arrived you could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> changed men". The only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours. The trucks reached Sarajevo two days prior to the concert, arriving to the cheers and applause of the city's residents; their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there. McGuinness explained, [...] "This is a city that's been disappointed so many times {{there were a lot of}} people who weren't prepared to believe the gig was going to take place until they saw the stage going up." [...] Until then, tickets had sold very slowly, but within 24 hours of the trucks' arrival, another 8,000tickets were sold. Despite this, a day before the concert, 15,000tickets remained unsold. Three-hundred local residents were employed to help assemble the stage and promote the show.|$|E

Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years.

2500|$|The {{history of}} cooking vessels before the {{development}} of pottery is minimal due to the limited archaeological evidence. The earliest pottery vessels, dating from , were discovered in Xianrendong Cave, Jiangxi, China. The pottery {{may have been used}} as cookware, manufactured by hunter-gatherers. Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef reported that [...] "When you look at the pots, you can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in a fire." [...] It is also possible to extrapolate likely developments based on methods used by latter peoples. Among the first of the techniques believed to be used by stone age civilizations were improvements to basic roasting. In addition to exposing food to direct heat from either an open fire or hot embers it is possible to cover the food with clay or large leaves before roasting to preserve moisture in the cooked result. Examples of similar techniques are still in use in many modern cuisines.|$|E

They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{students}} and faculty, regardless of religion, {{are required to}} agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found {{as far back as}} the days of the Brigham Young Academy and educator Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the [...] "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> following the school's moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. Ernest L. Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards (at the time, Wilkinson, as president of BYU, and the director of what was then the Unified Church School System, had some authority over all of the church's schools). This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol in addition to academic honesty. A signed commitment to live the Honor Code is part of the application process for all LDS-affiliated schools, and must be adhered to by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, {{students and}} faculty can be expelled from the school for excessive misbehavior. In addition to the general Honor Code common at all LDS schools, the BYU–Idaho Honor Code prohibits bib overalls, baseball caps (worn inside classrooms), shorts or capri pants, flip-flops (sandals), and also any worn, faded, or patched clothing on campus.|$|E
