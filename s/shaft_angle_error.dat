40|$|Abstract : Constant {{velocity}} joint (CVJ) lines of front drive automobiles {{are composed of}} the tripod CVJ or the double offset CVJ, the Rzeppa CVJ and the drive <b>shaft.</b> The rotational <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> of the CVJ line and the three dimensional motion of the drive shaft (the whirling motion and the fluctuation of axial direction) were measured and its components were expanded in trigonometric functions. The rotational <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> contains sinusoidal fluctuations with 2 π, 2 π/ 3, 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles of Tripod and Rzeppa CVJs. The whirling motion has the period of 2 π/ 3 according to the joint angle of Tripod CVJ. The axial direction motion of the drive shaft contains sinusoidal fluctuations of 2 π, 2 π/ 3 or 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles of Tripod and Rzeppa CVJs. Rotation of the output shaft Rzeppa CVJ due to its revolution about the drive shaft was analyzed experimentally and analytically...|$|R

40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer <b>error,</b> rolling misalignment <b>angle</b> <b>error,</b> and the gimbal <b>angle</b> <b>error,</b> the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and axis non-orthogonal angle will produce coning errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as coning angles (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R

40|$|In general, the <b>shaft</b> <b>angle</b> of {{automotive}} hypoid gears is 90 degrees. Therefore, the design method of an angular hypoid gear {{had not been}} investigated sufficiently up to now. Moreover, the tooth spiral of the hypoid gear is generally on the right hand and the pinion axis is offset below the gear axis. Therefore, when the pinion axis is offset conversely, the design method has not been investigated in detail. In the present report, by using basic equations on the angular hypoid gear with an opposite offset obtained in the previous paper, the design dimensions of the angular hypoid gear whose <b>shaft</b> <b>angle</b> is {{in the region of}} 70 ～ 100 -degrees are shown.
