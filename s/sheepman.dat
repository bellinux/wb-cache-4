5|$|Tracy finally {{achieved}} {{some success}} by joining {{forces with the}} notable stock manager William H. Wright {{in the spring of}} 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made her name on Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One of these shows brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. The <b>Sheepman</b> previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Gruber {{said that}} good writers used {{dialogue}} and plot development {{to develop these}} basic plots into believable stories. Other subgenres include the Spaghetti Western, the epic western, singing cowboy westerns, and a few such as: Along Came Jones (1945), in which Gary Cooper spoofed his western persona; The <b>Sheepman</b> (1958), with Glenn Ford poking fun at himself; and Cat Ballou (1965), with a drunk Lee Marvin atop a drunk horse. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was re-invented with the revisionist Western.|$|E
2500|$|Trials quickly {{spread in}} England and Scotland. From the beginning, shepherds {{realized}} that show collies, also becoming popular at the time, quickly lost the keen working instincts honed in working collies. In 1876, a trial was organized in Alexandra Park by the <b>sheepman</b> {{as a challenge}} to the show fanciers to demonstrate that show collies could still work. [...] There were two judges for work and appearance. [...] The result was a disaster for the show fanciers. [...] Show collies barked, yelped and lost control of many sheep. [...] The winner was a common red coated working collie named Maddie, owned by John Thomas, a Welsh shepherd.|$|E
5000|$|For decades {{prior to}} 1909, <b>sheepmen</b> and cattlemen had been {{fighting}} for control of America's vast unsettled grasslands. The conflicts usually began as disputes over grazing rights, but the cattlemen also complained that the <b>sheepmen</b> destroyed the open range and made it unsuitable for cattle. For example, cattlemen claimed that <b>sheepmen</b> let their flocks overgraze, or that the sharp hooves of the sheep were cutting up the grass {{to a point where}} it wouldn't grow back. <b>Sheepmen</b> were also said to have polluted the water sources so badly that cattle could not drink from them without becoming sick. Generally, the cattlemen were the stronger of the two factions and they controlled the range by establishing a type of border called [...] "deadlines" [...] and hiring gunmen to prevent sheepherders from crossing them.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will say}} that old Cal wasn't {{distinguished}} as a <b>sheepman.</b> He was a little, old stoop-shouldered /hombre/ about {{as big as a}} gun scabbard, with scraggy white whiskers, and condemned to the continuous use of language. Old Cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn't even hated by the cowmen. And when a <b>sheepman</b> don't get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen, he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung.|$|E

It's true, I dare say, that he bragged, for he was given to bluster an' blow. An' he's old now. I can't help it if he bragged about me. But if he has, an' if he's justified in his stand against you <b>sheepmen,</b> I'm goin' {{to do my best}} {{to live up to his}} brag." ...|$|R

It {{rests on a}} monopoly of Government land. It's got to go. Settlement is creeping in and these big ranges which these 'cattle kings' have held, must be free. There is a war due between the <b>sheepmen</b> and the cattlemen, too, and our lay is to side in with the <b>sheepmen.</b> They are mainly Mexicans, but their fight is our feast." ...|$|R

6000|$|Dry Valley {{had been}} a <b>sheepman.</b> His real name was Hector, {{but he had been}} rechristened after his range to {{distinguish}} him from [...] "Elm Creek" [...] Johnson, who ran sheep further down the Frio.|$|E
6000|$|... "I heerd {{it at the}} store," [...] {{replied the}} lad, {{with an air of}} confidence. [...] "Some <b>sheepmen</b> was talkin' to Greaves. He's the storekeeper. I was settin' outside, but I heerd. A Mexican come down off the Rim ter-day an' he fetched the news." [...] Here the lad looked furtively around, then whispered. [...] "An' thet greaser was sent by somebody. I never heerd no more, but them <b>sheepmen</b> looked pretty plumb sour. An' one of them, comin' out, give me a kick, darn him. It shore is the luckedest day fer us cowmen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, {{the open}} talk is thet the <b>sheepmen</b> are forcin' this war. But thar's talk not so open, an' I reckon not very healthy for any man to whisper hyarbouts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See heah, girl. You listen. There's a clique of ranchers {{down in the}} Basin, {{all those}} you named, with Isbel at their haid. They have resented <b>sheepmen</b> comin' down into the valley. They want it all to themselves. That's the reason. Shore there's another. All the Isbels are crooked. They're cattle an' horse thieves--have been for years. Gaston Isbel always was a {{maverick}} rustler. He's gettin' old now an' rich, so he wants to cover his tracks. He aims to blame this cattle rustlin' an' horse stealin' on to us <b>sheepmen,</b> an' run {{us out of the}} country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ef I {{must say}} it, Sam," [...] she drawled, [...] "you look jest {{like one of}} them hayseeds in the picture papers, 'stead of a free and {{independent}} <b>sheepman</b> of the State o' Texas." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the door}} of the hotel some half-a-dozen men were clustered. As the young couple {{approached}} they gave way, but a short, powerful man, whom Lee Virginia recognized as Gregg the <b>sheepman,</b> called to the ranger: ...|$|E
60|$|The ranger {{was not in}} a mood {{to invite}} the <b>sheepman</b> in, and, besides, he {{perceived}} the danger to which Wetherford was exposed. Therefore his answers were short. Gregg, on his part, did not appear anxious to enter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trouble brewin' {{between the}} cattlemen {{down in the}} Basin an' the <b>sheepmen</b> up on the Rim. Dad says there'll shore be hell to pay. I tell him I hope the cattlemen chase him back to Texas." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of local citizens were supportive, any protests heard {{were coming from}} the <b>sheepmen.</b> Conservationist and later Venice, California founder Abbot Kinney and Century magazine editor Robert Underwood Johnson gave their support of the proposed set aside.|$|R
60|$|Madison Lane, a young {{cattleman}} {{from the}} Nueces country, won the race. He and Rosita were married one Christmas day. Armed, hilarious, vociferous, magnanimous, the cowmen and the <b>sheepmen,</b> laying aside their hereditary hatred, {{joined forces to}} celebrate the occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because there's grass everywhere. I see {{no sense}} in a <b>sheepman</b> goin' {{out of his way}} to {{surround}} a cattleman an' sheep off his range. That started the row. Lord knows how it'll end. For most all of them heah are from Texas." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mose {{took the}} small, firm {{hand of the}} <b>sheepman</b> and looked into his face he liked him, and the {{stranger}} returned his liking. [...] "Your fight is mine, gentlemen," [...] he said. [...] "These cattlemen are holding back settlement for their own selfish purposes." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>sheepman</b> smiled. [...] "So am I, but I've got a {{wife and}} two daughters back in Santy Fay. Come and see me. I like your build. Well, gentlemen, just call on me at any time you need me. I'll see that my sheep don't trouble you." ...|$|E
50|$|Once {{partisan}} feelings became {{tense and}} hostilities began, Burnham became {{drawn into the}} conflict, defending the Wells family and particularly John and his father Fred, {{as well as being}} forced to participate in raiding parties on <b>sheepmen.</b> After being drawn into it, Burnham was marked for death by the <b>sheepmen,</b> who described him as an “unknown gunman” with his “Remington six-shooter belt.” He hid for many days before escaping from the valley. Private posses were raised for raiding the opposition. Killings and counter-killings became a weekly occurrence. For the Wells outfit, it became a sheer waste of human life in a struggle without honor or profit in another man's feud, and seemingly without end.|$|R
50|$|A range war {{develops}} between cattlemen and <b>sheepmen.</b> A {{couple of}} cowhands, Dave Saunders and Chito Rafferty, {{get caught in}} the middle when they rescue Tug Campbell, who's about to be lynched by sheep ranch foreman Jess Rawlins and his men without a fair trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Greaves {{is hard to}} figure. He's a snaky {{customer}} in deals. But {{he seems to be}} good to the poor people 'round heah. Says he's from Missouri. Ha-ha! He's as much Texan as I am. He rode into the Tonto without even a pack to his name. An' presently he builds his stone house an' freights supplies in from Phoenix. Appears to buy an' sell a good deal of stock. For a while it looked like he was steerin' a middle course between cattlemen an' <b>sheepmen.</b> Both sides made a rendezvous of his store, where he heard the grievances of each. Laterly he's leanin' to the <b>sheepmen.</b> Nobody has accused him of that yet. But it's time some cattleman called his bluff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{right for}} you, <b>sheepman.</b> I like an open game, myself. We're two locoed he-milliners hat-hunting in the wilderness. I notify you. Burr, to mind your corrals. We've got an even start, {{and the one}} that gets the {{headgear}} will stand some higher at the Espinosa." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>sheepman</b> grimly replied: [...] "I {{have the}} {{reputation}} {{in my country}} {{of taking care of}} myself." [...] He drew a revolver and laid it affectionately in the hollow of his folded left arm. [...] "I have two of these, and in a mix-up with me, somebody generally gets hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You fellows {{hold the}} winning hand," [...] said Delmar; [...] "the small rancher will sure wipe the <b>sheepman</b> out in time. I've got sense {{enough to see}} that. You can't fight the {{progress}} of events. Youngster, you belong to the winning side," [...] he ended, turning to Mose, [...] "but it's the unpopular side just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One thing, Thayer," [...] Dick {{said in an}} aside, after {{releasing}} {{himself from}} the girls, as they jostled in confusion where they met Thayer and Naismith {{at the head of}} the stairway leading down to the dining room. [...] "Before you leave us, cast your eyes over those Merinos. I really have to brag about them, and American <b>sheepmen</b> will have to come to them. Of course, started with imported stock, but I've made a California strain that will make the French breeders sit up. See Wardman and take your pick. Get Naismith to look them over with you. Stick half a dozen of them in your train-load, with my compliments, and let your Idaho <b>sheepmen</b> get a line on them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal," [...] he began, thoughtfully, [...] "reckon {{there are}} only two points in Jim's talk I need touch on. There's shore goin' to be a Grass Valley war. An' Jim's idea of the cause of it seems to be pretty much {{the same as that of}} all the other cattlemen. It 'll go down a black blot on the history page of the Tonto Basin as a war between rival <b>sheepmen</b> an' cattlemen. Same old fight over water an' grass! ... Jean, my son, that is wrong. It 'll not be a war between <b>sheepmen</b> an' cattlemen. But a war of honest ranchers against rustlers maskin' as sheep-raisers! ... Mind you, I don't belittle the trouble between <b>sheepmen</b> an' cattlemen in Arizona. It's real an' it's vital an' it's serious. It 'll take law an' order to {{straighten}} out the grazin' question. Some day the government will keep sheep off of cattle ranges.... So get things right in your mind, my son. You can trust your dad to tell the absolute truth. In this fight that 'll wipe out some of the Isbels--maybe all of them--you're on the side of justice an' right. Knowin' that, a man can fight a hundred times harder than he who knows he is a liar an' a thief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Texas was {{overstocked}} {{with bad}} men an' fine steers," [...] concluded Blaisdell. [...] "Most {{of the first}} an' some of the last have struck the Tonto. The <b>sheepmen</b> have now got distributin' points for wool an' sheep at Maricopa an' Phoenix. They're shore waxin' strong an' bold." ...|$|R
