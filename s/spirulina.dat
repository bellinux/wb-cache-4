25|$|<b>Spirulina</b> (Arthrospira platensis) is a blue-green microalgae with a {{long history}} as a food source in East Africa and pre-colonial Mexico. <b>Spirulina</b> is high in protein and other nutrients, finding use as a food {{supplement}} and for malnutrition. <b>Spirulina</b> thrives in open systems and commercial growers have found it well-suited to cultivation. One of the largest production sites is Lake Texcoco in central Mexico. The plants produce a variety of nutrients and high amounts of protein. <b>Spirulina</b> is often used commercially as a nutritional supplement.|$|E
25|$|Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is a {{cyanobacteria}} {{similar to}} <b>spirulina,</b> {{which is used}} as a nutritional supplement.|$|E
25|$|The Christopher Hills Foundation donated {{more than}} $9 {{million worth of}} <b>spirulina</b> {{products}} to charitable organizations in the U.S. and abroad. When the Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan, Hills learned from his friends in Peshawar that Afghan freedom fighter Ahmad Shah Masoud's mujahadeen troops as well as Tajik and Pashtun tribals were starving because supply routes had been cut by Russian forces. Hills donated and shipped $300,000 worth of <b>spirulina,</b> which was packed in by mules with help from Senator Charlie Wilson to sustain the Afghans.|$|E
25|$|The campus housed University of the Trees Press which {{published}} Christopher Hills' {{writings and}} the research {{of a number of}} resident students who obtained degrees at the university and wrote books on light & color frequencies and the science of Radionics. A small workshop produced pendulums for dowsing and a line of negative ion generators. With the buildup of the vitamin business surrounding discoveries that <b>spirulina</b> had significant weight loss benefits University of the Trees became one of the largest employers in the San Lorenzo Valley and leased more than 10 buildings in Boulder Creek for housing students and warehousing for Light Force, a burgeoning nutritional products brand based on <b>spirulina.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cold-water delicacies, such as {{salmon and}} lobster, thrive in this nutrient-rich, deep, seawater. Microalgae such as <b>Spirulina,</b> a health food supplement, {{also can be}} cultivated. Deep-ocean water can be {{combined}} with surface water to deliver water at an optimal temperature.|$|E
25|$|For millennia <b>spirulina</b> {{had been}} a food staple for natives of Lake Chad and also for the Aztecs but Hills funded much of the early {{experimentation}} needed for its successful modern day mass cultivation, described in Dr Nakamura's book Spirulina: Food for a Hungry World.|$|E
25|$|Chlorella, {{another popular}} microalgae, has similar {{nutrition}} to <b>spirulina.</b> Chlorella {{is very popular}} in Japan. It is also used as a nutritional supplement with possible effects on metabolic rate. Some allege that Chlorella can reduce mercury levels in humans (supposedly by chelation of the mercury to the cell wall of the organism).|$|E
25|$|Rhodophyceae. Patches of residual, dry, {{evergreen}} forest and {{large areas of}} littoral scrub in woodlands in fishing villages bordering the lagoon are seen. Invasive phytoplankton species of Prosopis juliflora, <b>Spirulina</b> major, Oscillatoria spp., Anabaena spp., Rhizosolenia castracanei, Eucampia cornuta and Climacodium frauenfeldianum in the plains {{on the periphery of}} the lake have been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Reliance {{industries}} {{in collaboration with}} Algenol, USA commissioned a pilot project to produce algal bio-oil in the year 2014. <b>Spirulina</b> which is an alga rich in proteins content has been commercially cultivated in India. Algae is used in India for treating the sewage in open/natural oxidation ponds This reduces the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of the sewage and also provides algal biomass which {{can be converted to}} fuel.|$|E
25|$|Enclosing a pond with a {{transparent}} or translucent barrier effectively turns {{it into a}} greenhouse. This solves {{many of the problems}} associated with an open system. It allows more species to be grown, it allows the species that are being grown to stay dominant, and it extends the growing season – if heated, the pond can produce year round. Open race way ponds were used for removal of lead using live <b>Spirulina</b> (Arthospira) sp.|$|E
25|$|Hills and Nakamura had {{a vision}} of feeding the world from lakes, seas and {{backyard}} aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, Food from Sunlight which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on chlorella but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at Lake Chad were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called <b>spirulina</b> that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in Ethiopia. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of <b>spirulina</b> samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the seafood}} harvest is {{consumed}} by humans, but {{a significant proportion}} is used as fish food to farm other fish or rear farm animals. Some seafoods (kelp) are used as food for other plants (fertilizer). In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption. Products, such as fish oil and <b>spirulina</b> tablets are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{byproducts}} {{produced in}} the processing of microalgae {{can be used in}} various applications, many of which have a longer history of production than algal biofuel. Some of the products not used in the production of biofuel include natural dyes and pigments, antioxidants, and other high-value bio-active compounds. These chemicals and excess biomass have found numerous use in other industries. For example, the dyes and oils have found a place in cosmetics, commonly as thickening and water-binding agents. Discoveries within the pharmaceutical industry include antibiotics and antifungals derived from microalgae, as well as natural health products, which have been growing in popularity over the past few decades. For instance <b>Spirulina</b> contains numerous polyunsaturated fats (Omega 3 and 6), amino acids, and vitamins, as well as pigments that may be beneficial, such as beta-carotene and chlorophyll.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as <b>spirulina</b> are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E
2500|$|To {{manufacture}} <b>spirulina</b> nutritional products Hills {{started the}} Light Force company in Santa Cruz, California, {{which was one}} of the early models for multi-level marketing. Customers began reporting weight loss and health benefits from <b>spirulina</b> and the success story was featured in The National Enquirer. Sales skyrocketed into the millions of dollars propelling Light Force to 50,000 distributors worldwide. To grow that much <b>spirulina</b> Hills formed joint ventures with Koor Foods in Eilat, Israel, Taiwan Aqua in Taipei and Sosa Texcoco at Lake Texcoco in Mexico. Hills also had an association with Cyanotech on the Big Island of Hawaii which grew a very pure Pacifica brand of <b>spirulina.</b> By 1995 more than 5000 tons of <b>spirulina</b> a year were being imported for Light Force products. To encourage domestic research and production Hills purchased a 150-acre farm and built raceway ponds filled from the land's own natural geothermal aquifer in Desert Hot Springs, California.

2500|$|... {{confirmed}} vegetarian diets {{provide sufficient}} protein intake {{as long as}} a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. [...] Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds <b>spirulina,</b> pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.|$|E
2500|$|The diet {{requires}} restricting or eliminating foods high in Phe, such as soybeans, egg whites, shrimp, chicken breast, <b>spirulina,</b> watercress, fish, nuts, crayfish, lobster, tuna, turkey, legumes, and lowfat cottage cheese. Starchy foods, such as {{potatoes and}} corn are generally acceptable in controlled amounts, but {{the quantity of}} Phe consumed from these foods must be monitored. A food diary is usually kept to record the amount of Phe consumed with each meal, snack, or drink.

Lower-protein [...] "medical food" [...] substitutes are often used in place of normal bread, pasta, and other grain-based foods, which contain a significant amount of Phe. Many fruits and vegetables are lower in Phe and can be eaten in larger quantities. Infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the benefits of breastmilk, but the quantity must also be monitored and supplementation for missing nutrients will be required. [...] The sweetener aspartame, present in many diet foods and soft drinks, must also be avoided, as aspartame contains phenylalanine.|$|E

5000|$|During 1964 and 1965, the {{botanist}} Jean Leonard, {{during his}} Belgian Trans-Saharan Expedition, confirmed that dihe {{is made up}} of <b>Spirulina</b> and thus chemical analysis was started on <b>Spirulina.</b> During that time, Léonard received a request from Sosa-Texcoco Ltd, Mexico to study a bloom of algae in their sodium hydroxide production facility.
