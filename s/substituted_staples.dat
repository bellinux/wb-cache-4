A lack of locally grown potatoes suitable for processing {{has meant that}} processed potato products are mostly imported, while fresh potatoes are grown locally or regionally. Estimation of a two-equation system of demand functions for fresh potatoes and frozen French fries shows that per capita consumption of both products are significantly influenced by income, price, the rate of urbanization, and country-specific factors.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the change in}} the nature of food demand in India in the last twenty years. It identifies two distinct stages of diet transition associated with the period of economic growth. During the first stage, income-induced diet diversification, consumers move away from inferior goods to superior foods and <b>substitute</b> some traditional <b>staples,</b> especially rice. In the second stage, diet globalisation, the influences of globalisation are much more marked with increased consumption of proteins, sugars and fats. Diet diversification has marked the process of transformation in food production systems. The implications for small and marginal farmers could be serious, unless there are incentives and policies that allow them to move away from subsistence agriculture and become more integrated in the global food market.

40|$|Agricultural {{societies}} partly {{depend upon}} wild foods. Relationships between an agricultural {{society and its}} wild foods can be explored by examining how the society responds through colonization of new lands {{that have not been}} previously inhabited. The oldest clear example of this phenomenon took place about 5000 years ago in the tropical Western Pacific at the “boundary” interface between Near and Remote Oceania. An inventory of wild and domesticated food plants used by people living along “the remote side of ” that interface has been prepared from the literature. This was then assessed for the roles of plants at the time of original colonization of Remote Oceania. The majority of species are wild foods, and most of these are used as leafy vegetables and fruits. The wild food plants mostly serve as supplements to domesticated species, although there are a few that can be used as <b>substitutes</b> for traditional <b>staples...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wheat is an {{alternative}} food product that contains high carbohydrate, which is currently consumed by many Indonesian people in order to <b>substitute</b> their <b>staple</b> food of rice.   However, Indonesia must import large amount of this product, and {{during the last decade}} the imported volume has dramatically increased.   In 2008 the imported wheat reached 4. 9 million tons. Since 2001, Indonesian Government has developed domestic wheat agribusiness which aimed to establish industrial villages of domestic wheat production.   However, due to some obstacles, the program is not successful yet. Therefore, it is needed to study the competitive position of wheat agribusiness in Indonesia.   The study’s objectives are (1) to portrait the current domestic wheat agribusiness in Indonesia, (2) to analyze the domestic wheat competitive position, and (3) to formulate strategy for developing domestic wheat agribusiness in Indonesia as an effort to fulfill some part of domestic wheat demand and to build industrial villages of wheat production. The study was conducted in 2009. Data have been analyzed by using the frame of Porter’s Diamond Theory in order to find out the competitive position of Indonesian domestic wheat agribusiness.   Afterwards, SWOT analysis is used to investigate internal strengths and weaknesses as well as external opportunities and threats of Indonesian wheat agribusiness in order to formulate the developing strategies. Finally, the approach of strategic architecture is used to arrange the formulated strategies where it can be easier to get the picture. The conclusion of Porter’s Diamond analysis showed that each subsystems of domestic wheat agribusiness in Indonesia still do not support one to another, therefore, its competitiveness becomes weak. In order to strengthen its competitiveness, domestic wheat agribusiness needs to be developed more properly by paying attention to development strategies which have been consciously formulated and put in mapping of strategic architecture. </em...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full [2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Mycosphaerella fijiensis with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Three related fungal species within the genus Mycosphaerella induce important leaf spot diseases on Musa spp. : M. fijiensis, M. musicola and M. eumusae. They cause black leaf streak disease, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and eumusae leaf spot disease, respectively. M. fijiensis and M. musicola are known to cause serious economic damage on banana. M. fijiensis is present in most Musa growing regions of the world, but it is absent from the PRA area. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM[3] No. 11 : Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The Panel considers that:The climatic conditions in the PRA area and the economic, social and environmental consequences following the introduction of M. fijiensis into the PRA area could have been better analysed in the French document to support the conclusions reached. The Panel concludes that:* The probability of entry, under the current regulations, of M. fijiensis on Musa plant propagation material (other than vitroplants), and banana leaf, banana fruit would be low for French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion because the import is banned. * If the current restrictions are rescinded, the probability of entry of M. fijiensis into the PRA area would be high on the banana conventional propagation material (e. g. suckers) and leaves (for wrapping, decoration, etc.) pathways, low on commercial fruit without leaf debris and negligible on the vitroplants pathways. * In agreement with the French document’s conclusion, the Panel considers that probability of establishment of M. fiiensis in the whole PRA area is “high”. * The Panel agrees with the French document about the “high probability” of M. fijiensis to spread in the PRA area after establishment. * In commercial plantations of Cavendish bananas M. fijiensis would increase production costs because of the increased number of chemical treatments and more frequent de-leafing required to reduce inoculum pressure, compared to the less aggressive M. musicola. Additional costs would also be faced to develop control strategies to fungicide resistance and to adapt current disease forecasting systems. Additional control costs may reduce the competitiveness of the banana industry in Guadeloupe and Martinique, resulting in reduced employment and consequent negative social impact. * Smallholdings producing fruit for the local market or for home-consumption could suffer yield losses impacting on production and consumption patterns, with related negative social impacts, should the yield of plantain be substantially reduced. Similar effects are possible for French Guiana, where banana is also grown in shifting cultivation. * Environmental impact will result from the increased number of fungicide applications, with possible negative effect on human health through pollution of the air and surface water. * Uncertainties, which do not affect the final conclusion, remain as regards: H. psittacorum as a pathway; the extent of additional control cost for smallholders; the availability and the costs of <b>substituting</b> <b>staple</b> foods, should the yield of plantain for family consumption be substantially reduced; the increase of pesticide residues in banana fruit should M. fijiensis establish in the PRA are...|$|R
40|$|Flours from a {{total of}} 15 genotypes of Dioscorea alata, D. esculenta, D. hispida, D. pentaphylla, and D. rotundata were {{evaluated}} to identify variation in starch-related functional properties affecting their quality for use in food processing. Significant differences were obtained among and within species for these properties. Very low amylose flours (3. 8 - 7. 4 %) such as D. esculenta showed high swelling volume (SV), lower gelatinization temperatures (GT), low paste viscosities and high breakdown, and soft, sticky, and cohesive gel textures. Dioscorea rotundata flours gave slightly higher apparent amylose contents (AAC) and GT compared to D. esculenta, but moderately high and variable paste viscosities and firm, non-sticky gel textures. Dioscorea hispida flour had low AAC and GT but extremely high paste viscosity and low paste stability. Flours from wild and cultivated genotypes of D. pentaphylla and D. alata showed a range of properties with potential for use in noodle-making and for industrial uses requiring high viscosity. Genotypes BSUP 115 and BSUP 126 (D. pentaphylla) showed strong resistance to mechanical disintegration (shear-thinning).

40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular food crops grown as a <b>substitute</b> <b>staple</b> in Zimbabwe. Its {{production}} is constrained by pest and diseases which reduce the yield drastically. The blackleg / soft rot disease complex caused by Pectobacterium and Dickeya species (formerly known as Erwinia) has been identified as a potential threat to potato production. The soft rot pathogens can cause systemic and vascular infections in potatoes, which result in the development of various symptoms on the stem and tubers. The symptoms that develop on the plant are not species specific but depend on climatic conditions prevailing at the infection stage. The pathogens affect the crop at all stages of production, which include in the field, storage and in transit. The primary objectives of this study were to identify the pathogens which cause blackleg and soft rot on potatoes in Zimbabwe; document the grower’s knowledge of blackleg and soft rot diseases in Zimbabwe; evaluate cultivars grown in Zimbabwe and South Africa for tolerance to Pectobacterium and Dickeya species; determine the role of calcium in blackleg and soft rot development; and determine the genetic diversity of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis isolates from South Africa, Zimbabwe and mini-tubers imported from China. The first chapter introduces the research highlighting the importance of potatoes globally and in Zimbabwe. It discusses production constraints caused by soft rot pathogens, as well as the pathogenesis of Pectobacterium and Dickeya spp. It also summarises the research objectives and thesis outline. Chapter 2 provides an overview of published literature on morphology, pathogenicity and identification of blackleg and soft rot pathogens, epidemiology, host range, defense mechanisms in plants, host nutrition and disease management strategies. Taxonomic revisions have led to the reclassification of pectolytic Erwinia into several genera. Strains formerly described as Erwinia carotovora have been incorporated into the genus Pectobacterium, and strains classified as Erwinia chrysanthemi are now assigned to the genus Dickeya. Several species and subspecies of Pectobacterium and Dickeya have isolated from infected potatoes. In Zimbabwe only Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum have until now been identified as the causal agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases, respectively. Although other species and subspecies of Pectobacterium and Dickeya have been isolated from infected potato plants in Zimbabwe, their potential to cause diseases on potatoes should not be underestimated. In chapter 3 bacterial isolates collected from infected plants showing typical blackleg / soft rot disease symptoms were identified using biochemical and physiological methods, as well as rep-PCR, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and single gene sequencing using two genes, viz. gyrB and recA. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to study the genetic diversity among potato isolates from Zimbabwe, South Africa and mini-tubers imported from China. Pectobacterium and Dickeya species enter the plant through wounds and natural openings such as lenticels. When they invade the plant they colonise the vascular tissue and spaces between the thin walled parenchyma cells. They remain inside these cells as latent infections and disease symptoms develop when host resistance is impaired or when environmental conditions become conducive for disease development. Chapter 4 investigates the role of defense related enzymes, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases, chlorogenic acid and total soluble phenols in host resistance to potato soft rot. The potato varieties were assayed for activity of polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases and concentration of chlorogenic acid and total soluble phenols in tuber tissue. The role of these four components in imparting resistance against the soft rot pathogens was also investigated. Blackleg and soft rot diseases are seed-borne and difficult to control using chemical, physical and cultural methods. Several approaches aimed at controlling blackleg and tuber rot have been studied but the degree of success has been variable. Plant nutrition is an important component of natural disease resistance. The effect of calcium soil amendments in enhancing resistance to potato soft rot pathogens was investigated in Chapter 5. A management strategy based on calcium-induced defense responses of potato to Pectobacterium and Dickeya spp. was investigated. Calcium promotes production of phenolics and strengthens the cell wall, making the plants resistant to maceration by pectolytic enzymes. In Chapter 6 a survey was conducted in nine potato growing regions of Zimbabwe using an informal structured questionnaire. The findings highlighted the distribution and impact of blackleg and soft rot diseases on the Zimbabwean potato industry. A broad spectrum of information on blackleg / soft rot disease complex was gathered and this information can help growers to make informed decisions about control strategies to apply. Each chapter in this thesis has been treated as an independent entity. Thus redundancy between chapters could not be avoided. It is my hope that the results of these studies on soft rot pathogens in Zimbabwe will contribute to a better understanding of the blackleg / soft rot disease complex that they cause. I also hope that these studies will form the basis of detailed and future investigations in epidemiology and disease control strategies. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
