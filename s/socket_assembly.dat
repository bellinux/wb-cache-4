50|$|In {{the case}} of non-permanently {{connected}} domestic equipment, a BS 1363-2 socket rated at 13 A {{is attached to the}} ring circuit, into which a fused plug may be inserted. (Note, it is not intended that the fuse should protect the appliance itself, for which it is still necessary for the appliance designer to take the necessary precautions.) Multiple socket accessories may be protected with a fuse within the <b>socket</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another problem arises {{after much}} {{use with the}} {{motherboard}} power connector; flap-like metal parts which contact {{the outside of the}} plug lose their tension and fail to make contact so that power does not reach the computer. The [...] "official" [...] solution is to replace the connector on the motherboard, which requires partial dis-assembly of the computer and desoldering a part with several pins; many companies charge a considerable sum for the work involved. Various simple alternatives have been suggested; for example a thin [...] "skin" [...] of solder {{on the outside of the}} barrel of the connector on the PSU (with care not to overheat the connector's plastic parts; and this thickened connector should not be used with other, not faulty Dell laptops, as it will stretch the springs and damage or even overheat the plug and <b>socket</b> <b>assembly,</b> causing them to melt or bond permanently).|$|E

5000|$|While in {{automotive}} parlance {{the term}} [...] "ball joint" [...] usually {{refers to the}} primary ball joint connections {{at the ends of}} the control arms, this type of joint is used in other parts as well, including tie rod ends. In these other applications, they are typically called tie rod ends or, when they are an inner tie rod end on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner <b>socket</b> <b>assemblies.</b> These joints are also used {{in a number of other}} non-automotive applications, from the joints of dolls to other mechanical linkages for a variety of devices, or any place where a degree of rotation in movement is desired.|$|R
50|$|Forge work {{depended}} on a declining {{supply of coal}} and wood which idled the plant in 1783. In 1794, Christopher Johnston purchased the property and sold the equipment from the slitting mill to George Elliott for his upstream mill in 1807. The property was auctioned on September 16, 1819, renovated by the Carroll and Oliver families and resold in 1822. A large distillery operation was put into operation by John McKim Jr. which ceased by 1833 when the Thomas Viaduct construction began. The mill continued in operation by George T Worthington until a fire in 1856. In 1868, a major flood damaged the four-story mill. The Levering family acquired the site and sold it in 1876 to the Viaduct Manufacturing Company. A street through the site is now named Levering Avenue. From 1906-1910, a 20-by-30-foot room was rented to Marion B. Davis, who manufactured brass screw threads and <b>socket</b> <b>assemblies</b> for automobiles delivered by horse and carriage. The Viaduct Company produced telegraph equipment onsite until it was abandoned in 1914.|$|R

40|$|Integrated Circuit (IC) sockets provide {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of electrical interconnects in enterprise servers, where quality and reliability are critical for customer applications. The evaluation of IC sockets, according to current industry practices, relies on the execution of stress loads and stress levels that are defined by standards, having no consideration to the physics of failure (PoF), target operating environment, or contact resistance behavior over time. In a similar manner, monitoring of contact resistance during system operation has no considerations to the PoF or environmental conditions. In this dissertation a physics of failure approach was developed, to model the reliability of elastomer sockets {{that are used in}} an enterprise server application. The temperature and relative humidity environment, at the IC socket contact interface, were characterized as a function of external environmental conditions and microprocessor activity.

40|$|A {{probe and}} <b>socket</b> <b>assembly</b> for {{serving as a}} {{mechanical}} interface between structures is presented. The assembly comprises a socket having a housing adapted for connection to a first supporting structure and a probe which is readily connectable to a second structure and {{is designed to be}} easily grappled and manipulated by a robotic device for insertion and coupling with the socket. Cooperable automatic locking means are provided on the probe shaft and socket housing for automatically locking the probe in the socket when the probe is inserted a predetermined distance. A second cooperable locking means on the probe shaft and housing are adapted for actuation after the probe has been inserted the predetermined distance. Actuation means mounted on the probe and responsive to the grip of the probe handle by a gripping device, such as a robot for conditioning the probe for insertion and are also responsive to release of the grip of the probe handle to actuate the second locking means to provide a hard lock of the probe in the socket...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{an instrument for}} measuring the range of angular displacement associated with two human body portions connected to a common joint. The instrument includes two pivotally connected, elongate rods, and separate supports for supporting each of the rods on a respective one of the body portions in spaced relationship with the body portion. Each of the supports includes a pair of ball and socket assemblies which are mounted on the respective body portions in spaced relation to one another. The ball of each ball and <b>socket</b> <b>assembly</b> has an aperture formed therethrough for receiving the associated elongate rod. Such a support arrangement enables the body portions to be rotated about the common joint without affecting the natural movements of the body portions. An encoder is utilized to pivotally connect the two elongate rods and to generate an electrical output signal representing the relative angular position between the two rods. A counter and display circuit is responsive to the encoder output signal for determining the change in angular position between the two rods and displaying this value in terms of angular degrees...|$|E
40|$|Variability in {{composite}} {{manufacture and}} the limitations in positional accuracy of common industrial robots have hampered automation of assembly tasks within aircraft manufacturing. One {{way to handle}} geometry variations and robot compliancy is to use force control. Force control technology utilizes a sensor mounted on the robot to feedback force data to the controller system so instead of being position driven, i. e. programmed to achieve a certain position with the tool, the robot can be programmed to achieve a certain force. This paper presents an experimental case where a compliant rib is aligned to multiple surfaces using force feedback and an industrial robot system from ABB. Two types of ribs where used, one full size carbon fiber rib, and one smaller metal replica for evaluation purposes. The alignment sequence consisted of several iterative steps and a search procedure was implemented within the robot control system. The technology {{has the potential to}} lessen the need for dedicated tooling, reduce the need for traditional workspace calibration and can be used in several other applications, such as pin and <b>socket</b> type <b>assemblies</b> found in pylons or landing gear or 'part to part' assemblies such as leading edge ribs to spar...|$|R

In this tecforum, we will present interconnect analysis and modeling techniques in both time (TDR/T) and frequency (VNA) domains. We will discuss the importance of integrated simulate-and-compare link between SPICE/IBIS simulators and measurements, which allows the designer to quickly extract and validate gigabit interconnect models, and to predict eye-diagram degradation, jitter, losses, crosstalk, reflections and ringing in PCBs and flexboards, packages, <b>sockets,</b> connectors, cable <b>assemblies,</b> and at the input die capacitance.

40|$|Dust boot is {{the part}} which {{prevents}} entering the foreign bodies (such as water, dust etc.) in to the tie rod ends. Dust boot can lose its elasticity according to working condition. The boot fails and contaminants, resulting in corrosion and wear and causing excessive deflection in the <b>socket</b> <b>assembly,</b> loose steering and alignment to angle changes. Increasing trends in the problems of difficulty in control on the road curve, and skid due to the looseness in the connecting points to the steering system can be seen. In this study physical tests are applied to the dust boot. These are; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesion resistance, internal diameter,external diameter and outer diameter. In the period of aging tests, following tests are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Soft PVC and neoprene materials are used in dust boot and it is applied according to the criteria of ASTM and DIN {{in order to preserve}} tie rod ends from outer factors in a long time. Physical properties and aging values are compared...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the integration of}} the robotic assembly workcell and the capability of the AdeptOne SCARA robot in performing both non-vision and vision based conveyor tracking. An experiment is set up for a Plastic Leadless Chip Carrier, or PLCC, chip and <b>socket</b> <b>assembly</b> operation. A PLCC chip is a square-shape integrated circuit that has its pins bent down around its perimeter to prevent damage to the pins during assembly and transportation. Binary image processing is employed by the vision system to recognize the random locations of incoming PLCC chips at the upstream location of the conveyor. When at least one PLCC chip is identified, the robot will acquire the chip using a special designed end effector and will wait until a printed circuit board passes the sensor at the downstream location of the conveyor. The robot will then insert the PLCC chip into the PLCC socket on the moving circuit board which is transported into the robot 2 ̆ 7 s work envelope by the conveyor. The circuit board is fixed on the conveyor belt. The entire operation is conducted without any interruption of the conveyor 2 ̆ 7 s motion. This thesis covers the design of the robot workcell and the end effector that accomplishes the assembly task and the results of non-vision and vision conveyor tracking during PLCC assembly using the Adept robot system...|$|E

A methodology was developed for modeling and monitoring contact resistance of electrical interconnects. The technique combined a PoF model with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). In the methodology the resistance behavior is characterized as a function of temperature. The effective a-spot radius was extracted from the characterization data and modeled with a power-law. A PoF model was developed to estimate the resistance of an elastomer contact, based on the effective a-spot radius and the ambient temperature. The methodology was experimentally demonstrated with a temperature cycle test of the elastomer socket. During the evaluation the difference between estimated and observed resistance values were tested with the SPRT. The technique was shown to be very accurate for modeling contact resistance and to be highly sensitive for the detection of resistance degradation. A qualitative reliability model was developed for the mean contact resistance of an elastomer socket, using fundamental material properties and user defined failure criteria. To derive the model, the resistance behavior of contacts under nominal mechanical load was studied as a function of time and temperature. The elastomer contact was shown to have a very complex resistance behavior, which was modeled by multiple statistical distributions. It was shown that elastomer sockets, in spite of experiencing stress relaxation at the macroscale (elastomer), can exhibit decreases in contact resistance, a result of stress redistribution at the microscale (Ag particles), which increases Ag-Ag particle stress and the effective contact area...|$|E
