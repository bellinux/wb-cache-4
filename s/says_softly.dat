500|$|Lyrically, Madonna compares rain with {{feelings}} of love. Just as rain washes away dirt, love washes clean the sorrows of the past, leaving a person and their lover to focus on their feelings of the present moment. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post described [...] "Rain" [...] as [...] "an optimistic Peter Gabriel-like ballad in which water {{is a metaphor for}} love ('Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain')." [...] According to Stephen Sears from music website Idolator, [...] "the synths turbo-charge at 2:46 into a sleek middle eight that features dueling Madonnas reciting lines of poetry out of the left and right channels [...] 'By sheer force of will / I'll raise you from the ground', she <b>says</b> <b>softly,</b> 'And without a sound, you'll appear and surrender to me, to love'." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought lyrically the ballads on Erotica to be primarily concerned with sex, saying that some might even view [...] "Rain" [...] as an extended metaphor for ejaculation, though he didn't subscribe to that knee-jerk interpretation.|$|E

That Mr. Stafford couldn’t stand; so he cleared out like a scared stag, and there he was, chucked into the streets, so to speak. Cloete looked so savage as he went to and fro that he hadn’t the spunk to tackle him; but George seemed a softer kind to his eye. He would have been glad of half a quid, anything. [...] . I’ve had misfortunes, he <b>says</b> <b>softly,</b> in his demure way, which frightens George more than a row would have done. [...] . Consider the severity of my disappointment, he says. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought he}} had been gone indeed, and so {{that he had been}} in jest; and, by the way, thought either he had no mind to the thing, or that he never {{intended}} it; so I shut my door--that is, latched it, for I seldom locked or bolted it--and went to bed. I had not been in bed a minute but he comes in his gown to the door and opens it a little way, but not enough to come in or look in, and <b>says</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "What! are you really gone to bed?" [...] "Yes, yes," [...] says I; [...] "get you gone." [...] "No, indeed," [...] says he, [...] "I shall not be gone; you gave me leave before to come to bed, and you shan't say 'Get you gone' now." [...] So he comes into my room, and then turns about and fastens the door, and immediately comes to the bedside to me. I pretended to scold and struggle, and bid him begone with more warmth than before; but it was all one; he had not a rag of clothes on but his gown and slippers and shirt, so he throws off his gown, and throws open the bed, and came in at once.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{how can the}} {{prevalent}} offence be house-breaking {{in a place like}} this?" [...] "Easily enough. When you've seen a little of the city you'll see. Natives sleep and lie about all over the place, and whole quarters are just so many rabbit-warrens. Wait till you see the Machua Bazar. Well, besides the petty theft and burglary, we have heavy cases of forgery and fraud, that leave us with our wits pitted against a Bengali's. When a Bengali criminal is working a fraud of the sort he loves, he is about the cleverest soul you could wish for. He gives us cases a year long to unravel. Then there are the murders in the low houses--very curious things they are. You'll see the house where Sheikh Babu was murdered presently, and you'll understand. The Burra Bazar and Jora Bagan sections are the two worst ones for heavy cases; but Colootollah is the most aggravating. There's Colootollah over yonder--that patch of darkness beyond the lights. That section is full of tuppenny-ha'penny petty cases, that keep the men up all night and make 'em swear. You'll see Colootollah, and then perhaps you'll understand. Bamun Bustee is the quietest of all, and Lal Bazar and Bow Bazar, as you can see for yourself, are the rowdiest. You've no notion what the natives come to the police station for. A man will come on and want a summons against his master for refusing him half-an-hour's leave. I suppose it does seem rather revolutionary to an up-country man, but they try to do it here. Now wait a minute, before we go down into the city and see the Fire Brigade turned out. Business is slack with them just now, but you time 'em and see." [...] An order is given, and a bell strikes softly thrice. There is a rush of men, the click of a bolt, a red fire-engine, spitting and swearing with the sparks flying from the furnace, is dragged out of its shelter. A huge brake, which holds supplementary horses, men, and hatchets, follows, and a hose-cart is the third on the list. The men push the heavy things about as though they were pith toys. The men clamber up, some one <b>says</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "All ready there," [...] and with an angry whistle the fire-engine, followed by the other two, flies out into Lal Bazar. Time--1 min. 40 secs. [...] "They'll find out it's a false alarm, and come back again in five minutes." [...] "Why?" [...] "Because there will be no constables on the road to give 'em the direction of the fire, and because the driver wasn't told the ward of the outbreak when he went out!" [...] "Do you mean to say that you can from this absurd pigeon-loft locate the wards in the night-time?" [...] "What would be the good of a look-out if the man couldn't tell where the fire was?" [...] "But it's all pitchy black, and the lights are so confusing." ...|$|E

Big Bird, trying to find the words to thank her, says that he doesn't even know her name. [...] "Kaguya-hime," [...] their guide <b>says</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As if {{anticipating the}} 21st century debates and disappointments once O'Brian's past was exposed, Horowitz interviewed O'Brian {{at his home}} in France in 1994: [...] "Until recently, he refused all interviews. Those authors we know the least about, he says, are the ones we get in their purest form, like Homer. In The Truelove, Stephen warns would-be interviewers that [...] "question and answer is not a civilized form of conversation."

6000|$|But {{the heart}} that was fullest beat and fluttered in Rose's bosom {{as she went}} about putting spring flowers everywhere; very silent, but so radiant with {{happiness}} that the aunts watched her, <b>saying</b> <b>softly</b> to one another, [...] "Could an angel look sweeter?" ...|$|R

Sam tells Adams, [...] "they run out of lead pencils… I managed to wangle my way back into the Army".

6000|$|And {{each day}} she taught the young birds sweet songs, and as their gay music rang {{through the old}} forest, the stern, dark pines ceased their solemn waving, that they might hear the soft sounds {{stealing}} through the dim wood-paths, and mortal children came to listen, <b>saying</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "Hear the flowers sing, and touch them not, for the Fairies are here." ...|$|R
