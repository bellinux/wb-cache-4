5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified <b>sampling.</b> Conversely, the impossibility of random <b>sampling</b> sometimes necessitates nonprobability <b>sampling,</b> such as convenience <b>sampling</b> or snowball <b>sampling.</b>|$|E

In SD interfaces, where there is only one datastream, the 0th <b>sample</b> is a Cb sample; the 1st <b>sample</b> a Y <b>sample,</b> the 2nd <b>sample</b> a Cr <b>sample,</b> and the third <b>sample</b> is the Y' sample; the pattern repeats from there. In HD interfaces, each datastream has its own <b>sample</b> numbering—so the 0th <b>sample</b> of the Y datastream is the Y <b>sample,</b> the next <b>sample</b> the Y' <b>sample,</b> etc. Likewise, the first <b>sample</b> in the C datastream is Cb, followed by Cr, followed by Cb again.|$|R
