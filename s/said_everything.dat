She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> is fine.|$|E

I was looking at Kevin Spacey thinking, 'this guy's {{getting a lot of}} stuff done'." [...] The evening before the season was posted, someone responsible for the @BarackObama Twitter account (which is run by Organizing for Action) tweeted a request that no spoilers be posted online. Since the season debuted on Valentine's Day, The New York Observer created themed cards in honor of the series with quotes such as [...] "A great man once <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power" [...] (an Oscar Wilde quote Underwood had stated during season 1).|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of their first DVD, [...] (September 2004), and the {{compilation}} album [...] (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005. The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour, followed {{the release of}} Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Powderfinger were involved in philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families. One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia, and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. In April 2010 Powderfinger announced {{that they would be}} breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour, declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> they wanted to say. On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment. In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and the band published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band.|$|E

500|$|Tyutcheva {{took her}} book to {{other members of}} the family. Nicholas's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote in her diary on 15 March 1910 that she could not {{understand}} the family's regard for Rasputin as [...] "almost a saint" [...] when she viewed him as only a [...] "khlyst". Tyutcheva told Grand Duchess Xenia that the starets visited when Olga and Tatiana were getting ready for bed and sat there talking with them and [...] "caressing" [...] them. The girls hid his presence from their governess and were afraid {{to talk to her about}} Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The empress refused to believe her, Vishnyakova told investigators, and <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but [...] "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." [...] Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq titled The Way I See It as a {{declaration}} to music listeners {{about how his}} perspective was more informed by classic soul than before in his career: [...] "This is what I really love, and everything you’ve heard from me before {{has been based on}} the roots of this music." [...] The cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, in which Saadiq performed Marvin Gaye's 1965 song [...] "Ain't That Peculiar". It showed Saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit, tie, and thick-rimmed glasses: a look similar to that of Temptations singer David Ruffin. According to Saadiq, the photo [...] "set the tone for the whole album ... me singing that song, me wearing that suit, it <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> that this album should be." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot believed the cover [...] "evokes the dramatic portraits and color schemes of old-school jazz and soul albums. Think Ray Charles on Atlantic, Sonny Rollins on Blue Note, Sam and Dave on Stax ... With arms raised, he looks like he's testifying as much as singing." [...] The rest of the album's packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson-tinted cover's font and 1960s Columbia Records logo. The packaging's photography was taken by Norman Seeff.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E

For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule [...] "not complete", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these books, Yeats, a magisterial {{examination}} of the poet, challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out {{the basic principles of}} his new approach to criticism: [...] "Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle." [...] A new poet becomes inspired to write because he has read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poet discovers that these poets whom he idolized have already <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> he wishes to say. The poet becomes disappointed because he [...] "cannot be Adam early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 27 January 1979, Geoffrey Boycott and Brearley {{walked out}} to bat at the Adelaide Oval for the fifth Test, having been put in by Australia. The {{tourists}} were routed for 169 all out with Taylor only making four runs. He partnered with Botham to take two catches as Australia were, in return, routed for 164. England, needing to set a commanding total, reached 267/7 when Taylor {{walked out to}} bat with his fellow Derbyshire colleague Miller. Miller went on to make 64 before he was dismissed and John Emburey came to the crease, however by the Time Taylor was sent back England had reached 336/8, Taylor having scored 97 runs from 300 balls. He passed his previous Test best of 45, and with his 97th run he both equalled his first-class best and reached 9,500 first-class runs. His dismissal was to a [...] "tiny leg-side tickle" [...] though, despite being three from a hundred, he chose to walk off the field. John Thicknesse in 2004 wrote that [...] "it <b>said</b> <b>everything</b> about his sportsmanship." [...] Though Taylor took no catches in the final innings, Willis and Mike Hendrick combined to reduce Australia to 160 all out and give England victory. Taylor made 36 in the final Test match, three catches and a stumping as England took a convincing nine-wicket victory to seal the series. Taylor's 208 runs at 26.00 outscored captain Brearley, and he ended the Test series with 18 catches and two stumpings.|$|E
