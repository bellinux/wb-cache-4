5|$|Moving back to 1919, {{the elderly}} Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places {{the music box}} near her tombstone. He stands in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment and then turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem {{lying on the ground}} with Christine's {{engagement}} ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Shankly's death, {{training}} was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield. The Labour Party conference stood in a minute's <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man who {{had always been a}} socialist. Sir Matt Busby, the former Manchester United manager, was so upset that he refused to take any telephone calls from people asking him for a reaction. Tributes poured in from the world of football, especially from the former players of all Shankly's clubs. Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting: [...] "In my opinion, he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century".|$|E
500|$|... "Cry" [...] was {{promoted}} by a music video, or [...] "short film," [...] as Jackson would refer to it. The video {{was directed by}} Nicholas Brandt, who had previously directed [...] "Earth Song" [...] (1995), [...] "Childhood" [...] (1995) and [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] (1996), {{all of which were}} featured on Jackson's [...] album. The video was filmed in six different locations, all were filmed in California. People featured in the video included members of a real life gospel group. The video begins with dozens of people of different ages, ethnicities and races holding hands. Long lines of people were stretched over mountains, across highways, in a forest and on the beach. Everyone stands in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> majority of the video. Following the bridge, everyone begins singing the chorus. Towards the final chorus, the group collectively clap their hands along with the song, taking hands once more as the song ends.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: [...] "No doubt {{you think you}} are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very {{inferior}} fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine". Alluding to an episode in [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of an hour, [...] Holmes remarks: [...] "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in [...] "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".|$|E
2500|$|As the 1960s loomed the Majestic {{began to}} {{establish}} {{itself as the}} place to see art house and foreign films, with mainstream fare rounding out their bookings. After police heard complaints about a movie trailer that showed [...] "objectionable" [...] material, the Majestic previewed Ingmar Bergman's The <b>Silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> group headed by the Madison chief of police, but they declined to censor the film. In 1965, the Majestic finished a 14-week run of My Fair Lady, the longest run for any film in a Madison theater at that time. But as social mores and attitudes began to change during the late 1960s, RKO-Stanley-Warner began booking soft-core [...] "skin flicks" [...] that were light on art and heavy on nudity. When criticized for doing so, manager Finkler replied that the local audience for family movies had dried up.|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
60|$|Arlington said nothing, {{not from}} injured pride, {{but because he}} was {{thinking}} hard for something to say. Eleanor mistook his <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> assumption of tolerant superiority, and her anger prompted her to a further gibe.|$|R
60|$|With one accord, {{and without}} a word passing between them, they left the {{neighborhood}} of the cottage hurriedly; then stopped on a sudden, and attentively looked {{each other in the}} face--looked in <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. Trudaine spoke first.|$|R
6000|$|... [Mrs Warren, <b>silenced</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, looks forlornly at Vivie, who waits, {{secretly}} {{hoping that}} the combat is over. But the cunning expression comes back into Mrs Warren's face; and she bends across the table, sly and urgent, half whispering.] ...|$|R

6000|$|The major was <b>silenced</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. [...] "I congratulate you, Count," [...] he said. [...] "Monsieur le Marechal {{shall have}} your views without delay.

60|$|Finally he {{sat down}} in the little arm-chair between her and the {{cupboard}} where she was accustomed to hang up her clothes, stuck out his legs very stiffly across the room, and despaired of his family in an obtrusive and impregnable <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> enormous time.|$|R

6000|$|There was a {{long pause}} in the conversation, <b>a</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, during which the girl went {{in and out of the}} room and settled herself down at her work.

6000|$|Yes. It was a relief. He was <b>silenced</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time--for a time. I {{could not}} have stood another peal of that insane screeching. I was sure of it; and just then Gambril, the austere Gambril, treated us to another vocal performance. He began to sing out for relief. His voice wailed pitifully in the darkness: [...] "Come aft somebody! I can't stand this. Here she'll be off again {{directly}} and I can't. [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{stiffness}} {{had gone}} from my brain and fingers. My pen flew over the paper. The joy of creation sang once more in my heart, tingled in all my pulses.

60|$|The shower {{passed as}} quickly as it had gathered, and the band which it had <b>silenced</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment burst forth again in the music which fills the Carlsbad day from dawn till dusk.
