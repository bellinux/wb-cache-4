5000|$|A {{secondary}} effect of early agriculture {{during the years}} of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s was when homesteaders abandoned the unproductive land (Olsen 1997). The United States government bought up much of this land through the Land Utilization Program, with management eventually controlled by the United States Forest service and the Bureau of Land Management (Wooten 1965; Olsen 1997). During the drought years of the 1930s, these agencies re-vegetated some of these areas with non-native highly competitive vegetation such as <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) (USDA- US Forest service 2001). These plants served their purpose by re-vegetating and protecting the soil. But these invaders became great competitors and directly affected native vegetation. In some instances crested wheatgrass and <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> have forced out native vegetation, creating monoculture habitats. Monoculture habitats are not favored by sharp-tailed grouse, as they prefer sites with high heterogeneity.

This study, conducted from 1988 - 91 at Mead, Nebraska, and from 1989 - 91 at Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, consisted of 3 components. The first component measured changes in <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> tiller density and biomass and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) flower culm density in mixed stands following spring burns. Burning was timed to coincide with four <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> growth stages and included repeated burns in consecutive years.

Burning early, at tiller emergence, had no effect on <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> in years when precipitation was normal or below normal. However, with above normal precipitation, biomass more than doubled after an early burn. Repeated burns, at the time of tiller elongation and later stages, maintained low tiller density and biomass. A single burn, however, allowed full to partial recovery. The greatest increase in big bluestem flower culm density was coincident with the greatest decrease in <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> tiller density. ^ A second component of the study compared differences in the microenvironment between sites dominated by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> and those dominated by big bluestem following early spring burning.

40|$|Exotic plant invasions {{represent}} a significant {{threat to the}} integrity of native grasslands. Across the Northern Great Plains, grasslands invaded by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss) support lower plant diversity, potentially resulting in important consequences for ecosystem function. Previous research on <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> has primarily focused on aboveground changes in plant communities, but there is growing evidence that the soil ecosystem can be significantly altered with invasion. The two objectives of this thesis were to examine whether <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> invasion alters soil nitrogen cycling, and to determine if changes in plant community diversity or productivity influence soil bacterial communities. Relationships between <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> and the soil ecosystem were assessed using data collected from a Festuca hallii Vasey (Piper) (plains rough fescue) grassland located near Macrorie, SK. Gross rates of nitrogen cycling and community productivity from <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> invaded and native grassland sites were compared to determine the potential influence of <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> invasion on the soil nitrogen cycle. The relationship between increasing <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> abundance and soil bacterial structure and composition was also studied. Gross mineralization rates and total soil nitrogen were significantly higher in smooth brome-invaded areas relative to native grassland. Bacterial and archaeal amoA, used as indicators of ammonia-oxidizer population sizes, were altered by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> cover. Higher gross mineralization rates were likely due to stimulated microbial activity caused by increased litter and root production in areas invaded by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome.</b> <b>Smooth</b> <b>brome</b> decreased plant species richness through increased litter production, but had the opposite effect on bacterial communities. Bacterial communities had higher species richness and evenness in soils invaded by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome,</b> and <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> invasion was also associated with bacteria important for soil nitrogen cycling. As bacteria dominate microbial biomass and are important for decomposition processes, a more even bacterial community may have supported increased mineralization rates in smooth brome-invaded soils. Specifically, a more even bacterial community may have increased mineralization rates through greater resource utilization and niche partitioning. The responses observed in these studies suggest that belowground changes with <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> invasion have the potential to have important consequences for ecosystem processes...|$|E

Plots composed of a 1 : 1 ratio of <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> and switchgrass were located in a restored tallgrass prairie and were randomly assigned one of the following three N levels: (a) NH 4 NO 3 added to in-crease available N, (b) sucrose added to reduce available N, and (c) no additions to serve as control. In addition, soil N status, soil respiration rates, plant growth, and litter decomposition rates were mon-itored. Results indicate that by the 2 nd year, the addition of sucrose significantly reduced avail-able soil N and additions of NH 4 NO 3 increased it. Further, <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> had greater tiller density, mass, and canopy interception of light on N-en-riched soils, whereas none of these characteristics were stimulated by added N in the case of switch-grass. This suggests that <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> may have a competitive advantage on higher-N soils. Smooth-brome plant tissue also had a lower carbon–nitro-gen (C:N) ratio and a higher decomposition rate than switchgrass and thus may cycle N more rap-idly in the plant–soil system.

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{environmental}} impacts of exo-tic organisms have refocused attention {{on the ability of}} diverse communities to resist biological invaders. Although resource availability, often related to nat-ural and anthropogenic disturbances, appears central to the invasibility of biological communities, under-standing the links between resources, diversity and invasibility is often confounded by the covariance among key variables. To test the hypothesis that community invasibility remains contingent on the type and intensity of disturbance and their impacts on plant community diversity and resource availability, we designed an experiment testing the invasibility of northern fescue prairies by <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss.), a Eurasian perennial grass, threaten-ing the structure and function of prairie remnants throughout the Great Plains. Using soil disturbances and herbicide, we imposed treatments manipulating the diversity and resource availability of native prairies. Our observations demonstrate that the vulnerability of native prairies to exotic plant inva-sions remains contingent on resources. While the establishment of <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> seedlings increased with increasing disturbance, its impact depended on the availability of soil nitrogen. As a result, soil burial treatments, simulating disturbance by northern pocket gophers, provided poor recruitment areas for <b>smooth</b> <b>brome,</b> and their low levels of soil moisture and nitrogen, combined with the rapid recovery of the prairie community, compromised seedling establish-ment. Emphasizing the covariance of diversity and key environmental variables following disturbance, our findings illustrate the importance of disturbance type and intensity on community invasibility. Such a consideration is critical in the conservation and restoration of native prairie remnants throughout th...|$|E

30|$|Seed mixes were {{rudimentary}} {{and much}} less diverse in 1977. The emphasis was on commercially available seed and quick-establishing plants with little understanding or regard to inter- and intraspecific species competition. Ecological diversity, longevity and wildlife habitat value were often secondary considerations. Species such as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) and <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis) (often used for pasture grass) were commonly used in reclamation but are now considered invasive and thus undesirable. Commonly seeded legumes were also agriculturally-based, i.e., alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis).|$|E
40|$|Windbreaks are an {{integral}} part of many farms and ranches and provide critical protection for farmsteads, livestock and crops. Unfortunately, many windbreaks planted in the 1930 s and 1940 s are losing their effectiveness due to age, poor health or neglect. In some cases, the windbreak no longer has the necessary density to provide winter protection. In other cases, overcrowding may have reduced the health and vigor of the windbreak, or the windbreak may have been invaded by aggressive sod-forming grasses such as <b>smooth</b> <b>brome,</b> reducing tree growth. Whatever the reason, many older windbreaks need renovation...|$|E
40|$|Uses Grazing/pastureland/hayland: This is an {{introduced}} species used for hay and pasture {{in the northern}} Great Plains, west to eastern Washington, and south into Colorado and Kansas. It produces good hay yields, both individually and with alfalfa (Medicago spp.), where stiff stems tend to keep alfalfa from lodging. Intermediate wheatgrass has fairly slow re-growth following clipping and is best adapted to single crop-haying situations. Intermediate wheatgrass responds very well to irrigation with production nearing the level of 'Regar ' meadow brome (Bromus biebiersteinii) and orchardgrass and exceeding <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis) under full irrigation.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} evaluated {{methods of}} reducing costs of finished beef. The first experiment, used lambs {{as a model}} for cattle. A dry rolled corn diet served as a control and two byproduct diets: 1) corn gluten feed; or 2) gluten feed plus wheat midds, were supplemented with three levels of tallow. Byproduct diets gave feed efficiencies nearly equal to corn and efficiencies increased with tallow supplementation. In the second experiment, 128 steers were used in grazing systems including <b>smooth</b> <b>brome,</b> warm-season grasses, oats and cornstalks and finished on corn or byproduct diets.

40|$|A daily {{time step}} model {{simulating}} growth {{and quality of}} cool season grasses was developed and validated for <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss.) under varying environmental and management conditions. Growth predictions are based upon genetic potential, environmental temperature, leaf area, soil moisture, and nitrogen fertilization rate. Daily potential growth rate is a composite of two functions—one relating grass species maximum growth rate to minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for plant growth, and another relating daily minimum and maximum air temperatures to time. Multipliers are developed for available leaf area, moisture, and nitrogen, and the minimum of these values modifies the daily potential growth rate to determine daily plant production. Change in sward dry matter digestibility (DMD) {{is a function of}} forage material present, daily forage growth, and environmental temperature. For dry matter (DM) production, the relationship between model (Y) and observed (X) estimates (kilograms of dry matter per hectare) yielded the regression equation: Y = 218 + 0. 94 X; SE = 431; R 2 = 0. 98. The relationship between model (Y) and observed (X) estimates of DMD (%) gave the regression equation: Y = 2. 24 + 0. 97 X; SE = 1. 78; R 2 = 0. 90. The above validation shows that the mathematical logic contained within the plant model accurately predicted <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> production and changes in forage quality. Intercept and slope values were similar to 0. 0 and 1. 0, respectively, and standard error values were similar to observed experiments...|$|E
40|$|Perennial grass {{establishment}} on abandoned cropland in the Nebraska Sandhills difficult due to low soil fertility, organic matter, {{and water}} holding capacity and high potential erodibility. Establishment is further complicated by unpredictable precipitation and weed competition. Two warm-season grasses: sand bluestem [Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus (Nash) Fern. ] and switchgrass (Panicam virgatum L.); and 2 cool-season grasses: <b>smooth</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and intermediate wheat-grass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkw. 2 ̆ 6 D. R. Dewey subsp. were evaluated with spring-seeded field trials. Seedbed preparation [untilled, disced, and dead oat (Avena sativa L.) cover (DOC) ] effect on seeded grass and nonseeded species densities was evaluated in 1985 and 1986 at 2 locations on Valentine sands (Aquic Ustipsamment). In 1985 1 site was irrigated. Both sites were dryland in 1986. Stand failure (3 ̆c 5 seedlings/m 2) occurred on the dryland rite in 1985 due to low, erratic precipitation. Stands evaluated in June 1986 on plots established with irrigation in 1985 had 38, 46, and 61 plants/m 2 for the untilled, disced, and DOC seedbeds, respectively. The disced or DOC seedbeds were required for successful (3 ̆e plants/m 2) dryland seedings in 1986 at both locations. Irrigation the establishment year minimized risk of stand failure and allowed the use of my seedbed preparation or grass species studied. Sand bluestem was the only species to establish both years. However, if a dryland seedling of a cool-season species is desired, intermediate wheatgrass appeared more adapted than <b>smooth</b> <b>brome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{expanding}} eastern red cedar (Juniperus viginiana) populations have altered prairie and grassland ecosystems in the Great Plains, causing a reduction in livestock grazing capacity. This study {{examined the effects of}} eastern red cedar removal on cattle forage coverage located on private property in northeastern Nebraska. An analysis of collected field data obtained using a line intercept method in a control and an experimental plot was performed on Elymus canadensis (Canada wild rye), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), and Bromus inermis (<b>smooth</b> <b>brome),</b> three common grassland species that serve as forage for cattle. Results show Canada wild rye responded negatively to the eastern red cedar removal, with a coverage declining from 58 cm in 2012 to 0 cm in 2014. Kentucky bluegrass initially responded negatively, declining from 1161 cm in 2012 to 217 cm in 2013, but responded positively in 2014, increasing to 414 cm. <b>Smooth</b> <b>brome</b> also experienced a similar response to cedar removal, declining from 736 cm in 2012 to 42 cm in 2013, but increasing to 234 cm in 2014. Statistical variances were not analyzed, which would help determine the magnitude of the effects the removal had on forage species, if any. Further data collection and analysis are needed to more accurately determine whether or not forage coverage will continue to increase and exceed the initial coverage recordings in 2012 with the Eastern red cedar present and provide an economic return for the ranchers...|$|E
