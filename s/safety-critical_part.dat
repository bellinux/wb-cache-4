50|$|Automatic {{train control}} (ATC) {{is a general}} class of train {{protection}} systems for railways that involves a speed control mechanism in response to external inputs. ATC systems tend to integrate various cab signalling technologies and they use more granular deceleration patterns {{in lieu of the}} rigid stops encountered with the older automatic train stop technology. ATC can also be used with automatic train operation (ATO) and is usually considered to be the <b>safety-critical</b> <b>part</b> of the system.|$|E

With the introduction of an Automatic train operation (ATO) system supplied by Alstom in 2002 the said TBL system now functions as the <b>safety-critical</b> <b>part</b> of the said ATO system, and also serves as a fallback in case the ATO system fails or is not available.|$|E

If the top crown sheet of the inner firebox was made flat, so as to maintain a constant water depth above it, this required complex and expensive girder stays to support it. These stays were also a <b>safety-critical</b> <b>part</b> of the boiler and many past boiler explosions had been caused by their failure. This was especially so for boilers that {{were likely to be}} used at all carelessly, or by crews who were less skilled or well-trained.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{division}} of polymers into thermoplastics, elastomers and thermosets helps define their areas of application. The latter group of materials includes phenolic resins, polyesters and epoxy resins, {{all of which}} are used widely in composite materials when reinforced with stiff fibres such as fibreglass and aramids. Since crosslinking stabilises the thermoset polymer matrix of these materials, they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like steel. However, their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures. In addition, they suffer less from fatigue, so are ideal for <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> which are stressed regularly in service.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Code to {{estimate}} position and attitude of a spacecraft or aircraft {{belongs to the}} most <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> of ¤ight software. The complex underlying mathematics and abundance of design details make it error-prone and reliable implementations costly. AutoFilter is a program synthesis tool for the automatic generation of state estimation code from compact speci£cations. It can automatically produce additional safety certi£cates which formally guarantee that each generated program individually satis£es a set of important safety policies. These safety policies (e. g., array-bounds, variable initialization) form a core of properties which are essential for high-assurance software. Here we describe the AutoFilter system and its certi£cate generator and compare our approach to the static analysis tool PolySpace. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContinuous {{increase}} in flight passengers alongside {{with a high}} demand for fuel efficiency {{has led to the}} development of Geared Turbo Fans (GTF). Being a <b>safety-critical</b> <b>part,</b> the gearbox faces strong safety requirements that also account for sophisticated manufacturing processes and monitoring systems. One major issue is tool wear and the threat of tool breakage during the hobbing process. Due to the high costs of both the raw material and the tool, wear induced tool breakage is a major cost driver. Common practice today is to use each tool for a designated time, but in-situ online wear assessment would result in a major reduction of costs. Tool wear of hobs is not spread equally across all cutting edges; hence the assignment of tool wear to each blade would enable a monitoring system to analyze the individual tool life and predict its operational capability. This research paper discusses the general feasibility of a blade-oriented monitoring system for gear hobbing processes. A correlation between tool wear and effective power is found and analyzed. It can be shown that the respective position of the tool wear changes the effective power signal significantly. These findings enable further research on an online, model based and position-oriented tool wear monitoring system...|$|E
40|$|The CERN Detector Safety System (DSS) {{has been}} {{developed}} to monitor {{the state of the}} LHC detectors and protect their components against emergency situations which other less reliable systems could possibly fail to handle, or which were not covered by any other system. The DSS consists of two main components: a PLC-based Front-End and a supervisor Back-End. The two parts communicate via the OPC mechanism. The Front-End is the core of the DSS, to which all the runtime safety-critical actions are delegated. These are encoded in an "Alarm-Action Matrix", that {{can be seen as a}} set of user-defined rules relating the Input Channels (analogue and digital sensors) to the Output Channels (actuators, typically on/off interlock switches). One of the user requirements is the possibility of modifying these rules at any time, without stopping the system. New Input and Output Channels can also be incrementally added to the system without perturbing the previously existing part. To fulfil these requirements without detriment to the <b>safety-critical</b> <b>part,</b> the PLC software has been designed in a completely data-driven way. This approach allowed the PLC code to be kept as simple as possible and independent from the user-defined rules. The rules, as well as the parameterization for the Input and Outpu...|$|E

40|$|Aim of the {{workshop}} was to bring together people working on implementation of logic in the broadest sense, in order to exchange ideas and techniques. There were contributions from different branches of logic. The majority of contributions is about first order theorem proving, but there are papers about higher order logic and linear logic as well. The level of concreteness of the papers differs. Some of the papers describe concrete systems. Others discuss design dilemmas that reccur in many systems, or general techniques that can be reused in other systems. Implementation of logic {{is not only an}} academic exercise, but also a something that matters to the outside world. Interactive verification systems are gradually finding applications.

40|$|The {{technical}} {{importance of}} variable amplitude (spectrum) loading {{is not only}} given by obtaining much longer fatigue lives compared with those determined under constant amplitude loading with the maximum value of the spectrum. It also enables the lightweight potential resulting from proper consideration of the exceeding of the Woehler-lines (constant amplitude loading) by the Gassner-lines (variable amplitude loading) for a required duration. The degree of exceeding at the required service duration allows higher design stresses than under constant amplitude loading and is decisive in determining to what extent cross sections and hence weights can be reduced. However, the experimental determination of Gassner-lines is time and cost consuming, while their estimation by cumulative damage, i. e. fatigue life, calculations, is subject to underlying large uncertainties. Therefore, especially for <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts,</b> experimental verifications and service inspections are indispensable...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{nondestructive}} testing has important applications in, for example, {{the nuclear power}} and aerospace industries, where {{it is used to}} inspect <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> for flaws. For safe and reliable testing, mathematical models of the ultrasonic measurement systems are invaluable tools. In this thesis such measurement models are developed for the ultrasonic testing for defects located near non-planar surfaces. The applications in mind are the testing of nuclear power plant components such as thick-walled pipes with diameter transitions, pipe connections, etc. The models use solution methods based on frequency domain boundary integral equation methods, with a focus on analytical approaches for the defects and regularized boundary element methods for the non-planar surfaces. A major benefit of the solution methods is the ability to provide accurate results both for low, intermediate and high frequencies. The solution methods are incorporated into a framework of transmitting probe models based on prescribing the traction underneath the probe and receiving probe models based on electromechanical reciprocity. Time traces are obtained by applying inverse temporal Fourier transforms, and it is also shown how calibration and effects of material damping can be included in the models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the domain}} of safety-critical {{embedded}} and cyber-physical systems, software-based redundancy is generally understood as an effective and cheap approach to improve reliability. Especially redundant execution in terms of triple modular redundancy is a well-known solution. However, triple modular redundancy (TMR) leaves unprotected single points of failure (SPOFs), such as the voter, which have to be carefully considered in all safety considerations. We present Combined Redundancy (CoRed), a holistic approach that hardens <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> of a system against softerrors, while effectively eliminating the vulnerability caused by SPOFs. CoRed leverages redundant execution in combination with encoded processing to tackle the unprotected voting and data distribution. Its implementation does not require specific knowledge about the application and can be easily integrated into existing projects. We evaluated CoRed in a realistic setting using a quadrotor helicopter and provide experimental evidence for softerror resistance and comparable low resource demand. In our experimental comparison plain TMR left more than seven percent of failures undetected, whereas CoRed was able to eliminate all silent data corruptions while inducing an overhead of just seven percent.

50|$|Rubber {{products}} are often <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents {{or loss of}} function. Failed products can be examined {{with many of the}} generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is vulcanized or cross-linked. Attenuated total reflectance infra-red spectroscopy is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the selenium crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific elastomer used in a product. Often the best technique is ESEM using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides elemental analysis, it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of chlorine indicates polychloroprene while the presence of nitrogen indicates nitrile rubber. The method is also useful in confirming ozone cracking by the large amounts of oxygen present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber and polybutadiene and associated copolymers. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during ozonolysis.|$|R

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have reported results based on comparisons among data flow adequacy criteria. However, {{there is a}} lack of such comparisons between mutation and data flow. In the first part of this dissertation, we report experiments to compare the relative strength, cost, and fault detection effectiveness of mutation, its variants, and data flow based adequacy criteria. The results of these experiments can benefit a tester in selecting an adequacy criterion to construct and/or evaluate a test set under different time, budget, and criticality constraints. ^ In spite of the empirically demonstrated superiority of mutation over the path-oriented testing strategies in fault detection, it is not used in practice primarily because of its high operational cost. In the second part of this dissertation, we propose alternative mechanisms to improve the performance of mutation testing. Results from an empirical study to evaluate these mechanisms favor the use of mutation, for example, to test <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> of a software. ^ It is often impossible to run all test cases generated to satisfy a software 2 ̆ 7 s release criterion during regression testing. This inspired us to explore how regression testing can be conducted economically and effectively. In the third part of this dissertation, we examine the effect of test set minimization on the fault detection capability of data flow criteria. An answer to this question provides guidelines to a tester on how to select a representative subset of test cases from a test suite. ^ In the last part of this dissertation, we report on experiments that reveal that test cases selected based on a coverage criterion are more likely to reveal faults in programs than those generated randomly. These results support the use of partition testing as opposed to random testing for building and evaluating test sets. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>safety-critical</b> {{rotating}} <b>parts</b> {{of aircraft}} engines are mainly designed using experimental material data, based on standard specimens and procedures, while few {{data are available}} on the effect of manufacturing anomalies on fatigue life. In this context, the paper investigates the effects of different machining parameters on the high-temperature fatigue resistance of Inconel 718 superalloy specimens, cut from engine disk forgings, machined by turning on a vertical lathe. An unconventional specimen was designed in order to have the machining marks aligned with the fatigue loading axis, so to reproduce the hoop stresses in engine disks. For the test campaign, three machining parameters were chosen (depth of cut, cutting speed and insert wear) that typically may generate non-geometrical anomalies. A correlation has been found between the machining parameters, the residual stresses, the surface roughness, and the distorted and amorphous layer thicknesses. Correlations of such data with fatigue life are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive testing using {{ultrasound}} {{has important}} applications in e. g. {{the nuclear power}} and aerospace industries, where {{it is used to}} inspect <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> for flaws. For reliable inspections a proper adaptation to the specific testing situation is crucial, and in this process a mathematical model of nondestructive ultrasonic testing is a valuable tool. In this thesis a two-dimensional mathematical model of ultrasonic nondestructive testing for cracks near a non-planar surface is developed, with applications in the testing of thick-walled pipes with diameter transitions, pipe connections, etc. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the 2 D anti-plane wave scattering problem is considered. The solution method employed is based on reformulating the problem as two coupled boundary integral equations (BIE) : a displacement BIE for the back surface displacement and a traction BIE for the crack opening displacement. In order to avoid numerical integration of singular integrals a regularization approach is employed for the displacement BIE. The integral equations are subsequently solved simultaneously using a combination of a series expansion of the crack-opening displacement and a boundary element discretization of the back surface. The transmitting ultrasonic contact probe is modelled by prescribing the traction beneath it. To model the action of the receiving probe an electromechanical reciprocity relation is used. An inverse temporal Fourier transform is applied to obtain the time traces, and a few numerical examples are given to illustrate the model and the influence of the back surface. In the second part of the thesis the solution method developed in the first part for anti-plane wave scattering is adapted and applied to the in-plane wave scattering problem, featuring coupled P and SV waves. The action of the transmitting ultrasonic contact probe is modelled also for this case by prescribing the traction beneath the probe, but in order to realistically model both P and SV probes two different tractions are considered. The model also takes into account the influence of a couplant applied between the probe and component. The action of the receiving probe is again modelled using reciprocity. Finally, a few numerical examples are given...|$|R

40|$|The subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) and the BOP control system {{were the most}} important contributors to the Macondo accident in April 2010. A BOP is a large valve system used during the drilling phase; to seal, control, and monitor oil and gas wells. As a consequence of the Macondo accident, improved methods for reliability assessment of BOPs are now required. Over the years, several subsea BOP reliability studies have been performed, where technical solutions and potential failures are thoroughly investigated. As a result of the information gained, both maintenance and reliability of the BOP systems have improved. Despite overall improvements, the BOP is still a main contributor to risk and downtime in the drilling phase. A deeper look into the reliability reports reveals the control system of the BOP as the root of the majority of failures. Most subsea BOPs are equipped with a multiplex control system with a combination of electronics and hydraulics, used to operate the different functions of the BOP. Despite the high level of redundancy, several sections of the system are subject to critical system failures. To prevent BOP failures, national regulations and standards have been developed in several countries. Most of the national requirements are similar, but there are also differences. These similarities and differences are illustrated in this study through a detailed comparison between the relevant regulations and standards in Norway and the United States, with respect to general-, design- and operational BOP requirements. The main focus of this study is the multiplex subsea BOP control system. The potential critical failures of this system are identified and analyzed in a detailed failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). This analysis shows that the shuttle valve, the pod selector valve, the subsea accumulators, and the fluid reservoir are the most <b>safety-critical</b> <b>parts</b> of the control system. The BOP control system has several redundant elements and these may be vulnerable to common-cause failures. The potential common-cause failures are examined in this study and found to have a significant influence on the reliability of the control system. Improving current reliability assessments of subsea BOP control systems requires a thorough review of both the system and the previously used methods. In this study, a fault tree analysis is performed to reveal the relevant failure combinations. To improve reliability calculations provided by common fault tree analysis programs, a post-processing of the minimal cut sets in a spreadsheet (i. e., Excel) is proposed to cover the effect of common-cause failures. The method gives a more conservative and accurate approximation compared to the existing methods. An event tree analysis is performed to cover the switching phases between the two pods, showing the time dependencies that can influence the consequences. This type of switching cannot be modeled in the fault tree, therefore, recommendations to apply the event tree analysis to similar situations to get a more accurate reliability estimate, is given. For components such as the shear ram, a perfect function test cannot be conducted. In the performed analysis, no such components are evaluated. However, in an expanded analysis of the subsea BOP control system, such components will be involved, therefore, adding the contribution from the proof test coverage factor to components prone to imperfect testing, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to update the underlying software in many industrial control devices. Engineering teams had to ‘rip and replace’ obsolete components. However, the ability to make firmware updates has provided significant benefits to the companies who use Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), switches, gateways and bridges as well as an array of smart sensor/actuators. These updates include security patches when vulnerabilities are identified in existing devices; they can be distributed by physical media but are increasingly downloaded over Internet connections. These mechanisms pose a growing threat to the cyber security of safety-critical applications, which are illustrated by recent attacks on safety-related infrastructures across the Ukraine. Subsequent sections explain how malware can be distributed within firmware updates. Even when attackers cannot reverse engineer the code necessary to disguise their attack, they can undermine a device by forcing it into a constant upload cycle where the firmware installation never terminates. In this paper, we present means of mitigating the risks of firmware attack on <b>safety-critical</b> systems as <b>part</b> of wider initiatives to secure national critical infrastructures. Technical solutions, including firmware hashing, must be augmented by organizational measures to secure the supply chain within individual plants, across companies and throughout safety-related industries...|$|R
40|$|Safety-critical {{systems can}} be {{negatively}} affected by faults such as component failures or environmental disturbances. One or more occurrences of such faults might lead to hazards, that is, potentially disastrous situations or conditions that may cause accidents with economical losses, environmental damage, injuries, or loss of lives. Safety analysis {{is the process of}} identifying such hazards as well as their root causes in order to assess a system's overall safety. Traditional safety analysis techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis or Failure Modes and Effects Analysis help to systematically assess system safety by informally dissecting the system's behavior and component interdependencies. However, the increasing complexity of <b>safety-critical</b> systems, in <b>part</b> due to the introduction of more and more software-based components, requires more sophisticated safety analysis techniques to thoroughly analyze system behavior with regard to faults. Additionally, traditional safety analysis techniques are not suited for the analysis of self-organizing systems, an emerging class of often safety-critical systems that change their behavior and structure during operation in a way that cannot be predicted during system development. Self-organization thus necessitates new safety analysis approaches that are at least partially conducted at run time while the system is already in operation. The contribution of this thesis is a systematic design time and run time modeling and analysis approach for safety-critical systems based on formal methods and executable models. Its main achievements are threefold: Firstly, a systematic modeling approach and the executable modeling language S# are introduced. Secondly, a safety analysis technique based on explicit-state model checking and its formal foundations are defined, increasing analysis efficiency and practical usability compared to alternative techniques. Thirdly, a unified model execution and analysis approach is used to simulate and visualize S# models and to systematically conduct design time and run time safety analyses for them with consistent semantics. The contributions are evaluated using different case studies from multiple application domains...|$|R
