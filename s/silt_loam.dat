The study includes a comparison between soils found in five different locations. Using the bulk density, water holding capacity, soil organic matter, soil pH, soil water content at field capacity, and soil porosity, this study aims to distinguish how continuously using the same cropping systems will affect soils {{over an extended period}} of time. Soil samples were collected from Christian County, Kentucky, Caldwell County, Kentucky, Calloway County, Kentucky, and Madison County, Illinois on August 29 th 2017. The soil samples collected include <b>silt</b> <b>loams</b> and sandy <b>silt</b> <b>loams</b> that are in use for horse pasture, raising dark tobacco, conservation reserve program, gardening, and a park.

The 1. 3 M contaminated hectares were characterized by irrigation method, soil drainage, and vadose zone thickness and lithology.

Much slower expansion (3700 ha/yr) occurred in the 220, 000 contaminated hectares in the central Platte valley characterized by predominately gravity irriga-tion on thick, well-drained <b>silt</b> <b>loams</b> above a thin (5. 3 m), sandy unsaturated zone.

Average annual concentrations in 10 MAs are increasing (p< 0. 05) and indicate that aver-age nitrate concentrations in leachates below the root zone and groundwater concentrations have not yet reached steady state.
