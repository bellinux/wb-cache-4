5|$|The station {{opened on}} 26 March 1877. Because of steep {{gradients}} near the town, {{the station was}} built in open fields <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the town itself. The station resembled in design Chingford railway station, opened in 1878, another GER branch line terminus.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, {{followed}} by the right center. They were again {{said to have been}} met by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws. The government wanted to be <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the monarch, and the buildings around Whitehall, physically separated from St James's Palace by St James's Park, {{seemed to be a}} good place for ministers to work.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E

5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in {{a process known as}} autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E

5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had {{gone as far as}} Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze.

5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades.

5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the Kanto and Johto regions {{featured}} in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E
