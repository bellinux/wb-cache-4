However, few studies have quantitatively analyzed the drivers of spatial changes in the N budget. We constructed a mass balance model of the N budget at the soil surface using a database of county-level agricultural statistics to analyze N input, output, and proportional contribution of various factors to the overall N input changes in croplands during 2000 - 2010 in the Yangtze River Basin, the largest basin and the main agricultural production region in China. Over the period investigated, N input increased by 9 %. Of this 87 % was from fertilizer N input. In the upper and middle reaches of the basin, the increased <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> N application rate accounted for 84 % and 76 % of the N input increase, respectively, mainly due to increased N input in the cropland that previously had low <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> N application rate. In lower reaches of the basin, mainly due to urbanization, the decrease in cropland area and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> N application rate nearly equally contributed to decreases in N input. Quantifying spatial N inputs can provide critical managerial information needed to optimize <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> N application rate and monitor the impacts of urbanization on agricultural production, helping to decrease agricultural environment risk and maintain sustainable agricultural production in different areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) {{have been suggested}} as contributors to {{the first step of}} nitrification in terrestrial ecosystems, a role that was previously assigned exclusively to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The current study assessed the effects of agricultural management, specifically amendment of soil with biosolids or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> on nitrification rates and copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes. Anaerobically digested biosolids or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied annually for three consecutive years to field plots used for corn production. Biosolids were applied at two loading rates, a typical agronomic rate (27 Mg hectare− 1 year− 1) and double the agronomic rate (54 Mg hectare− 1 year− 1), while <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied at an agronomic rate typical for the region (291 kg N hectare− 1 year− 1). Both biosolids amendments and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> increased soil N and corn yield, but only the biosolids amendments resulted in significant increases in nitrification rates and increases in the copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes. In addition, only archaeal amoA gene copy numbers increased in response to biosolids applied at the typical agronomic rate and showed a significant correlation with nitrification rates. Finally, copy numbers of archaeal amoA genes were significantly higher than copy numbers of bacterial amoA genes for all treatments. These results implicate AOA as being primarily responsible for the increased nitrification observed in an agricultural soil amended with biosolids. These results also support the hypothesis that physiological differences between AOA and AOB may enable them to occupy distinct ecological niches...|$|R

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate.

Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{applied to}} the surface of the land for {{agricultural}} purposes represents a significant source of reactive nitrogen (N r) that can be emitted as a gaseous N r species, be denitrified to atmospheric nitrogen (N 2), run off during rain events or form plant-useable nitrogen in the soil. To investigate the magnitude, temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of nitrogen pathways on a global scale from sources of animal manure and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> we developed a mechanistic parameterization of these pathways within a global terrestrial land model, the Community Land Model (CLM). In this first model version the parameterization emphasizes an explicit climate-dependent approach while using highly simplified representations of agricultural practices, including manure management and fertilizer application. The climate-dependent approach explicitly simulates the relationship between meteorological variables and biogeochemical processes to calculate the volatilization of ammonia (NH 3), nitrification and runoff of N r following manure or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application. For the year 2000, approximately 125  Tg N yr − 1 is applied as manure and 62  Tg N yr − 1 is applied as <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> We estimate the resulting global NH 3 emissions are 21  Tg N yr − 1 from manure (17  % of manure production) and 12  Tg N yr − 1 from fertilizer (19  % of fertilizer application); reactive nitrogen runoff during rain events is calculated as 11  Tg N yr − 1 from manure and 5  Tg N yr − 1 from fertilizer. The remaining nitrogen from manure (93  Tg N yr − 1) and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (45  Tg N yr − 1) is captured by the canopy or transferred to the soil nitrogen pools. The parameterization was implemented in the CLM from 1850 to 2000 using a transient simulation which predicted that, even though absolute values of all nitrogen pathways are increasing with increased manure and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application, partitioning of nitrogen to NH 3 emissions from manure is increasing on a percentage basis, from 14  % of nitrogen applied in 1850 (3  Tg NH 3  yr − 1) to 17  % of nitrogen applied in 2000 (21  Tg NH 3  yr − 1). Under current manure and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application rates we find a global sensitivity of an additional 1  Tg NH 3 (approximately 3  % of manure and fertilizer) emitted per year per °C of warming. While the model confirms earlier estimates of nitrogen fluxes made in a range of studies, its key purpose is to provide a theoretical framework that can be employed within a biogeochemical model, that can explicitly respond to climate and that can evolve and improve with further observation...|$|R

Although improved crop yields resulting from NPK fertilizers are known to dilute the concentrations of other nutrients in plants, much of the measured decline {{can be attributed to the}} use of progressively higher-yielding crop varieties which produce foods with lower mineral concentrations than their less productive ancestors. It is, therefore, unlikely that organic farming or reduced use of fertilizers will solve the problem; foods with high nutrient density are posited to be achieved using older, lower-yielding varieties or the development of new high-yield, nutrient-dense varieties.|$|E

Life cycle {{assessment}} is the predominant method to compare energy and environmental impacts of agricultural production systems. In this life cycle study, we focused on the comparison of swine manure to <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> as nutrients for corn production in Iowa. Deep pit (DP) and anaerobic lagoon (AL) treatment systems were compared separately, and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) {{was chosen as the}} representative <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The two functional units used were fertilization of 1000 kg of corn in a continuous corn system and fertilization of a crop yielding 1000 kg of corn and a crop yielding 298 kg of soybean in a 2 -yr corn-soybean rotation. Iowa-specific versions of emission factors and energy use were used when available and compared with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change values. Manure was lower than <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for abiotic depletion and about equal with respect to eutrophication. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was lower than manure for global warming potential (GWP) and acidification. The choice of allocation method and life cycle boundary were important in understanding the context of these results. In the DP system, methane (CH 4) from housing was the largest contributor to the GWP, accounting for 60 % of the total impact. When storage systems were compared, the DP system had 50 % less GWP than the AL system. This comparison was due to reduction in CH 4 emissions from the storage system and conservation of nitrogen. Nitrous oxide emissions were the biggest contributor to the GWP of UAN fertilization and the second biggest contributor to the GWP of manure. Monte Carlo and scenario analyses were used to test the robustness of the results and sensitivity to methodology and important impact factors. The available crop-land and associated plant nutrient needs in Iowa was compared with manure production for the current hog population. On a state-or county-wide level, there was generally an excess of available land. On a farm level, there is often an excess of manure, which necessitates long-distance transport...|$|R

During the last five decades, the response of agricultural systems to increased nitrogen fertilization has evolved differently in the different world countries.

25|$|Industrial {{agriculture}} {{also produces}} undesirable environmental effects. Large scale growing operations of commodity crops {{rely on the}} use of chemical pesticides and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Modified corn is a greedy plant that consumes more fertilizer that any other crop. Without either of these, the soil alone could not have supported the large number of hybrid corn plants that helped America’s food industry explode. The production of both synthetic pesticides and fertilizers requires the use of natural gas and petroleum. Currently, it is relatively inexpensive to produce fertilizers and pesticides in this fashion, since the product is efficient and can be produced in huge quantities. Petrochemical fertilizers are preferred over sustainable options (manure) for these reasons. Fossil fuels are also crucial for transportation of product, manufacturing, and for running tractors and harvesting equipment. It is estimated that every bushel of corn requires the equivalent of between one quarter and one third of a U.S. gallon of petroleum to grow (37 to 50 liters per metric ton). For every acre of corn, about 50 U.S. gallons of petroleum are needed (470 L/ha). The use of fossil fuel in farming is standard; without this relatively affordable and convenient fuel source aiding in the fertilization, pest resistance, harvesting and manufacturing corn crops would not meet a high enough yield to satisfy the needs of the farmer or the demands of the consumer.|$|E

Two bioremediation processes based on fungi (commercially produced white rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and aged, coarse wood chips, 'compost', with naturally occurring fungi) were applied with variations and compared to one control: a typical static biopile. An elevated-face compost turner was used to turn the soil in selected windrows for aeration.

The warm and wet maize season was associated with significantly larger N losses via gaseous and hydrological pathways than the cooler and drier wheat season. Nitrate leaching and NH 3 volatilization were the main N loss pathways, accounting for 78 % and 93 % of the annual hydrological and gaseous N losses, respectively. The field 15 N tracing experiment showed that the wheat system had a high N retention capacity (∼ 50 % of 15 N application), although the N residence time was short. In the subsequent maize season, 90 % of the residual 15 N-labeled fertilizer in the soil that had been applied to the wheat system was utilized by plants or lost to the environment. The combined application of <b>synthetic</b> and organic <b>fertilizers</b> (pig manure) or application of pig manure resulted in significantly higher soil N retention and lower NO 3 − leaching, while yields remained unaffected.
