5|$|In {{subsequent}} years, she frequently expressed {{regret for}} her roles in antisemitic films. Although Söderbaum {{continued to play}} roles in film, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> offered a leading role after the war. Eventually, she became a photographer of celebrities.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{successful}} in {{her more than}} a decade of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from what she had asked for recompense, it also never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after 1605 {{her career as}} a courtesan came to an end when she married the playwright and bureaucrat Shen Defu. She was married several times (making many of the {{proposals}} herself) but none of these unions lasted. As well as Shen Defu, her husbands included General Li Hualong, art critic Li Rihua and, in later life, an unnamed (but wealthy) merchant from Suzhou. Although she wanted children, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> able to have any.|$|E

5|$|Szent István {{was based}} at Pola (Pula) for the {{duration}} of her career. In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to Pag Island. Only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; {{for the rest of the}} time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{her death}} four years prior, the Swedish {{mathematician}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables, offering to send her his monograph on Sofia Kovalevskaya. Shapley replied, letting Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt had died, and suggesting that the true credit belonged to his (Shapley's) interpretation of her findings. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.|$|E

5|$|While often {{described}} as gifted and bright, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes. Gibbes, Gilliard, and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova described Anastasia as lively, mischievous, and a gifted actress. Her sharp, witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{in a position}} to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> able to walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation {{at a time when}} some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Liz sees Floyd, the {{corporate}} employee who {{she has a}} crush on, go into a church on a Tuesday afternoon. The next week, she follows him in and finds that he is attending an AA meeting. Liz pretends to be an alcoholic {{so that she can}} get closer to Floyd and hear his secrets. After finding out that members of the same AA group are not allowed to date, Liz confesses to Floyd that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> an alcoholic and that she made it up to get close to him. He gets mad and feels betrayed, so she apologizes and tells him all of her secrets to make it up to him. Floyd forgives her and they begin dating.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II both {{submarines}} {{participated in}} cruises to Mediterranean ports. Hrabri {{was captured by}} Italian forces in April 1941 during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> commissioned by the Italians and was subsequently scrapped. Nebojša evaded capture, and served with British submarine forces in the Mediterranean as an anti-submarine warfare training boat {{until the end of}} the war. Following the war, she served in the Yugoslav Navy as Tara in a training role until 1954, when she was stricken.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} {{ships were}} laid down four years later. Roma {{was built by}} the CRDA shipyard, starting on 18 September 1938. She was launched on 9 June 1940 and was completed on 14 June 1942, after which she joined the fleet in La Spezia and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. Impero was laid down at the Ansaldo shipyard on 14 May 1938. She was launched on 15 November 1939, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> completed. After the entrance of Italy to World War II, the Italian Navy moved the unfinished ship from Genoa to Brindisi, out of fears of French attacks on the vessel. Work was not resumed.|$|E

5|$|All of the dreadnoughts {{except for}} Petropavlovsk were laid up in October–November 1918 {{for lack of}} manpower. She bombarded the rebellious {{garrison}} of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland. On 17 August 1919 Petropavlovsk was claimed as torpedoed and put out of action by the British Coastal Motor Boat CMB 88 in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all. On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in Poltavas forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> repaired although numerous proposals were made to reconstruct her. The crews of Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and they were renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna and Marat respectively after the rebellion was crushed to commemorate the Paris Commune and to erase their 'betrayal' of the Communist Party. The two undamaged ships were recommissioned in 1925–26 and all the ships were given proper revolutionary names.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} most modern units of the High Seas Fleet, Brummer and Bremse were {{included}} in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers. The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 in single file, commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, and so he ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships. Brummer sank at 13:05; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> raised for scrapping and remains on the bottom of Scapa Flow. Bremse sank at 14:30 and was ultimately raised on 27 November 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933 in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} as a minelayer, the German Navy never operated her as such. She and her sister were used to raid a British convoy to Norway in October 1917. The two cruisers sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships of the convoy. The Kaiserliche Marine considered sending the two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans to abandon the plan. Brummer {{was included in the}} list of ships interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. Brummer was successfully scuttled, and unlike most of the other wrecks, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> raised for scrapping.|$|E

500|$|In the First Folio, {{the only}} source for the play, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> {{referred}} to as Lady Macbeth, but variously as [...] "Macbeth's wife", [...] "Macbeth's lady", or just [...] "lady".|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Brummer sank at 13:05; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> raised for scrapping and remains {{on the bottom of}} Scapa Flow. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Brummer and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles {{as part of an effort}} to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|The newly {{installed}} French {{colonial government}} promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to Algiers. Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted {{to remain as}} symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement– the menalamba rebellion– and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Despite Ranavalona's repeated requests, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> permitted to return home to Madagascar. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 {{at the age of}} 55. Her remains were buried in Algiers but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina {{on the grounds of the}} Rova of Antananarivo.|$|E
