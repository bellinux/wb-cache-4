40|$|Escape {{analysis}} of object-oriented languages approximates {{the set of}} objects which do not escape from a given context. If we take a method as context, the non-escaping objects can be allocated on its activation stack; if we take a thread, Java <b>synchronisation</b> <b>locks</b> on such objects are not needed. In this paper, we formalise a basic escape domain e as an abstract interpretation of concrete states, which we then refine into an abstract domain er which is more concrete than e and, hence, leads to a more precise escape analysis than e. We provide optimality results for both e and er, {{in the form of}} Galois insertions from the concrete to the abstract domains and of optimal abstract operations. The Galois insertion property is obtained by restricting the abstract domains to those elements which do not contain garbage, by using an abstract garbage collector. Our implementation of er is hence an implementation of a formally correct escape analyser, able to detect the stack allocatable creation points of Java (bytecode) applications. This report contains the proofs of results of a paper with the same title and authors and to be published in the Journal "Higher-Order Symbolic Computation"...|$|R
40|$|The {{new era of}} {{multi-core}} processing challenges software {{designers to}} efficiently exploit the parallelism that is now massively available. Programmers have to exchange the conventional sequential programming paradigm for parallel programming: single-threaded designs must be decomposed into dependent, interacting tasks. The Java programming language has built-in thread support and is therefore suitable {{for the development of}} parallel software, but programming multi-threaded applications is a tedious task. Therefore we are working on a framework and tool support to alleviate the burden of threads, <b>synchronisation</b> and <b>locking,</b> based on process networks. This paper describes our initial ideas for this new programming model. ...|$|R
40|$|Long-running, heavily multi-threaded, Java server {{applications}} make stringent {{demands of}} garbage collector (GC) performance. Synchronisation of all application threads before garbage collection {{is a significant}} bottleneck for JVMs that use native threads. We present a new static analysis and a novel GC framework designed {{to address this issue}} by allowing independent collection of threadlocal heaps. In contrast to previous work, our solution safely classifies objects even in the presence of dynamic class loading, requires neither write-barriers that may do unbounded work, nor <b>synchronisation,</b> nor <b>locks</b> during thread-local collections; our analysis is sufficiently fast to permit its integration into a high-performance, productionquality virtual machine. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a population of}} coupled oscillators characterized by a limit cycle. The analysis is developed by means of analogue simulation {{that allows us to}} obtain a wide overview of the dynamics {{as a function of the}} intensity of coupling. We Found behaviours such as <b>synchronisation,</b> transient phase <b>locking</b> and cluster formation. The global quantity corresponding at the sum of the amplitudes was considered as an indicator of the dynamics. An interesting property of this quantity is the presence of a maximum of fluctuations corresponding to a special intensity of the coupling...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} latency {{presents a}} major challenge to achieving high responsiveness for Internet-based cooperative editing systems. In this paper, we propose conflict control locking (post-locking) schemes for conflict resolution in real-time object-based cooperative graphics editors. With these schemes, no locking request is needed before applying an editing operation to an object, instead, a lock will automatically be generated by the system ifa conflict occurs. Lock ownership assigning rules ure devised for the schemes. With a spec$c post-locking approach, algorithms and implementation techniques, such as, <b>lock</b> <b>synchronisation</b> detection, voting, and group intention realisation, are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|A {{non-blocking}} {{program is}} one that uses non-blocking primitives, such as load-linked/store-conditional and compare-and-swap, for <b>synchronisation</b> instead of <b>locks</b> so that no process is ever blocked. According to their progress properties, non-blocking programs may be classified as wait-free, lock-free or obstruction-free. However, a precise description of these properties does not exist {{and it is not}} unusual to find a definition that is ambiguous or even incorrect. We present a formal definition of the progress properties so that any confusion is removed. The formalisation also allows one to prove the widely believed presumption that wait-freedom is a special case of lock-freedom, which in turn is a special case of obstruction-freedom...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{extend the}} Jinja source code {{semantics}} by Klein and Nipkow with Java-style arrays and threads. Concurrency is captured in a generic framework semantics for adding concurrency through interleaving to a sequential semantics, which features dynamic thread creation, inter-thread communication via shared memory, <b>lock</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and joins. Also, threads can suspend themselves and be notified by others. We instantiate the framework with the adapted versions of both Jinja source and byte code and show type safety for the multithreaded case. Equally, the compiler from source to byte code is extended, {{for which we}} prove weak bisimilarity between the source code small step semantics and the defensive Jinja virtual machine. On top of this, we formalise the JMM and show the DRF guarantee and consistency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{verification}} method for concur-rent Java programs based on the concept of dynamic frames. We build on our earlier work that proposes a new, symbolic permission system for concurrent reasoning and we provide the following new contributions. First, we describe our approach for proving program specifications to be self-framed w. r. t. permissions, which is a necessary condition to main-tain soundness in concurrent reasoning. Second, we show how we use predicates to provide modular and reusable specifications for program <b>synchronisation</b> points, like <b>locks</b> or forked threads. Our work primarily targets the KeY verification system with its specification language JML∗ and symbolic execution proving method. Hence, we also give the current status of the work on implementation and we discuss some examples that are verifiable with KeY. ...|$|R

40|$|Polaritons are {{lightweight}} bosonic quasiparticles {{that result}} from the strong coupling of light with an exciton transition inside a microcavity. A sufficiently dense cloud of polaritons condenses into a polariton condensate, a state of matter showing macroscopic coherence and superfluid properties, whose dynamics {{are influenced by the}} cycle of constant pumping and decay of polaritons. This thesis begins with an introduction on the particle and wave properties of the polariton condensate, followed by a theoretical description of two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and a section on simulation of polariton condensates. The optical setup and the microcavity sample are presented thereafter, including holographic laser shaping with a spatial light modulator (SLM), which allows exciting the microcavity with arbitrarily shaped pump geometries. Experimental results comprise optical control of polariton condensates, and dipolaritons. First, optical blueshift trapping and energy <b>synchronisation</b> (phase <b>locking)</b> of condensates are introduced. The transition from phase-locked condensates to an optically trapped condensate is investigated for a configuration of N pump spots arranged on a circle of varying diameter. Differences between these two condensate types are highlighted in the discussion section. Next, two parallel pump laser lines with small separation are investigated, which create a one-dimensional waveguide with strong uniform gain. Optically guided polaritons are investigated in this configuration with respect to coherence, flow speed, temperature and chemical potential. Observations hint that coherence arises below the condensation threshold simply from the chosen geometry of the system. The final chapter is dedicated to dipolaritons (polaritons with a static dipole moment) which form when polaritons strongly couple to indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells. In this system quantum tunnelling of electrons can be controlled with bias voltage. This allows tuning the dipolariton properties optically and electrically, with exciting prospects for future experiments. A conclusion and outlook section rounds off this work...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{synchronisation}} plays {{a critical}} role in information processing, storage and transmission. Characterising the pattern of synchronisation is therefore of great interest. It has recently been suggested that the brain displays broadband criticality based on two measures of <b>synchronisation</b> - phase <b>locking</b> intervals and global lability of synchronisation - showing power law statistics at the critical threshold in a classical model of synchronisation. In this paper, we provide evidence that, within the limits of the model selection approach used to ascertain the presence of power law statistics, the pooling of pairwise phase-locking intervals from a non-critically interacting system can produce a distribution that is similarly assessed as being power law. In contrast, the global lability of synchronisation measure is shown to better discriminate critical from non critical interaction. Comment: (v 3) Fixed error in Figure 1; (v 2) Added references.

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} the main physical effects produced by stellar rotation on presupernovae, {{as well as}} observations which confirm these effects and their consequences for presupernova models. Rotation critically influences {{the mass of the}} exploding cores, the mass and chemical composition of the envelopes and the types of supernovae, as well as the properties of the remnants and the chemical yields. In the formation of gamma-ray bursts, rotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor. In binaries, the interaction between axial rotation and tidal effects often leads to interesting and unexpected results. Rotation {{plays a key role in}} shaping the evolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities (metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to Population III stars). At solar and higher metallicities, the effects of rotation compete with those of stellar winds. In close binaries, the <b>synchronisation</b> process can <b>lock</b> the star at a high rotation rate despite strong mass loss and thus both effects, rotation and stellar winds, have a strong impact. In conclusion, rotation is a key physical ingredient of the stellar models and of presupernova stages, and the evolution both of single stars and close binaries. Moreover, important effects are expected along the whole cosmic history. Comment: 36 pages, 15 figures, published in Handbook of Supernovae, A. W. Alsabti and P. Murdin (eds), Springe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations into}} issues of power quality {{and reliability of}} grid connected inverters and proposes improved topological and control solutions to improve performance and cost effectiveness of these systems. Synchronisation of inverters to the grid can be problematic in its operational reliability. Of all grid <b>synchronisation</b> techniques phase <b>locked</b> loop based method offers a simple, robust and flexible solution. However the conventional PLL approach is inherently difficult to tune, due {{to the influence of}} its parameters on loop dynamics, filtering properties and output waveform spectral purity. The improved PLL proposed in the thesis, relieves the tuning task by decoupling the effect of its loop parameters from performance characteristics. Inverter power quality issues are addressed beginning from sources of harmonic distortion, classified as intrinsic and extrinsic. A potential intrinsic source is a look-up table generated reference sinusoid accessed in non-uniform increments resulting in harmonic, inter-harmonic or subharmonic distortion. The effect is studied in detail with analytical derivations and experimental results. On the other hand, extrinsic distortions are mainly caused by the distorted grid voltage. The effect of inductor current feedback, output current feedback and capacitor current feedforward on harmonic impedance is studied. The combination of inductor current feedback and capacitor current feedforward demonstrates good disturbance rejection and damped load transient performance on a low power grid connected inverter. It is shown that by carefully selecting the feedforward coefficient, the structure of the control system could be varied between the feedback and feedforward schemes. Theoretical concepts are validated on a purpose built 50 OW 3 -level grid connected inverter controlled through a generalised controller board based on TMS 320 C 31 DSP. Multi-level inverters are presented as a favourable topological alternative to H-bridge grid connected inverters at medium and high power levels. The effect of number of levels, topology and switching strategy on switching losses, spectral performance and cost is analysed. Simulation results reveal that Boolean manipulation of PWM signals can be used to re-distribute harmonic energy for common mode cancellation, resulting in low switching harmonic amplitudes. Such a scheme - Carrier anti-phase sine (CAS) PWM is proposed and used in the prototype 3 -level inverter.
