5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> diets with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|To <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> incomes, {{the rangers}} trapped predators such as coyote, fox, lynx, {{mountain}} lion, and wolverine for their furs, {{a practice that}} survived until 1925. Predator control continued however; 43mountain lions were killed in Yosemite by the state lion hunter in 1927. Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted to local extinction.|$|E
5|$|Agrium Vanscoy Potash Operations is Canada's {{third largest}} {{producer}} of potash fertilizer. In the 1930s early homesteaders would maintain Highway 7 {{as a means}} to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income. Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for direction of travel with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines. Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures. In 2017, for instance, {{approximately half of the}} country's population was growing fruits and vegetables to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> diet, caused in part by a doubling in food prices in the preceding two years.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> operations with scrap lead, and this trend {{is likely to increase}} in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was one of}} a {{small number}} of Continental Army regiments that was the direct responsibility of the Continental Congress (most regiments were funded and supplied by a specific state). Commanded by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Moses Hazen for its entire existence, the regiment was originally made up of volunteers and refugees from Quebec who supported the rebel cause during the disastrous invasion of Canada. Hazen and his staff were later authorized by Congress to recruit in other areas to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> ranks.|$|E
5|$|Wolves <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> {{diet with}} fruit and {{vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' offense in 1946. He caught a 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September {{game against the}} Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> football incomes.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of antioxidant activity of food supplements in vitro. The theoretical part focuses on legislative requirements of food <b>supplements,</b> <b>their</b> characteristic and classification. Further, the attention is also devoted to antioxidants, their properties, effects, importance and utilization. Separate chapter describes herbs, which are {{an essential component of}} researched <b>supplements,</b> <b>their</b> effects and properties. For experimental part several food supplements in various forms (capsule, tea, juice, dried fruits) were chosen and total content of polyphenols was determined using the UV-VIS spectroscopy. Further, the total antioxidant activity is characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance involving DPPH method...|$|R
5|$|Emanuel Lasker {{was born}} on December 24, 1868 at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), {{the son of a}} Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. According to the website Chessmetrics, Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s. To <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, {{especially}} at the CaféKaiserhof.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach {{contents}} and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Rodham {{became the}} first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 {{investment}} generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Loeu {{typically}} practice subsistence slash {{and burn}} shifting cultivation in small villages of between 20 and 60 nuclear families. Each village collectively owns and governs a forest territory whose boundaries are known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2hectares (2.5–5acres) of actively cultivated land and 5–6hectares (12.5–15acres) of fallow land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle {{practiced by the}} Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.|$|E
5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E
5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E
