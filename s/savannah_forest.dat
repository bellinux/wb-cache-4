The mean proximate composition (mg/ 100 mL) was as follows: phenolics (269. 5), condensed tannins (266. 0), Vitamin C (231. 4) and sugars (12. 05 mg mL - 1). The mineral composition (mg/ 100 mL) showed potassium (76. 0) to be the highest, followed by calcium (43. 0), magnesium (10. 92), phosphorous (0. 79) and sodium (0. 41). Zinc, copper and iron concentrations were much lower and ranged from 0. 05 - 0. 08 mg/ 100 mL. The physicochemical properties of the juice were as follows: pH (4. 31), colour (light yellow for juice from yellow apples and yellow with traces of red pigments for juice from red apples). Phenol and tannin contents in the juice showed significant (p< 0. 05) variation among the ecological zones. Thus, apples from the Forest transitional zone appear to be better for juice extraction because of their relatively low tannin, higher pH, higher sugar and less phenolic content. No {{significant differences in the}} quantitative composition of calcium, iron, zinc and phosphorus could be attributed to the ecological zone or colour from which the juice was extracted...|$|E
40|$|Spatial inequalities {{related to}} the choice of {{delivery}} care have not been studied systematically in Sub-Saharan Africa where maternal and perinatal health outcomes continue to worsen despite a range of safe motherhood interventions. Using retrospective data from the 1998 and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys, this paper investigates the extent of changes in spatial inequalities associated with type of delivery care in Ghana {{with a focus on}} rural–urban differentials within and across the three ecological zones (<b>Savannah,</b> <b>Forest</b> and Coastal). More than one-half of births in Ghana continue to occur outside health institutions without any skilled obstetric care. While this is already known, we present evidence from multilevel analyses that there exist considerable and growing inequalities, with regard to birth settings between communities, within rural and urban areas and across the ecological zones. The results show evidence of poor and disproportionate use of institutional care at birth; the inequalities remained high and unchanged in both urban and rural communities within the Savannah zone and widening in urban communities of the Forest and Coastal zones. The key policy challenges in Ghana, therefore, include both increasing the uptake of institutional delivery care and ensuring equity in access to both public and private health institution...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAxtell (1999) distinguishes {{different}} {{motivations for}} using agent-based computation {{in the social}} sciences, opposing the use of simulation as a complement for a mathematical model and when “writing down equations is not a useful activity”. This later point of view matches the study of Bantu expansion to Southern and Eastern Africa between 1000 BP and 1000 AD. Use of linguistic and genetic studies give some information over the absence or presence of Bantu groups at some different dates but the information is globally deficient. An agent-based model (HUME) has been developed in order to reconstruct "stylized facts" in the way Bantu expansion occurred: demographic growth, speed of migration, preferred routes (costal road, <b>savannah,</b> <b>forest,</b> rivers, etc.). Particular attention {{has been put on}} the effect of the interactions between forager-hunter groups and Bantu groups on the rhythm and form of the spatial expansion process. Hence, a debate exists today amongst paleolinguists and paleohistorians on how equatorial forest present in Central Africa have been crossed by Bantus groups, taking into account that Bantus groups dislike going into the forest, inhabited by forest foragers groups. Questions remain unsolved to what extend forest foragers helped Bantus groups to cross the equatorial forest, or if contact between Bantus and forest foragers was common at Neolithic era. A strong asymmetry today characterizes their relationships and empirical knowledge based on genetic and linguistic observation today cannot discriminate whether this asymmetry have been present from the start or have develop over time. HUME (HUman Migration and Environment) model aims at exploring "numerically" the Bantu expansion and to test the effects on the forms of spatial expansion of different forms of interaction between Bantu groups and forest-foragers groups. Thus, {{we have been able to}} test different scenarios about how the Bantu have expanded toward the South. Space is heterogeneous in the model with three types of areas (sea, <b>savannah,</b> <b>forest)</b> that impact the ability of groups to extract resources and to move. This spatial heterogeneity is a cornerstone of the methodology adopted for it allows us to assess the respective role played by social interactions betweens groups and by interactions betweens groups and the environment in the spatial forms of the crossing of equatorial forest by Bantus. Various initial spatial configurations are tested and the expansion of the Bantu are measured by indicators to assess i) the success or failure of the colonization of the entire space, ii) the trajectories of settlement, particularly in relation to the obstacle of the forest. We therefore use spatial simulation as a way to build “stories” that are at the same time consistent with stylized fact already known by specialists of the Neolithic era and realistic enough to fertilize the scientific approach on unknown part of the system, here for instance the complex interactions between Bantus groups and forest foragers groups...|$|E
40|$|Background : Two of the {{problems}} of malaria parasite vector control in Nigeria are the diversity of Anopheline vectors and large size of the country. Anopheline distribution and transmission dynamics of malaria were therefore compared between four ecotypes in Nigeria during the rainy season. Methods : Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in molecular identification after morphological identification microscopically. Enzyme linked immunorsorbent assay (ELISA) was used for the blood meal analysis and sporozoite detection. Results : Five species were identified out of 16, 410 anophelines collected. An. gambiae s. s made up approximately 29. 2 &#x 0025;- 36. 6 &#x 0025; of the population in each zone. All five species acted as vectors for P. falciparum. An. gambiae s. s had the highest sporozoite rate. The most infected mosquitoes were found in the rain forest.

40|$|Unintended childbearing in Ghana is {{estimated}} to be about 0. 7 births per woman, thus contributing to the high total fertility rate of more than 4 births. About one-third of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for family planning and there are strong geographic differences between and within ecological zones. Spatial analysis of risk of unintended pregnancies planning can reveal differences in the provision and usage of contraceptive commodities, thereby providing information of areas where programmes should be strengthened. This study uses data from the 1998 and 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys to examine geographical variation in the risk of unintended pregnancies among women in the three ecological zones of Ghana (<b>Savannah,</b> <b>Forest,</b> and Coastal). The data was analysed using multilevel logistic regression. Approximately 55 % of Ghanaian women (married or in union) are at risk of unintended pregnancies and there are differences between urban and rural women, with rural women more likely to have their demand for contraception unmet. After adjusting for the socio-economic and demographic factors, the results show little differences between ecological zones in the levels of women exposed to the risk of unintended pregnancy, but they demonstrate significant within community effects, which influence the risk of unintended pregnancies for women within the community. Communities, therefore, can be used as units for targeting services aimed at increasing coverage of contraceptive commodities. <br/...|$|E

The collection of blood for the molecular typing was achieved on 121 indigenous chickens of which 60 from the Savannah ecological area and 61 from the Forest ecological area. The genotyping was carried out for 22 microsatellite loci. Weight and body measures of the Savannah chickens were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) than those of the Forest chickens. In the Savannah ecological area, the most frequent plumage colours were the black (22. 15 %), the white (19. 62 %), the coppery black (7. 59 %) and the golden partridge (7. 59 %). In the Forest area, the fawn (15. 34 %), the black (10. 43 %), the white (6. 8 %), the silver white (6. 8 %) and the golden partridge (6. 75 %) were the dominant feather colours.

Of 3826 flies dissected, 188 (4. 9 %) were parasitologically positive overall. The infection rate in G. pallidipes was 5. 7 % (187 of 3301 flies), but only one of 525 G. longipennis was infected (infection rate 0. 2 %). There was a higher infection rate in female G. pallidipes flies than male flies (χ 2 = 18. 5, P< 0. 001) and odds ratio= 2. 5 (95 % 1. 6, 3. 7). The infected flies were analysed by PCR using 10 sets of primers specific for species and subgroups within the subgenera Nannomonas, Trypanozoon and Duttonella. Of 188 parasitologically positive samples, PCR identified 137 (72. 9 %), leaving 51 (27. 1 %) non-identified. We recorded infection rates of 47. 2 % for Trypanosoma congolense <b>savannah,</b> <b>forest</b> and kilifi subgroups, 20. 9 % for T. simiae/T. simiae tsavo/T. godfreyi, 14. 9 % for T. brucei ssp. and 13. 8 % for T. vivax.

40|$|Phylogeographic {{studies of}} {{tropical}} and subtropical tree species provide an ideal method {{to study the}} role of forest refugia in the structuring of genetic diversity in contemporary populations. To date, most studies have examined rainforest-dependent trees, yet the influence of forest refugia on <b>savannah</b> <b>forest</b> and woodland trees remains poorly understood despite their potentially important role in forest assemblages during the last glacial maximum. Here, we examine the level and structuring of genetic diversity across the geographic range of the savannah woodland tree, Khaya senegalensis—African mahogany, from Senegal to Uganda (> 5000 km) and from the steppes of the Sahara desert to the fringes of Africa’s equatorial rainforests (700 km). Three chloroplast (cpDNA) loci and 13 nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci were genotyped in 503 individuals. Individual-based clustering of nSSR genotypes identified that all samples formed two populations that showed no pattern of geographic structuring. Population level analysis of nSSR data revealed only very weak genetic structure (F ST[*]=[*] 0. 013) {{with most of the}} genetic diversity contained within populations. Geographical differentiation (G ST[*]=[*] 0. 096) was low for the 14 haplotypes identified. However, whereas all haplotypes occurred in the western populations (including Cameroon), only two cosmopolitan haplotypes were found in central-eastern populations. Geographically restricted low-frequency haplotypes were found in eight western populations. Higher genetic diversity in western populations was confirmed by patterns of allelic richness, which were lower in central-eastern populations. Taken together, these results indicate that K. senegalensis displays very little genetic differentiation across its geographic range and that previously identified barriers to dispersal across the northern savannah belt of tropical Africa (e. g. the Dahomey Gap, Mega Lake Chad and the Adamawa Highlands) have not impeded contemporary gene dispersal in this species. Nevertheless, clustering of rare haplotypes indicates that the Dahomey Gap has likely been an important historical barrier to genetic connectivity between western and eastern regions of the species and that it is likely that this savannah tree also experienced range contraction around major forest refugial fringes or riparian incursions during the last glacial maximum (LGM) ...|$|E
