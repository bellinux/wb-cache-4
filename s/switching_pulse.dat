Initially one consider the performance of the device, operating in the nonlinear regime without loss. It was observed that the effect of dispersion and nonlinearity, has strong influence on the pulse propagation when one increase the length of the AOTF. For shorter length of the device the <b>switched</b> <b>pulse</b> is presenting time broadening. For higher length of the device, pulse breakup was observed. Considering the AOTF with loss one consider the device of length 0. 25 mm with loss of 4 dB/mm constructed with an increasing nonlinearity profile.

When the laser intensity of a femtosecond laser is high enough (around 1018 Wm- 2), a plasma can be created that spans the complete distance between the electrodes. The gas-filled spark gap is then closed on a femtosecond timescale, similar to photoconductive switching of a semiconductor switch. Stochastic breakdown processes, such as avalanche and streamer formation that cause the breakdown in laser triggered spark gaps, are passed over, which results in faster risetime and less jitter. Measurements of the <b>switched</b> <b>pulses</b> {{as a function of}} laser energy were performed in a 1 mm gap at an applied voltage of 4. 5 kV.
