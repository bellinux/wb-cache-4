5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E

40|$|Transgender populations {{demonstrate}} significant sexual diversity, {{with over}} three-fourths (77 %) of transgender individuals identifying as sexual minorities (Grant et al., 2011); however, {{a majority of}} research on sex, sexuality, and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> has focused exclusively on cisgender and heterosexual individuals and, perhaps more importantly, addressed these issues a heteronormative and cisnormative perspective (Nichols, 2014). Such frameworks have created significant gaps in research about sex, sexuality, and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> for trans individuals including understanding how gender transition influences sex and sexuality and how trans individuals and their partners engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>practice.</b> The current study addressed these omissions in the literature through a feminist, grounded theory qualitative inquiry into sex, sexuality, and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> for trans individuals and their partners. A sample of sixteen individuals (eight total couples) participated in in-person interviews about sex and sexuality. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using Charmaz’s (2006) approach to grounded theory and results yielded four themes: Internal Level, Change Processes, Relationship Level and Outside the Dyad. Findings revealed that the participant experiences of sex, sexuality, and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> occur on multiple levels, including the individual, the couple and, for some participants, outside of the couple. Changes/transitions in gender impacted both trans and cis partners and influenced understanding of sexuality, sexual behaviors, and even relationship structures...|$|R
5|$|The HIV {{pandemic}} {{has challenged}} communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> and drug use– which were once taboo– {{is sponsored by}} many governments and their healthcare providers. Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of anti-retroviral drugs, particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated far-reaching legislative changes. In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted. Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain <b>sexual</b> <b>practices,</b> and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> was {{one method}} of {{perfecting}} the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

40|$|In Ethiopia {{the number}} of young people going to college is {{steadily}} increasing. This predisposes them to risky sexual behaviour which leads to unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortions and HIV. This study has aimed to determine the patterns of <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> and contraceptives use and risk behaviours among those students in central Ethiopia. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was employed. Data on <b>sexual</b> <b>practice,</b> knowledge and contraceptive use were collected from 327 college students. The data were cleaned, entered and analysed using SPSS version 20. The results revealed that despite their knowledge of the methods of safe sex, there are still considerable misconceptions regarding the effectiveness of contraceptives, their side effects and their proper use. In terms of the <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> reported by the respondents, 142 (43. 4 %) practised sex and 110 (77. 5 %) of respondents had used contraceptives at least once. The age of the respondents, {{the number of}} years for which they stayed in college and their fields of study were significantly associated with their <b>sexual</b> <b>practice.</b> In conclusion, a significant number of college students practised sex without using contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, and a considerable number of their partners disapproved of the use of contraceptivesHealth StudiesM.

25|$|Heterosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the opposite sex. Heterosexual <b>sexual</b> <b>practices</b> are subject to laws in many places.

Sodomy laws were seen as discouraging same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>practices,</b> but may affect opposite-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>practices.</b> Laws also ban adults from committing sexual abuse, committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.|$|E

As far as the orientations during the consultation is concerned, we noticed that they are insufficient and that this issue is still a reason for shame between the pregnant woman and the professional who assists her, what raises doubts and fear in the pregnant woman’s minds. ...|$|R
40|$|Few {{data have}} been {{available}} to examine the longitudinal behavioral changes among injection drug users despite the favorable findings of previous studies on reduced risk in drug injection and needle sharing. A substantial number of injection drug users may either not change their risk behaviors or may lapse later. This study examined the longitudinal risk patterns of drug injection and patterns of unprotected <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> over a 48 -month follow-up period. The main {{purpose of this paper}} was to develop predictive models of initiation and maintenance of safer behaviors and, in particular, to identify factors that predict the maintenance or initiation of safer behavior over time. Four patterns of behavioral changes for both drug injection and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> were defined: Initiation of safer behaviors, consistently unsafe practices, lapse into risky practices, and maintenance of risk reductions. A total of 415 injection drug users participated in the Risk Assessment Project in Philadelphia. All participants were assessed every six months using the Risk Assessment Battery and HIV antibody test. Each participant had at least two observation points. Using the logit model with generalized estimating equations method, the author found the following results. The longitudinal patterns of risky <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> was significantly associated with the patterns of drug injection. Being Black and unemployed at baseline were significant predictors of initiation of cessation of drug injection. Being Black, being in methadone treatment, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of maintenance of cessation of drug injection. Being female and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of initiation of safer <b>sexual</b> <b>practice.</b> Being older, being female, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of maintenance of safer <b>sexual</b> <b>practice.</b> Implications for further interventions are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{critics have}} charted an {{increasing}} biomedical and individualised approach to HIV prevention among gay and bisexual men, citing a significant shift in HIV {{policy and practice}} away from the community-based approaches to HIV prevention which characterised early responses. However, this dichotomous approach to ‘the biomedical or the social’ fails to capture the complex ways in which community-based approaches and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> are already inextricably linked with the biomedical. This article explores how biomedical constructions of risk are embedded in the community-based bodily management and <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> of gay and bisexual men in the North East of England. Drawing on Paul Rabinow’s concept of ‘biosociality’, the article proposes {{the notion of an}} imagined biosocial community: a community of gay and bisexual men who are affected by and at risk of HIV. Through this lens, the article explores how biomedical and sexual negotiations are situated in a broader history of illness, sexual politics and community. The article considers the importance of the biomedical in managing the body and the on-going significance of memory, community formation and identity in relation to ‘AIDS’. It then explores how the interplay of these elements is deployed or threatened within these imagined community norms of <b>sexual</b> <b>practice,</b> where responsibility to others is critical. In paying attention to an imagined biosocial community, this article demonstrates how perceptions of and adherence to imagined community <b>sexual</b> <b>practice</b> remain critical in addressing risk of HIV in an increasingly biomedicalised context...|$|R
