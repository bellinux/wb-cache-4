2500|$|The band's line-up had {{undergone}} a number of changes; however, the original three members had reunited. For a year, Erik [...] "Smelly" [...] Sandin left the band {{and was replaced by}} Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. [...] In 1986, the band released the extended play <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>If</b> We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This, attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of Liberal Animation, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the NOFX and <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>If</b> We're on Mystic! extended plays. The album is quite rare and only printed around 1,000 copies. The price of the album ranges from $80–$300. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the NOFX extended play.|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Norm Clarke {{recalled}} {{an encounter}} with Cosby in the 1990s in Denver, where the comedian embraced a crowd of adoring fans but treated Clarke with contempt. Clarke wrote: [...] "Last week, as allegations of sexual assault mounted against Cosby, I found myself wondering why a man so beloved, here and around the globe, who had won over everyone from school kids to media, kept a Denver newspaperman at bay. ... <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> he didn't {{want to talk to}} another journalist?

2500|$|James FitzGerald, a UCC Old Boy himself, {{published}} a book in 1994 titled Old Boys; the Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College. [...] It stirred up some controversy in Canadian media due to its candid portrayal of life at the College, derived from excerpts of interviews that FitzGerald had conducted with former students, ranging from Conrad Black and Michael Ignatieff to unknowns who managed gas stations or worked in retail. [...] Reactions varied; Charlotte Gray wrote in the Toronto Star: [...] "My reaction to this book is fascinated revulsion - mainly because the school seems to have taught successive generations of boys that girls are some alien species that is both terrifying and stupid," [...] while Jill Rigby said in the Toronto Sun: [...] "Yeah, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> some UCC teachers were pedophiles?

6000|$|I {{heard myself}} censured {{the other day}} in a coffee-house, for seeming to glance in the letter to Crassus,[11] against a great man, who is still in employment, and likely to {{continue}} <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>if</b> I had really intended that such an application should be given it? I cannot perceive how I could be justly blamed for so gentle a reproof. If I saw a handsome young fellow going to a ball at court with a great smut upon his face, could he take it ill in me to point out the place, and desire him with abundance of good words to pull out his handkerchief and wipe it off; or bring him to a glass, where he might plainly see it with his own eyes? Does any man think I shall suffer my pen to inveigh against vices, only because they are charged upon persons who are no longer in power? Every body knows, that certain vices are more or less pernicious, according to the stations of those who possess them. For example, lewdness and intemperance are not of so bad consequences in a town rake as a divine. Cowardice in a lawyer is more supportable than in an officer of the army. If I should find fault with an admiral because he wanted politeness, or an alderman for not understanding Greek; that indeed would be to go out of my way, for an occasion of quarrelling; but excessive avarice in a g[enera]l, is I think the greatest defect he can be liable to, next to those of courage and conduct, and may be attended with the most ruinous consequences, as it was in Crassus, who to that vice alone owed the destruction of himself and his army.[12] It is the same thing in praising men's excellencies, which are more or less valuable, as the person you commend has occasion to employ them. A man may perhaps mean honestly, yet if he be not able to spell, he shall never have my vote for a secretary: Another may have wit and learning in a post where honesty, with plain common sense, are of much more use: You may praise a soldier for his skill at chess, because it {{is said to be a}} military game, and the emblem of drawing up an army; but this to a tr[easure]r would be no more a compliment, than if you called him a gamester or a jockey.[13] ...|$|E

6000|$|Conway Dalrymple {{made his}} way up the stairs with very slow steps, and as he did so he could not but think seriously of the nature of his {{friendship}} with this woman, and could not but condemn himself heartily for the folly and iniquity of his own conduct. Scores of times he had professed his love to her with half-expressed words, intended to mean nothing, as he said to himself when he tried to excuse himself, but enough to turn her head, even if they did not reach her heart. Now, this woman was a widow, and it came to be his duty to tell her that she was <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>if</b> she should claim from him now the love which he had so often proffered to her! It was not that he feared that she would claim anything from him at this moment,--neither now, nor to-morrow, nor the next day,--but the agony of the present meeting would produce others in which there would be some tenderness mixed with the agony; and so from one meeting to another the thing would progress. Dalrymple knew well enough how such things might progress. But in this danger before him, it was not of himself that he was thinking, but of her. How could he assist her at such a time without doing her more injury than benefit? And, if he did not assist her, who would do so? He knew her to be heartless; but even heartless people have hearts which can be touched and almost broken by certain sorrows. Her heart would not be broken by her husband's death, but it would become very sore if she were utterly neglected. He was now at the door, with his hand on the lock, and was wondering why she should remain so long within without making herself heard. Then he opened it, and found her seated in a lounging-chair, {{with her back to the}} door, and he could see that she had a volume of a novel in her hand. He understood it all. She was pretending to be indifferent to her husband's return. He walked up to her, thinking that she would recognize his step; but she made no sign of turning towards him. He saw the motion of her hair over the back of the chair as she affected to make herself luxuriously comfortable. She was striving to let her husband see that she cared nothing for him, or for his condition, or for his jealousy, if he were jealous,--or even for his ruin. [...] "Mrs. Broughton," [...] he said, when he was close to her. Then she jumped up quickly, and turned round, facing him. [...] "Where is Dobbs?" [...] she said. [...] "Where is Broughton?" ...|$|E
