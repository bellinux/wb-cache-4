Analytical models {{have been widely used}} to estimate the impacts of <b>bank</b> <b>storage,</b> but are often based on assumptions of conditions that are rarely found in the field, such as vertical river banks and saturated flow. Numerical simulations of <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow in river-aquifer cross sections with vertical and sloping banks were undertaken using a fully-coupled, surface-subsurface flow model. Sloping river banks were found to increase the bank infiltration rates by 98 % and storage volume by 40 % for a bank slope of 3. 4 ° from horizontal, and for a slope of 8. 5 °, delay bank return flow by more than four times compared with vertical river banks and saturated flow. The results suggested that conventional analytical approximations cannot adequately be used to quantify <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> when <b>bank</b> slope is less than 60 ° from horizontal. Additionally, in the unconfined aquifers modeled, the analytical solutions did not accurately model <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow even in rivers with vertical banks due to a violation of the dupuit assumption. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow were also modeled for more realistic cross sections and river hydrograph from the Fitzroy River, Western Australia, to indicate the importance of accurately modeling sloping river banks at a field scale.

40|$|For {{predictive}} numerical {{simulations of}} subsurface floods (groundwater head rise {{due to high}} water in a contiguous river), {{it is important to}} know how to represent the <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> process in a numerical groundwater model.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of major hydrogeological {{controls}} on hyporheic exchange and <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water–groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) <b>bank</b> <b>storage,</b> (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2 -D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river–aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity − 1 significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> The <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> return/fill time ratio {{was positively related to}} wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river–aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater {{and surface}} water are often studied as {{different}} system; however, one commonly affects the other through various scenarios. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> {{is an important}} hydrogeological process, which involves the temporary storage and release of stream water in adjacent aquifers. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> can contribute {{a considerable amount of}} discharge to a river and can be an important process for movement of contamination downstream. Several studies document the effects of increasing stage and increasing storm duration; however, these controls are often separated. This project examines peak stage and storm duration to determine which factor is statistically more influential on the bank-storage process. The study focuses on a small reach of Little Kickapoo Creek, a third-order, perennial stream located in central Illinois. A 3 -D, transient-state numerical model (MODFLOW) was created of the study site, and 36 simulations were ran at various peak stages and storm durations. Results illustrate that peak stage and storm durations, while both influential, affect different areas of the bank-storage process. However, peak stage is statistically more influential in controlling the maximum volume of <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> (~ 3. 6 x) that occurs in the system and of the storage that remains in the system at 100 hours (~ 1. 1 x). While statistically less influential in determining storage remaining at 100 hours, increasing storm duration appears to be more effective on the retention of <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> Parafluvial exchange is important for evaluating <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> along a meandering stream, suggesting that at least 2 -D, ideally 3 -D, models are used to evaluate <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> Lastly, this study recognizes that <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> is the mechanism for road salt storage along the stream during winter months and the subsequent flushing of the chlorides back to the stream during the summer months...|$|R
