40|$|The {{focus of}} this note is on the <b>sparsest</b> cut in a capacitated, undirected graph. It {{turns out that the}} problem of finding a <b>sparsest</b> cut is NP-hard, yet the problem is {{interesting}} and important. The problem has applications to divide-and-conquer algorithms for approximately solving many hard combinatorial problems, such as balanced cuts, feedback arc set, minimum fill-in ordering, VLSI layout, minimum crossing-number layout, etc. First, we will motivate and prove a key theorem due to Leighton & Rao showing that the objective value of a <b>sparsest</b> cut is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value of an LP (linear programming) relaxation of the <b>sparsest</b> cut problem, and moreover, there is an efficient algorithm for finding such an approximately <b>sparsest</b> cut, i. e., a cut whose objective value is within a logarithmic factor of the objective value of the <b>sparsest</b> cut. After that, we introduce the notions of metric spaces and ` 1 -embeddings, discuss some of the connections to <b>sparsest</b> cuts and multicommodity flows, and prove a generalization of the LeightonRao theorem and algorithm, based on results of Bourgain and others. For completeness, we include a proof of Bourgain's theorem: by allowing a logarithmic distortion, any metric space has an ` 1 -embedding. Finally, we discuss a paradigm for approximately solving hard combinatorial problems by using a subroutine for finding approximately <b>sparsest</b> cuts. This paradigm easily gives a log-squared approximation guarantee. 11. 1 The <b>sparsest</b> cut problem and an LP relaxation Let G = (V; E) be an undirected graph, and let n denote jV j. Let u: E!!+ assign a nonnegative capacity to each edge. Throughout this chapter, for a cut ffi(S) of G, the ratio means the quantity u(ffi(S)) j Sj Δ jV nSj, and a <b>sparsest</b> cut is one whose ratio is minimum. (Note that ffi(S) is a set of edges, but we also associate the node set S with it. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} {{balanced and}} <b>sparsest</b> generator matrices for cyclic Reed-Solomon codes with any length n and dimension k. By <b>sparsest,</b> we mean that each row has the least possible number of nonzeros, while balanced {{means that the}} number of nonzeros in any two columns differs by at most one. Codes allowing such encoding schemes are useful in distributed settings where computational load-balancing is critical. The problem was first studied by Dau et al. who showed, using probabilistic arguments, that there always exists an MDS code over a sufficiently large field such that its generator matrix is both <b>sparsest</b> and balanced. Motivated by the need for an explicit construction with efficient decoding, the authors of the current paper showed that the generator matrix of a cyclic Reed-Solomon code of length n and dimension k can always be transformed to one that is both <b>sparsest</b> and balanced, when n and k are such that k/n (n-k+ 1) is an integer.

40|$|In a high-dimensional {{linear system}} of equations, {{constrained}} l 1 minimization {{methods such as}} the basis pursuit or the lasso are often used to recover one of the <b>sparsest</b> representations or approximations of the system. The null space property is a sucient and "almost" necessary condition to recover a <b>sparsest</b> representation with the basis pursuit. Unfortunately, this property {{can not be easily}} checked. On the other hand, the mutual coherence or the restricted isometry property are checkable sucient conditions insuring the basis pursuit to recover one of the <b>sparsest</b> representation. Because both of these conditions are too strong, they are hardly met in practice. Even with these conditions, to our knowledge, there is no theoretical result insuring that the lasso solution is one of the <b>sparsest</b> approximations. In this article, we study a novel constrained problem that gives, without any condition, one of the <b>sparsest</b> representations or approximations. To solve this problem, we provide a numerical method and we prove its convergence. Numerical experiments show that this approach gives better results than both the basis pursuit problem and the reweighted l 1 minimization problem...|$|R
