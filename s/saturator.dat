40|$|The {{carbonatation}} {{process at}} the Huletts refinery (Hulref) consists of adding a slurry of calcium hydroxide in water to the raw melt solution, to a desired pH. Carbon dioxide gas is then bubbled into the sugar solution, in <b>saturators,</b> under controlled conditions of alkalinity and temperature. Separation of the clear liquor and the calcium carbonate is done by filtration. The filter station at the refinery consists of 13 rotary leaf filters and four plate and frame filters. The performance of these filters has been deteriorating due to age and lack of maintenance. As a result there is a carryover of impurities which adversely affects {{the performance of the}} resin plant and also refined sugar quality. Options were considered regarding the way forward with the filter station. The installation of new filters was considered. Currently fully automated membrane filter presses are available that carry out both the filtration and de-sweetening of the calcium carbonate cake in one filtration step. This has major advantages in terms of operating personnel, liquor quality and quality of the filter cake. The new filters would reduce the moisture of the filter cake from 52 % to less than 30 %.

40|$|Catalytic {{ethylbenzene}} {{conversion to}} styrene {{which is one}} of the largest industrial processes worldwide was the main subject of this study. The surface structure of potassium-promoted iron oxide catalyst, which is the industrial catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, was studied. For that purpose ion scattering spectroscopy was used to determine the surface termination of this catalytic phase. The obtained observations, in agreement with previous studies, indicated that this phase is potassium terminated, and confirmed the fact that potassium should be on the surface of the catalyst to have its promoting action. There are several known drawbacks of the normal dehydrogenation process including endothermicity, deactivation and the large demand of preheated steam. Oxidative dehydrogenation process (ODH) of ethylbenzene is a promising candidate with several advantages. The absolutely metal free material Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) was chosen as a model catalyst for the ODH of ethylbenzene over carbon materials whose catalytic activity in this process has attracted a lot of interest. Since oxygen-containing groups are supposed to be the active centres of the ODH reactions, argon- and oxygen-sputtering followed by exposure to oxygen atmosphere was used to create those groups. Only oxygen sputtering proved to be efficient in introducing surface oxygen functionality. The sputtered surface was investigated using thermal programmed desorption spectroscopy, auger spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. TPD spectra revealed low-temperature CO 2 and high-temperature CO desorption peaks. Using SEM and AFM, and comparing the heavily oxygen-sputtered surface with the smooth surface of the cleaved samples, many pits and pin holes were seen on the surface which indicates a significant damage of the surface by repeated oxygen sputtering. Upon performing reaction experiments on cleaved and oxygen-sputtered HOPG, a percentage yield of styrene ranging from 0. 25 – 0. 6 % was obtained according to reaction conditions without any obvious difference between the cleaved and the oxygen sputtered samples. The system sensitivity was tested and verified. Additionally, the detected activity was proved to be originating from ODH process by performing oxygen-free experiments. Reaction data was also used to determine the apparent activation energy (Arrhenius) which was found to be in the range of 50 kJ/mol for both the cleaved and the oxygen sputtered samples. The reason for the similar results observed was discussed and different explanations were given in which carbonaceous depositions over the catalyst surface play a major role. The reaction rate over HOPG samples was determined, and compared to the active catalyst (onion-like carbon), this comparison lead to the conclusion of the reasonability of using HOPG as a model catalyst for further studies. As a last step, different techniques including SEM, AFM and temperature programmed analysis were used to study the catalyst after reaction. Temperature programmed desorption of cleaved samples after reaction have shown desorption peak of CO which indicates the presence of carbonaceous depositions on the surface because the cleaved surface is known not to evolve any COx at the used temperature range. Temperature programmed oxidation indicated that the carbonaceous deposits are composed mainly of carbon and oxygen. These deposits did not show any obvious redox behaviour. Upon exploring the surface morphology, the cleaved surface was found to be smooth before and after reaction. This is explained by the building of carbon depositions in one layer. On the other hand, the oxygen-sputtered samples were found to be rough before reaction, after reaction, the surface was still rough. This was explained as the building of carbon depositions taking place extensively on the basal plane of HOPG and not on the whole surface.

In industries, Citric acid is produced by fermentation process and after separation-purification processes, the end product {{is in the form of}} crystals. For pharmacy purpose, the quality of citric acid crystals is very important aspect, and the impurity substance which difficult to separate is iron-Fe. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of flow rate feed and temperature of <b>saturator</b> tanks against impurity of Fe in the products of citric acid crystals and to know the relationship between the crystal product rates with impurity of Fe in the product citric acid crystal. This research has used 4 liters MSMPR crystallizer, continuously operated, temperature of the crystallizer was keep constant at 20 oC using refrigeration system. Concentration of Fe in the feed was 40 ppm. Feed flow rates was variated (0, 5; 1; 1, 5; 2; 2, 5; 3) ml/sec. Temperature of <b>saturator</b> tank was variated (30, 40, 50) oC. Fe content in the citric acid crystal was analyzed using spectrophotometer. This research concludes that greater flow rate feed, the higher concentration of Fe impurity trapped in the product of citric acid crystal. Meanwhile, the higher the <b>saturator</b> temperature, concentration of Fe impurity in the product citric acid crystals became lower. The best condition was reached at flow rate feed 0. 5 ml / sec and at a temperature of <b>saturator</b> tank 50 oC. Weight of crystal produced in the best conditions is 101. 62 g with impurity concentration of Fe 0. 3 ppm. In addition, product rate of crystal influenced the level impurity of Fe contained in the citric acid crystals products.
