50|$|Segmental {{sliplining}} is {{very similar}} to continuous sliplining. The difference is primarily based on the pipe material used as the new carrier pipe. When using any bell and spigot pipe such as FRP, PVC, HDPE or <b>Spirally</b> <b>Welded</b> Steel Pipe, the individual pieces of pipe are lowered into place, pushed together, and pushed along the existing pipe corridor.|$|E

He {{spent a year}} getting over her death, after which he founded Natural Gas Tubes Starting with one steel unit, {{he went on to}} acquire more. This led to his founding the Caparo Group in 1968, which became one of the UKâ€™s largest steel conversion and distribution businesses, manufacturing an extensive range of structural steels, precision tube, <b>spirally</b> <b>welded</b> tube, special bar qualities, industrial wires, cold rolled strip and spring steel strip. Lord Paul stepped down from the management of the Caparo Group in 1996.|$|E

40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} <b>spirally</b> <b>welded</b> tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally welded tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for <b>spirally</b> <b>welded</b> tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on <b>spirally</b> <b>welded</b> tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - ovalisation relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|E
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{buckling}} behavior of <b>spirally</b> <b>welded</b> steel tubes. First, an existing analytical solution {{and the results of}} an extended experimental investigation are investigated. The imperfections measured during testing are investigated and classified, and methods are proposed to incorporate them into finite element models. Buckling analyses are carried out using finite element software, the resulting eigenmodes are characterized, and the response of tubes to various combinations of buckling modes is investigated. Next, the tubes themselves are modeled, incorporating these imperfections, full material models, and residual stresses. The results are compared to the results of the experimental program. Statistical analyses are also performed to investigate the accuracy of the models. Finally, parameter studies are carried out in order to investigate the effect that various parameters have on the response of the tubes, both in terms of critical curvature and maximum moment. The parameters are characterized based on their significance, and recommendations are made for future research. ...|$|E
