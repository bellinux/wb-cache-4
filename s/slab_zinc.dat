40|$|Report {{issued by}} the U. S. Bureau of Mines {{discussing}} the U. S. slab-zinc consumption between the years of 1940 - 1945. As stated in the introduction, "this information circular summarized basic data collected for many years by the Bureau of Mines, but in particular presents for the 1940 - 45 period details derived from the comprehensive <b>slab</b> <b>zinc</b> consumption survey inaugurated in 1940 " (p. 3). The different uses for <b>slab</b> <b>zinc</b> are presented. This report includes maps, tables, and illustrations...|$|E
40|$|This report compares {{estimated}} {{production costs}} from four energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, chemical and non-ferrous metals) in the European Union and some third countries. Production costs have been estimated following a bottom-up approach, i. e. using information at facility level from a representative number of facilities. Costs are broken down to key factors, such as material, labour and energy costs and exclude capital costs (depreciation and interest). Moreover, the energy costs are estimated considering {{the effect of}} the state of technologies and the fuel mix in each country. For the iron and steel industry the production costs of hot-rolled coil and wire rod are analysed as representative flat and long products, respectively. The production costs of these products have been estimated for both the integrated route (blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace) and the recycling route (electrical arc furnace). For the chemical industry, the products analysed are ammonia, methanol, ethylene and propylene; whereas for the non-ferrous metals the analysis is focused on primary aluminium production, copper cathodes and <b>slabs</b> of <b>zinc.</b> Most of the EU 28 production costs are ranked (when compared with certain competitor countries) between the 75 th percentile and the maximum production cost. These costs are highest in the EU relative to other countries or regions in the case of flat products from the recycling route, ammonia and methanol. For long products -from the recycling route-, flat products -from the integrated route-, ethylene, propylene -refinery grade- and copper anode the EU 28 production costs are between the median (the median separates the higher half of the costs from the lower half) and the 75 th percentile of all production costs estimated. In the case of cement, the EU 28 production cost is quite similar to the value of the median cost. There are also cases in which the EU 28 production costs were among the lowest costs, namely for copper cathode and <b>zinc</b> <b>slabs.</b> It is worth noting that the contribution of energy costs to production costs is the highest in the EU only for methanol and ammonia. For all other products and industries analysed (including methanol and ammonia), other components of the cost (raw materials, labour and others or feedstock) contribute more to final costs than energy (natural gas is considered as a feedstock for methanol and ammonia). It is also noteworthy that, in most industries and products, the behaviour of credits (by-products, home scrap, electricity production from waste gases or from combined heat and power) contributes to reduce production costs more in the EU than it does in other countries or regions.

40|$|Our study compares {{production}} {{costs of the}} non-ferrous metals (NFM) industry in the European Union (EU) and other countries {{in order to understand}} whether these costs are higher in Europe. Our analysis focuses on copper and zinc, since they are considered to be the most greatly consumed non-ferrous metals after aluminium. The countries selected for comparison depend on the metal and are based on high shares of extra-EU 28 trade and/or of global installed capacity. A bottom-up approach has been followed, based on information at facility level for primary production of the two metals. The analysis includes 32 copper smelters, 34 copper refineries and 23 zinc smelters, representing 72 %, 58 % and 30 % of global production of copper anodes, cathodes and <b>zinc</b> <b>slab</b> respectively. Taking into consideration the complex structure of the industry, costs are broken down to three components: (1) Energy, (2) Labour and other costs (salaries, consumables and other on-site costs) and (3) Credits (due to co-products). Our findings suggest that although interesting observations emerge in each of these components, overall costs compare more favourably among countries than initially thought. The EU industry does not have the highest {{production costs}}. On the contrary, {{especially in the case of}} copper refineries and zinc, it has lower production costs than most of the countries included in the study. JRC.
