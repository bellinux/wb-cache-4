Acknowledging the harm caused to nature by humans, the Advisory Board asked {{for the implementation of}} [...] "a set of ecologic skills unknown in this country today". A call to arms was raised for exploring new methods of active protection and restoration of plant and animal life in the national parks: [...] "Americans have shown a great capacity for degrading and fragmenting native biotas. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not exercised much imagination or ingenuity in rebuilding damaged biotas.

Working {{with only one}} transmitter, the station alternated radio broadcasts with silent television images of the station's call sign, faces in motion, and wind-up toys in motion. Speaking later that month, Gernsback downplayed the broadcasts, intended for amateur experimenters. [...] "In six months we may have television for the public, but <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not got it."

2500|$|Bob Rae, 58, was the Ontario New Democratic Party Premier of Ontario from 1990 to 1995 and was {{a federal}} NDP MP for Broadview—Greenwood in the House of Commons from 1978 to 1982. Since leaving electoral politics, Rae worked {{on a number of}} {{contentious}} issues for the federal government, most notably the Air India disaster; worked in international relations advising on constitutional issues and conducted a study for the Ontario government on post-secondary education. Rae joined the Liberal Party in April 2006 (he had previously been a Liberal in the 1960s) before launching a centrist campaign that month. In a speech to the Canadian Club of Winnipeg on March 13, 2006, Rae expressed his interest in uniting the 'progressive' forces of Canada in order to regain a majority government in the Canadian House of Commons.

2500|$|<b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> spoken only of {{the office}} of Prime {{properly}} so called, which ends like the other Little Hours. It is followed by some prayers which are called the office of the chapter, and are composed in the Roman Liturgy of the reading of the martyrology, of a prayer, [...] "Sancta Maria et omnes sancti" [...] ("May holy Mary and all the Saints..."), a prayer concerning work, [...] "Respice in servos tuos [...] [...] [...] Dirigere et sanctificare" [...] ("Look upon thy servants... Direct and sanctify"), and a blessing. This addition to Prime is a legacy bequeathed by the monks to the secular clergy. As has been said above, originally after Prime the monks had to betake themselves to manual work or reading. The office therefore ended with a prayer for their work [...] "... et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos et opus manuum nostrarum dirige" [...] ("...and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct."), and the prayer [...] "Dirigere". Later the reading of the martyrology, the necrology, the rule, and a prayer for the dead were added.|$|E

It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition.|$|R
