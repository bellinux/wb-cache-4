5|$|Some {{exploitation}} style documentaries {{purported to}} show actual events but were instead staged, elaborate ruses. The most prominent {{of which was}} Ingagi (1931), a film which claimed to show a ritual where African women were given over to gorillas as sex slaves, but instead was mostly filmed in Los Angeles using local blacks in place of natives. Douglas Fairbanks mocked the phoniness of many pre-Code documentaries in his parody Around the World in 80 Minutes with Douglas Fairbanks, in one scene of which he filmed himself wrestling a stuffed tiger doll, then a tiger-skin rug. Opposing these films was the travelogue which was shown before features {{and served as a}} short <b>saccharine</b> form of cinematic tourism.|$|E
25|$|Dickens was {{regarded}} as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, {{like many of his}} novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of <b>saccharine</b> sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its legal}} troubles, SST {{continued}} to release records by artists including Minutemen, <b>Saccharine</b> Trust, and Meat Puppets. In 1982 Minneapolis hardcore group Hüsker Dü became the label's first non-West Coast signing. Following {{the resolution of}} the debacle with Unicorn Records, SST released four Black Flag albums in 1984. The multiple Black Flag albums, along with the double album releases Zen Arcade and Double Nickels on the Dime by Hüsker Dü and the Minutemen, respectively, stretched the label's resources. While SST believed Zen Arcade would be a sizable underground hit, pressings of over 5,000 copies were unknown territory for the label, so it erred {{on the side of caution}} and did not print over that number in its initial pressing. Awarded critical acclaim by several mainstream media outlets, Zen Arcade sold out quickly and remained out of print for months. Ginn decided to cut the promotional costs of the Black Flag albums by issuing them in quick succession and having the band tour solidly behind the releases.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} new material, {{the band}} each selected songs for different {{sides of the}} double album, with the fourth side named [...] "Chaff". Several songs on Double Nickels on the Dime were outsourced to or inspired by contemporaries, such as Black Flag's Henry Rollins and Jack Brewer of <b>Saccharine</b> Trust.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has a scene (using actual {{footage from}} A Space Odyssey) {{in which the}} {{monolith}} morphs into a chocolate bar. Catholic News wrote that the film [...] "had subtle and obvious riffs on everything from the <b>saccharine</b> Disney [...] "Small World" [...] exhibit to Munchkinland to, most brilliantly, a hilarious takeoff on Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} show [...] "wholly revised and gleefully self-aware... a few tons {{short of a}} mega-musical – no fake {{helicopters}} here, no power ballads <b>saccharine</b> enough to stop Communism in its tracks." [...] The Hollywood Reporter thought the revival was, [...] "while not perfect, an exhilarating accomplishment". [...] Variety called it [...] "a bold theatrical operation, an artistic success".|$|E
500|$|In 1954, {{the guitarist}} Chuck Wayne became Bennett's musical director. Bennett {{released}} his first long-playing album in 1955, Cloud 7. The album {{was billed as}} featuring Wayne and showed Bennett's leanings towards jazz. In 1957, Ralph Sharon became Bennett's pianist, arranger, and musical director, replacing Wayne. Sharon told Bennett that a career singing [...] "sweet <b>saccharine</b> songs like 'Blue Velvet'" [...] wouldn't last long, and encouraged Bennett to focus even more on his jazz inclinations.|$|E
500|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour {{was widely}} praised by critics and fans. Natalie Torres, of the {{newspaper}} Dia a Dia, said that [...] "Arjona knows how to handle his 'girls', {{with a mix of}} attitudes from a 'rough' male and seductive lyrics." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported, [...] "Arjona is one of Latin pop's finest lyricists: observant, nuanced, sometimes wry, sometimes melancholy and especially fond of the play of opposites...unlike some of his fellow Latin pop stars, Mr. Arjona is no <b>saccharine</b> lover boy." ...|$|E

Minogue's vocals are synthesised and are {{delivered in a}} breathy and whispery manner. According to music magazine Spin, the song describes Minogue's [...] "addiction to love" [...] through a chocolate simile. PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand called its lyrics [...] "steamy," [...] citing the line [...] "Hold me and control me and then/ Melt me slowly down" [...] as an example. Helen Pidd from The Guardian found the lyrics to be [...] "packed with <b>saccharine</b> innuendo." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as [...] "the John Lennon of the {{swinging}} Northwest", appeared [...] "unusually tortured by success" [...] and struggled with {{an addiction to}} heroin. Rumors surfaced in early 1994 that Cobain suffered a drug overdose and that Nirvana was breaking up. On April 8, 1994, Cobain {{was found dead in}} his Seattle home from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound; Nirvana summarily disbanded. Cobain's suicide [...] "served as a catalyst for grunge’s...demise", because it [...] "...deflated the energy from grunge and provided the opening for <b>saccharine</b> and corporate-formulated music to regain" [...] its lost footing." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{was voted}} number 25 on MTV's 25 Best Songs of 2011. James Montgomery wrote that the song was a [...] "supremely <b>saccharine</b> single from {{erstwhile}} Girls Aloud member mashes together every notable pop moment in recent history, yet somehow manages to be better that {{the sum of its}} parts. That's thanks mostly to the supercharged, sing-a-long chorus, where the whole thing comes together in a head-spinning rush. She should go solo more often." [...] The song was also listed on Billboard magazine's Best Songs of 2011 list at number 14. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was listed as The Guardians 14th best song.|$|E
500|$|... "I fear Mariah Carey. Superficially, {{she might}} seem like a {{purveyor}} of <b>saccharine</b> bilge like 'Hero' ... But that's bullshit.

And her most fiendish weapon is the duet. If the MOR market needs servicing, she'll duet with Luther or Whitney ... If her contemporary edge needs sharpening, she'll hang with the Wu-Tang Clan ...

500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said, [...] "Of all the ballads, though, {{the quiet}} piano closer 'Glitter in the Air' takes the cake, never once overplaying its hand, {{remaining}} sweet without once ever succumbing to <b>saccharine</b> niceties (think of a Jason Robert Brown song without the vocal showboating). It's the sweetest {{moment on the}} entire disc, but it only succeeds because it's also the least complex song here". Craig Emonds of The South End stated that while [...] "every song has potential to do well and is quite likable, [...] Pink's vocals are strong and shine particularly in the ballad 'Glitter In The Air'." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moodoy of the Associated Press said that [...] "What makes the song so moving is that despite all of the heartache, she doesn't appear gun-shy about taking the leap again".|$|E

RPGamer commented [...] "Final Fantasy Fables is quite unique, offering a wide variety of gaming options. While building on the massive world of the Final Fantasy series, it takes a new spin in an attempt at something fresh." [...] Edge magazine referred to the game as a [...] "decent effort". They complemented the visuals, but stated [...] "the execution and appeal is limited". IGN called Chocobo Tales a [...] "surprisingly fun and engaging experience." [...] GameSpot stated [...] "it might look like just another kid's game, but {{there is a lot of}} quality gaming buried under the <b>saccharine</b> visuals." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the other}} two tracks were {{generally}} positive. Brackpool wrote favorably about [...] "Grand Ideas" [...] and made comparisons to Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, while Hoffman named it the most danceable track on the album. Though Battaglia felt the song kept repeating the same chord progression, he believed the [...] "accents and shifts in pitch" [...] strengthened it. Jeff Rovinelli writing for Tiny Mix Tapes thought [...] "The Long Way Home" [...] sounded silly. Brackpool agreed, writing [...] " [...] isolated {{from the rest of the}} album [...] could easily pass for generic library music..." [...] While Draper considered it a solid song, he decided it was a [...] "little too <b>saccharine</b> for its own good". Hoffman enjoyed the song and wrote [...] "the vibe is rangy and exultant [...] as blissful and bemused as the vehemently unpretentious [...] shot of Lindstrøm." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Two More Lonely People" [...] was {{described}} by Evan Sawdey of PopMatters as [...] "one moment of carefree dance-pop joy" [...] that was reminiscent of material from her earlier Hannah Montana soundtracks; he also stated that the lyrics delivered in [...] "Forgiveness and Love" [...] were among the [...] "more over-the-top cutesy moments" [...] throughout the record, specifically commenting that the lines [...] "The only thing that / Our hearts are made of / Are the acts of forgiveness and love" [...] were [...] "so unbelievably <b>saccharine</b> that Hallmark would ultimately have to turn them down". Robert Ham from Christianity Today felt that [...] "Permanent December" [...] discussed the story of [...] "the devoted girlfriend pushing aside the 'sexy boys' vying for her affections", while [...] "Stay" [...] addressed the difficulties in maintaining a long-distance relationship.|$|E
500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it <b>saccharine</b> and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes, and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E

[...] Hal Lipper of the St. Petersburg Times remarked that it [...] "is an enormously engaging cartoonquite a feat when you consider the <b>saccharine</b> psychobabble passing for dialogue". The Miami Heralds Bill Cosford gave it {{two and a half stars}} out of four, the same rating he had applied to its predecessor.

500|$|The lyrics on Primary Colours often {{focus on}} mundane topics {{pertaining}} {{to the lives of}} ordinary people, including watching TV and eating ice cream, while its music often features shredding power chords. According to The Washington Posts Chris Richards, the music represents a new, gentler type of punk rock in the vein of No Age and Abe Vigoda. Richards also wrote that Suppression [...] " [...] these upbeat rock tunes from becoming too <b>saccharine</b> with a nervy delivery that's part David Byrne, part Iggy Pop". A similar sentiment was expressed by David Bevan of Pitchfork Media, who wrote [...] "there's a softening of edges taking place throughout, a band testing limits after having already refined them". He also described it as an [...] "artfully polished extension of its predecessor". Current described the album as [...] "a bit more '82ish than the '76ish sound of our first LP, slightly less frantic and maybe a bit more palatable".|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} the song is [...] "a slower, less {{addictive}} variation" [...] of [...] "We Belong Together". Newsday critic, Glenn Gamboa, also called it a [...] "We Belong Together-sh ballad". In separate reviews of the song, both David Balls and Nick Levine of Digital Spy also compared the song to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together"; the former rated [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] three out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "It {{may not be the}} most original of songs, but Carey's emotion-packed vocals make this a pleasant treat after some vacuous recent offerings." [...] Freedom De Luc from The Washington Post described the song as an [...] "emotive ballad", while Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Foster's Daily Democrat noted [...] "it could have been recorded in her early '90s heyday — except it's not as <b>saccharine</b> as some of her early work". However, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described it as one of the album's [...] "worst songs".|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{interest}} in music started at around {{ten years of}} age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: [...] "I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so {{madly in love with}} it, it's all I did". He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but was so nervous he played {{with his back to the}} audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. [...] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. [...] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: [...] "I love every single kind of music ... even the most <b>saccharine,</b> sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s".|$|E
500|$|Rick Cohoon of Allmusic {{praised the}} album for its musical variety, saying, [...] "With artists as well {{anchored}} in the business as Diamond Rio, the musical quality is a given. The real challenge is outdoing yourself {{and coming up with}} fresh concepts. The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal". He cited [...] "Beautiful Mess" [...] and [...] "I Believe" [...] as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track [...] "Rural Philharmonic" [...] (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) {{as an example of the}} band's strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable, commending the [...] "masterful musicianship" [...] and Roe's [...] "light vocal timbre", while criticizing the song selections as [...] "mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of 'I Believe' to the <b>saccharine</b> sentiments of 'We All Fall Down.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly <b>saccharine,</b> yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|Many critics noted Several {{songs are}} built on the same formula of [...] "You're a Jerk", with Allmusic noting that, [...] "Dot Com," [...] "Colors," [...] "Turnt," [...] and [...] "So Dope" [...] (which the chorus is a sound bite from the 1992 film Class Act) all have the cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good. The review also said [...] "R ballad [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] featuring smooth Auto-tuned vocals from Ray J, the B.A.S.S.-inspired [...] "Bunz", the slow jam [...] "New Girl," [...] and the rollicking [...] "Cashmere," [...] which bumps along like a New Jack rap jam, are nice diversions." [...] On the album split, The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The album begins to lose circulation toward its end, when the pair lose their lambent wit in favor of mawkish lover-boy ballads better left to Sean Kingston albums." [...] Jeff Weiss of the newspaper used [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] as an example, noting that its sounds have [...] "a <b>saccharine</b> sappiness and contrived tone that feels {{at odds with the}} otherwise organic-sounding album." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator complemented the video {{by saying that}} the [...] "standout track from Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and it’s given an extra sheen thanks to a quirky, unconventional video that doesn’t shy away from the dark tone of the song’s lyrics". Brian Zacher from AXS.com said that the video shares the [...] "greatness" [...] with the previous one, [...] "Just the Way You Are". James Montgomery of MTV News gave a mixed review on the video, in which he said [...] "after all, it would’ve been easy — and expected — to make something slick, sexy and/or <b>saccharine,</b> a glossy thing where he croons from a rooftop somewhere, removes his shirt, and somehow ends up with the girl. None of that happens here. Rather, we see Mars struggling and sweating, being taunted and tempted, falling and rising again... He ends up alone, unloved. He probably gets flattened by a train". On another review by Montgomery, the singer redemption is refereed because Mars [...] "distances himself from his smoove-crooning contemporaries, and he does it simply by being real. Really dramatic, really emotional, really clever. This one’s a winner, even if, at the end of it, Mars has lost everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Buy, Buy Baby" [...] was watched by approximately 3.7million households, according to Nielsen ratings.

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal said Spears' appearance on the show was [...] "uninspired". Lenny Ann Low of The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Spears as a right-wing co-host was a miss. [...] "It proves she can talk and avoid the furniture but her flitting, one-dimensional character feels like a stunt." [...] In Low's opinion, {{the only thing that}} saved the episode from a [...] "thumbs down", was [...] "its message about finding the courage to be yourself in a sea of conservatism, <b>saccharine</b> though that sounds." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thought Spears [...] "bombed" [...] in the episode, and [...] Jeff Hidek of Star-News disliked the Southern accent she used in her performance. The Plain Dealers Mark Dawidziak commented: [...] "Granted, the episode wasn't very well written, but Spears seemed more out of place on the show than Megan Mullally's Karen at a sensitivity seminar." ...|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} <b>saccharine</b> at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium." ...|$|E

The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Mike Hale of the New York Times felt that [...] "Throwdown": [...] "emphasized the show's increasingly dual nature" [...] whereby [...] "the students are in a pretty good musical, and the adults are in a below-average dramedy." [...] Wendy Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly deemed the episode [...] "welcome light relief", while Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "perhaps Glees sharpest episode yet", describing it as [...] "chock-full of standout scenes". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, criticizing it for [...] "overly earnest, <b>saccharine</b> moments" [...] but commenting that it was a [...] "great example" [...] of Glee [...] "just being damn funny".|$|E
500|$|Contra la Corriente {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised Marc Anthony's singing. Terry Jenkins of Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 and praised Anthony's vocals as being [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "near-flawless" [...] though {{he felt that}} it [...] "doesn't quite match the dizzying heights of his breakthrough Todo a Su Tiempo". David Wilson of Wilson & Alroy's Record Reviews called the tunes [...] "solid" [...] and praised Anthony's voice but criticized Peña's production as being [...] "slavishly" [...] similar to the previous album. Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune names Contra la Corriente as Anthony's best album and felt that the influence of Cuban music was prominent [...] "in the rhythms and harmonies" [...] in comparison to Los Van Van. Ernesto Lechner of the Los Angeles Times, who was more critical of the album, gave it two-out-of-four stars criticizing the arrangements as [...] "unbearably soapy" [...] and called the album a [...] "flawed masterpiece in the <b>saccharine</b> genre of salsa romantica." [...] An editor for Billboard magazine felt Anthony should [...] "build on his towering reputation with another radio-appropriate package". [...] Contra la Corriente was named the eighth best album of 1997 by Time magazine stating that [...] "...whether you habla espanol or not, Anthony's talent comes through, no translation needed".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its <b>saccharine</b> content.|$|E
500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{propelled}} {{the story}} arc for season six by allowing characters to confess previously taboo issues {{to themselves and}} each other. Whedon commented that he was [...] "obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, about saying things we haven't said", comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode [...] "Hush", in which characters begin communicating when they stop talking. According to Buffy essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes' [...] "false <b>saccharine</b> behaviour" [...] impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon {{to force them to}} be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, spontaneous combustion, is an allusion to Bleak House by Charles Dickens—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during [...] "Going Through the Motions". Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number [...] "If We're Together", beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible. Although she asks in verse [...] "Apocalypse / We've all been there / The same old trips / Why should we care?", all the Scoobies join her, including Giles despite his suspicions that Buffy is no longer interested in her life.|$|E

In South Korea, they are credited as the lead female group that shifted the public's focus back to female idols after the Korean music industry experienced an influx of male idol groups from 2002 to 2007. ABC's news program Nightline referred to Girls' Generation as the [...] "hottest act" [...] of K-pop. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian emphasized the group's claim of being [...] "Asia's No 1 girl group" [...] on their Twitter page and said that [...] "anything more would be superfluous." [...] CNN noted {{the group as a}} [...] "national phenomenon" [...] in South Korea and labelled them the [...] "Asian version" [...] of British girl group Spice Girls, while fashion expert David Yi of Mashable described the group as the sole contributor who turned K-pop into a [...] "huge phenomenon." [...] Tyler Brûlé of the Financial Times selected the group as the seventh most recognizable figure of Korean culture, the only musical act to make the list. Japanese magazine Nikkei Business suggested the group's international expansion and success was the musical equivalent to Samsung's global trend. Hoai-Tran Bui from USA Today also wrote: [...] "Girls Generation remains the popular girl group in Korea, and their continued success as one of the main purveyors of classic, <b>saccharine</b> retro pop showcases the lasting strength of K-pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again".

I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago.
