50|$|Relays and {{contactors}} used {{to control}} plant and machinery {{in the early days}} of control technology. In the event of a hazardous situation, the actuator was simply isolated from the energy supply. This type of protection system could be manipulated in the event of a malfunction, disabling the protective function. Special relay circuits, such as the three-contactor combination, were the first designs to come out of deliberations into how this could be avoided. These device combinations led to the development of the first <b>safety</b> <b>relay</b> from the German automation manufacturer Pilz, the PNOZ.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{design of}} a first-generation <b>safety</b> <b>relay</b> {{is based on the}} classic three-contactor combination. The {{redundant}} design ensures that wiring errors do not lead to the loss of the safety function. Two relays (K1, K2) with positive-guided contacts provide the safe switching contacts. The two input circuits CH1 and CH2 each activate one of the two internal relays. The circuit is activated via the start relay K3. There is another monitoring circuit between the connection points Y1 and Y2 (feedback loop). This connection is used to check and monitor the position of actuators, which are activated or shut down via the safety contacts. The device is designed {{in such a way that}} any faults in the input circuit are detected, e.g. contact welding on an emergency off/emergency stop pushbutton or on one of the safety contacts on the output relay. The safety device stops the device switching back on and thereby stops the activation of relays K1 and K2.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the failure was the setting of a {{protective}} relay {{on one of the}} transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. The <b>safety</b> <b>relay</b> was set to trip if other protective equipment deeper within the Ontario Hydro system failed to operate properly.On a particularly cold November evening, power demands for heating, lighting, and cooking were pushing the electrical system to near its peak capacity. Transmission lines heading into Southern Ontario were heavily loaded. The system operators were not aware of a potential ambiguity between the extremely heavy power flows into Ontario and the setting upon which the relay was properly designed to operate. As a result of this ambiguity, at 5:16 p.m. Eastern Time, a small variation of power originating from the Robert Moses generating plant in Lewiston, New York caused the relay to trip, disabling a main power line heading into Southern Ontario. Instantly, the power that was flowing on the tripped line transferred to the other lines, causing them to become overloaded. Their own protective relays, which are also designed to protect the line from overload, tripped, isolating Beck Station from all of Southern Ontario.|$|E

40|$|Child {{safety and}} the {{prevention}} of child maltreatment can be {{considered one of the}} most important issues underneath the umbrella of childhood education. Despite the fact that child safety is not usually one of the subjects that comes to rnind when discussing elementary academia, the topic of {{safety and the}} prevention of child maltreatment remains largely one of the most important lessons to be taught. Child maltreatment, such as child abuse and neglect, can affect children dramatically from both a physical and a psychological standpoint, sometimes following individuals from childhood through the rest of their lives. For this reason, children of any age, beginning as early as possible, should learn how to be safe in common day-to-day situations in order that abusive situations can be avoided. Children should be told that they are unique human beings with a particular dignity, and as such, are deserving of treatment that represents both love and respect.

40|$|International audience—Road safety can be {{improved}} a lot {{with the help of}} Cooperative Collision Warning System, in which vehicles cooperate with each other for <b>relaying</b> <b>safety</b> messages to avoid accidents.

We aim to minimize the total transmission energy and reduce the transmission interference for delivering emergency safety messages to endangered vehicles while guaranteeing timeliness of safety messages and transmission reliability of inter-vehicle communications. The emergency safety message dissemination problem is formulated as a spanning tree optimization problem with both hop-count constraint and reliability-height constraint.

40|$|There {{has been}} some concern that, as nuclear power plants age, {{protective}} measures taken to control and minimize the impact of fire may become ineffective, or significantly less effective, and hence result in an increased fire risk. One objective of the Fire Vulnerability of Aged Electrical Components Program is to assess the effects of aging and service wear on the fire vulnerability of electrical equipment. An increased fire vulnerability of components may lead to an overall increase in fire risk to the plant. Because of their widespread use in various electrical <b>safety</b> systems, electromechanical <b>relays</b> were chosen to be the initial components for evaluation. This test program assessed the impact of operational and thermal aging on the vulnerability of these relays to fire-induced damage. Only thermal effects of a fire were examined in this test program.

The purpose of this test program was to assess whether the fire vulnerability of electrical relays increased with aging.

The relays tested were Agastat GPI, General Electric (GE) HMA, HGA, and HFA. At least two relays of each type were artificially aged {{and at least two}} relays of each type were new.

However, it is a standard of practice in which {{all members of the}} operating theater provide their full and {{undivided attention}}. Standards of patient care should be contiguous throughout the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative stages of surgery. In this manner, it is expected that the same undivided attention afforded during the timeout should be maintained when transferring the patient to the postanesthesia care unit. Methods: In this study, information was collected regarding handover of information during the transfer status postsurgical procedures. Data were collected via observing interactions between the anesthesiologist and the nurse during verbal patient transfers. Results: This study demonstrated that the presence of undivided attention during the handover of a surgical patient in the postanesthesia care unit has a direct correlation with improved recall of the information discussed during handover. Conclusion: Focus is on the quantity of information that can be recalled by the transferring nurse, and whether or not undivided attention affects the outcome. Analysis focuses on suggestions to better improve patient safety and recovery when being transferred in an anesthetic setting. The practice of patient handover should be standardized to better improve the safety and quality of medical care.
