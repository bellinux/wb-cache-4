Carleton is a rake– a sexually experienced man {{who refuses to}} conform to many of society's guidelines.

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would <b>soon</b> <b>find</b> its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E

5|$|Brian {{begins to}} search for a way {{to get back to the}} United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they travel to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a {{diversion}} in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They <b>soon</b> <b>find</b> a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is horrified to learn that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would <b>soon</b> <b>find</b> {{its way into the}} engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E

The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children.

25|$|This {{exhibition}} {{also featured}} La Maison cubiste. Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed facade of a 10 meter by 3 meter house, {{which included a}} hall, a living room and a bedroom. This installation {{was placed in the}} Art Décoratif section of the Salon d'Automne. The major contributors were André Mare, a decorative designer, Roger de La Fresnaye, Jacques Villon and Marie Laurencin.

The groundsman then visits the four, and agrees to help them if they will take him to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|The {{artist has}} broken down the picture plane into facets, {{presenting}} multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would <b>soon</b> <b>find</b> {{its way into the}} foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen.
