5|$|Only a {{minority}} of war memorials used some of the newer styles emerging in the inter-war period, such as modernism, realist and Art Nouveau approaches. As noted above, typically existing, traditional themes were preferred for memorials {{as a way of}} grounding mourning in a more familiar perspective. Nonetheless, some of the memorials to use the newer styles became particularly famous. There are a handful of memorials conducted in an Art Deco style, including the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney which uses the delicate aspects of the Art Deco style to invoke <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> the viewer, and is the only war memorial in the world to depict a naked soldier. The Douaumont Ossuary also draws on Art Deco principles in its structural architecture, avoiding straight lines in favour of gentle, soft, intersecting curves. Modernist principles were taken further in a small number of British memorials designed by Eric Gill, characterised by their highly abstract, simplified forms.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E

The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.|$|E
25|$|The 1860s were {{a period}} of great <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> Liszt's private life. On December 13, 1859, he lost his 20-year-old son Daniel, and on September 11, 1862, his 26-year-old {{daughter}} Blandine also died. In letters to friends, Liszt afterwards {{announced that he would}} retreat to a solitary living. He found it at the monastery Madonna del Rosario, just outside Rome, where on June 20, 1863, he took up quarters in a small, Spartan apartment. He had on June 23, 1857, already joined the Third Order of Saint Francis.|$|E

25|$|The Megillah is {{read with}} a cantillation (a {{traditional}} chant) differing from that {{used in the}} customary reading of the Torah. Besides the traditional cantillation, there are several verses or short phrases in the Megillah that are chanted in a different chant, the chant that is traditional for {{the reading of the}} book of Lamentations. These verses are particularly sad, or they refer to Jews being in exile. When the Megillah reader jumps to the melody of the book of Lamentations for these phrases, it heightens the feeling of <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> the listener.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. The overall pattern of results across studies indicates that people diagnosed with psychopathy demonstrate reduced MRI, fMRI, aMRI, PET, and SPECT activity {{in areas of the}} brain. Some recent fMRI studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives). Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. Meta-analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and <b>sadness)</b> <b>in</b> both adults and children/adolescents.|$|E

500|$|In {{his essay}} <b>Sadness</b> <b>in</b> Palestine?!, Dan Miron explores Kafka's {{connection}} to Zionism: [...] "It seems {{that those who}} claim that {{there was such a}} connection and that Zionism {{played a central role in}} his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles". Kafka considered moving to Palestine with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied Hebrew while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod's from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal's and Rabbi Julius Guttmann's classes in the Berlin [...] (College for the Study of Judaism).|$|E
500|$|Upon {{reaching}} [...] at {{the summit}} of the glacier, at 85°36′S, Amundsen prepared for the final stage of the journey. Of the 45dogs who had made the ascent (7 had perished during the Barrier stage), only 18 would go forward; the remainder were to be killed for food. Each of the sledge-drivers killed dogs from his own team, skinned them, and divided the meat between dogs and men. [...] "We called the place the Butchers' Shop", Amundsen recalled. [...] "here was depression and <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> the air; we had grown so fond of our dogs". Regrets did not prevent the team from enjoying the plentiful food; Wisting proved particularly skilful in his preparation and presentation of the meat.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{first two}} songs are a one-two {{introduction}} to the rapper and what he is up to. There is a gloomy interior monologue about success, the lack of it, and Cudi's inner conflicts, where he welcomes listeners by saying they are in his dreams. [...] "Soundtrack 2 My Life" [...] is a more courageous theme song where he proclaims, [...] "This is the soundtrack to my life". In it he states that his family {{did not see the}} <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> him and that he has not been right since his father's death.

500|$|Film scholar Peter Hames has {{summarized}} three {{themes of}} Loves of a Blonde {{that have been}} discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film, themes that have {{been something of a}} constant throughout Forman's career: [...] "the impermanence of young love, the confusion and despair of middle age, and the gulf between the generations". [...] Another theme that is often identified involves the awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society. Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> the film's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state, [...] although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism, others point out that the grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy, but that individuals create their own isolation as well.|$|E

Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, praising the guest stars and the way the Doctor's character was explored. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, also gave a positive review, praising the creepiness, Karan and Leonidas' performances, and the <b>sadness</b> <b>in</b> the ending.
