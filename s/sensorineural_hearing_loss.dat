5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. <b>Sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} of anomalies seen with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{result in a}} distinct diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for the disorder are broad distal phalanges of the thumbs and big toes, accompanied by a broad and shortened nose, <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and developmental delay, with predominant occurrence in males.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between preference judgments and discrimination scores obtained using flat and selective amplification. Sixteen subjects with sloping <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> listened to tapes of PB words and sentences, which had been recorded through flat and selective response hearing aids. Preference judgments and discrimination scores were obtained for each subject. The {{results of this study}} indicate that individuals with sloping <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> do understand speech best with selective amplification. The results also indicate that there is no significant difference between preference judgments for flat or selective amplification.

The auditory system, consisting of external ear, middle ear, inner ear, organ of Corti, basilar membrane, hair cells, inner hair cells, outer hair cells, innervation of hair cells, and transducer mechanisms, is discussed.

5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E

40|$|By the {{utilization}} of reconstructive procedures (tympanoplasty), middle ear and mastoid infections can be eliminated with the acquisition of a clean, dry ear in about nine out of 10 cases, and hearing can be improved in {{about half of the}} patients so treated. Incapacitating attacks of Ménière's disease can be successfully treated in selected cases by labyrinthectomy, ultrasound destruction of the vestibular system, or streptomycin treatment.

40|$|For signal {{detection}} and identification, the auditory system needs to integrate sound over time. It is frequently {{assumed that the}} quantity ultimately integrated is sound intensity and that the integrator is located centrally. However, we have recently shown that absolute thresholds are much better specified as the temporal integral of the pressure envelope than of intensity, and we proposed that the integrator resides in the auditory pathway’s first synapse. We also suggested a physiologically plausible mechanism for its operation, which was ultimately derived from the specific rate of temporal integration, i. e., the decrease of threshold sound pressure levels with increasing duration. In listeners with <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> that rate seems reduced, {{but it is not}} fully understood why. Here we propose that in such listeners there may be an elevation in the baseline above which sound pressure is effective in driving the system, in addition to a reduction in sensitivity. We test this simple model using thresholds of cats to stimuli of differently shaped temporal envelopes and durations obtained before and after <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> We show that thresholds, specified as the temporal integral of the effective pressure envelope, i. e., the envelope of the pressure exceeding the elevated baseline, behave almost exactly as the lower thresholds, specified as the temporal integral of the total pressure envelope before <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Thus, the mechanism of temporal integration is likely unchanged after <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> but the effective portion of the stimulus is. Our model constitutes a successful alternative to the model currently favored to account for altered temporal integration in listeners with <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> viz., reduced peripheral compression. Our model {{does not seem to be}} at variance with physiological observations and it also qualitatively accounts for a number of phenomena observed in such listeners with suprathreshold stimuli...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{radiotherapy}} on hearing was studied in 30 {{patients who were}} treated by surgery and radiotherapy for a parotid neoplasm. Functions of the irradiated ear were {{compared with those of}} the non-irradiated ear in the same patient. Tympanometry showed a small but significant reduction of static compliance on the irradiated side when compared with the non-irradiated side. Audiometry showed a significant increase in <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in the 1 - 2, 4 - 8 and 10 - 20 kHz ranges that increased with frequency. This <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was mainly <b>sensorineural</b> in contrast to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> at 250 - 500 Hz, where {{it was more of a}} conductive type. There appeared to be a significant dose-effect relation in sound perception at 4 - 8 kHz. Doses to the cochlea of less than 55 Gy seldom caused a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> in contrast to doses exceeding 65 Gy.

40|$|Hearing by air {{conduction}} (AC) and bone conduction (BC) {{are attributed to}} be the natural ways of stimulating the cochlea. With AC hearing, the cochlea is stimulated by air pressure variations via the ear canal, whereas with BC hearing, sound vibrations are transmitted thru the skull bone to the cochlea. <b>Sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> are commonly rehabilitated with conventional AC hearing aids in the ear canal, but patients who are suffering from conductive or mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> and who are unable to use AC hearing aids, may instead use bone conduction devices (BCDs). In order to determine the type and degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> the BC <b>hearing</b> thresholds are measured using a bone vibrator, and then analyzed together with the AC hearing thresholds to suggest an appropriate rehabilitation alternative.

25|$|Damage to {{the hair}} {{cells of the}} inner ear results in <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> which affects the ability to {{discriminate}} between sounds.

40|$|A {{study of}} Click Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (CEOAEs) {{elicited}} at stimulation intensities from 35 to over 80 dB {{was carried out}} by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) on signals from both normal and hearing impaired subjects. In normal subjects, a clear scaling of determinism with increasing stimulation intensity was observed in the click intensity range from 41 to 59 dB. Outside that range and, in particular, above its upper end, subject-dependent features appeared in the form of different maximal levels of determinism. A comparative analysis of responses from hearing impaired subjects with conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> and <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> suggested that the principal contributor to this behavior is the middle ear and allowed to discriminate the two pathologies {{solely on the basis of}} CEOAEs.

40|$|The pathogenetic {{mechanism}} of many hearing disorders {{have not been}} fully defined. Studies of certain hearing disorders in man have suggested a role for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -encoded genes in disease pathogenesis, In a cohort of unrelated patients with Meniere's Disease, otosclerosis and strial presbycusis {{as well as other}} types of <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> we have identified an extended MHC haplotype common to the majority of these patients, supporting a hypothesis that a gene(s) within the MHC domain may confer susceptibility to these hearing ailments. In addition, a preliminary study of 27 individuals with various hearing maladies, a striking finding is that 44 % of the patients express the following extended MHC haplotype in contrast to only 7 % of the general population: DQw 2 -DR 3 -C 4 BSf-C 4 A 0 -G 11 : 15 -Bf: 0. 4 -C 2 a-HSP 70 : 7. 5 -TNFa 5 -B 8 -Cw 7 -Al.

50|$|Imaging {{is usually}} not pursued in those with {{uncomplicated}} conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and characteristic clinical findings.

40|$|Simulated {{performance}} intensity functions {{were used}} to quantitatively discriminate speech intelligibility through phoneme discrimination assessment.

Simulations of NAL-RP and DSL 4. 0 fitting algorithms were compared. Auditory nerve discharge patterns from the model were presented as neurograms. An automated ranking process was used to quantify neurogram degradation using a new measure, the Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM). The measure has previously been shown to correlate well in predictions of phoneme discrimination for normal hearing listeners in both quiet and noise. In this study, simulated responses to consonant-vowel-consonant word lists in a quiet environment at a range of presentation levels {{were used to}} produce phoneme discrimination scores. This represents a further step in validating the use of auditory nerve models to predict speech intelligibility for different hearing aid fitting methods in a simulated environment, allowing the potential for rapid prototyping and early design assessment of new hearing aid algorithms...|$|R

25|$|Variations {{within the}} Genome are being studied to {{determine}} susceptibility to chronic diseases {{as well as}} infectious diseases.

25|$|Six autosomal-dominant point {{mutations}} {{in the sequence}} {{have been found to}} cause various types of hearing loss, particularly <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hearing test}} {{administered}} by a medical doctor, otolaryngologist (ENT) or audiologist including pure tone audiometry and speech recognition {{may be used}} to determine the extent and nature of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and distinguish presbycusis from other kinds of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Otoacoustic emissions and evoked response testing {{may be used to}} test for audio neuropathy. The diagnosis of a <b>sensorineural</b> pattern <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is made through audiometry, which shows a significant <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> without the [...] "air-bone gap" [...] that is characteristic of conductive hearing disturbances. In other words, air conduction is equal to bone conduction. Persons with cochlear deficits fail otoacoustic emissions testing, while persons with 8th cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve) deficits fail auditory brainstem response testing.|$|R
50|$|Most {{forms of}} nonsyndromic {{deafness}} {{are associated with}} permanent <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear consists of three parts: a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea that helps process sound, nerves that send information from the cochlea to the brain, and structures involved with balance. <b>Loss</b> of <b>hearing</b> caused by changes in the inner ear is called <b>sensorineural</b> deafness. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> that results from changes in the middle ear is called conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic deafness involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear; this combination is called mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that endolymphatic hydrops {{is the cause of}} complaints in patients suffering from Meniere's disease, it has not been possible up to now to prove the presence of an endolymphatic hydrops in living humans. This study evaluated the psychophysical method introduced by Mrowinski et al. [Mrowinski D., Gerull G., Nubel K., Scholz G., 1995. Masking and pitch shift of tone bursts and clicks by low-frequency tones. Hear. Res. 85, 95 - 102; Mrowinski D., Scholz G., Krompass S., Nubel K., 1996. Diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops by low-frequency masking. Audiol. Neurootol. 1, 125 - 134] to diagnose endolymphatic hydrops. These authors used low frequency biasing to differentiate between individuals with and individuals without Meniere's disease. In the present study no statistically significant differences in masking parameters could be found between a large number (n = 91) of ears with Meniere's disease and ears (n = 52) with comparable <b>sensorineural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> but without symptoms of Meniere's disease. Our results support the idea that results deviating from normal in low frequency biasing measurements are not due to endolymphatic hydrops itself, but to other pathological changes of the inner ear. An explanation could be that with increasing <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> the gain of the cochlear amplifier decreases, leading to smaller modulation depths. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
