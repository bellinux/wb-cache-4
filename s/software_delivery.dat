25|$|The {{most common}} for {{measuring}} functional size is function point analysis. Function point analysis measures {{the size of}} the software deliverable from a user's perspective. Function point sizing is done based on user requirements and provides an accurate representation of both size for the developer/estimator and value (functionality to be delivered) and reflects the business functionality being delivered to the customer. The method includes the identification and weighting of user recognizable inputs, outputs and data stores. The size value is then available for use in conjunction with numerous measures to quantify and to evaluate <b>software</b> <b>delivery</b> and performance (development cost per function point; delivered defects per function point; function points per staff month.).|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Arms Deal update to CS:GO in August 2013 added cosmetic items termed [...] "skins" [...] into the personal computer versions of the game. The developers had considered other types of customization drops for the game before coming to weapon skins; they had ruled out on player skins, since CS:GO is a first-person shooter and the player would not see their customization, {{as well as new}} weapons, fearing this would imbalance the game. Following the model they used for Team Fortress 2, Valve enabled players to be rewarded with random skin drops as they played matches which would be stored in their user inventory within Steam, Valve's <b>software</b> <b>delivery</b> and storefront client. Limited-time [...] "souvenir" [...] skins could also be earned by watching competitive CS:GO matches within the game or through a Twitch.tv account linked to a Steam account. Unlike Team Fortress 2, the CS:GO skins do not have any direct impact on gameplay, only influencing the look of a player's weapon. Skins, unique to specific in-game weapons, are given several qualities, including a rarity that determines how often a player might acquire one by a random in-game drop just by playing the game or as in-game rewards, and an appearance quality related to how worn the gun appeared.|$|E

40|$|Fast <b>software</b> <b>deliveries</b> are {{hindered}} by high maintenance efforts due to internal quality issues and Technical Debt (TD) and specifically, Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) has received increased {{attention in the}} last few years. ATD has a significant influence and impact on system success and, left unchecked, it can cause expensive repercussions; it is, therefore, of maintenance and evolutionary importance to understand the basic underlying factors of ATD. Thus, with this as background, {{there is a need for}} a descriptive model to illustrate and explain the different ATD issues. The aim of this study is to synthesize and compile research efforts with the goal of creating new knowledge with a specific interest in the ATD field. The contribution of this paper is the presentation of a novel descriptive model, providing a comprehensive interpretation of the ATD phenomenon. This model categorizes the main characteristics of ATD and reveals their corresponding relations.

50|$|Continuous {{delivery}} and DevOps {{are similar in}} their meanings and are often conflated, but they are two different concepts. DevOps has a broader scope, and centers around the cultural change, specifically the collaboration of the various teams involved in <b>software</b> <b>delivery</b> (developers, operations, quality assurance, management, etc.), as well as automating the processes in <b>software</b> <b>delivery.</b> Continuous delivery, on the other hand, is an approach to automate the delivery aspect, and focuses on bringing together different processes and executing them more quickly and more frequently. Thus, DevOps can be a product of continuous delivery, and CD flows directly into DevOps.|$|E
