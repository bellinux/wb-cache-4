25|$|The {{notion of}} Svatantrya {{is central to}} Somananda's philosophy. The free-will of Shiva is {{manifested}} as energy, called Shakti, which emanates from Shiva himself and is the <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> which the world is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, it is beyond any obstacles. When Shakti begins the process of manifestation it subdivides {{into a number of}} ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).|$|E
25|$|A second {{application}} area {{in computer}} vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted {{for the purpose}} of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> bulk material, a process called optical sorting.|$|E

25|$|Another {{prominent}} guild in Kangting {{is that of}} {{the women}} tea coolies who shift the <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> the warehouses to the inns where the caravans start. They have a monopoly on this work and the cheerful gangs of girls are a picturesque element in the city's life. They need to be immensely strong to do a job which consists of carrying over a short distance anything up to an entire yak's load several times a day. Many of them are quite pretty (and well aware of the fact); they look very gay and rather brazen as, giggling and chattering among themselves, they move along with their heavy burdens, which are held in place by a woolen girdle around the chest.|$|E

500|$|In mid October 2016, Waters {{announced}} that he would return to North America in 2017 with a pioneering new tour named [...] "Us + Them", stating: [...] "We {{are going to take a}} new show on the road, the content is very secret. It'll be a mixture of <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> my long career, <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> my years with Pink Floyd, some new things. Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but it will be all connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I promise you. It'll be spectacular like all my shows have been." [...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC. The tour title is derived from the track [...] "Us and Them," [...] from the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|E

60|$|The {{cause of}} such unusual vigour and {{accumulation}} of power was, that a fire anywhere about the docks is deemed pre-eminently dangerous, {{owing to the}} great and crowded warehouses being <b>stuffed</b> <b>from</b> cellars to roof-trees with combustibles.

60|$|Mattress.--Making a {{mattress}} {{is indeed a}} very simple affair. A bag of canvas, or other cloth, is made of the size wanted. It is then stuffed full of hair, wool, dry leaves, or cotton, and a strong stitch is put through it every few inches. The use of the stitching is to prevent the <b>stuffing</b> <b>from</b> being displaced, and forming lumps {{in different parts of}} the bag.|$|R

500|$|By {{this time}} the Britpop {{movement}} was in decline, and the band had failed to meet expectations with their third album. After {{the conclusion of the}} Be Here Now Tour in early 1998, amidst much media criticism the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, entitled The Masterplan. [...] "The really interesting <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> around that period is the B-sides. There's a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on Be Here Now itself, I think", related Noel in an interview in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Coxon {{struggled}} with drinking problems and, in {{a rejection of}} the group's former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E

500|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly north-south {{for about}} 11 {{kilometres}} (7 miles), remaining above 600m (1,970ft) throughout its length. Nethermost Pike is toward {{the southern end}} of this ridge, with Helvellyn itself to the north and Dollywaggon Pike to the south. In common with much of the Helvellyn range there is a marked contrast between the western and eastern slopes of Nethermost Pike. In Wainwright's words: [...] "The grassy western slope trodden by the multitudes is of little interest, but the fell should not be judged accordingly: it is made of sterner <b>stuff.</b> <b>From</b> the east, Nethermost Pike is magnificent, hardly less so than Helvellyn." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Black {{released}} Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. [...] Black {{chose the}} title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|Twelve days later, Dylan {{made his}} first trip abroad. British TV {{director}} Philip Saville had heard Dylan perform in Greenwich Village, and invited him {{to take part in}} a BBC television drama: Madhouse on Castle Street. Dylan arrived in London on December 17. In the play, Dylan performed [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] and two other songs. Dylan also immersed himself in the London folk scene, making contact with the Troubadour folk club organizer Anthea Joseph and folk singers Martin Carthy and Bob Davenport. [...] "I ran into some people in England who really knew those [...] songs," [...] Dylan recalled in 1984. [...] "Martin Carthy, another guy named [...] Davenport. Martin Carthy's incredible. I learned a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> Martin." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{more common}} commercially {{packaged}} product found {{today is the}} [...] "Polish" [...] gefilte fish patties or balls, similar to quenelles, where sugar {{is added to the}} broth, resulting in a slightly sweet taste. Strictly speaking they are the fish filling, rather than the complete filled fish.

50|$|There {{are also}} {{regional}} differences {{as to the}} stuffing or dressing traditionally served with the turkey. The traditional version has bread cubes, sage, onion and celery. Southerners generally make their dressing from cornbread, while those {{in other parts of}} the country make <b>stuffing</b> <b>from</b> white, wheat or rye bread as the base. One or several of the following may be added to the dressing/stuffing: oysters, apples, chestnuts, raisins, and sausages or the turkey's giblets.|$|R

It's her weird, selfish way of protecting them". This, the character's assertion in the episode to Ghost Rider that she [...] "deserves to die". Concerning the character Fitz keeping the android Aida a secret from his girlfriend Simmons, actor Iain De Caestecker said, [...] "They're trying to maintain a healthy relationship while being secret undercover spies that have secret assignments ... it's with the best intentions, keeping <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> her, I suppose. It's going to get interesting. Lying is a strong word. I'm just keeping stuff from" [...] her.|$|E
500|$|Empires Nick de Semlyen {{awarded the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "fun if uneven <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> Ratner," [...] with a [...] "fairly dull" [...] opening act.

[...] Semlyen praised Alda, {{saying that it is}} his [...] "smarm offensive {{that turns out to be}} the primary pleasure." [...] The Village Voices Nick Pinkteron said that the film [...] "deserves credit as a clean, well-turned job, fleet and funny and inconsequential," [...] and appreciated the cast, praising Leoni as the [...] "best thing going," [...] and Murphy's [...] "inspired" [...] contributions. However, Pinkerton was critical of the script, describing it as [...] "amateur as its crooks: the audience isn't even fully aware of who's in on the job when it kicks off, while other threads are left dangling." ...|$|E
500|$|Join Hands {{was written}} {{over a period}} of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, {{including}} scenes of repression and curfews; {{it was one of the}} first times they had seen images of people being shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as [...] "a real time, everything in flocks and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this <b>stuff</b> <b>from</b> the past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of what things were like at the time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took [...] "the very un-rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration".|$|E
