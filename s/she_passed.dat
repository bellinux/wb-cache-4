5|$|Potter {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at her boots.

5|$|She {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} at St Paul's Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs. When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best subjects were literature and scripture.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as <b>she</b> <b>passed.</b> Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.|$|E

From there <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico.

5|$|Before his death, in 1976 Blair bought O'Hara {{a travel}} magazine, the Virgin Islander, which {{she began to}} edit from their home {{for many years in}} St. Croix. She sold it in 1980 to USA Today {{to spend more time with}} her {{daughter}} and grandson Conor (born 1970). <b>She</b> <b>passed</b> on the airline business the following year, which by this time was chartering 120 flights a day with a fleet of 27 planes. O'Hara had had considerable prior experience with business as from the 1940s she ran a clothing store in Tarzana, Los Angeles, operating under her name, specializing in dresses for women. O'Hara increasingly spent time in Glengarriff on the southwest coast of Ireland, and established a golf tournament there in 1984 in her husband's memory. A hurricane in 1989 destroyed her home in St. Croix. While in New York, inquiring about the costs of rebuilding, she suffered six successive heart attacks and underwent an angioplasty. She moved permanently to Glengariff after suffering a stroke in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Cressy, {{named after}} the 1346 Battle of Crécy, was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding at their {{shipyard}} in Govan, Scotland on 12 October 1898 and launched on 4 December 1899. After finishing her sea trials <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> into the fleet reserve at Portsmouth on 24 May 1901. She was commissioned by Captain Henry Tudor for service on the China Station on 28 May 1901, but her departure was delayed for several months when her steering gear broke down shortly after leaving the base {{and she had to}} return. She eventually left home waters in early October 1901, arriving at Colombo on 7 November, and then Singapore on 16 November. She was assigned to the North America and West Indies Station from 1907 through 1909 and placed in reserve upon her return home.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, the Great White Fleet {{was ordered}} by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt {{to circle the}} world, as a {{demonstration}} of the might of the United States Navy. Kentucky was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, Kentuckys former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. The fleet then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico.

5|$|Jiyuan {{was hit by}} a {{multitude}} of shells, disabling her forward-mounted Krupp gun and severely damaging all the structures above her armour belt. Captain Fang gave orders to flee at full speed towards Waihaiwei, with Yoshino in pursuit. Reports differed on why Jiyuan was not overtaken by the faster Japanese cruiser, with one claim stating that Jiyuans aft mounted Krupp gun scored a hit on the bridge of the Yoshino, and another indicating that shot was fired by the Kuang Yi. While Jiyuan got away, the Kuang Yi fought against the remaining two cruisers until she was holed and sinking, at which point she was beached to allow her crew to escape. As the Tsi Yuan headed to Weihaiwei, <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> the Kowshing which was still heading to Korea. The troop ship was stopped by the Japanese, and after prolonged negotiations she was sunk with loss of a great number of the troops and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|Kalep took up {{flying in}} the late 1920s, when she met Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker while holidaying in St. Moritz {{and asked him to}} teach her to fly a plane. She {{completed}} five hours of flying with Fokker and, after breaking her arm during a sledding accident in the winter of 1931, took her pilot's test in Germany on 1 August 1931. <b>She</b> <b>passed,</b> becoming the first qualified female pilot from Estonia, and the seventh woman to pass the exam in Germany. Soon after receiving her license, Kalep and Valter Mayer, a German mechanic, co-piloted a small Klemm plane from Berlin through Eastern Europe, stopping in Szczecin, Gdańsk, Kaunas, Jelgava and Riga, finally landing in Tallinn on 18 August. Upon her arrival in Tallinn, Kalep was greeted by a crowd of journalists and officers of the Estonian Air Force; she briefly visited relatives in Nõmme before beginning her return journey to Amsterdam.|$|E
