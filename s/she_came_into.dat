5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} {{when she ran}} onto the Penmarks Rocks. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E

25|$|The {{life story}} of Maria took another {{dramatic}} turn on 16 August 1976, when Maria found herself {{on trial in}} a Dutch court charged with plotting to murder her husband. She admitted in court {{that she had been}} thinking about leaving her husband but was afraid to start divorce proceedings in case she lost custody of her children. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> contact with two regular customers at her husband's café bar.

Somehow this prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after her separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced, but separated in 1964. During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1900 Zitkala-Ša {{was sent}} by Carlisle's founder, Colonel Richard Henry Pratt, to the Yankton Reservation {{for the first time}} in several years to recruit students. She was greatly dismayed to find that her mother's house was in disrepair, her brother's family had fallen into poverty, and that white {{settlers}} were beginning to occupy lands allotted to the Yankton Dakota under the Dawes Act of 1877. Upon returning to the Carlisle School, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> conflict with its founder, as she resented his rigid program of assimilation into dominant white culture and the limitations of the curriculum. It prepared Native American children only for low-level work, assuming they would return to rural cultures. In 1901 Zitkala-Ša was dismissed. That year she had published an article in Harper's Monthly describing the profound loss of identity felt by a Native American boy after undergoing the assimilationist education at the school.|$|E

Meissner-Blau worked as the Bildungsreferentin (education secretary) for the industrial giant OMV where she took {{an active role}} holding seminars and running classes for the working class employees. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> contact with numerous figures in the union movement and leaders within the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ). During the 1970s the issue of nuclear power was {{at the forefront of}} environmental activism, and was a particularly contentious issue in Austrian politics. In the late 1970s this issue came to a head with the planned construction of six nuclear power plants, the first of which was the Nuclear Power Facility at Zwentendorf. Opposition to the plant became increasingly vociferous as the plant neared completion in 1978. Meissner-Blau became a prominent leader in the fight against the plant, appearing frequently in the media as a spokesperson for the opposition movement. She was joined by her husband Paul, Stefan Micko, Wolfgang Pekny, and Peter Weish as the main figureheads for the cause.|$|E
25|$|The French {{ambassador}} to the United States registered {{a complaint with the}} President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left as soon as practicable. Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners no one would have thought that objectionable. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter.|$|E
25|$|In April, Radwańska {{began her}} clay {{season at the}} Porsche Tennis Grand Prix as the 7th seed. She lost in {{straight}} sets to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round. She later withdrew from her forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, citing a foot injury. At the French Open Radwańska was seeded at No.9. In her first match after being sidelined for five weeks due to a right foot injury she eased past Fiona Ferro in straight sets in just over an hour. In the second round she defeated Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck to face Alizé Cornet in the third round. Radwańska had won seven of their eight previous matches, including {{the only one on}} clay - at the French Open nine years ago - but this time lost to Cornet in two sets. Radwanska withdrew from the Ricoh Open and Aegon Classic Birmingham due to a viral illness. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the 2017 Aegon International as the No. 9 seed but fell to Lauren Davis.

25|$|From 1897 to 1899, Zitkala-Ša played violin {{with the}} New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.

In 1900, Zitkala-Ša played violin at the Paris Exposition with the school's Carlisle Indian Band. In the same year, she began writing articles on Native American life which were published in such popular periodicals as Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Monthly. Also in 1900, Zitkala-Ša was sent by Captain Pratt back to the Yankton Reservation {{for the first time}} in several years to recruit students. She was greatly dismayed to find there that her mother's house in disrepair, her brother's family in poverty, and that white settlers were beginning to occupy the land promised to the Yankton Dakota by the Dawes Act of 1877. Upon returning to Carlisle, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> conflict with Pratt. She resented the rigid program of assimilation and argued that the curriculum did not encourage Native American children to aspire to anything beyond lives spent in menial labor. In 1901 Zitkala-Ša was dismissed, likely for an article she had published in Harper's Monthly describing the profound loss of identity felt by a Native American boy after being given an assimilationist education at Carlisle. Concerned with her mother's advanced age and her family's struggles with poverty, she returned to the Yankton Reservation in 1901. Zitkala-Ša dedicated her life to Indian reform, voting rights and education.|$|E

500|$|Helen Berger, then a {{lecturer}} in {{sociology at the}} West Chester University of Pennsylvania, had initially {{become involved in the}} study of the Pagan movement in preparation for a series of public lectures that she gave at the Boston Public Library in October 1986. Based on the subject of the historical witch trials that took place in New England during the Early Modern period, she devoted the final lecture in the series to an examination of the contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, then living in the area. Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate in A Community of Witches, Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and Marcello Truzzi, and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was [...] "peripherally associated" [...] with Paganism.
