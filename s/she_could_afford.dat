When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford,</b> so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.|$|E
25|$|Stevens {{was born}} November 18, 1923, in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{the third of}} four children, in a small cottage built by his {{paternal}} grandfather after the marriage of his parents, Gertrude S. (née Chancellor) and George A. Stevens. The family later lived in Chicago, where George Stevens was an accountant before losing his job during the Great Depression. Around this time, when Ted Stevens was six years old, his parents divorced, and Stevens and his three siblings went back to Indianapolis to reside with their paternal grandparents, followed shortly thereafter by their father, who developed problems with his eyes and went blind for several years. Stevens's mother moved to California and sent for Stevens's siblings as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to, but Stevens stayed in Indianapolis helping to care for his father and a mentally disabled cousin, Patricia Acker, who also lived with the family. The only adult in the household with a job was Stevens's grandfather. Stevens helped to support the family by working as a newsboy, and would later remember selling many newspapers on March 1, 1932, when newspaper headlines blared {{the news of the}} Lindbergh kidnapping.|$|E
25|$|In {{her version}} of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an {{arranged}} marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia {{in order not to}} be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to leave him if the marriage should have been unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.|$|E

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War on 4 August 1914, David rejoined his regiment and was soon in France. [...] In May 1915, Clement, David's older brother, was killed while serving with the 10th Royal Hussars, which made David heir to the Redesdale title and lands. On 17 August 1916 Bertie Mitford died; David, still serving at the front, became the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Sydney quickly took possession of Batsford House, much of which had been shut up for many years, and occupied the portion of it that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to heat. The children had the run of the house and grounds, and were taught together in the schoolroom. This was a source of frustration for Nancy, whose lively intelligence required greater stimulus. She spent many hours reading in the Batsford House library where, according to Hastings, [...] the foundations of her intellectual life were laid.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Bringing up Baby, the Independent Theatre Owners of America {{included}} Hepburn {{on a list of}} actors considered [...] "box office poison". Her reputation at a low, the next film RKO offered her was Mother Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects. Hepburn turned it down, and instead opted to buy out her contract for $75,000. Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but Hepburn's personal wealth meant <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to be independent. She signed on for the film version of Holiday (1938) with Columbia Pictures, pairing her for the third time with Grant, to play a stifled society girl who finds joy with her sister's fiancé. The comedy was positively reviewed, but it failed to draw much of an audience, and the next script offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000—less than she had received at the start of her film career. Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, [...] "No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Annie [...] "Knowles" [...] Fisher {{was born}} on December 3, 1867, in Boone County. She was one of eleven {{children}} born to former slaves Robert and Charlotte Knowles [...] From an early age, Annie {{was put in charge}} of cooking for the family. Although Annie attended school for a short time, she eventually quit school to help support her family. Annie found her love of cooking while working in kitchens of wealthy white families in the Columbia area. She was paid little and received second hand clothing as one of the [...] "perks" [...] of the job. Annie noted later in life for a newspaper article that although she was grateful for the second hand clothing, she wanted to make a good living so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> new clothes. Annie {{went to work for the}} Lenoir-Nifong family of Maplewood, Missouri. In 1890, Annie began to work for George Bingham Rollins and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Missouri. Although it is rumoured that she won a gold medal for her beaten biscuits at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 in St.Louis historian Mary Beth Brown wrote in an article published by the Genealogical Society of Central Missouri that there is no record of her in the lists of entrants and prizewinners.|$|E

2500|$|By her own admission, {{she was not}} {{a success}} at first. [...] She only made about $25 during her first month, and all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> for her office was two chairs and a {{borrowed}} typewriter. [...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E
2500|$|The Brooklyn Class {{design was}} a further {{refinement}} of the New Orleans Class Heavy Cruiser that preceded it. [...] The {{desire for the}} Brooklyns arose from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which limited the construction of heavy cruisers, i.e., ships carrying guns with calibers between 6.1 inches and 8 inches. Great Britain needed trade control cruisers and hoped that the treaty would limit nations to smaller cruisers to a 6,000 to 8,000 ton range that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> Agreement to the London Treaty and the proceeding with the American Light cruiser design can be focused to Admiral William V. Pratt who overrode the vehement objections of the General Board. Under the treaty the US was allowed 30,000 tons for heavy cruisers and 143,500 tons for light cruisers. The United States needed large cruisers {{to deal with the}} extreme ranges that operations in the Pacific Ocean required. Cruisers with 6" [...] guns and 10,000 tons were therefore desired. The US Navy's experience with the Omaha Class Cruiser was not all that could be hoped for. The light hull design caused a stressed hull and was very overweight. Design started in 1930, with the first four of the class ordered in 1933 and an additional three ships in 1934. Basic criteria had been that speed and range should match heavy cruisers and, when the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers carrying fifteen six-inch main guns appeared, the new U.S. ships would match their weaponry. Various combinations of armor and power plants were tried in the efforts to stay below the Treaty 10,000 ton limit. Aviation facilities were moved to the stern of the ship from the amidships position of the New Orleans Class cruisers.|$|E
2500|$|Mae West was {{a shrewd}} investor, {{produced}} her own stage acts, and invested her money in {{large tracts of}} land in Van Nuys, a thriving suburb of Los Angeles. With her considerable fortune, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to do as she liked. [...] In 1976, she appeared on Back Lot U.S.A. on CBS, where she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang [...] "Frankie and Johnny" [...] along with [...] "After You've Gone." [...] That same year, she began work on her final film, Sextette (1978). Adapted from a 1959 script written by West, the film's daily revisions and production disagreements hampered production from the beginning. Due to the near-endless last-minute script changes and tiring production schedule, West agreed to have her lines signaled to her through a speaker concealed in her hair piece. Despite the daily problems, West was, according to Sextette director Ken Hughes, determined to see the film through. [...] At 86, her now-failing eyesight made navigating around the set difficult, but she {{made it through the}} filming, a tribute to her self-confidence, [...] remarkable endurance, and stature as a self-created star 67 years after her Broadway debut in 1911 at the age of 18. Time wrote an article on the indomitable star entitled [...] "At 84, Mae West Is Still Mae West." [...] Upon its release, Sextette was not a critical or commercial success, but remains notable for the diverse cast, and because none of West's contemporaries such as Dietrich, Garbo, etc., were still making films. [...] The cast included some of West's first co-stars such George Raft (Night After Night, 1932), silver screen stars such as Walter Pigeon and Tony Curtis, and more contemporary pop stars such as The Beatles' Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper, and television favorites such as Dom DeLuise and gossip queen Rona Barrett. [...] It also included cameos of some of her famed musclemen from her 1950s Las Vegas show, such as the still remarkably fit Reg Lewis. [...] Sextette also reunited Mae West with Edith Head, her costume designer from 1933 in She Done Him Wrong. [...] The film was a last hurrah and a Valentine from Mae West to her fans.|$|E
