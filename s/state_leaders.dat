5|$|Brown {{was sworn}} in on December 31, 2005 at the Buffalo Convention Center. During his first day in office he toured the Buffalo Waterfront to show his {{commitment}} to its development. Before {{the end of the}} year, restoration on the original point where the Erie Canal met the Great Lakes was underway. Brown presented his plans for the development during subsequent tours by top <b>state</b> <b>leaders,</b> including future New York State Governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson. Erie Canal Harbor eventually opened on July 2, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{played a}} role in the {{evacuation}} of federal troops from Texas at the onset of the American Civil War. As Texas considered whether to secede from the United States, General David E. Twiggs, commander of federal troops in Texas negotiated with <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> concerning the transfer of federal property. After learning of such negotiations, the United States military moved to decommission Twiggs, and replace him with Colonel Carlos Waite. Texas viewed this move as a rejection of the negotiations and proceeded to forcefully claim the federal property. Twiggs, while awaiting relief from Waite, surrendered the property on the condition that federal troops could peacefully evacuate. They were allowed to depart, but only from the Texas coast. Waite arrived and relocated troops near Green Lake, where they could await coastal departure near an adequate source of freshwater. During the stay, Fort Sumter fell under siege, and Texas grew concerned about the concentration of armed federal troops in the area. With their respective nations now at war, Texas considered the deal with Twiggs void, and began to capture federal troops to force them to either join the Confederacy or be Prisoners of War. Some of the remaining uncaptured companies elsewhere in the state attempted to flee to Green Lake. Several regiments camped by the lake later in the war, and complained about mosquitos.|$|E

Foster said that he considered that his criticism could aid Blossman's campaign by giving it more exposure, but the governor spoke out and accused Blossman of running an offensive advertisement in bad taste.|$|E

25|$|During {{his second}} term as Lieutenant Governor, the state passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. Although it was at first {{extremely}} popular, it had soon become apparent to <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> that it was leading the state to financial ruin. The problem was not fully evident when Wallace ran for governor in 1837, but was {{a small part of}} his election campaign. He was elected largely because of his prior support to the improvement act, which the public still supported, and his support from the popular governor Noah Noble.|$|E
25|$|He {{also began}} to follow new policies, {{pursuing}} independent defence and foreign policies and distancing Australia from its traditional ties to Britain. But he continued to support Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, a position he had reluctantly inherited from Holt, which became increasingly unpopular after 1968. On domestic issues, he favoured centralist policies {{at the expense of}} the states, which alienated powerful Liberal <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> like Sir Henry Bolte of Victoria and Bob Askin of New South Wales. He also fostered an independent Australian film industry and increased government funding for the arts.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, Brown entered Lawrence to {{meet with}} Free <b>State</b> <b>leaders</b> and help fortify against a feared assault. At least 2,700 pro-slavery Missourians were once again invading Kansas. On September 14, they skirmished near Lawrence. Brown {{prepared}} for battle, but serious violence was averted when the new governor of Kansas, John W. Geary, ordered the warring parties to disarm and disband, and offered clemency to former fighters on both sides. Brown, {{taking advantage of the}} fragile peace, left Kansas with three of his sons to raise money from supporters in the North.|$|E

25|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, the family bank entered a period of {{financial}} difficulty. Gates and his brothers were able to successfully meet with each of the banks depositors and convince them to sign non-withdrawal pledges. Thanks to their cooperation, the family was able to preserve the bank and made it one of the few in the region to avoid a bank run. In 1928 he succeeded his father as the chairman of the Whitley County Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1931 Gates became the Indiana commander of the American Legion. The position led him to travel around the state and meet with many <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> as he lobbied for veterans.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1965 both Ole Miss and Mississippi State University had been integrated– the former violently, the latter peacefully. McCain, USM and <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> {{recognized}} the state needed to integrate in order to appeal to businesses from outside the state. They made extensive confidential plans for the admission of their first black students. A faculty guardian and tutor was secretly appointed for each {{to help with the}} transition. The campus police department was instructed to prevent or quickly stop any incident against the two black students. Student athletic, fraternity, and political leaders were recruited to keep the calm and protect the university from the kind of negative publicity that Ole Miss had suffered during rioting against Meredith's enrollment.|$|E
25|$|After leaving active {{military}} service, McNutt {{returned to}} his law school teaching job, becoming a full professor in 1920 and then, in 1925, the youngest dean in the school's history. He skillfully used both his university connections and his wartime experience to launch his political career. As law school dean, he forcefully attacked pacifists and opponents of compulsory military training on college campuses. He had since returning from the war been active in The American Legion, an influential veterans' organization, and spoke frequently throughout the state. In 1927, he was elected commander of the Indiana department of The American Legion. His group's lobbying brought him contact with many <b>state</b> <b>leaders</b> which began his interest in politics and began building a political base of support.|$|E

25|$|The major demonstration, dubbed Kranti Rally (Revolution Rally) {{and held}} in Ahmedabad on 25 August at the GMDC grounds, was {{attended}} by over 500,000. The members of community formed a procession and presented the memorandum of their demands to the District Collector. Hardik Patel, who led the rally, declared he would go on a hunger strike with others, demanding the Chief Minister personally be present there to receive the memorandum. He was arrested as {{he did not have}} permission to stay on the grounds after the rally, and later released. Those present on the grounds were dispersed by the police using force. An inquiry was ordered to investigate the reason behind the police's use of force. Anandiben Patel and Rajanikant Patel, <b>state</b> <b>leaders,</b> both denied ordering or authorising the police charge on the crowd.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipeline}} {{allowed an}} oil bonanza to take shape. Per capita incomes rose throughout the state, with virtually every community benefiting. <b>State</b> <b>leaders</b> were determined that this boom would not end like the fur and gold booms, {{in an economic}} bust {{as soon as the}} resource had disappeared. In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested. Income from the fund is used to pay annual dividends to all residents who qualify, to increase the fund's principal as a hedge against inflation, and to provide funds for the state legislature. Since 1993, the fund has produced more money than the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, whose production is diminishing. , the fund's value was over $30 billion.|$|E
25|$|During Hayden's final {{campaign}} in 1962, the Central Arizona Project {{was the central}} issue. <b>State</b> <b>leaders</b> saw his seniority as being key in gaining approval for the project. To aid his re-election, campaign staff arranged {{for a series of}} events to celebrate Hayden's fiftieth anniversary in Congress and raise awareness of his achievements. A series of viral infections suffered by the senator {{over the course of the}} year prompted rumors that the 85-year-old senator had died. To refute these rumors, Hayden held a press conference at Bethesda Naval Hospital three days before the election. Despite a growing Republican trend in Arizona, Hayden's Republican challenger, state representative and future governor Evan Mecham, only got lukewarm support from the state party. Arizona's Republican establishment felt Hayden's seniority was crucial for ensuring the project would pass. Ultimately, Hayden won a record seventh term, but only tallied 54.9 percent of the vote—easily the closest race of his Senate career, and his closest since his first bid for a full term in the House half a century earlier.|$|E
