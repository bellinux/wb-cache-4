5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused <b>substance</b> <b>abusers</b> to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E

Voytilla noted when this particular demographic of <b>substance</b> <b>abusers</b> attended AA {{meetings in the}} surrounding community, they felt uncomfortable and made others attending the meetings uncomfortable. Voytilla's EA meetings were created to avoid these problems, and address the illnesses of his clients other than substance abuse. Since then, four articles have narrowly defined EA as a program specifically for mentally retarded or intellectually disabled <b>substance</b> <b>abusers.</b> In a similar way, EA has also been incorrectly described as an organization either specifically or primarily {{for those who have}} been discharged from psychiatric hospitals.|$|E

25|$|Nitrous oxide, also {{sometimes}} known as laughing gas, is a legally available gas used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, {{as well as}} food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. <b>Substance</b> <b>abusers</b> {{also sometimes}} use the gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency {{that can lead to}} nerve damage.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may also}} be treated for {{substance}} abuse following the administration of psychoactive substances containing amphetamine, caffeine, tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, phencyclidines, or other inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. Clinicians assessing and treating <b>substance</b> <b>abusers</b> must establish therapeutic rapport to counter denial and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary {{short and long term}} treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, {{many of these}} people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in <b>substance</b> <b>abusers</b> dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: The {{previous}} {{research has demonstrated that}} addiction treatment services for women need to be based on knowledge of female psychological needs. Therefore, the aim of current study is to compare body image, quality of sleep and marital satisfaction among <b>substance</b> <b>abuser</b> and non-substance abuser women. Materials and Methods : This study is a descriptive comparative research. 200 women including 100 <b>substance</b> <b>abuser</b> women and 100 non-substance abuser women were chosen through convenience method in Arak in 2015. The measuring instruments were Fisher body image scale (1970), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (1989) and Enrich Marital Satisfaction Scale (1989). Data was analyzed utilizing t independent. Results : The results showed that there is the significant difference between marital satisfaction (P= 0. 001) and quality of sleep (P= 0. 001) among <b>substance</b> <b>abuser</b> and non-substance abuser women. Additionally, the significant difference was not observed between body image (P= 0. 31) among these two groups. Conclusion : These findings emphasized that substance use decreases the quality of sleep and marital satisfaction in women. Hence, it should be considered these factors in process of therapeutic intervention in <b>substance</b> <b>abuser</b> women. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. The most {{important}} ethiology factor of chronic liver disease that progresses into terminal insufficiency is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Intravenous (iv) drug abuse {{is the main}} cause for spreading HCV. Thus the therapy for such patients is of extreme importance in reducing the incidence of the disease. The aim {{of the study was}} to establish efficacy of a combined therapy with peginterferon alpha- 2 a and ribavirin in iv opiate <b>substances</b> <b>abusers</b> having chronic HCV infection in relation to sex, age, genotype and level of fibrosis and duration of HCV infection before the treatment. Methods. Thirty one iv opiate <b>substances</b> <b>abusers</b> with chronic hepatitis C (HHC) were enrolled in the examination. The patients were divided according to the genotype into two groups. The patients with genotypes 1 and 4 (n = 18) were treated for 48 weeks, while those with genotypes 2 and 3 (n = 13) for 24 weeks. PCR HCV RNA, genotype determination and liver biopsy were done to each patient. Results. A stabile virological response was achieved in 93. 5 % of the patients, so the therapy demonstrated statistically significant efficacy i. v. opiate <b>substances</b> <b>abusers</b> with HHC (p 0. 05). Conclusion. Therapy of of iv opiate <b>substances</b> <b>abusers</b> with HHC has its specificities, and these patients need special treatment. Efficacy of the therapy was equivalent in patient groups formed according to the sex, genotype, level of fibrosis and duration of HCV infection. A combined therapy with peginterferon alfa 2 a and ribavirin has high level of success in the treatment of these patients...|$|R
