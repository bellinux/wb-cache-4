5|$|The west <b>side</b> <b>will</b> have a large,tree-lined, {{pedestrian}} mall with a reflecting {{pool and}} new illumination. The reflecting pools will also {{work as a}} performance fountain, providing splash and spectacle at programmed moments during stadium events. Around the complex, granite flooring will have stripes evocative of the club's second uniform, in synchronisation with the external illumination. There will be benches and large gardens; the media centre will be housed in one of them. The landscaping was designed by John Loomis, who headed the Burj Khalifa project. Lighting was projected by the American firm T. Kondos.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's <b>side,</b> <b>will</b> {{be unable to}} help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
25|$|The planet should rotate {{relatively}} quickly so {{that the}} day-night cycle is not overlong. If a day takes years, the temperature differential between {{the day and night}} <b>side</b> <b>will</b> be pronounced, and problems similar to those noted with extreme orbital eccentricity will come to the fore.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> return any {{captured}} weapons, vehicles, {{and communication}} devices.|$|R
50|$|Grains {{strive to}} {{minimize}} their energy, and a curved boundary {{has a higher}} energy than a straight boundary. This means that the grain boundary will migrate towards the curvature. The consequence {{of this is that}} grains with less than 6 <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> decrease in size while grains with more than 6 <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> increase in size.|$|R
5000|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{cooperate}} in the compiling {{of a joint}} orthographic manual (pravopis).|$|R
25|$|Spastic {{hemiplegia}} (one side being affected). Generally, {{injury to}} muscle-nerves {{controlled by the}} brain's left <b>side</b> <b>will</b> cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.|$|E
25|$|Before play begins, {{the captain}} of each <b>side</b> <b>will</b> inspect the pitch. Based on the pitch and weather conditions, the captains select their final eleven players. If the pitch is soft or dusty, the captain will tend to select more spin bowlers; if the pitch is hard, the choice tends to favour fast bowlers {{at the expense of}} spinners.|$|E
25|$|When {{beginning}} a land assault, the player is given several units. The exact {{number of units}} {{is determined by the}} proportion of the player's crew versus the size of the city's garrison. An overwhelming superiority for either <b>side</b> <b>will</b> give that side up to 10 units to command, while equally balanced fights will generally produce four or five units for each side.|$|E
5000|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{discuss and}} {{negotiate}} {{to arrange for}} the security of SSA-S leaders ...|$|R
25|$|All {{one can say}} is that on average, {{averaging}} using , the two <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> average out.|$|R
5000|$|The two <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{establish}} an organization {{to plan the}} unification of a [...] "democratic, free, and equitably prosperous China" ...|$|R
25|$|To reduce {{uncertainty}} and fear the UN Peacekeeping force can monitor the aforementioned compliance, facilitate communication between belligerents {{in order to}} ease security dilemma concerns thus reassuring belligerents that the other <b>side</b> <b>will</b> not renege, and allow for belligerents to signal their legitimate intentions for peace to the other side. That is to say, provide a meaningful pathway for communication between both sides to make their intentions known and credible.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the tackle}} count the attacking <b>side</b> <b>will</b> {{start to think}} defensively in {{anticipation}} of a handover, also known as a changeover or turnover. That is, whilst most kicks performed at this time will be primarily for attacking purposes, there is always a defensive element to consider. The attacking team uses these tactics to put themselves in the better defensive position when their set of six ends at the 'change over'.|$|E
25|$|The Wednesday Cricket Club {{was founded}} in 1820 and soon {{became one of the}} {{pre-eminent}} cricket clubs in the Sheffield area. The Wednesday club was the direct forerunner of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. The club was reformed in 2011 and has risen from section 7 in the Mansfield District League to section 2 in 2017. It's midweek <b>side</b> <b>will</b> play in division A of the Sheffield Alliance Midweek League in 2018 having won division B in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Host and {{the seven}} highest-ranked sides on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings as on 30 September 2017 will qualify {{directly}} for the event proper to be held from 30 May to 15 July 2019. The four bottom-ranked <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> be joined by six teams from the ICC World Cricket League in the 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018 and the top two <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> complete the 10-team World Cup line-up.|$|R
5000|$|Covering fifteen weeks, the {{schedule}} featured {{a total of}} 91 matches. The competition was the decider for the top seven <b>sides</b> that <b>will</b> {{become part of the}} top table of New Zealand domestic table via the Premiership, whilst the bottom seven <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> form the Championship. The regular season consisted of two types of matches: ...|$|R
30|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> work towards {{agreed upon}} {{procedures}} and arrangements {{to enable the}} citizens of the two countries to have access to the city of Jerusalem.|$|R
25|$|The play of {{this type}} of ending {{revolves}} around whether or not the pawn can be promoted, or if the defending rook must be sacrificed to prevent promotion. If the pawn promotes, that <b>side</b> <b>will</b> have an overwhelming material advantage. If the pawn is about to promote, the defending side may give up his rook for the pawn, resulting in an easily won endgame for the superior side (a basic checkmate). In a few cases, the superior side gives up his rook in order to promote the pawn, resulting in a won queen versus rook position (see Pawnless chess endgame#Queen versus rook).|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, a draw occurs when {{it appears that}} neither <b>side</b> <b>will</b> win. Draws are codified by various rules of chess {{including}} stalemate (when the player to move has no legal move and is not in check), threefold repetition (when the same position occurs three times with the same player to move), and the fifty-move rule (when the last fifty successive moves made by both players contain no capture or pawn move). A draw also occurs when neither player has sufficient material to checkmate the opponent or when no sequence of legal moves can lead to checkmate.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Five – Advice from a Caterpillar: The Caterpillar {{questions}} Alice and {{she admits}} to her current identity crisis, compounded by {{her inability to}} remember a poem. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that {{one side of the}} mushroom will make her taller and the other <b>side</b> <b>will</b> make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.|$|E
5000|$|Paraxial {{mesoderm}} {{surrounding the}} notochord at the <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> develop into the somites (future muscles, bones, {{and contributes to}} the formation of limbs of the vertebrate [...] ).|$|R
50|$|In October 2012, Vasoon Animation {{signed a}} co-production deal with French {{animation}} studio Folimage Studio. The two <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{work together to}} determine the future of four co-produced animated features.|$|R
50|$|The 9th-placed <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{face the}} runners-up of the 2013 Latvian First League in a two-legged play-off, with the winner being awarded {{a spot in}} the 2014 Higher League competition.|$|R
25|$|Most often, sword {{fighting}} duels {{occur when}} two ships collide during naval combat. Sword fights can also break out during attacks on cities, {{particularly if the}} city has too few defenders to mount a battle outside the city gates, but also if the player manages to reach the town gates during such land battles without first having defeated the enemy force. During these two kinds of fights, the player's crew and the enemy crew will have an important influence on combat. Crew sizes and morale dictate which side {{is more likely to}} lose men during the conflict - any men lost on one <b>side</b> <b>will</b> cause a reduced effectiveness of that side's leader's combat moves.|$|E
25|$|Read this {{carefully}} {{as it may}} save your life or {{the life of a}} relative or a friend. In the next few days, {{some or all of the}} cities named on the reverse <b>side</b> <b>will</b> be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories, which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique that they are using to prolong this useless war. Unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's well-known humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected <b>side</b> <b>will</b> trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus will beat towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E
5000|$|... A {{spokesman}} for China's foreign ministry expressed [...] "concern about these developments", and a [...] "hope that measures taken by all <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{be to the}} benefit of regional peace and stability".|$|R
50|$|After that, {{you must}} choose your action skill to fight. Players have to guess. Opponents choose attacks or defenses. For the battle, both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> have 4 {{commands}} following by the table below.|$|R
50|$|Both North Korea and South Korea {{engage in}} a {{propaganda}} war on the internet. Hackers from both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> attack and shut down each other's websites and direct propaganda messages through social networks.|$|R
25|$|Coin tossing is {{a simple}} and {{unbiased}} way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as {{which side of the}} field a team will play from, or which <b>side</b> <b>will</b> attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.|$|E
500|$|The {{boundaries}} {{were drawn}} up by Robert Wagner, a Chicagoan {{who worked as a}} National Register assistant with the Illinois Department of Conservation. Wagner drew up the boundaries on the basis of [...] "visual integrity.". This led to an irregular pattern of inclusion for the Sycamore Historic District. Often one side of the street will be in the district while the other <b>side</b> <b>will</b> not. In other cases, such as with the library or the U.S. Post Office an arbitrary line was drawn with the sole purpose of including a specific structure.|$|E
500|$|The first tunnel {{connecting}} Watson Island and the Port of Miami {{was completed}} in August 2012., and the second tunnel was completed on May 9, 2013 as [...] "Harriet" [...] emerged back on Watson Island, where digging had commenced in 2011. The roadway construction should finish for an opening on May 15, 2014. The MacArthur Causeway, which currently has three traffic lanes in each direction and a sidewalk on the eastbound <b>side,</b> <b>will</b> be widened to four [...] wide traffic lanes with a ten-foot inner and outer shoulder, {{as well as a}} six-foot sidewalk.|$|E

50|$|If a {{calculation}} was correct before casting out, casting out on both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> preserve correctness. However, {{it is possible}} that two previously unequal integers will be identical modulo 9 (on average, a ninth of the time).|$|R
50|$|In end of April 2013, Cho {{said that}} the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement had been concluded. Both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> sign the {{agreement}} in near future, and hope that the consensus will become effective within the year 2013.|$|R
