Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one microplate, causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks {{on either side of the}} faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake {{was caused by}} right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> drop, more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was [...] thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude. There were at least 155aftershocks, reaching a magnitude of up to 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to [...] below the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> field. This is a non-linear effect of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the sound velocities of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{discrete}} event simulation {{is commonly}} used to identify system bottlenecks and starving and blocking conditions in resources and services. The CONFIG hybrid discrete/continuous simulation tool can simulate such conditions in combination with inputs external to the simulation. This provides a means for evaluating the vulnerability to system accidents of a system's design, operating procedures, and control software. System accidents are brought about by complex unexpected interactions among multiple system failures, faulty or misleading sensor data, and inappropriate responses of human operators or software. The flows of resource and product materials {{play a central role}} in the hazardous situations that may arise in fluid transport and processing systems. We describe the capabilities of CONFIG for simulation-time linear circuit analysis of fluid flows in the context of model-based hazard analysis. We focus on how CONFIG simulates the <b>static</b> <b>stresses</b> in systems of flow. Unlike other flow-related properties, <b>static</b> <b>stresses</b> (or <b>static</b> potentials) cannot be represented by a set of state equations.

40|$|I {{investigate}} how inclusion of <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> changes, caused by tectonic loading and previous seismicity, {{contributes to the}} effectiveness and reliability of prospective earthquake forecasts. Several {{studies have shown that}} positive <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> changes are associated with increased seismicity, relative to stress shadows. However, it is difficult to avoid bias when the learning and testing intervals are chosen retrospectively. I hypothesize that earthquake forecasts based on <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> fields may improve upon existing earthquake forecasts based on historical seismicity. Within southern California, I have confirmed the aforementioned relationship between earthquake location and Coulomb stress change, but found no identifiable triggering threshold based on <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> history at individual earthquake locations. I have also converted <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> changes into spatially-varying earthquake rates by optimizing an index function and calculating probabilities of cells containing at least one earthquake based on Coulomb stress ranges. Inclusion of Coulomb stress effects gives an improvement in earthquake forecasts that is significant with 95 % confidence, compared to smoothed seismicity null forecasts. Because of large uncertainties in Coulomb stress calculations near faults (and aftershock distributions), I combine <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> and smoothed seismicity into a hybrid earthquake forecast. Evaluating such forecasts against those in which only Coulomb stress or smoothed seismicity determines earthquake rates indicates that Coulomb stress is more effective in the far field, whereas statistical seismology outperforms Coulomb stress near faults. Additionally, I test effects of receiver plane orientation, stress type (normal and shear components), and declustering receiver earthquakes. While <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> shows significant potential in a prospective earthquake forecast, simplifying assumptions compromise its effectiveness. For example, we assume that crustal material within the study region is isotropic and homogeneous and purely elastic, and that pore fluid pressure variations do not significantly affect the <b>static</b> Coulomb <b>stress</b> field. Such assumptions require further research in order to detect direct earthquake triggering mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|A central {{problem in}} studies of fault {{interaction}} and earthquake triggering is that of quantifying changes in frictional strength and constitutive response caused by dynamic stressing.

We quantitatively evaluate this model for the apparent triggering of aftershocks by the 1992 M_W 7. 3 Landers and 1994 M_W 6. 7 Northridge earthquakes. Specifically, we test whether the fraction of aftershocks consistent with <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> change triggering {{is greater than the}} fraction of random events which would appear consistent by chance. Although <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> changes appear useful in explaining the triggering of some aftershocks, the model's capability to explain aftershock occurrence varies significantly between sequences. The model works well for Landers aftershocks. Approximately 85 % of events between 5 and 75 km distance from the mainshock fault plane are consistent with <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> change triggering, compared to ∼ 50 % of random events. The minimum distance is probably controlled by limitations of the modeling, while the maximum distance may be because <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> changes of < 0. 01 MPa trigger too few events to be detected. The <b>static</b> <b>stress</b> change triggering model, however, can not explain the first month of the Northridge aftershock sequence significantly better than it explains a set of random events.
