5000|$|Accredited Crane Operator Certification OSHA {{regulation}} 29 CFR 1926 <b>Subpart</b> <b>CC,</b> released August 9, 2010, requires crane operators {{involved in}} construction {{to be certified}} by an accredited certification provider by November 10, 2014. An operator is defined as any person operating the equipment. To be accredited, certification providers must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, defined as [...] "an organization that, due to its independence and expertise, is widely recognized as competent to accredit testing organizations. Examples of such accrediting agencies include, {{but are not limited}} to, the National Commission for Certifying Agencies and the American National Standards Institute." [...] This is the first time certification by an accredited certification provider has been required on a national level, although individual states (e.g., West Virginia, Hawaii, California) and cities (Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia) have required crane operator certification as far back as 2000. The new OSHA standards make the completion of this requirement an important topic of knowledge for the crane and lifting industry.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued the}} second phase of the organic air {{emission}} standards for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) and hazardous waste generators in December 1994. These standards (referred to as the <b>Subpart</b> <b>CC</b> standards) are designed to further reduce organic air emissions from hazardous waste management activities. To comply with these new air standards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is designing a volatile organic removal and destruction treatment train to modify its existing Waste Water Treatment Tank Farm (hereafter called Tank Farm). LLNL`s Tank Farm consists of six, 7, 000 -L open-top tanks used to store and treat aqueous low-level radioactive, mixed, and hazardous waste before discharging it to the local publicly owned treatment works. The waste stored and treated in the tanks have elevated volatile organic constituent (VOC) concentrations. According to the <b>Subpart</b> <b>CC</b> standards, tanks handling waste with similar VOC concentrations must be retrofitted with a cover and an emission control device for cover openings that achieves at least a 95 % reduction in the total organic content of the vented gas stream. However, LLNL concluded that the removal and destruction of VOCs from waste before they enter the Tank Farm would demonstrate compliance with the <b>Subpart</b> <b>CC</b> standards more effectively and be more cost effective than installation of air emission control devices on the Tank Farm. LLNL has designed this removal and destruction technique to consist of an air stripper, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, catalytic oxidizer, scrubber, and mist eliminator...|$|E
40|$|Background Even though lower-limb motor {{disorders}} are core features of spastic cerebral palsy (sCP), {{the relationship with}} brain lesions remains unclear. Unraveling the relation between gait pathology, lower-limb function, and brain lesions in sCP is complex for several reasons; wide heterogeneity in brain lesions, ongoing brain maturation, and gait depends {{on a number of}} primary motor functions/deficits (eg, muscle strength, spasticity). Objective To use a comprehensive approach combining conventional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with sCP above 3 years old to relate quantitative parameters of brain lesions in multiple brain areas to gait performance. Methods A total of 50 children with sCP (25 bilateral, 25 unilateral involvement) were enrolled. The investigated neuroradiological parameters included the following: (1) volumetric measures of the corpus callosum (CC) and lateral ventricles (LVs), and (2) DTI parameters of the corticospinal tract (CST). Gait pathology and primary motor deficits, including muscle strength and spasticity, were evaluated by 3 D gait analysis and clinical examination. Results In bilateral sCP (n = 25), volume of the LV and the <b>subparts</b> of the <b>CC</b> connecting frontal, (pre) motor, and sensory areas were most related to lower-limb functioning and gait pathology. DTI measures of the CST revealed additional relations with the primary motor deficits (n = 13). In contrast, in unilateral sCP, volumetric (n = 25) and diffusion measures (n = 14) were only correlated to lower-limb strength. Conclusions These results indicate that the combined influence of multiple brain lesions and their impact on the primary motor deficits might explain {{a large part of the}} gait pathology in sCP...|$|R
