40|$|The paper {{describes}} some of {{the most}} recent activities in Germany in the technical assessment of future European launcher architecture. In focus is a joint effort of DLR-SART with German launcher industry in the definition of a next generation upper-medium class expendable TSTO with an initial operational capability after 2020. Involved companies are EADS astrium and MT Aerospace. This DLR-agency funded study WOTAN investigates fully cryogenic launchers as well as those with a combination of solid and cryogenic stages, fulfilling a requirement of 5000 kg single payload into GTO. Solid strap-on boosters should allow both versions further payload growth capability. In its second part the paper analyzes options for new liquid fuel upper stages to be put on the P 80 solid first stage of the Vega small launcher. Versions with storable as well as cryogenic propellants are investigated in a preliminary launcher <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> <b>and</b> their technical viability is critically assessed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} gaining {{insight into the}} main factors {{that have to be}} taken into account when {{designing}} a planning system for the co-ordination between cells in a cellular manufacturing system. In the last decades, the application of cellular manufacturing systems has become increasingly popular, both in production and service industries. The concept is known under various names: team based production, semi-autonomous groups, group technology, and so on. A change towards cellular manufacturing has important consequences for both the design and organization of the production <b>system</b> (<b>lay-out,</b> technology, <b>and</b> the allocation of tasks, responsibility and authority with respect to the transformation process in the system). However, the transformation process has to be planned and controlled in order to obtain the logistical benefits of a change towards cellular manufacturing. In this study, we investigate the consequences of applying cellular manufacturing for the design of a planning system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of reliability}} of systems has, for decades, {{been based on}} the structure function, which expresses functioning of a system given the states of its components. One problem of the structure function is that, in its simplest form, for a system with m components it must be specified for 2 m combinations of component states, which is impossible for most practical systems and networks. Recently, the authors have introduced the survival signature, which is {{a summary of the}} structure function that is meaningful if the system’s components can be divided into groups with exchangeable failure times. The survival signature takes all the aspects of the <b>system</b> <b>lay-out</b> into account <b>and</b> is sufficient for a range of inferences, in particular, to derive the system’s failure time distribution given the components’ failure time distributions. In this paper, we provide a brief introductory overview of the survival signature, including recent advances. We then suggest a fundamental change {{to the nature of the}} structure function, namely from being a binary function to a probability, or even an imprecise probability. This provides a generalized tool for realistic quantification of system reliability and can straightforwardly be incorporated into the survival signature. We discuss opportunities these concepts provide for practical reliability assessment, and challenges for their application to real-world systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of design}} and operation of combined heat, cooling and power systems usually leads to select different plant <b>lay-outs</b> <b>and</b> size of <b>components,</b> depending on the adopted optimization criterion (maximum profit or energy saving or minimum environmental impact). This occurs when the current energy prices and the normative provisions supporting cogeneration {{are not able to}} coincide with the specific customer’s interest and the overall ‘‘social interest’’ for a reduction in energy consumption and in pollutants’ emissions. At EU level, polygeneration is considered to have a large potential for residential and commercial buildings district network, for the tertiary sector and for industrial applications. In such applications, it is often convenient to integrate the trigeneration system with a reversible heat pump, because of a low ratio between electric demand and that for heating and cooling. In this paper, the design and operation of such hybrid systems is discussed. The results achievable through different operation modes are compared and, with reference to a 600 -rooms hotel and a 300 -beds hospital in Italy, the effects on plant design from an hour-by-hour optimization of plant operation are assessed. Finally, the need for a flexible support system for cogeneration plants is put into evidence and some criteria are listed for an effective regulation...|$|R
