[...] In addition, failures were uncovered in [...] "the way the forces understood the operative reality and implemented it." [...] As there were no perceived missile threats, an officer had left the ship's anti-missile suite disabled, in energy-saving <b>standby-mode,</b> while patrolling near the coast.|$|E
50|$|The story {{concludes with}} a {{conversation}} between George Nine and George Ten. Deactivated and placed in storage, they can only speak in the brief intervals when their power levels rise above the <b>standby-mode</b> threshold. Over what a human would experience as a long time, the Georges discuss the criteria for what constitutes 'responsible authority'- that (A) an educated, principled and rational person should be obeyed in preference to an ignorant, immoral and irrational person, and (B) that superficial characteristics such as skin tone, sexuality, or physical disabilities are not relevant when considering fitness for command. Given that (A) the Georges {{are among the most}} rational, principled and educated persons on the planet, and (B) their differences from normal humans are purely physical, they conclude that in any situation where the Three laws would come into play, their own orders should take priority over that of a regular human. That in other words, that they are essentially a superior form of human being, and destined to usurp the authority of their makers.|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of the copier procurement project is an accelerated market introduction of innovative copiers with very low <b>standby-mode</b> and short recovery time in the medium speed market segment. If strong market pull helps to advance market introduction by two years, annual energy savings {{are estimated to be}} in the order of 100 to 1000 GWh/year during some 15 years. The savings depend mainly on the long term market penetration of this innovative copier and on the power management of the copiers with today's technology (figure 1) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we use a}} {{conversion}} chain to minimize <b>standby-mode</b> power consumption, detailing the {{different parts of the}} emitter and the receiver. The proposed technology is based on an efficient radio-frequency (RF) energy transfer and an RF-dc conversion circuit with a self-maintained switch that wakes up an electronic device [e. g., television (TV), home automation systems, etc. ], using an integrated emitter and a receiver with performances suitable for home or industrial applications. The developed system works in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band (2. 4 - 2. 48 GHz) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a method which generates time-space trajectories of {{travelers}} by analyzing data from the mobile phone network. The method utilizes mainly the data from location-area-updates, which are recorded from any mobile phone in the <b>standby-mode</b> and thus does not require phone calls or handset equipment. The main idea of the method is to derive location-area-sequences for single trips from the mobile phone data and to compare these with location-area-sequences, {{which are based on}} routes through the road and rail network. The method generates a vast number of trajectories on highways and can be used for several applications in the field of transportation planning. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method {{that uses a}} {{combined}} approach of sleep-state assignment and threshold voltage (Vt) assignment in a dual-Vt process. While each of these methods has previously been used individually, their combined effect has not been leveraged to date. By combining Vt and sleep-state assignment, leakage current can be dramatically reduced since the circuit is in a known state in <b>standby-mode</b> and only transistors that are off {{need to be considered}} for high-Vt assignment. A significant improvement in the leakage/ performance trade-off is therefore achievable using such a combined method. We formulate the optimization problem for simultaneous state and Vt assignment under delay constraints and propose both an exact method for its optimal solution {{as well as a number}} of practical heuristics with reasonable run time. We compare our results with Vt and sleep state assignment only and demonstrate an average decrease in leakage current of 3. 5 X compared to previous approaches...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is a {{significant}} reliability concern for nanoscale CMOS circuits. Its effects on circuit timing can be especially pronounced for circuits with <b>standby-mode</b> equipped functional units because these units can be subjected to static NBTI stress for extended periods of time. This paper proposes internal node control, in which the inputs to individual gates are directly manipulated to prevent this static NBTI fatigue. We give a mixed integer linear program formulation for an optimal solution to this problem. The optimal placement of internal node control yields an average 26. 7 % reduction in NBTI-induced delay over a ten year period for the ISCAS 85 benchmarks. We find {{that the problem is}} NP-complete and present a linear-time heuristic {{that can be used to}} quickly find near-optimal solutions. The heuristic solutions are, on average, within 0. 17 % of optimal and all were within 0. 60 % of optimal. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} {{influential}} buyers may create a strong enough market pull to accelerate market introduction of an innovative energy efficient fast copier. Procurement of innovative technologies {{is well known}} in the industrial sector. Usually there are very few players involved: one buyer and few manufacturers, and the aim is mainly to increase performance and reduce costs. For several years, co-operative procurement has been used in some countries – e. g. by Nutek in Sweden and by a consortium of utilities SERP (Super Efficient Refrigerator Program) in the U. S. in the “Golden Carrot ” Program – as a Market-Pull measure with the aim to accelerate innovation in energy efficiency of equipment and appliances. What has hardly ever been done is a cooperative procurement at a multinational level. Going international can strengthen the market pull signal (more buyers) in traditional market segments (appliances and equipment), and open new domains for technology procurement activities in international market segments, such as office equipment and consumer electronics. International coordination is an important factor for a strong market-pull. The challenge of the copier procurement project is an accelerated market introduction of innovative copiers with very low <b>standby-mode</b> and short recovery time in the medium speed market segment. If strong market pull helps to advance market introduction by two years, annual energy savings are estimated to be in the order of 10...|$|E
