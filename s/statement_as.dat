5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|Since this Life first {{appeared}} in McClure's Magazine not one important <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned. It {{is a product of}} much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason the wretched cult would not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and conclusive, and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed as to the history or nature of Eddyism.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E

Veltmann objected that each statement was obtained under duress and was not voluntary. Coakley characterized the <b>statements</b> <b>as</b> not being confessions requiring voluntary conditions but merely [...] "admissions" [...] that had no such requirement. Osterhaus ruled that Coakley could not introduce the <b>statements</b> <b>as</b> evidence but that he could ask the defendants questions based on what each man's signed statement contained.|$|R

5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there {{does not seem to}} be any authoritative <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E

25|$|To {{establish}} a mathematical <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> a theorem, a proof is required, that is, {{a line of}} reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish {{the status of a}} <b>statement</b> <b>as</b> a theorem. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the rule}} against hearsay {{was aimed at}} prohibiting the use of another person's <b>statement,</b> <b>as</b> {{equivalent}} to testimony by the witness to the fact.

Examples of fabrication: A person giving directions to a tourist when the person doesn't actually know the directions. Often propaganda is fabrication.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements.

Even written documents made under oath, such as affidavits or notarized statements, {{are subject to the}} 'hearsay rule'.|$|E
