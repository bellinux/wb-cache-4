5|$|The film {{is set in}} the Victorian {{period of}} India's colonial British Raj. The story {{revolves}} around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.|$|E
5|$|Chao {{are small}} creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with {{pleasant}} and relaxing personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in Sonic Adventure 2, states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, <b>spins</b> <b>around,</b> or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has been treated well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has been treated poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} a top. The top <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> its own axis of symmetry; this corresponds to its intrinsic rotation. It also rotates around its pivotal axis, with its {{center of mass}} orbiting the pivotal axis; this rotation is a precession. Finally, the top can wobble up and down; the inclination angle is the nutation angle. The same example can be seen with {{the movements of the}} earth.|$|E
25|$|Common {{house rules}} allow players to 'finger' or blow {{the ball out}} of the cup if the ball <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs {{allowing}} each player to shoot again. In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, {{gravitational}} waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, {{provided that the}} motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning dumbbell. If the dumbbell <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> its axis of symmetry, it will not radiate {{gravitational waves}}; if it tumbles end over end, {{as in the case}} of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.|$|E

25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced focal plane tomography in X-ray tomography imaging.|$|E

500|$|Tenacious D are {{supporters}} of cannabis legalization. They have also performed at a NORML benefit concert. Black described his view that allowing drug use would remove {{the stigma of}} feeling [...] "naughty" [...] attached to users, making the activity mundane and less attractive. Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled Sixty <b>Spins</b> <b>Around</b> the Sun. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller drug laws to be repealed. Black said of it, [...] "They're populating our prisons with people, you know, first time drug offenders—single mothers that {{have a little bit}} of coke end up going to prison for 20years or something. It's just cruel and unusual punishment." ...|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey uses KUKA robocoaster technology, {{which allows}} the seats to pivot while being held above the track by a robotic arm. However, the ride is not a roller coaster but a scenic dark ride. The {{experience}} includes a flight around Hogwarts castle, an encounter with the Whomping Willow and a horde of Dementors, and a Quidditch match. The ride drops, <b>spins</b> <b>around,</b> twists and turns, but does not turn upside down, though passengers sometimes lie flat on their backs. Over-the-shoulder bars are used to secure guests in their seats, and a single parabolic metal bar [...] {{is used as a}} hand grip. At the conclusion of the ride, guests exit into Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods gift shop.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, The Simpsons was using traditional animation without computers, {{but they had to}} get one for a scene where the camera <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> the car from above. The car was difficult to animate because it had to [...] "look real" [...] and not [...] "boxy like a truck". The car was based on a 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges. The Simpsons animator David Silverman said that the episode was [...] "probably the most difficult one" [...] Scott had to direct on the show.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Crash's sole offensive maneuvers were jumping onto his enemies and a distinctive technique in which he <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> like a tornado, kicking away anyone or anything that he strikes. In later games Crash can expand his range of abilities by defeating boss characters. The expanded abilities include a powerful splash, the ability to jump while in the air, the [...] "Death Tornado Spin" [...] (a variation of his spinning technique that allows him to hover through the air for a limited time), a bazooka that fires Wumpa Fruit, increased running speed, the ability to safely tip-toe on top of explosive crates, and the ability to jump at incredibly high heights. The games Crash of the Titans and [...] allow Crash to further expand his offensive abilities with new fighting moves learned from collecting a magical substance known as [...] "Mojo". In , Crash has the ability to throw TNT crates, and can use his Yo-yo to bring in enemies to spin attack.|$|E

2500|$|The turn is {{executed}} {{immediately after}} or {{even during the}} end of the rockback. As the name implies, the vaulter turns 180° toward the pole while extending the arms down past the head and shoulders. Typically the vaulter will begin to angle their body toward the bar as the turn is executed, although ideally the vaulter will remain as vertical as possible. A more accurate description of this phase of the vault may be [...] "the spin" [...] because the vaulter <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> an imaginary axis from head to toe.|$|E
2500|$|St Lythans Burial Chamber is {{also known}} as Gwâl y Filiast (...) — the site had been used as an animal shelter in the early 19th century– and Maes y Felin (...) , {{apparently}} from the legend that, each Midsummer's Eve, the capstone <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> three times and all the stones go to the nearby river to bathe. [...] The cromlech stands in a field known as the [...] "Accursed Field", so called due to its supposed infertility.

2500|$|When Beauty and the Beast was released, many animators were {{impressed}} with the studio for [...] "pushing the envelope", while some considered the scene to be [...] "a miserable failure", accusing its new technology of distracting from [...] "the moment". Describing the scene as [...] "an early experiment in computer animation," [...] Josh Larsen of Larsen on Film observed that the ballroom sequence features [...] "the camera swooping in and around to provide an expansive sense of space that 3-D still isn’t able to capture." [...] In her book The Beautiful Ache, author Leigh McLeroy wrote that the scene represents [...] "one of those strange moments where love creeps in against all odds and insists on staying put." [...] Audiences tend to remember the ballroom sequence as [...] "the one in which Belle and the Beast share a romantic dance as the camera files and <b>spins</b> <b>around</b> them." [...] Angela Lansbury recalled being [...] "astonished" [...] when she first saw the [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "unique" [...] scene. In Moviepilot's Chris Lucas' opinion, [...] "The ballroom scene remains the one that truly symbolizes their adoration for each other." [...] IGN believes that the scene [...] "signals the completion of [...] inner change - from irascible recluse into [...] true love." ...|$|E
