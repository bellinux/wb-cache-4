25|$|Animal {{rights groups}} are also {{primarily}} concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned {{that they have}} been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is <b>soring,</b> a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a Tennessee Walking Horse to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the United States Department of Agriculture, <b>soring</b> is still widespread and difficult to eliminate. Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries. Among these are horse-tripping, a sport where riders chase and rope a loose-running horse by its front legs, throwing it to the ground.|$|E

500|$|<b>Soring</b> {{began in}} the 1950s with gaited horse {{trainers}} who were looking to improve their chances of winning at horse shows. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action gaits to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive shoeing and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front {{feet off the ground}} more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, <b>soring</b> had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition. However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part {{to address the issue of}} <b>soring.</b> In 1969, Senator Joseph Tydings sponsored legislation to prohibit <b>soring,</b> leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970, amended in 1976. While Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking Horses and other [...] "high-stepping breeds" [...] are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E
500|$|<b>Soring</b> is the {{practice}} of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner that creates the movement or [...] "action" [...] desired in the show ring. <b>Soring</b> {{is an act of}} animal cruelty that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E

500|$|<b>Soring</b> can be {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not {{to react to the}} pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present. Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years, <b>soring</b> is still practiced and criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end <b>soring.</b>|$|E
500|$|The largest {{association}} in the United States for equine veterinarians, the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP), called {{the practice of}} <b>soring</b> [...] "one {{of the most significant}} welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline" [...] after releasing a white paper on the subject in 2008. The organization pointed out that despite over three decades of work, the HPA law had failed to prevent sored horses from being trained, shown, and sold. The AAEP blamed this failure on what they called the [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] level of funding for enforcement, which the law caps at $500,000 annually. The federal Office of Inspector General found in 2010 that the self-enforcement system of HIOs and DQPs was inadequate for eliminating the practice of <b>soring.</b> This led to the June 2012 strengthening of penalty systems.|$|E

500|$|The Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA); (codified [...] ) is a United States federal law, {{under which}} the {{practice}} of <b>soring</b> is a crime punishable by both civil and criminal penalties, including fines and jail time. It is illegal to show a horse, enter it at a horse show, or to auction, sell, offer for sale, or transport a horse {{for any of these}} purposes if it has been sored.|$|E
500|$|<b>Soring</b> {{is defined}} by the HPA with four meanings: [...] "(3)(A) an irritating or {{blistering}} agent has been applied, internally or externally, by a person to any limb of a horse, (B) any burn, cut, or laceration has been inflicted by a person on any limb of a horse, (C) any tack, nail, screw, or chemical agent has been injected by a person into or used by a person on any limb of a horse, or (D) any other substance or device has been used by a person on any limb of a horse or a person has engaged in a practice involving a horse, and, as a result of such application, infliction, injection, use, or practice, such horse suffers, or can reasonably be expected to suffer, physical pain or distress, inflammation, or lameness when walking, [...] " [...] Action devices, which remain legal but are often used in conjunction with illegal <b>soring</b> practices, are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as [...] "any boot, collar, chain, roller, or other device which encircles or is placed upon the lower extremity of the leg of a horse in such a manner that it can either rotate around the leg, or slide up and down the leg so as to cause friction, or which can strike the hoof, coronet band or fetlock joint". Between 1978 and 1982, research was undertaken by Auburn University as to the effect of applications of chemical and physical irritants to the legs of Tennessee Walking Horses. The study found that chains of any weight used in combination with chemical <b>soring</b> produced lesions and pain in horses. However, chains of 6 ounces or lighter, used on their own, produced no pain, tissue damage or thermographic changes.|$|E
500|$|As {{originally}} enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to {{be enforced}} by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), {{a branch of the}} USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates [...] "the potential for a [...] "fox guarding the chicken coop" [...] situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of <b>soring,</b> the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of <b>soring.</b> When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{challenges}} to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding due process and equal protection, none of which were successful. [...] Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the act, including whether knowledge of <b>soring</b> or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it is not. The issue of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is the only issue that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the Circuit Court level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the Fifth Circuit Court, it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.|$|E
500|$|<b>Soring</b> can be also {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs.

The practice is called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and benzocaine, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads.

500|$|The showing, {{exhibition}} {{and sale of}} Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of <b>soring,</b> which developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice [...] "cruel and inhumane". The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show. Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections.

500|$|The Celebration {{has often}} been criticized with {{allegations}} of <b>soring</b> of horses at the event, an abusive practice designed to make horses step higher and illegal under federal law by the Horse Protection Act of 1970. The sponsors of the Celebration have consistently denied the allegations. Every horse entered in the Celebration must undergo an inspection designed to detect sored horses conducted by an APHIS-employed inspector before the horse is allowed to show. Inspectors may use hoof testers (plier-like tools which direct pressure on {{an area of the}} foot to find any source of pain), leg swabs and other tools such as thermography to detect signs of horses being sored. In 2006, the concerns escalated between trainers and inspectors from APHIS. [...] Initially, trainers refused to submit their horses for inspection, creating a stand-off that required law enforcement intervention. Then, prior to the World Grand Championship finals, inspectors disqualified all but three of the finalists. [...] A group of approximately 150 people gathered, demanding that the disqualified horses be allowed to show. However, citing safety concerns, the show management cancelled the class altogether and no World Grand Champion was crowned that year.|$|E
500|$|There are two breed {{registries}} for the Spotted Saddle Horse. In 1979, the National Spotted Saddle Horse Association (NSSHA) {{was organized}} in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The association focuses on promoting naturally-gaited saddle horses with pinto coloration. The NSSHA is adamant about disallowing cruel and inhumane training and showing practices, including <b>soring,</b> sometimes seen in {{other elements of}} the Spotted Saddle Horse industry, and prohibited by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA). The NSSHA also bans the use of action devices (such as chains or other weights around the pasterns) and performance packages (stacks of pads attached to the shoe, sometimes weighted or used to conceal abusive shoeing practices) in their shows, which goes beyond the protection afforded by the HPA. In 1985, the Spotted Saddle Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (SSHBEA) was formed, headquartered in Shelbyville, Tennessee. The SSHBEA is recognized as a [...] "Horse Industry Organization" [...] (HIO) under the HPA, and occasionally sees violations of the HPA at their shows.

If passed, the bill, {{nearly identical to}} HR 6388, would amend the Horse Protection Act of 1970 to increase fines to $5,000, increase prison time to three years, and increase other penalties. It would also mandate the USDA to assign a licensed inspector if a show management indicates its intent to hire one, currently a voluntary practice. The bill would prohibit the use of [...] "action devices" [...] and [...] "stacks". Action devices are weights attached around the pasterns of horses, and if attached so that they move, they can rub or irritate sored areas and thus further enhance gaits. Stacks are layers of pads attached {{to the bottom of}} the front hooves between the horseshoe and the hoof, which increase the lift of the foot and the impact with the ground by adding height and weight to horses' front feet. The final change would be to increase penalties for violations of the act. The bill was assigned to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Both bills have been opposed by some organizations within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. The President and executive committee of the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (TWHBEA) voted to support this legislation, but the full board of directors chose not to.
