50|$|Ostrinia obumbratalis, the <b>smartweed</b> <b>borer,</b> is a moth in the Crambidae family. It was {{described}} by Lederer in 1863. It is found in North America, {{where it has been}} recorded from New Brunswick and Manitoba to Louisiana and Florida.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{variability}} of seven European corn borer populations, Ostrinia nubilalis, from North America and Europe {{was assessed by}} polymerase chain reaction- {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (PCRRFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS- 1) region (â‰ˆ 500 base pair [bp]) and four mitochondrial (mtDNA) regions (1550 bp total) were examined. The <b>smartweed</b> <b>borer,</b> Ostrinia obumbratalis, and south-Western corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, were used for comparisons. Of 106 restriction sites identified (80 in mtDNA and 26 in ITS- 1), none differentiated geographical populations, pheromone races, or voltine ecotypes of the European corn borer. The lack of variation in the ITS- 1 of European corn borer was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The genetic similarity of European corn borer populations, despite their wide geographical range and physiological differences, may be explained by a relatively recent origin for the voltinism and pheromone races, gene flow among races, and/or expansion from genetic bottlenecks...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid advance}} westward of the European corn borer in 1926 has aroused the whole nation, {{particularly}} the corn belt states. New infestations were found all thru southern Michigan, across northern Ohio and into six counties in northeastern Indiana. An isolated infestation {{was discovered in}} Kankakee County, Illinois, only about 150 miles from Iowa. A number of caterpillars occurring in Iowa are frequently mistaken for the Eropean corn borer. Some of these are of about the saine size and quite similar in color markings and general appear. ance, while others, even tho they are very different in appearance, cause injury which resembles somewhat {{the work of the}} European corn borer. This circular is issued. to acquaint farmers and Iowa people in general with the habits and characters of these caterpillars. By careful consideration of the larval descriptions, the time of appearance, and character of the injury, the European corn borer may be distinguished from most of the caterpillars discussed in this circular. The <b>smartweed</b> <b>borer</b> and the lotus borer are exceptions, because they so closely resemble the European corn borer that it requires an expert and a microscope to identify them with certainty...|$|E
