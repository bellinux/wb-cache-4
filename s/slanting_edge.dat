Measurement of MTF by using <b>slanting</b> <b>edge</b> method is an important way to evaluate the quality of a slanted edge image, as it is difficult to acquire a straight image. Slanted edge image offers more data by reprojection of the data to the slanted line, and gives more points in the edge spread function (ESF). Straight and slanted edge images data were used to measure the ESF, the line spread function (LSF) and the presampled MTF using MATLAB R 2011 a program. Edge images were taken from a thick lead foil in a conventional radiographic screen-film system, and a, thick aluminium test objects with a thick lead in a Fuji computed radiography (FCR) system. Edge images of lead test devices provide higher MTFs than that of aluminiums.

30|$|The {{practical}} depth-of-focus for {{the camera}} presented here was measured using a <b>slanted</b> <b>edge</b> to determine the loss at modulation over a range of spatial frequencies most affected by defocus. A “Golden Target” which incorporates a <b>slanted</b> <b>edge</b> was imaged with the IR camera system as it was moved {{in and out of}} the object plane. A metric of the loss modulation due to going out of focus is to calculate the area under the MTF curve from 0.15 to 0.45 cycles per pixel for each position. Limiting the area loss to 30 % of the normalized area gave a depth of focus of ± 2  mm in object space. Thus, to image panel paintings having outer plane deviation in excess of ± 3  mm would give unacceptable blurring of the IRR mosaic. Given the high signal-to-noise of the camera system, some adaptive sharpening can restore much of this loss in sharpness, as this limit is approached.|$|R

30|$|Because {{of small}} errors and {{accuracy}} limitations {{that arise in}} {{each part of the}} system, the effective resolution is different from the sampled resolution. The ISO guideline 12233 : 2000 was used to compute the in-plane sampling efficiency. The effective resolution was found to be 65 µm and 46 µm for respectively the horizontal and vertical axis. This method of computing the sampling efficiency is usually applied for sampling camera sensors, and it involves the capture of a planar <b>slanted</b> <b>edge</b> target. The <b>slanted</b> <b>edges</b> in this target is then measured for its ‘sharpness’ and results in its sampling frequency response, from which the sampling efficiency is derived. At each coordinate, our system also captures the color information at the exact same location as the depth is sampled. The spatial accuracy of the color information is therefore directly related to the accuracy of our three dimensional data. We can directly relate these metrics if we project our three dimensional data to a two dimensional plane. From this two dimensional plane, we then take the color map, resulting in a common 2 -D image. We can then proceed with extracting the sampling frequency response following the ISO guideline.|$|R

30|$|A digital zooming {{system can}} {{increase}} spatial resolution without a high density image sensor or a high cost optical zoom lens. Recently, most digital cameras adopt a digital zooming system, which is commonly implemented by convolving an up-sampled {{version of the}} low-resolution (LR) image with a small kernel using proper weighting coefficients. Popular convolution-based up-sampling methods include linear and cubic-spline interpolation (Wick et al. 2004). Linear interpolation simply averages four neighboring pixels with weights that are inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} target pixel. On the other hand, cubic-spline interpolation determines the pixel intensity value using the weighted average of sixteen neighboring pixels with weights determined by the two dimensional (2 D) cubic function. However, neither linear nor cubic-spline interpolation can avoid jagged artifacts in the <b>slanted</b> <b>edge</b> region and blurring artifacts {{due to the nature of}} the rectangular-shaped interpolation kernel (Papker et al. 1983; Unser et al. 1991).|$|R

It is confirmed that the intensity of the surface pressure fluctuations varies in the streamwise direction, and that most of the low-frequency noise is generated {{at the root of the}} serrations. It is concluded that the additional noise reduction achieved by the use of combs is due to the mitigation of the outward flow motion at the root. Furthermore, it is shown that the edge-oriented correlation length and the convection velocity of the surface pressure fluctuations are the two statistical flow parameters that influence both the intensity and the frequency range of noise reduction.
