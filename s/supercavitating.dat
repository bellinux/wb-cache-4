50|$|A <b>supercavitating</b> torpedo is a torpedo {{using the}} effect of {{supercavitation}} to create a bubble around the torpedo to move at high velocity under water. The following {{is a list of}} <b>supercavitating</b> torpedoes which have been developed or are in development.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>supercavitating</b> propeller is the surface piercing, or ventilated propeller. These propellers are designed to intentionally cleave the water and entrain atmospheric air to fill the void, {{which means that the}} resulting gas layer on the forward face of the propeller blade consists of air instead of water vapour. Less energy is thus used, and the surface-piercing propeller generally enjoys lower drag than the <b>supercavitating</b> principle. The surface-piercing propeller also has wedge-shaped blades, and propellers may be designed that can operate in both <b>supercavitating</b> and surface-piercing mode.|$|E

50|$|The <b>supercavitating</b> {{propeller}} is {{a variant}} of a propeller for propulsion in water, where supercavitation is actively employed to gain increased speed by reducing friction. They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats, as well as model racing boats. The <b>supercavitating</b> propeller operates submerged with the entire diameter of the blade below the water line. Its blades are wedge-shaped to force cavitation on the whole forward face, starting at the leading edge, {{in order to reduce}} water skin friction. As the cavity collapses well behind the blade, the <b>supercavitating</b> propeller avoids the spalling damage due to cavitation that is a problem with conventional propellers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underwater}} {{capabilities of}} MEA series <b>supercavitating</b> ammunition {{allow it to}} be used for Unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) applications. The armed UUVs can be used in both offensive and defensive underwater warfare operations. Using the [...]50 BMG <b>supercavitating</b> cartridge, an armed UUV can potentially destroy steel-hulled underwater objects from a distance of 60 meters, or could potentially hit a target 1,000 meters in the air from a location 5 meters below the surface.|$|E
50|$|Super{{cavitation}} {{is the use}} of cavitation {{effects to}} create a bubble of steam inside a liquid large enough to encompass an object travelling through the liquid, greatly reducing the skin friction drag on the object and enabling achievement of very high speeds. Current applications are mainly limited to projectiles or very fast <b>supercavitating</b> torpedoes, and some propellers, but in principle the technique could be extended to include entire vehicles. Chinese and the US Navy are reportedly working on <b>supercavitating</b> submarines.|$|E

50|$|<b>Supercavitating</b> {{ammunition}} that functions better underwater {{has been}} developed by Defence & Security Group (DSG), a Norwegian company. The Multi-Environment Ammunition (MEA) series <b>supercavitating</b> rifle ammunition, developed and marketed by DSG, is anticipated to be useful for certain special operations, including underwater warfare. These include defensive applications such as diver protection, and offensive applications such as neutralizing enemy divers, VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) operations, MIO (maritime interception operations), GOPLATS (Gas and oil platform) boarding operations, speedboat interdiction and neutralization, anti-submarine warfare, anti-torpedo operations, and certain counter-piracy operations.|$|E
50|$|The Kursk {{submarine}} {{accident was}} rumored to {{have been due to}} a faulty Shkval <b>supercavitating</b> torpedo, though later evidence points to a faulty 65-76 torpedo (see Kursk submarine disaster).|$|E
5000|$|The VA-111 Shkval (from шквал — squall) torpedo and its {{descendants}} are <b>supercavitating</b> torpedoes {{originally developed}} by the Soviet Union. They are capable of speeds in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h).|$|E
50|$|Cavitation {{can be used}} as an {{advantage}} in design of very high performance propellers, in form of the <b>supercavitating</b> propeller. In this case, the blade section is designed such that the pressure side stays wetted while the suction side is completely covered by cavitation vapor. Because the suction side is covered with vapor instead of water it encounters very low viscous friction, making the <b>supercavitating</b> (SC) propeller comparably efficient at high speed. The shaping of SC blade sections however, make it inefficient at low speeds, when the suction side of the blade is wetted. (See also fluid dynamics).|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} rocket-propelled torpedoes were tried soon after Whitehead's invention {{but were not}} successful. Rocket propulsion has been implemented successfully by the Soviet Union, for example in the VA-111 Shkval—and has been recently revived in Russian and German torpedoes, as it is especially suitable for <b>supercavitating</b> devices.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 February 2008, the Iranian Defense Ministry {{announced}} that 74 domestically produced [...] "gunboats" [...] (small missile boats) had entered service with the Iranian Navy. picture The Navy has had {{reported to have}} the Hoot <b>supercavitating</b> torpedo and the Thaqeb (missile) in trials or service, though reliable information is scarce.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, the United States Navy began {{developing}} a sea mine clearance system invented by C Tech Defense Corporation, known as RAMICS (Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System), {{based on a}} <b>supercavitating</b> projectile stable in both air and water. These have been produced in 12.7 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm diameters. The terminal ballistic design of the projectile allowed it to cause explosive destruction of sea mines as deep as 45 m underwater with a single round. In 2000, these projectiles were used to successfully destroy a range of live underwater mines when fired from a hovering Sea Cobra gunship at Aberdeen Proving Ground. RAMICS is currently undergoing development by Northrop Grumman for introduction into the fleet. The darts of German (Heckler & Koch P11) and Russian underwater firearms, and other similar weapons are also <b>supercavitating.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>supercavitating</b> {{object is}} a high speed {{submerged}} object {{that is designed to}} initiate a cavitation bubble at the nose which (either naturally or augmented with internally generated gas) extends past the aft end of the object, substantially reducing the skin friction drag that would be present if the sides of the object were in contact with the liquid in which the object is submerged. A key feature of the <b>supercavitating</b> object is the nose, which may be shaped as a flat disk or cone, and may be articulated, but which likely has a sharp edge around the perimeter behind which the cavitation bubble forms. [...] The shape of the object aft of the nose will generally be slender in order to stay within the limited diameter of the cavitation bubble. If the bubble is of insufficient length to encompass the object, especially at slower speeds, the bubble can be enlarged and extended by injection of high pressure gas near the object's nose.|$|E
50|$|Two {{experimental}} SESs (the SES-100A and 100B), both {{of around}} 100 tons, with 80 ft (24 m) length and 40 ft (12 m) beams, were {{developed for the}} US Military in the 1960s and 70s. They both attained speeds {{in excess of the}} program goal of 80 knots (150 km/h). The SES 100B, was built by Bell Aerospace (Textron Corporation) at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. Driven by 2 semi-submerged, <b>supercavitating</b> controllable, reversible propellers, achieved speeds in excess of 96 knots (approximately 110 mph) in the Gulf outside St. Andrews Bay in Panama City, Florida.|$|E
5000|$|Inventor Gregory Sancoff {{had decided}} to focus on small {{watercraft}} following {{the attack on the}} USS Cole in 2000, after which he recalled saying: [...] "Some yahoo terrorists in a cheap little boat and $500 worth of explosives can kill 17 sailors on a billion-dollar ship?" [...] He also came across a 630-page United States Navy report on an exercise called Juliet, where the Navy attacked an enemy force of small, high-speed boats; after two days, the Navy had suffered over 20,000 simulated casualties. Sancoff gathered information on marine technology, including hydroplane racing boats and high-speed <b>supercavitating</b> torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|The British Spearfish torpedo {{designed}} to counter high speed Russian submarines, {{such as the}} Alfa class submarine, is reputed to have a speed in excess of 70 knots (130 km/h or 80 mph). The Russian rocket-powered <b>supercavitating</b> torpedo VA-111 Shkval is reportedly capable of speed in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h or 230 mph). German press reports of an underwater anti-torpedo missile named Barracuda that allegedly reaches 800 km/h. The U.S. Navy has contracted with the General Dynamics Electric Boat Division to support development of the Underwater Express, an undersea transport capable of controllable speeds up to 100 knots (185 km/h) through supercavitation.|$|E
5000|$|A natural {{continuation}} {{of these studies}} was recently presented in The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows [...] - an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain {{for the last three}} decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of <b>supercavitating</b> bodies.|$|E
5000|$|The ship's {{helmsman}} had to {{be qualified}} as both a sea pilot and an aircraft pilot. Bras d'Or had two propulsion systems: one for foilborne operation and one for hullborne operation, which included four engines. Foilborne power was provided by a FT4A-2 gas turbine developing [...] at 21,500 rpm through General Electric gearboxes {{to a pair of}} three-bladed <b>supercavitating</b> propellers. Hullborne propulsion was driven by a Paxman Ventura 16YJCM sixteen-cylinder diesel engine to a pair of variable-pitch propellers. Auxiliary power and electrical power while foilborne was provided by an ST6A-53 gas turbine powering an auxiliary gearbox. Both of the P&W turbines were built by United Aircraft of Canada. There was also a Garrett GTCP85-291 gas turbine for essential ship electrical requirements in emergencies.|$|E
50|$|The great speed {{required}} for supercavitation to {{work can be}} achieved temporarily by a projectile fired under water or by an airborne projectile impacting the water. Rocket propulsion {{can be used for}} sustained operation, with the possibility of tapping high pressure gas to route to the object's nose in order to enhance the cavitation bubble. An example of rocket propulsion is the Russian VA-111 Shkval <b>supercavitating</b> torpedo. In principle, maneuvering may be achieved by various means such as drag fins that project through the bubble into the surrounding liquid (p. 22), by tilting the nose of the object, by injecting gas asymmetrically near the nose in order to distort the geometry of the cavity, by vectoring rocket thrust through gimbaling for a single nozzle, or by differential thrust for multiple nozzles.|$|E
50|$|The Ghost uses a dual-pontoon <b>supercavitating</b> hull, {{known as}} the small waterplane-area twin-hull (SWATH), to run at top speed through 10 ft seas. It is gyro-stabilized, control is {{provided}} by 22 underwater control surfaces. Below eight knots, the Ghost sits in the water on its centerline 38 ft-long module; faster than this, the marine aluminum buoyant hulls lifts the main hull {{out of the water}} by two 12 ft-long struts, achieving full stability and reducing the amount of area resisting the water. Each strut is attached to a 62 ft-long underwater tube that contains the engines. Four propellers are {{at the front of the}} tubes, which is more stable and allows for better control at high speeds; the propellers funnel air down through the struts, creating a gas bubble around each tube (the cavitation effect) for reduced drag and smooth motion. Propulsion on the prototype is provided by two T53-703 turboshaft engines providing 2,000 horsepower, there are plans to later adopt the General Electric T700 turboshaft engine. Since the tubes that contain the engines, fuel, and most computing systems are underwater, this lessens vulnerability because critical systems are protected by the water itself. The aircraft-style cockpit is outfitted with large windshields fashioned from two inch-thick glass; steering is provided via a throttle and joystick arrangement. The Ghost has achieved speeds of over 30 knots, and is being tested to 50 knots.|$|E
40|$|<b>Supercavitating</b> {{projectiles}} {{are characterized}} by substantially reduced hydrodynamic drag from the fully wetted underwater projectiles. Drag is localized at {{the nose of the}} projectile, where a cavitator generates a cavity that completely envelops the body (supercavity). While a <b>supercavitating</b> projectile moving in cruise phase, its motion modes is different from that of a usual wetted projectiles. Based on the motion characteristics, an indirect fixed-depth control via controlling the pitch angle feedback schemes adopting the margin steering control method is put forward. The control method is robust and easy to implement. The research may be useful for designing the control system of <b>supercavitating</b> projectiles...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTWe have {{performed}} integrated dynamics modeling for a <b>supercavitating</b> vehicle. A 6 -DOF {{equation of motion}} was constructed by defining the forces and moments acting on the <b>supercavitating</b> body surface that contacted water. The wetted area was obtained by calculating the cavity size and axis. Cavity dynamics were determined to obtain the cavity profile for calculating the wetted area. Subsequently, the forces and moments acting on each wetted part-the cavitator, fins, and vehicle body-were obtained by physical modeling. The planing force-the interaction force between the vehicle transom and cavity wall-was calculated using the apparent mass of the immersed vehicle transom. We in-tegrated each model and constructed an equation of motion for the <b>supercavitating</b> system. We performed numerical simulations using the integrated dynamics model to analyze {{the characteristics of the}} <b>supercavitating</b> system and vali-date the modeling completeness.

40|$|A spatial {{kinetics}} {{model for}} <b>supercavitating</b> vehicles including the coupled motion of pitch, yaw, and rolling was presented. Mathematical simulations {{were performed to}} investigate dynamic performance of <b>supercavitating</b> vehicles. An intrinsic conic-like oscillation in the motion of <b>supercavitating</b> vehicles was discovered. A lakebed experiment was carried out to validate the oscillation. Good agreement is achieved between simulation and experiment {{in terms of the}} amplitude and frequency of attitude angles. The steady phase difference between the motions in different planes is also accurately captured which is about π/ 2. The conic-like oscillation is attributed to the occurrence of the tail-slap motion in the vertical and horizontal planes and the steady phase difference...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Supercavitating</b> vehicle {{utilizes}} supercavity {{to reduce}} the drag force when travelling underwater. It could achieve a speed higher than 200 Kn. The dynamic equations of <b>supercavitating</b> vehicle in the vertical plane were studied and the forces are analyzed in detail in this study. Three possible balanced states and configurations are analyzed. Considering the deviation of mass center during the flight, trajectories of uncontrolled <b>supercavitating</b> flight with these configurations are calculated respectively. Results show that fin position and the deviation of center of mass are main factors that affect the stability of underwater trajectories. The distance between fins and center of mass should be as small as possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on a {{detailed}} modeling of <b>supercavitating</b> flight, the Equivalent Pressure Center (EPC) method is proposed in this paper. To validating the proposed method, both of EPC and integrated moment, which are highly concerned during configuration design process for <b>supercavitating</b> motion, are studied for different configuration parameters including aspect ratio, fin position and cavitator {{size of the}} body. As the relative pitch angle between cavity and the vehicle would change with flight status, well designed vehicle configurations could produce better stability and maneuverability performances by locating the EPC close to the mass center. With {{detailed analysis of the}} EPC result, some of the propositional results for configuration parameters of <b>supercavitating</b> vehicles are given...|$|E
