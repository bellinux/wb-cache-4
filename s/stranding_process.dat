In some instances, debris may have been ingested {{as a result of the}} <b>stranding</b> <b>process</b> and, in others, it may have been ingested when feeding. Those species that are suction or “ram” feeders may be most at risk. There is also evidence of entanglement of cetaceans in marine debris. However, it is usually difficult to distinguish entanglement in active fishing gear from that in lost or discarded gear. The overall significance of the threat from ingested plastics and other debris remains unclear for any population or species of cetaceans, although there are concerns for some taxa, including at the population level, and marine debris in the oceans continues to grow. Further research including the compilation of unpublished material and the investigation of important habitat areas is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMarine {{vertebrate}} strandings {{offer an}} opportunistic sampling scheme {{that can provide}} abundant data over long periods. Because the <b>stranding</b> <b>process</b> involves biological, physical and sociological parameters, confounding complicates the interpretation of results. The statistical analysis of these data relies on generalized linear or additive models in order to infer long-term trends, but does not easily account for drift or variation in reporting rates. Here, we capitalized on county-level (administrative) variation following the passing of a law for compulsory reporting of stranded marine mammals in France to investigate how variation in reporting rates may affect the observed trend in stranded small delphinids in the Bay of Biscay. Using a time-series spanning more than 30 years across eight administrative counties, we built variance partitioning models {{for the analysis of}} count data. We discussed the choice of an appropriate likelihood to conclude the Negative Binomial useful and interpretable in the context of small delphinid strandings. We expanded the model with a recent methodology to detect structural breaks in the time series, focusing on overdispersion. We performed statistical robustness checks with respect to variations in reporting rates and discuss their causal interpretation in the context of observational data. Stranding frequencies increased on average 7 -fold over 30 years. We conclude that reporting rates to the French stranding network have been stable since the early 1990 s, and the average 3 -fold increase in stranded small delphinids observed in the Bay of Biscay since 1990 is due to other factors, including bycatch. Codes and data are available to replicate the analysis to other national stranding networks...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} work {{is to build a}} link between a {{structural}} theory for large-scale analyses of three-dimensional cable structures undergoing, in general, large displacements and rotations, and a refined mechanical description of metallic strands, fully accounting for their composite nature and hysteretic bending behavior. A new formulation for metallic strands is presented. The strand overall mechanical behavior is modeled according to the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. A constitutive law relating the cross sectional generalized stresses and strains of the adopted structural model is obtained by summing over the individual contributions of wires. Each wire in the strand is individually modeled as a curved thin rod. Kinematic equations are proposed to relate the wire generalized strain variables to those of the strand cross section. The equilibrium of the individual wires is analyzed under the hypothesis of radial contact between adjacent layers taking, most notably, also into account the effects due to the residual radial contact forces induced by the strand manufacturing process. Deformations of contact surfaces are neglected and friction is accounted for, through the Amontons-Coulomb law, {{in the study of the}} stick-slip conditions. The proposed sectional model accounts for some distinctive characteristic aspects of wire ropes, such as the coupling between axial force and torque and the non-linear, and non-holonomic, relation between bending moment and curvature, which is a consequence of sliding of wires. The performance of the proposed formulation is assessed with reference to well-documented physical tests and established analytical formulations. Moreover, the role of the residual contact forces due to the <b>stranding</b> <b>process,</b> on the bending behavior of a typical multi-layer strand is assessed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 In {{this study}} an {{analysis}} of the commercial fishery of the Loreto Region, with emphasis on the fishery fleet of Iquitos, Amazon Basin, Peru, is presented. There is evidence of a progressive replacement of large species by smaller, more productive and lower value species in the landing of the commercial fishery in the Loreto region. Strong fishing pressure has produced a decrease of large valuable species such as Brachyplaiystoma flavicans in the commercial landings of the last ten years. No studies have evaluated the association between catch of the fishery fleet and amplitude and duration of the flooding and fishing effort in the Ucayali and Amazon rivers. Hydrological indices were based on the Amazon water stage taken at Iquitos gauge station in the last ten years. Hydrological indices and fishing effort were used as explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression to answer the question whether the factor responsible for the fluctuation in catch per guilds was the intensity of flooding or the severity of the draw-down period while accounting for fishing effort. This analysis was performed with index of the same year and index of the preceding year. The most significant variables were flood index of the same year and number of fishermen-trips. A positive influence of flooding on the omnivore group was evident in the Ucayali (p-value = 0. 03) and Amazon (p-value = 0. 001) rivers. However, this influence was negative (p-value = 0. 03) on the detritivore group in the Ucayali River at high water which is interpreted as being due to reduced feeding places and <b>stranding</b> <b>process.</b> Number of fishermen-trips explains 90 % and 96 % of the variance of annual catches in the Ucayali and Amazon rivers, respectively. Additionally, six catch prediction models are presented...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPoxviruses {{appear to}} use single-strand {{annealing}} reactions to recombine linear molecules sharing short (< 20 bp) regions of end homology. We {{have examined the}} effect of base mismatches and base insertions on the reaction efficiency and used mismatch-containing DNAs to further characterize the polarity of the exonuclease postulated to catalyze these reactions in vivo. Incorporating one or two base substitutions within the 20 -bp segment of end homology {{had little effect on}} virus-promoted recombination, reducing the frequency of recombinational repair of transfected plasmids only 10 – 20 %. Base insertions were more destabilizing and their presence inhibited recombination 40 % (with one insertion) and 75 % (with two). The sequence of the recombinants recovered from virus-infected and transfected cells suggested that hybrid DNA is usually formed and then resolved by replication without repair. However, a few of the joints retained sequences suggestive of more complex enzymatic processing in vivo. We also used transfection studies to examine the fate of each of the four <b>strands</b> <b>processed</b> by the vaccinia recombination machinery. The preferential retention of base substitutions located near each of the 5 ′-ended strands confirmed that virus single-strand annealing reactions are catalyzed primarily by a 3 ′- to 5 ′-exonuclease.

40|$|Recombinational DNA repair is an {{essential}} component of DNA metabolism and the proteins required for recombinational repair pathways are highly conserved. The Escherichia coli RecA protein is studied as a prototypic strand exchange protein with structural and biochemical similarity to the archaeal RadA and eukaryotic Rad 51 family of recombination proteins. Although the RecA protein has been extensively investigated, structural information characterizing the molecular interactions required for DNA binding, pairing, and resolution remain conspiciously unresolved. A detailed molecular model for RecA-mediated strand exchange will provide greater insight into the universal mechanisms of strand exchange and identify similarities and differences between prokaryotic RecA and eukaryotic Rad 51 recombination proteins. Sensitive probes of real-time changes in RecA conformation and RecA-DNA interactions are required to monitor <b>strand</b> exchange <b>processes</b> on a relevant time scale. Fluorescence spectroscopy of the RecA protein has been used to elucidate some of the obscure intermediates involved in the <b>strand</b> exchange <b>process.</b> The rapid timescale of changes in tryptophan fluorescence and the precise placement of fluorescence probes in the RecA protein provide a unique opportunity to obtain structural information from active complexes in real-time (nanoseconds-milliseconds) consistent with transient protein intermediates.
