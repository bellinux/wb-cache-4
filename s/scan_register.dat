Redundancy introduces {{a great amount of}} randomness & non linearity in any kind circuitry (combinational or sequential). We introduce a new type of redundancy in sequential circuits to make redundant <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> that are indistinguishable with the original <b>scan</b> <b>registers.</b> They are sequentially undetectable as well as redundant, which makes it highly secured. The approach is only to replace the original <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> to modified redundant <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> called RScR...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} BETS, {{a behavioral}} test synthesis system, for {{the synthesis of}} high-throughput, area-efficient testable designs. While hardware sharing is a powerful technique to achieve area efficiency, it may adversely affect the testability of the synthesized design by introducing new loops. Besides CDFG loops, hardware sharing introduces three other types of loops: assignment loops, sequential false loops, and register files cliques. We provide a comprehensive analysis and a formal grammar characterization {{of the sources of}} loops in the data path during behavioral synthesis. Partial scan is a cost-effective technique for sequential circuit testing. Hardware sharing of <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> can be used to minimize the number of <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> required to synthesize data paths with minimal number of loops. The <b>scan</b> <b>registers</b> can be shared amongst several variables of the CDFG, to break not only the loops in the CDFG, but also the very loops introduced in the data path by hardware sharing. A new random walk based algorithm is proposed to break all CDFG loops using a minimal number of <b>scan</b> <b>registers.</b> The subsequent scheduling and assignment phase avoids formation of loops in the data path by reusing the <b>scan</b> <b>registers,</b> while ensuring high resource utilization. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique to synthesize easily testable data paths, with nominal hardware overhead, while maintaining the performance of the designs. The partial scan overhead incurred by the technique is significantly less than that of a gate-level partial scan approach...|$|R

ANTIC's graphic modes E and F require more than 7.5K of screen memory for a full screen display. The Display Lists for these displays require the LMS option added to a Mode instruction near {{the middle of the}} display where screen memory crosses the 4K boundary. Note that the 4K boundary cannot be crossed within the middle of a Graphics Mode line. The 4K boundary address can only be crossed between the end of one Mode line {{and the beginning of the}} next line.
