This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the mainstream perspective, that autism {{is caused by a}} genetic defect and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> targeting the autism gene(s), and the fringe theory that autism is caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{initially}} {{curious about}} Disraeli {{when he entered}} Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. [...] He told Matthew Arnold, [...] "Everybody likes flattery; and, {{when you come to}} royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, Adam Kirsch, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, Lord Melbourne. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to kiss hands, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, [...] "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{now defunct}} Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Prime Minister is made a Privy Counsellor {{as a result}} of taking office and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> the {{official}} title prefixed by [...] "The Right Honourable" [...] and not by a personal name. Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As [...] "Prime Minister" [...] is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as [...] "the Prime Minister". The title [...] "Prime Minister" [...] (e.g. [...] "Prime Minister James Smith") is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom, and has more recently become acceptable within it. Within the UK, the expression [...] "Prime Minister Smith" [...] is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{the use of}} {{the title}} [...] "Doctor" [...] is {{dependent}} upon the setting. The title is commonly used socially by physicians and those holding doctoral degrees; however, there was formerly a division between Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners on its social usage by those who are not physicians. Baldrige saw this usage as acceptable, while in contrast, Miss Manners wrote that [...] "only people of the medical profession correctly use the title of doctor socially," [...] but supports those who wish to use it in social contexts in the spirit of addressing people according to their wishes. Miss Manners has since softened her approach, noting in her Washington Post column that there are two approaches: [...] "having been earned, it should be used" [...] and [...] "that level of education being assumed, it need not be expressly mentioned"; while she maintains that everyone should be addressed according to their wishes, she no longer states that only medical professionals use the title correctly but instead acknowledges that the title has been earned by those with Ph.D.s. The Emily Post Institute similarly advises that [...] "Socially as well as professionally, medical doctors, dentists, and other professionals are addressed by, and introduced with, their titles. People who have earned a Ph.D. or any other academic, nonmedical doctoral degree have the choice of whether to use [...] "Dr." [...] both professionally and socially." [...] Other advice columns have also noted that [...] "it has become common to see someone with a Ph.D. addressed on the envelope as Dr., and as a consequence, deviation from convention has become acceptable." [...] Although the usage of the title by Ph.D. graduates has become common, its use socially by holders of professional doctorates (other than physicians) is neither explicitly endorsed nor explicitly discouraged by writers on etiquette. Miss Manners has, however, stated that a physician who has had their license revoked <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> their former preferred honorific (i.e. not according to their M.D. degree). [...] It is unusual for those who hold honorary doctorates to use the title [...] "Doctor".|$|E
60|$|Heroic poesy {{has always}} been sacred to princes, and to heroes. Thus Virgil inscribed his Æneids to Augustus Cæsar; and of latter ages, Tasso and Ariosto {{dedicated}} their poems {{to the house of}} Este. It is indeed but justice, that the most excellent and most profitable kind of writing <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> poets to such persons, whose characters have, for the most part, been the guides and patterns of their imitation; and poets, while they imitate, instruct. The feigned hero inflames the true; and the dead virtue animates the living. Since, therefore, the world is governed by precept and example, and both these can only have influence from those persons who are above us; that kind of poesy, which excites to virtue the greatest men, is of the greatest use to human kind.|$|E

Discourse processing has been shown useful for inference-based application; yet, most systems for textual entailment – a generic paradigm for applied inference – have only addressed discourse considerations via off-the-shelf coreference resolvers. In this paper we explore various discourse aspects in entailment inference, suggest initial solutions for them and investigate their impact on entailment performance. Our experiments suggest that discourse provides useful information, which significantly improves entailment inference, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> better <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> future entailment systems. ...|$|R

The chapter therefore addresses questions such as which criteria should govern the exercise of powers delegated to the administration.

The overall epoxidation reaction is highly exothermic (ΔH =− 230. 3 kJ/mol of each double bond), hence operating conditions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> always <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> safety considerations for the runaway reaction and thermal explosion. In this paper, best operating conditions in order to minimize these risks have been defined.
