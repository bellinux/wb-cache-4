Alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>available</b> <b>voltage</b> gain can be {{understood}} by noting that the charge density on oppositely charged sectors, between the neutralizer bars, is nearly uniform across the sectors, and thus at low voltage, while the charge density on same charged sectors, approaching the collector combs, peaks near the sector edges, at a consequently high voltage relative to the opposite collector combs.|$|R

50|$|A bridge-tied load (BTL), {{also known}} as bridged transformerless and bridged mono, is an output {{configuration}} for audio amplifiers, a form of impedance bridging used mainly in professional audio & car applications. The two channels of a stereo amplifier are fed the same monaural audio signal, with one channel's electrical polarity reversed. A loudspeaker is connected between the two amplifier outputs, bridging the output terminals. This doubles the <b>available</b> <b>voltage</b> swing at the load {{compared with the same}} amplifier used without bridging. The configuration is most often used for subwoofers.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the optimal carrier based {{approach}} for modulating a multilevel converter {{is to use a}} phase disposition (PD) carrier arrangement with a common mode offset added to the reference waveforms to centre the implicitly selected space vectors. However, this strategy does not fully utilize all <b>available</b> <b>voltage</b> levels at lower modulation depths, with an odd level system only using odd voltage levels and an even level system only using even voltage levels as the modulation depth varies.

40|$|The method {{presented}} in this paper addresses the problem of voltage sag state estimation (VSSE). The problem consists in estimating the voltage sags frequency at non-monitored buses from the number of sags measured at monitored sites. Usually, due to limitations on the number of <b>available</b> <b>voltage</b> sag monitors, this is an underdetermined problem. In this approach, the mathematical formulation presented is based on the fault positions concept and is solved by means of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique. The proposed estimation method has been validated by using the IEEE 118 test system and the results obtained have been very satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{improving}} the post-fault performance of Cascaded H-bridge Multilevel Inverters by decreasing the common mode voltage. First, an algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal post-fault state among all possible states which have the same maximum <b>available</b> <b>voltage.</b> Furthermore, a modified technique is proposed to calculate the references of inverter phase voltages under faulty conditions. This technique leads to {{a decrease in the}} common mode voltage when the required output voltage is less than its maximum value. These solutions are mutually employed in the post-fault control system. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in comparison with the existing methods in different cases...|$|R
