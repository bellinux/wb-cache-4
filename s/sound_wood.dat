"That's it, sir, to be repaired, {{and where}} they were past repair, to be copied in <b>sound</b> <b>wood.</b> But, bless you, the money fell short, and there they are, waiting for new subscriptions, and nobody to subscribe. It was all done a year ago, sir. Six gentlemen dined {{together}} about it, at the hotel in the new town. They made speeches, and passed resolutions, and put their names down, and printed off thousands of prospectuses. Beautiful prospectuses, sir, all flourished over with Gothic devices in red ink, saying it was a disgrace not to restore the church and repair the famous carvings, and so on. There are the prospectuses that couldn't be distributed, and the architect's plans and estimates, and the whole correspondence which set everybody at loggerheads and ended in a dispute, all down together in that corner, behind the packing-cases. The money dribbled in a little at first--but what CAN you expect out of London? There was just enough, you know, to pack the broken carvings, and get the estimates, and pay the printer's bill, and after that there wasn't a halfpenny left. There the things are, as I said before. We have nowhere else to put them--nobody in the new town cares about accommodating us--we're in a lost corner--and this is an untidy vestry--and who's to help it?--that's what I want to know." ...|$|E

50|$|Ever {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} electronic music provided a perfect medium in which to explore his love for both microtonality and new <b>sounds,</b> <b>Wood</b> decided to immerse himself more fully in this world, and in 1996 undertook a major project at IRCAM in Paris. He worked together with Carl Faia on a new work for Alphorn, MIDI-cowbells and electronics - Mountain Language - from 1997 to 1998. This marked the start of a series of works involving electronics, including SÃ©ance (1996), Jodo (1999), Autumn Voices (2001) and the opera, Hildegard (2002-2006).|$|R

50|$|The ancient {{sycamore}} {{that stands}} {{in the shadow of}} Blairquhan Castle, near Straiton, South Ayrshire is thought to be a dule tree, planted early in the 16th century during the reign of King James V of Scotland. The moss-covered trunk has a girth of 5.6 metres (18 feet 4 inches), and is completely hollow, with only a very thin outer shell of <b>sound</b> <b>wood</b> supporting the tree. The once spreading crown was heavily pruned in 1997 in an effort to preserve the fragile shell and prevent the much-weakened trunk from total collapse. Vigorous new growth is now establishing a new, smaller crown.|$|E
50|$|Libanasidus vittatus is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} slugs, snails, and moth larvae such as cutworms, {{as well as}} a fairly wide range of {{vegetable}} matter. They have been seen feeding on dead birds and other carrion, the food of pet dogs and cats, pet droppings, dry oatmeal, and also on fallen fruit. They have been known to chew on wooden floor boards and wooden structures such as garden furniture, though they are not equipped to digest <b>sound</b> <b>wood.</b> Gardens that have a healthy population of Parktown prawns are practically free of slugs and snails, so gardeners who are aware of their habits regard Parktown prawns as an effective natural means of controlling such pests. In turn the king crickets have their own natural predators, such as the hadeda ibis, fiscal shrike and helmeted guineafowl, birds at home in the urban habitat and able to deal with such large insects.|$|E

50|$|In Florida, where X. compactus {{has been}} introduced, {{the life cycle}} is {{completed}} in about twenty-eight days. Like other ambrosia beetles, the adult female carries a fungal symbiont, in this case Fusarium solani. This fungus attacks the xylem tissue of the plant host, creating a fluid that is consumed by the adult beetle and its larvae. Male larvae are produced from unfertilised eggs and are few in number; they remain in the gallery and eventually mate with their sisters. After pupation, the newly emerged female beetles remain in the tunnels for about eight days, and mating takes place here. They then crawl out of the tunnels and fly to another host tree, carrying some of the fungus with them. Here they tunnel into <b>sound</b> <b>wood</b> {{on the underside of}} the branch, introduce the fungus and start laying eggs. The females live for about forty days; symptoms of the infestation of a twig include the death of the stem and leaves beyond the tunnel entrance.|$|E
50|$|With {{the goal}} of {{creating}} a more mature and pristine <b>sound,</b> <b>Wood</b> entered Toronto's Reaction Studios in 2005 to begin recording the follow-up to his full-length debut. During the recording session, he used a Steinway grand piano, scored a full string quartet, and also {{enlisted the help of}} many well-known musicians, including Hawksley Workman and Kurt Swinghammer. The result was A Good Enough Day, which was released in 2007 on Dead Daisy Records in Canada, and in 2008 on Rounder Europe. The record received much radio attention domestically and abroad, and Wood was praised by critics for his fluent piano playing, melodic lyrical style and production ability. The record spawned three singles and three music videos, âA Mirror Withoutâ, âJulietâ and âIâm So Gladâ. Music from the record has also been featured on several TV and movie soundtracks, including TMN/Movie Central's ReGenesis, the CBC series This is Wonderland, the CTV movie Playing House, the film The End of Silence, and the Food Networkâs The Surreal Gourmet. Internationally, A Mirror Without was featured on an episode of Grey's Anatomy. His song Paradise was also featured on an episode of Private Practice.|$|E
30|$|The crystal {{transformation}} of cellulose I to cellulose II during alkali swelling {{was investigated in}} decayed oak wood that was used for shiitake mushroom cultivation {{and the results were}} compared with those of <b>sound</b> <b>wood</b> using X-ray diffraction analysis and ultraviolet microscopy. During mercerization, the sapwood cellulose of decayed wood was easily transformed into Na-cellulose I and then Na-cellulose I was easily converted into cellulose II after washing and drying. The sapwood cellulose of <b>sound</b> <b>wood</b> was converted more slowly to Na-cellulose I and very little Na-cellulose was converted to cellulose II. Na-cellulose I of <b>sound</b> <b>wood</b> can be reconverted to cellulose I during washing and drying. Therefore, it could be concluded that lignin prevented the alkali swelling of wood cellulose and the transformation from cellulose I to cellulose II. The decay of crystalline cellulose might cause an increase in the susceptibility of alkali swelling, so that the degree of mercerization may be also affected.|$|E
