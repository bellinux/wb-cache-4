500|$|There is a {{story about}} a dragon man from the village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E
2500|$|On October 30 at {{approximately}} 4 p.m., the militia rode into the community. [...] David Evans, {{a leader in}} the community, ran towards the militia, waving his hat and calling for peace. [...] Alerted to the militia's approach, most of the Latter-day Saint women and children fled into the woods to the south, while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop. [...] Unfortunately, the building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely spaced logs made it easy for the attackers to fire inside. [...] The shop became a deathtrap, since the militia gave no quarter, discharging about 100 rifles into the building. Grand River Township Justice of the Peace Thomas McBride, wounded while escaping the blacksmith shop, surrendered his gun to Jacob S Rogers Jr. who shot him, then hacked his body with a corn knife (<b>scythe</b> <b>blade).</b> [...] According to their own account they fired seven rounds making upwards of 1,600 shot during the attack of Haun's Mill. The attack lasted 30 to 60 minutes. The sun set at 5:16p.m.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{dropped his}} <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> and leaned upon the haft. He had been mowing since sunrise, and the shadows were now rapidly lengthening. His back ached {{and his hands}} were sore, and he found it a relief to stand still a moment and look about him. On {{one side of the}} {{clearing}} the slanting sunrays struck deep into the forest, forcing up great columnar trunks out of the shadow. On the other, the fretted pinnacles of the firs cut sharp against the sky, and between stretched long swathes of fallen timothy and fern already turning yellow. Not far away, Mr. Oliver, sitting in the mower's saddle, was guiding his team {{along the edge of the}} grass which fell beneath the rasping knife, and the clink and rattle of the machine rang sharply through the still, evening air. Frank, stripped to blue shirt and trousers, found everything his eyes rested on pleasant, and he felt that, after all, he had done wisely when he left the cities.|$|E

50|$|No {{one knows}} how much value to give to this statement. There is the deep {{suspicion}} that it reflects Claudian propaganda to add glory to the Roman invasion of Britain by making the Britons more sophisticated than they were. There is no accepted archaeological evidence concerning scythed chariots. There are some large heavy <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> from late Roman Britain which are too unwieldy {{for a man to}} use.However, a scythed chariot appears in The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (Táin Bó Cúailnge), the central epic of the Ulster cycle of Early Irish literature.|$|R
50|$|The cross {{refers to}} the village’s former {{allegiance}} to the Electorate of Trier. The rose recalls Rosenthal Monastery, which had holdings in the village {{as long ago as}} 1331. Illerich grew up in early times from an estate to today’s municipality, in which agriculture has been practised to the present day. Referring to this are the ear of wheat and the <b>scythe</b> <b>blade.</b> The charge in the base, the two ravens, are Saint Vincent’s attribute, thus representing the municipality’s and the church’s patron saint, who has enjoyed this distinction since 1569.|$|E
50|$|The {{cutting edge}} of a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> is {{traditionally}} maintained by occasional peening followed by frequent honing. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to: create the desired profile, to temper the metal and to remove minor nicks and dents. For mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for coarser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a peening hammer and special anvils or by using a peening jig. Historically, a peening station was {{set up on the}} edge of the field during harvest but now more likely back in the workshop.|$|E
50|$|The scythe and pitchfork, farming tools, have {{frequently}} {{been used as}} a weapon by those who couldn't afford or didn't have access to more expensive weapons such as pikes, swords, or later, guns. Scythes and pitchforks were stereotypically carried by angry mobs or gangs of enraged peasants. The process usually involved reforging the blade of a scythe at a 90 degree angle, strengthening the joint between the blade and the shaft with an additional metal pipe or bolts and reinforcing the shaft to better protect it against cuts from enemy blades. At times, instead of a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> a blade from a hand-operated chaff cutter was used.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{miles from}} Horncastle is {{the village of}} Winceby. During the 1643 Battle of Winceby [...] which helped to secure Lincolnshire for Parliament [...] leader Oliver Cromwell was almost killed. Local {{legend has it that}} the {{thirteen}} <b>scythe</b> <b>blades,</b> which hang {{on the wall of the}} south chapel of St. Mary's Church, were used as weapons at Winceby. This story is generally regarded as apocryphal. The accepted historical opinion is that they probably date from the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536. Both theories about the origin of the scythes are discussed at [...] "Church History", Lincoln website.|$|R

50|$|The use of scythes {{is still}} {{widespread}} today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so scythes {{are used to}} cut grass or bracken. Working <b>scythes</b> have <b>blades</b> between 0.9-0.95m long but competition scythes range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent segalari can manage some 5000m2 in a day.|$|R
50|$|The scythe {{was invented}} in about 500 BC and {{appeared}} in Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries (though the German image to the right is from the 9th century??). Initially used mostly for mowing hay, it had replaced the sickle for reaping crops by the 16th century as the scythe was better ergonomically and consequently more efficient. In about 1800 the grain cradle, was sometimes added to the standard scythe when mowing grain; the cradle was an addition of light wooden fingers above the <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> which kept the grain stems aligned and the heads together to make the collection and threshing easier. In the developed world the scythe has largely {{been replaced by the}} motorised lawn mower and combine harvester. However, the scythe remained in common use for many years after the introduction of machines because a side-mounted finger-bar mower, whether horse or tractor drawn, could not mow in front of itself and scythes were still needed to open up a meadow by clearing the first swathe to give the mechanical mower room to start.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} after the 'restoration' several people {{familiar}} with the figure commented that the feet were altered, having originally both pointed outwards and downwards so that [...] "the Giant appeared to be coming down the hill", in the words of Ann Downs, who had grown up at Wilmington Priory in the 1840s. Resistivity surveys conducted in the 1990s by R. Castleden, combined with examination of apparent shadow marks shown in early photographs, have provided strong evidence that the feet had in fact pointed outwards as described by 19th century observers and had been slightly lower than in the current outline. There was also some evidence to suggest that the feature on one staff similar to a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> flail or shepherd's crook was genuine, along with a suggestion of a [...] "helmet" [...] or hat. It seems likely that the proportions of the figure have been distorted slightly by the 1873 bricking and the 1969 replacement of the bricks with breeze blocks, with the Long Man having been up to 75.5 m tall prior to 1873.|$|E
5000|$|Scythe and sickle blades have {{traditionally}} been sharpened by occasional peening followed by frequent honing in the field during use. In the example below, a short <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> being used for clearing brambles, is being sharpened by reforming the malleable steel to create an edge profile that can then be honed. Because this blade {{is being used to}} cut tough-stemmed brambles it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge are also worked out of the blade by peening and a new edge profile then formed for honing. A peening jig is used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles. A coarse angle is set first about 3mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed. The blade is then honed using progressively finer honing stones and then taken to the field.|$|E

60|$|The lads {{were now}} able to look round at the wild group which filled the clearing. The greater portion were peasants, {{although}} the dress and bearing of several proclaimed that they belonged to a superior class. Some of the peasants were armed with guns, but these were quite in the minority, the greater portion carrying <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> fastened to long handles. These, although clumsy to look at, were terrible weapons in a close onslaught, and the Russian soldiers could seldom be kept firm by their officers when, {{in spite of their}} fire, the Polish peasantry rushed among them. The Poles were in high spirits. Their own loss had been small, and they had inflicted great slaughter upon the head of the Russian column, and had gained a considerable number of arms. A party which had attacked the rear of the column at the same moment when the main body fell upon its head, had for a time obtained possession of a wagon with spare ammunition, and had succeeded in carrying off the greater part of it.|$|R
500|$|Admiral Howe sent a noisy {{demonstration}} of Royal Navy ships up the Hudson River {{early on the}} morning of September 15, but Washington and his aides determined that it was a diversion and maintained their forces {{at the north end of}} the island. Five hundred Connecticut militia under the command of Colonel William Douglas had erected a crude breastwork on the American line at Kip's Bay, but many of these farmers and shopkeepers were inexperienced and had no muskets. They carried instead homemade pikes constructed of <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> attached to poles. After having been awake all night, and having had little or nothing to eat in the previous twenty-four hours, at dawn they looked over their meager redoubt to see five British warships in the East River near their position. As the militia at Kip's Bay lay in their ditches, the British ships, anchored [...] offshore, also lay quiet. The day was oppressively hot. At about 10 am, General Sir Henry Clinton, to whom Howe had given the task of making the landing, ordered the crossing to begin. [...] A first wave of more than eighty flatboats carried 4,000 British and Hessian soldiers, standing shoulder to shoulder, left Newtown Cove and entered the waters of the East River, heading towards Kip's Bay.|$|R
