5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her like that is you know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{morning in}} 1914, Hogg {{was awakened by}} a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was {{attempting}} to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but [...] "wrote down a name and address, {{handed it to him}} and told him to go there that very day to get a job". When asked why <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look like a bad man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E

500|$|... "On , I {{really just}} wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience. You can see that she {{had that kind of}} confidence. And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|During production, Bell and Menzel {{had to do}} a lot of {{recordings}} and re-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. [...] "We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that," [...] said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that she was really proud that Anna [...] "came out like <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E

500|$|More than 1,000 viewers {{complained to}} ITV {{and more than}} 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and {{was not allowed to}} vote last and force a deadlock. A {{spokesperson}} for The X Factor explained: [...] "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [...] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [...] went back to her to clarify {{that it was going to}} go to a majority vote if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> [...] was unable to take the vote to deadlock as deadlock requires a valid active vote." [...] However, a Daily Mail poll of 6,890 people showed that 4,795 of them wanted Cole to be sacked for refusing to vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realized that Cole might abstain and decided in that if she did, they would go to a majority vote. After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Waissel received fewer votes than Cohen, meaning that if the result went to deadlock, Waissel would have been eliminated.|$|E

6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He blinked {{his eyes}} and stroked his {{whiskers}} {{as he tried to}} understand what it all meant. [...] "Who is Sally Sly, and what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] he finally ventured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{cares for}} her,--except you and I. And now {{this man who}} has been here asking the servant {{questions}} has upset her greatly. Even your coming has done so, knowing, as <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>that</b> you have come, not to see us, but to make inquiries about Mrs. Trevelyan.

60|$|Most {{unexpectedly}} Mrs. Thornbury here intervened, {{either because}} it was her mission to keep things smooth or because she had long wished to speak to Mr. Hirst, feeling as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> young men were her sons.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just now," [...] she said, {{trailing}} aimlessly to the piano. She {{sat down}} and began to play at random, from memory.

6000|$|... "What is it? What has <b>she</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{should be}} thus punished? Tell me, man, that she shall be your lawful wife." [...] As {{she said this}} she caught him roughly by {{the collar of his}} coat and shook him with her arm.|$|R

60|$|And so, {{sitting there}} hand in hand, {{we waited for}} the dawn, {{speaking}} many sad and tender words to one another; and at last, when we parted, I held her once more unresisting to my breast, thinking, as <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> our separation would be an eternal one.|$|E
