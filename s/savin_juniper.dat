It is located on the south slope of the Cuerda Larga, in the municipal area of Manzanares el Real (part of the province of Madrid) and inside the Parque Regional (Regional Park) de la Cuenca Alta del Manzanares. The Pedriza's landscape is noted for its enormous rock formations and walls of granite displaying unusual and eye-catching configurations. Below the high rocky areas is an underbrush made up of rockroses and <b>savin</b> <b>junipers</b> which become a pine thicket farther way from the rock face. At the heart of the small valleys that make up La Pedriza runs the Manzanares river at the high river basin of its course. In the low part of the area is a recreational area with parking accommodations which allows visitors several routes to cross the territory. The most esteemed and sensational peak of La Pedriza, as well as its largest, is El Yelmo (The Helmet), a gigantic granite rockface towering over the surrounding peaks, rising to 1,700 m in elevation. El Yelmo's south face presents a massive stone wall that is highly prized by advanced mountain climbers. Throughout its history, La Pedriza's complex of caves was used as a hideout by exiles and by those seeking shelter during times of war.|$|R

40|$|<b>Savin</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus sabina L.) is a relict shrub in Poland {{with only}} one natural stand in Pieniny Mts. Seeds require warm {{followed}} by cold stratification to overcome dormancy. Application of temperature regime at 20 o / 3 o C layout, for 14 and 17 weeks respectively, {{is more effective than}} stratification at 15 o / 3 o C. Interruption of warm stratification phase after 7 weeks and seeds drying at room temperature for 3 -days with warm stratification follow-on resulted in increasing of germination capacity from 25 % to approximately 45 %. Germinated seeds pricked to substrate into containers gave seedlings 3 cm high when cultivated under plastic tunnel in the first vegetation season...|$|E
