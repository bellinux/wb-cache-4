This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed. The costs turned out to be modest, and the post-construction interior sound level tests confirmed the predictions for noise abatement.

40|$|Public address system {{operation}} at the Waste Receiving and Processing (WRAP) facility was reviewed. The review {{was based on}} an Operational Readiness Review finding that public address performance was not adequate in parts of the WRAP facility. Several improvements were made to the WRAP Public Address (PA) system to correct the deficiencies noted. Speaker gain and position was optimized. A speech processor was installed to boost intelligibility in high noise areas. Additional speakers were added to improve coverage in the work areas. The results of this evaluation indicate that further PA system enhancements are not warranted. Additional speakers cannot compensate for the high background sound and high reverberation levels found in the work areas. Recommendations to improve PA system intelligibility include minor speaker adjustments, enhanced PA announcement techniques, and the use of <b>sound</b> reduction and <b>abatement</b> techniques where economically feasible...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it's {{considerably}} grown {{the market}} demand for increasingly performing and comfortable aircrafts {{as a new}} mandatory design target. Among the determining factors for the internal comfort, are included the noise and vibrations, the source of which is detected mainly in the propulsion unit {{especially in the case}} of turboprop category: the most significant component of the noise perceived inside a cabin is undoubtedly the blade-passage load exerted by the propeller. Recently were therefore tested techniques, both active and passive, of vibration emission reduction and sound absorption, however the goal remains to find solutions by extremely low-weight and easy to apply on the real mock-up. As known, a damping treatment is typically used to reduce noise coming from fuselage structure vibration under acoustic loading excitation. In such research context, the vibro-acoustic performance of the viscoelastic material for replacing the conventional interior blanket of the fuselage sidewall have been investigated for the well-known higher dissipation capacity and energy storage. Starting from experimental tests by means of different measurement techniques carried out on an innovative foam sample, the dynamic parameters were estimated according to identify suitably the material performance database for further finite element analysis on a turboprop fuselage model. The outcomes achieved have emphasized a significant role of the viscoelastic foam than the standard blanket with respect to the internal <b>sound</b> pressure levels <b>abatement</b> as well as the thermal insulation.

40|$|In recent years, {{acoustic}} metamaterials {{have attracted}} increasing scientific interest for very diverse technological applications ranging from <b>sound</b> <b>abatement</b> to ultrasonic imaging, mainly {{due to their}} ability to act as band-stop filters.

40|$|Session 2 aNSb (Contributed Papers) - Noise: Numerical Methods in Noise I: {{abstract}} 2 aNSb 2 Starting from p. 3207 of {{this journal}} issue is proceedings of ACOUSTICS 2012 HONG KONGThe propagation of sound over an impedance strip {{has been a}} topic of interest in <b>sound</b> <b>abatement</b> design. Excess absorption by the periodical arrangement {{of two or more}} distinct impedance conditions has been shown by various theoretical and experimental studies. It is believed that the scattering by the impedance discontinuities can enhance the absorption in some designs. This gives motivation to design a more elaborate set of impedance distribution within one periodic module. In this study, the scattering and absorption by periodically-arranged acoustical treatment at oblique incidence is investigated using the spectral method of Chebyshev collocation. The effects on the sound absorption and reflection by the length of the repeating unit, the angle of incidence and scattering characteristics due to the discontinuities of the acoustical impedance are analyzed. Central to the method is the derivation of out-going waves which allows scattered sound of all directions to leave the computational domain without reflection. The full picture of scattering is captured and analyzed using a rather coarse set of grid suitable for further optimization studies. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The Sacramento (northern Central) Valley of California (CA) has a hot Mediterranean {{climate and}} a diverse {{ecological}} landscape that is impacted extensively by human activities, {{which include the}} intensive farming of crops and livestock. Waste-water ponds, marshes, and irrigated fields associated with these agricultural activities provide abundant larval habitats for C. sonorensis midges, {{in addition to those}} sites that exist in the natural environment. Within this region, C. sonorensis is an important vector of bluetongue (BTV) and related viruses that adversely affect the international trade and movement of livestock, the economics of livestock production, and animal welfare. To characterize the seasonal dynamics of immature and adult C. sonorensis populations, abundance was monitored intensively on two dairy farms in the Sacramento Valley from August 2012 - to July 2013. Adults were sampled every two weeks for 52 weeks by trapping (CDC style traps without light and baited with dry-ice) along N-S and E-W transects on each farm. One farm had large operational waste-water lagoons, whereas the lagoon on the other farm was drained and remained dry during the study. Spring emergence and seasonal abundance of adult C. sonorensis on both farms coincided with rising vernal temperature. Paradoxically, the abundance of midges on the farm without a functioning waste-water lagoon was increased as compared to abundance on the farm with a waste-water lagoon system, indicating that this infrastructure may not serve as the sole, or even the primary larval habitat. Adult midges disappeared from both farms from late November until May; however, low numbers of parous female midges were detected in traps set during daylight in the inter-seasonal winter period. This latter finding is especially critical as it provides a potential mechanism for the "overwintering" of BTV in temperate regions such as northern CA. Precise documentation of temporal changes in the annual abundance and dispersal of Culicoides midges is essential for the creation of models to predict BTV infection of livestock and to develop <b>sound</b> <b>abatement</b> strategies...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Although {{the adverse}} {{auditory}} effects of noise {{have been the}} focus of occupational health research for decades, {{little is known about the}} nonauditory health effects that result from noise exposure. The focus of this research was the nonauditory health effects of exposure to commercial aircraft noise (CAN) overflights. It was theorized that CAN exposure resulted in an ongoing stress-response that had the potential to be harmful to human health over time. Two aspects of CAN were considered; the sound level intensity (dBA), and the frequency of overflights. Data were collected by a stratified random sampling design in the CAN exposed neighborhoods of Eagan, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington, and in control communities of Shoreview and Mounds View, all located in Minnesota (n= 4000). A written questionnaire was used to measure; (1) health (MOS- 36 Scale), (2) behavioral and emotional coping strategies, (3) noise sensitivity, (4) annoyance levels, and (5) demographic data. Aircraft noise levels and overflight data were obtained in cooperation with the Metropolitan Airport <b>Sound</b> <b>Abatement</b> Commission. Results showed significantly higher stress levels and lower health measures by CAN exposure type. These findings occurred primarily in communities exposed to high frequencies of aircraft overflights. Multivariate analysis revealed significant reductions for the three main health measures of General Health (GH), Sense of Vitality (Vitality), and Mental Health (MH), based on CAN exposure type. Post-hoc contrast analysis indicated that GH, Vitality, and MH scores were worst with high frequency of overflights. Behavioral copers had significantly fewer stress symptoms and used fewer stress medications than non-behavioral copers. Non-normalized emotional copers had significant negative associations with Gil, Vitality, and MH; however, these correlations were weak. Noise sensitivity levels were not significantly different among the CAN exposed communities; however noise annoyance levels were significantly higher than controls, and were the highest with high frequency of overflights. Finally, multivariate analysis of covariance indicated significant reduction for health measures based on CAN exposure types after adjusting for all effect modifiers (covariates) in the study. Vitality was the most consistently impacted by CAN exposure, and this was particularly the case for subjects exposed to high frequency of aircraft overflights...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasingly}} tighter {{regulations on}} noise exposure during flight, aircraft designers have been compelled to innovate structures that minimise noise transmission {{into the cabin}} space. Porous material is widely used as a passive noise control medium because of their light weight, low cost, and broad band <b>sound</b> <b>abatement</b> effectiveness. The present work, inspired {{by the need to}} be able to predict noise transmission characteristics for commonly used constructions, incorporates the effect of flow into the calculations. Three types of sandwich configurations {bonded-bonded, bonded-unbonded and unbonded-unbonded{ are considered. Biot's theory is used to simulate the poroelastic material. The sound transmission though a double-walled panel lined with porous material in the presence of external mean flow is considered, first. The transmission loss is found to increase with increasing Mach number of the external mean flow. This is then explained on the basis that external mean flow increases the impedance of the panel. Mismatch in the characteristic acoustic impedances of the exterior and the interior results in the change of transmission loss. Transmission loss increases gradually when the pressure difference between air gap and that in the exterior decreases. A bi-objective optimization study is carried out to simultaneously minimize the sound transmission and the structural weight. The effect of laminated composite face plate in the structure is also brought out. Sound transmission through a system of double shells, lined with poroelastic material in the presence of external mean flow, is studied next. The transmission characteristics of the sandwich construction are presented for different incidence angles and Mach numbers over a wide frequency range. It is noted that the transmission loss exhibits three dips on the frequency axis as opposed to flat panels where there are only two such frequencies. Results are discussed in the light of these observations. Flow is shown to decrease the transmission loss below the ring frequency, but to increase this above the ring frequency due to the reduction of stiffness and the damping effect added by the flow. Finally, sound transmission through double-walled cylindrical shell lined with poroelastic material in the core excited by the exterior pressure fluctuation due to the turbulent boundary layer is investigated. The peaks of power spectral density of the inner shell kinetic energy due to shell resonance, hydrodynamic coincidence and acoustic coincidence are discussed. The results show that if the high frequency is interested, an air gap, even if very thin, between the two face shells provide superior sound insulation...|$|E
