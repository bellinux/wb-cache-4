As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E

They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him.

5000|$|The term [...] "six sigma" [...] {{comes from}} {{statistics}} {{and is used}} in statistical quality control, which evaluates process capability. Originally, it referred {{to the ability of}} manufacturing processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification. Processes that operate with [...] "six sigma quality" [...] over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma's</b> implicit goal is to improve all processes, but not to the 3.4 DPMO level necessarily. Organizations need to determine an appropriate sigma level for each of their most important processes and strive to achieve these. As a result of this goal, it is incumbent on management of the organization to prioritize areas of improvement.|$|R

40|$|Today it is {{required}} that industrial companies are continuously searching for new improvementopportunities to streamline processes {{so that they}} can be competitive on the market. One way to succeed is to standardize and map processes to structure the work and clarify possible weaknesses. The purpose of this study is to examine the problems and uncertainties in the project-process which can be reduced, dealing with new projects. Which project-models and standardizations should be established for the project-process to achieve a maximum flow through the project. The goal of the study is that these project-models and standardizations in turn will facilitate the management of projects by clarifying responsibilities, support communication, and reduce uncertainties. To reach an answer three questions has been raised:- How can implementing project-models improve the existing project-process, dealing with new projects?- How can standardized templates and checklists be used to reduce uncertainties and problems in a project-process?- What measures should take place to eliminate the loss of information between differentdepartment within an organization and between external parties? This study has been executed according to <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma’s</b> systematic methology DMAIC that facilitated and clarified the studys structure and planning. Through this method the study has been divided into five natural stages. The study is bases on both primary and secondary-data. In the study result it showed that there are several factors which are limiting the project-process flow. One factor that turned out to be a very considerable for a well-functioning project processwas communication between all parties. This covers both internally and externally. Defective communication leads to uncertainties in the responsibilities, work duties and increased lack ofessential information/data. Through the implementation of standardized project-models such as Flowchart and a Kanban-board could work duties, responsibilities and information become clarified and uncertainties be reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|Over 30, 000 people {{receive a}} solid organ {{transplant}} each year, with 5 - 30 % developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) (United Networking for Organ Sharing, 2015). At a Midwestern transplantation center, over 22 % {{of patients with}} a history of diabetes were not consulted to endocrinology after kidney and liver transplantation. With poor glycemic control, there is an increased risk of developing PTDM leading to poor outcomes. Utilizing the Donabedian model and the <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma’s</b> Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) as guides for implementation, the purpose of this project was to address the process measures of increasing appropriate consultations for evaluation and treatment of PTDM patients that would lead to an important quality measure of improved glycemic control for this population. The project involved the implementation of a clinical pathway to address this quality measure. Even though there was not a statistically significant change in number of consultations, there was a clinical meaningful difference because the patients who were consulted after pathway implementation received the benefit of management by endocrinology specialists to improve glycemic control post transplantation. Limitations of the project leading to the reported results include that the sample size was less than 30 and the period of evaluation was only one month. The recommendation is for transplant and endocrinology teams to continue to work together to develop clinical pathways to appropriately consult endocrinology teams that is consistent with the standardized care of other organ transplants. Though this is a small piece to a larger problem, the use of standardized pathways will potentially improve care leading to improved glycemic control in the kidney and liver transplant population. Early consultation immediately after surgery will potentially improve the transitions of care from inpatient to outpatient setting for this patient population...|$|R
