50|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the <b>server</b> <b>crash,</b> numerous short lived alternative forums were created by AirDisaster.com users, concluding {{with the establishment of}} AirDisaster.info, online since February 1, 2008.|$|E
50|$|Just {{weeks after}} its launch, the game {{attracted}} so many users that its <b>servers</b> <b>crashed</b> {{and it had}} to be taken offline for upgrades.|$|R
5000|$|September 15, 2014 - FCC {{receives}} 3.7 million {{comments in}} total. “The FCC's <b>server</b> <b>crashes</b> again as millions more people, companies, and advocacy organizations {{weigh in on}} the open internet rules.” ...|$|R
50|$|For example: if a site {{is using}} an SQL {{database}} (such as MySQL) for a script (such as PHP) and that SQL database <b>server</b> <b>crashes,</b> then PHP will display a connection error.|$|R

5000|$|In {{reference}} to this performance, [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{and his band}} have launched into a cover of [...] "Radio, Radio" [...] when technical difficulties, such as a <b>server</b> <b>crash,</b> forced him to stop a song midway during a live performance.|$|E
50|$|PVFS servers are {{designed}} {{so that they do}} not share any state with each other or with clients. If a <b>server</b> <b>crashes</b> another can easily be restarted in its place. Updates are performed without using locks.|$|R
5000|$|WFTU {{also has}} a program called [...] "Theatre of the Air," [...] where {{students}} re-enact {{the old days of}} radio through old radio dramas. The first of these events had so many on-line listeners, the station's <b>server</b> <b>crashed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Hectic Geek review noted {{problems}} with X.Org <b>Server</b> <b>crashes</b> and concluded [...] "If you use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and if it's working out for you, then {{there really is}} no need to switch to a non-LTS release, especially to the 15.10." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{feature is}} called [...] "gateway" [...] and handles the {{long-term}} {{persistence of the}} index; for example, an index can be recovered from the gateway {{in the event of}} a <b>server</b> <b>crash.</b> Elasticsearch supports real-time GET requests, which makes it suitable as a NoSQL datastore, but it lacks distributed transactions.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, Adam Boland was {{appointed}} {{executive producer of}} the program. Boland overhauled the program introducing a new format, a number of new segments and new regulars. These changes were scheduled to introduced on November 5 2011, however due an apparent <b>server</b> <b>crash,</b> the program was canceled at the last minute. The relaunch took place the following day as a result.|$|E
50|$|Ikonboard was {{originally}} developed by Matt Mecham, {{with the first}} release being Ikonboard 0.9 beta in September 1999. Originally much of the development took place on ikondiscussion.com (no longer active) until it suffered a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> in March 2001 and it was initially thought everything might have been lost, including early work on version 3. As a result, they switched to Ikonboard.com, and by April 2001 the majority had been recovered.|$|E
50|$|Scaling and {{reliability}} {{are controlled by}} the Microsoft Azure Fabric Controller so the services and environment do not crash, {{if one of the}} <b>servers</b> <b>crashes</b> within the Microsoft data center and provides the management of the user's Web application like memory resources and load balancing.|$|R
50|$|On July 6, 2011 Civilization World entered open beta and {{was made}} {{available}} to the public. On February 28, 2013, it was announced that the last day of play for CivWorld would be May 29, 2013. The game <b>servers</b> <b>crashed</b> about 6 minutes after the announced time.|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2013, the [...] "gigapause" [...] began. Hussie {{announced}} that the hiatus had almost reached its conclusion on September 27, 2014, although he had not fully completed the story. [...] On October 16, 2014, Homestuck [...] "gigaunpaused", and <b>server</b> <b>crashes</b> occurred as a multitude of fans visited the site.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{goals of}} {{scalability}} testing are {{to determine the}} user limit for the web application and ensure end user experience, under a high load, is not compromised. One example is if a web page can be accessed {{in a timely fashion}} with a limited delay in response. Another goal is to check if the server can cope i.e. Will the <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> if it is under a heavy load? ...|$|E
50|$|Chroma was a {{technically}} sophisticated skinning {{program by}} Thematic Software. First released 15 May 1999, it quickly {{proved to be}} flexible; later versions used a skin definition language called Chromumll. However, it was perceived as difficult to use, resulting in a low number of skins. The last release was in August 2000, possibly due to a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> in September, or perhaps in fear of competition from the impending release of Windows XP.|$|E
50|$|The SAW Video Mediatheque was {{the first}} online archive for {{independent}} media arts in Canada, soft-launched in 2003, and released publicly in 2004. The archive featured 496 videos, streamed in full for free on the Web. The Mediatheque suffered a back-end <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> and lost its database in 2009. The archive was relanched October 1, 2011 and continues to showcase over 300 videos, calling on its members to keep the archive growing.|$|E
50|$|The {{traffic on}} such a network will vary over time, {{and there will be}} periods when client {{requests}} will peak, sometimes exceeding the capacity of parts of network and causing congestion, especially in parts of the network that form bottlenecks. This can cause data request failures, or in worst cases, <b>server</b> <b>crashes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{week before}} the album's release on May 6, 2014, pre-orders for the {{physical}} copies were announced on the band's official website, {{and over the next}} 24 hours, the website's <b>server</b> <b>crashed</b> 4 times due to eager fans attempts to obtain the album. The earliest crashes even delayed the album's release for nearly half a day.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{concession}} for these issues, Wizards planned to throw [...] "Chuck's Virtual Party," [...] {{a weekend of}} free tournaments after the problems settled down. Unfortunately, {{it turned out that}} each user took up more memory in version 2 than the lightweight design of version 1. The result was that the <b>servers</b> <b>crashed</b> again under the strain.|$|R
5000|$|AFS {{has several}} {{benefits}} over traditional networked file systems, {{particularly in the}} areas of security and scalability. One enterprise AFS deployment at Morgan Stanley exceeds 25,000 clients. [...] AFS uses Kerberos for authentication, and implements access control lists on directories for users and groups. Each client caches files on the local filesystem for increased speed on subsequent requests for the same file. This also allows limited filesystem access {{in the event of a}} <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> or a network outage.|$|E
50|$|On May 4, {{shortly after}} pre-orders for Tarantallegra began on both online and offline stores, the online music market site Synnara {{experienced}} a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> {{due to the}} sudden, overwhelming response. Xia's agency, C-JeS Entertainment revealed that the album has reached 100,000 copies in pre-orders. It also topped Japan's iTunes' pop albums chart without any promotion. The album is revealed {{to have had a}} greater reaction from fans than anticipated, leading to sell-outs. According to Gaon, 122,000 copies of the album has been sold as of the end of May.|$|E
5000|$|On July 2, 2015, Sports Dating Inc., {{a company}} based in UK's home city of Lexington, {{launched}} BBNMeetup.com, an online dating site devoted to UK fans, with users allowed to create profiles before the site went fully live on July 15. [...] The site will offer most features of mainstream dating sites, with an additional metric of [...] "fandom" [...] (i.e., level of enthusiasm for the Wildcats). The site's Twitter feed alleged that the user demand for the site was high enough to cause a <b>server</b> <b>crash,</b> although ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan dismissed that claim as [...] "clever marketing".|$|E
5000|$|Denial-of-service {{attacks in}} the virtual world Second Life which work by {{continually}} replicating objects until the <b>server</b> <b>crashes</b> {{are referred to as}} gray goo attacks. This is a reference to the self-replicating aspects of gray goo. It is one example of the widespread convention of drawing analogies between certain Second Life concepts and the theories of radical nanotechnology.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{distributed}} dictionary that tolerates arbitrary single <b>server</b> <b>crashes.</b> The distinctive feature of our model {{is that the}} <b>crash</b> of a <b>server</b> cannot be detected. This {{is in contrast to}} all other proposals of distributed fault tolerant search structures presented thus far. It reflects the real situation in the internet more accurately, and is in general more suitable to complex overall conditions. This makes our solution fundamentally different from all previous ones, but also more complicated. We present in detail the algorithms for searching, insertion, and graceful recovery of <b>crashed</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R
50|$|COSCUP's {{registration}} set {{records in}} 2010, 2011, and 2012, as the <b>server</b> <b>crashed</b> within minutes after registrations began, the registration process is often done after hours, due to heavy server load. In COSCUP 2013, the conference started to use Registrano for registration. The system successfully sustained the heavy load of the registrations, this {{also led to}} the later success with KKTIX with COSCUP 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Zetta {{provides}} cloud backup {{and disaster}} recovery services, on-premises backup and archiving and is most notable for its network efficient data transfer. [...] It uses lightweight agent software to replicate customer data, creating a second copy in Zetta's bi-coastal enterprise-grade data centers {{that is available}} for recovery after a data loss event, such as a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> or natural disaster. Zetta's end-to-end disaster recovery service provides deployment-to-failback coverage and features upfront network, firewall, VPN connectivity configuration and automated disaster recovery testing. The software supports Windows, Linux, and Mac and has plug-ins for SQL, MS Exchange, Hyper-V, VMware, and NetApp filers.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{information}} in a Project Darkstar server is generally handled by tasks, although in some special cases they are not necessary. They are used in instances where storage or retrieval of data must be protected from a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> or shutdown, as tasks are saved and remembered when they are run, and can be respawned when the server is restarted in the same state {{as they were in}} before the crash. This is useful, for instance, when updating character information. If something goes wrong with the server internally, the character information is persisted and on a server restart the character information will be restored from the last state it was in before the crash.|$|E
50|$|The Serializer website was {{launched}} in October 2002 with Tom Hart as editor and with approximately 20 other contributing artists. After being offline due to a <b>server</b> <b>crash</b> in April, 2005, Serializer relaunched in October, 2006 under the editorship of Eric Millikin. The site was published by Joey Manley, who had previously published the subscription webcomics site Modern Tales, {{with some of the}} same artists, starting a few months prior in March 2002. Serializer {{was one of the first}} sites to sell digital subscriptions, using a freemium model, with each artist offering some of their series for free, but with the majority behind a paywall. Artists also sold content through micropayments, including through BitPass.|$|E
50|$|Activision {{maintained}} the official servers {{for a number}} of years, but the constant <b>server</b> <b>crashing</b> made player numbers diminish and the servers were closed down on May 28, 2002. Shortly after, fans of the game set up unofficial servers to keep Netstorm alive and the current server uptime is good. Additional unofficial patches have now been released which add several new options, allowing for more varied games.|$|R
50|$|OFT, which {{promoted}} {{itself as a}} free public service educational website, followed Mike and Diane day by day from July 18 to July 21, 1998 through HIV tests, condom selection, and telling their parents about their decision. So many millions of people attempted to view the site that the <b>server</b> <b>crashed.</b> The Internet Entertainment Group agreed to host it in exchange for links to their pornographic content.|$|R
5000|$|However several reviewers {{noted that}} the {{multiplayer}} {{part of the game}} had been released with a lot of game breaking bugs on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (client or <b>server</b> <b>crashes,</b> lag). Polygon reviewed the game the day of its release, and gave it 7.5, then later downgraded their score to 4 after acknowledging that the game [...] "was still barely playable for many players".|$|R
