2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing cotter pin was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until overspeed safety devices tripped and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the cotter pin had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|E
2500|$|In many countries, the law {{requires}} that tires must be specified, and fitted, to exceed the maximum {{speed of the vehicle}} they are mounted on, with regards to their speed rating code (except for [...] "temporary-use" [...] spare tires). [...] In some parts of the European Union, tires that are not fit for a car's or motorcycle's particular maximum speed are illegal to mount. The sole exception are M+S tires, where a warning sticker stating the allowed maximum speed must be placed within clear sight of the driver inside the vehicle. [...] Some manufacturers will install a <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> if a vehicle is ordered with tires rated below the vehicle's maximum speed. In some parts of the European Union, e.g. Germany, it is allowed to mount tires with a lower speed rating code if the car manufacturer specifies tires with a very high speed rating in the registration documents and the vehicle will not reach this speed based on insufficient power. In this case it is possible to calculate the appropriate speed rating with a formula.|$|E

50|$|However, in 2004, a law {{was passed}} {{requiring}} all matatus to include seat belts and <b>speed</b> <b>governors</b> and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to 80 km/h. However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their <b>speed</b> <b>governors</b> disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over 80 km/h.|$|R

5000|$|The {{logic to}} control the turbine was {{implemented}} using oil. All inputs (<b>speed</b> <b>governor,</b> power controller, ...) were valves or pumps attached to an oil cycle and influenced the oil flow such that actuators (pistons) made the necessary regulations.|$|E

With the electronic speed limiter removed, the top speed of the car was limited by drag and engine power in top gear at redline, around 135 mi/h km/h. While this was considered attainable given enough road, the automatic transmission version could not reach this speed without significant engine modification. However the manual transmission version of the car, when given enough road, was capable of reaching speeds of around 145. Without the sport package, the <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> was set at 115 mi/h km/h due to the H-rated tires with which the car was equipped.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the carburetor, the engine has a <b>speed</b> <b>governor,</b> two magnetos, mechanical fuel pump, generator, and an oil pump. It is started pneumatically, and remains fully operational during inverted flight. Unlike most American piston-type aero-engines, which turn to the right (clockwise) when viewed from the cockpit, the M14P rotates to the left (counter-clockwise), like most British-designed radials of the World War II era.|$|E
50|$|The engine <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> is used {{to prevent}} the engine from over-speeding. It has the {{capability}} of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed {{in terms of the}} centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump. At a critical value, this diaphragm causes another spill valve to open and bleed away the fuel flow.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new methodology for {{the synthesis of}} power system stabilizers (PSSs) and <b>speed</b> <b>governors</b> {{in order to satisfy}} some recent objectives and constraints imposed by the evolution of large-scale interconnected power systems. As a consequence of the increasing size of these systems, the frequency of some inter-area modes diminishes so much so that these oscillatory phenomena interact with the dynamics of the <b>speed</b> <b>governors.</b> These low-frequency inter-area modes are also more spread (i. e., they involve a larger number of generators) than the other inter-area modes of the system. This two particularities require several supplementary levels of coordination when tuning the PSSs and the governors of the machines involved in these oscillatory phenomena. To ensure this, the synthesis of the aforementioned regulators is done using a new control model which takes into account the key interactions of the dynamics of the power system. It thus allows the coordination of control actions among several generators as well as between the electrical and mechanical paths. This control framework ensures also an optimal trade-off performance/robustness. Validation simulations have been carried out with the Eurostag software on a realistic large-scale model of the interconnected European power system...|$|R
40|$|With {{the entry}} of Tasmania into the {{national}} electricity market, equipment upgrades are required {{in many parts of}} the existing power system.

This paper analyses the current standard control algorithm for turbine governors, the PID controller. It illustrates the processes involved, tuning and their limitations.

50|$|A New York Times article, dated November 27, 2005, {{discusses}} Steve and Susan Owings' {{attempts to}} have <b>speed</b> <b>governors</b> mandated {{for use on}} large trucks. All trucks manufactured since 1992 have the governors installed as standard equipment {{and it is the}} argument of Road Safe America that these governors should be set at 65 mph for all trucks. Road Safe America has been joined by the American Trucking Associations, insurance companies and numerous national carriers in petitioning the Department of Transportation for a regulation mandating the use of these speed limiters.|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} advanced, so did {{the electronics}} that go into cars. The electronic control unit in a modern automobile, together with advanced engine technology, {{makes it possible to}} control many aspects of the engine's operation, such as spark timing and fuel injection. The electronic control unit may also control electronic throttle control (drive-by-wire), poppet valve timing, boost control (in turbocharged engines), Anti-lock braking system, the automatic transmission, <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> (if equipped), and the Electronic Stability Control system.|$|E
50|$|A {{road test}} of the 2006 {{production}} model conducted by Road & Track yielded a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.6 seconds and a quarter mile dragstrip of 13.2 seconds at 104.1 mph. Such numbers made the SRT-8 Grand Cherokee the fastest accelerating vehicle within the SRT8 lineup, {{second only to the}} Dodge Viper SRT10 among all SRT vehicles. There is no electronic <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> employed, leaving the top speed rev-limited (revving to redline in top gear) to 170 mi/h km/h.|$|E
50|$|P {{accounts}} for present {{values of the}} SP-PV error. For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will be proportionately large and positive. Proportional control alone will always have an error between the set point and the actual process value, because it requires the error to generate the proportional response; so {{if there is no}} error, there is no response. This was the problem with the historic rotating-ball <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> - it always had an error.|$|E
50|$|Adler’s {{speed control}} system {{was based on}} the idea of car <b>speed</b> <b>governors,</b> but he {{believed}} they should only be activated at particularly dangerous spots on the road. Adler’s system was composed of a series of bar magnets buried under the road 20 meters away from dangerous spots. At speeds over 24 km/h, this magnet activated a series of relays installed in the car which cut the car’s ignition. Once the car had passed over a similar second magnet, the ignition was restored, and the car would be able to accelerate like normal.|$|R
30|$|As {{aforementioned}} in Denmark, {{the electricity}} markets are balanced {{taking into account}} the hour-ahead forecasts of wind and load. If the available wind power generated within the operating hour differs from the forecast, a power mismatch between generation and load will appear. The power mismatch yields to a change at the system frequency and deviation in power exchange from its hour-ahead schedule. The generating units equipped with <b>speed</b> <b>governors</b> will respond to the deviations by releasing FCR. Afterwards, the FRR from the AGC, depending on reserves availability, will return the system frequency to its nominal level and consequently replaces FCR.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{improved}} cascade control strategy is presented for hydroturbine <b>speed</b> <b>governors.</b> Different from traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC) strategies, the performance {{index of the}} outer controller is constructed by integrating the entropy and mean value of the tracking error with the constraints on control energy. The inner controller is implemented by a proportional controller. Compared with the conventional PID-P and MPC-P cascade control methods, the proposed cascade control strategy can effectively decrease fluctuations of hydro-turbine speed under non-Gaussian disturbance conditions in practical hydropower plants. Simulation results show {{the advantages of the}} proposed cascade control method...|$|R
50|$|The Priestman Oil Engine used a {{pressurised}} fuel tank, {{and fuel}} injection through a nozzle into a chamber heated by exhaust gasses {{in order to}} create a suitably combustable mixture in the cylinder. Incomplete vaporisation of the fuel resulted in some condensation on the walls of the cylinder; as a result the fuel both lubricated the cylinder as well as providing power. The engine also controlled the speed by connections between valves on the fuel inlets and a <b>speed</b> <b>governor.</b> Ignition was by electric spark.|$|E
50|$|It {{might also}} have {{happened}} that a broken cable or fuse suddenly cut off the load from the turbine, leading to a rapid rise of its rotation speed {{that could not be}} compensated by the <b>speed</b> <b>governor.</b> In this case a safety device would have decreased the air supply to the turbine, leading to a rise of temperature in the combustion chamber {{due to the lack of}} cold air which, in turn, would have led to the shutdown of the turbine due to over-temperature.|$|E
