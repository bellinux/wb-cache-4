50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as {{magnalium}} {{may be used}} to create <b>sparks.</b> The quantity and style of <b>sparks</b> produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by <b>spark</b> testing. In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel — about 0.7% is best for large <b>sparks.</b> The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching <b>sparks.</b> The color of <b>sparks</b> used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the <b>sparks</b> are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the <b>sparks.</b> The duration a <b>spark’s</b> existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting <b>spark.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} minimum {{ignition}} energy (MIE) has traditionally {{formed the basis for}} studying ignition hazards of fuels. However, the viewpoint of ignition as a statistical phenomenon appears to be more consistent with the inherent variability in engineering test data. We have developed a very low-energy capacitive <b>spark</b> ignition system to produce short <b>sparks</b> with fixed lengths of 1 – 2 mm, and the ignition system is used to perform <b>spark</b> ignition tests using a range of <b>spark</b> energies in lean hydrogen–oxygen–argon test mixtures used in aviation safety testing. The test results are analyzed using statistical tools to obtain probability distributions for ignition versus <b>spark</b> energy. A second low-energy <b>spark</b> ignition system was also developed to generate longer <b>sparks</b> with varying lengths up to 10 mm. A second set of ignition tests is performed in one of the test mixtures using a range of <b>spark</b> energies and <b>spark</b> lengths. The results are analyzed to obtain a probability distribution for ignition versus the <b>spark</b> energy per unit <b>spark</b> length. Preliminary results show that a single threshold MIE value does not exist, but rather that ignition is statistical in nature and highly dependent on mixture composition and <b>spark</b> length...|$|R
