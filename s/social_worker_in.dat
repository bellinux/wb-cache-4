40|$|The major {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{obstacles}} in formulating a code of ethics for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> Jordanian institutions and to identify the personal characteristics and professional behaviours of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> Jordan. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to achieve the objectives of this study. A survey with open and closed questions was distributed randomly to 95 <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> The study found that a substantial numbers of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> Jordan (78. 6 %) from the sample did not belong to any social work associations. The majority of male and female <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> (29. 5 %) have a BSW degree. The research also revealed the obstacles in formulating a code of ethics for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> Jordan; those obstacles are the clients, social work institutions, the experience of <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> weaknesses <b>in</b> the research, and the cultural obstacles in local communities in Jordanian society. A recommendation arising from the study is that all professional <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> Jordan need to formulate a national <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> code of ethics as a guide for practice. The code of ethics would have general ethical principles that are based on the core values of social work to be used as a guide for professional behaviour...|$|R

5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E
