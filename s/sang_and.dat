5|$|The Muisca played music, <b>sang</b> <b>and</b> danced {{mainly as}} part of religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampo√±as and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E

5000|$|Feierabend's {{original}} research, {{conducted in}} his time at Temple University, is entitled The Effects of Specific Tonal Pattern Training On <b>Singing</b> <b>and</b> Aural Discrimination Abilities of First Grade Children. [...] In this study, Feierabend investigated the outcomes of <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> aural discrimination. Four groups of children were taught pre-determined amalgamations of tonal patterns that were either easy to <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> easy to aurally discriminate, or patterns that were more difficult to <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> aurally discrimination. This test lasted for five minutes over the series of seven weeks. After analysis, evidence showed that that <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> aural discrimination abilities become more similar in students that echo patterns {{that are easy to}} sing. This research suggests better singing skills are fostered in children who echo patterns varied in <b>singing</b> difficulty, <b>and</b> aural discrimination abilities are improved if echoed patterns are easy to sing.|$|R
5|$|The final ten contestants then {{competed in}} the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks. Each week the contestants <b>sang</b> <b>and</b> {{performed}} during the live show, receiving comments from the judges following their performance. The public then {{got a chance to}} vote for their favourite Maria, and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd Webber, who then decided which Maria to keep in the contest. This was repeated with the top ten, the top nine and the top eight. With the top seven and top five, two were voted off in the program, and there were two different sing-offs.|$|E
5|$|When Dyer {{returned}} to Europe he initially travelled to France, where he <b>sang</b> <b>and</b> played to theatres in Paris. Only one boxing match is recorded {{during his time}} there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} {{as a backup}} singer and dancer for the French disco artist Patrick Hernandez on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy and they lived in an abandoned synagogue in Corona, Queens. Together, they formed her first rock band, the Breakfast Club, for which Madonna <b>sang</b> <b>and</b> played drums and guitar. In 1980 or 1981 she left Breakfast Club and, with her former boyfriend Stephen Bray as drummer, formed the band Emmy. The two began writing songs together, but Madonna later decided to market herself as a solo act. Her music impressed DJ and record producer Mark Kamins who arranged a meeting between Madonna and Sire Records founder Seymour Stein.|$|E

5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, <b>sang</b> <b>and</b> played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E

Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and <b>Sang</b> <b>and</b> declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{acoustic}} cues {{and human}} capability for discriminating <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices are discussed {{to develop an}} automatic discrimination system for <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices. Based {{on the results of}} preliminary subjective experiments, listeners discriminate between <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices with 70. 0 % accuracy for 200 ms signals and 99. 7 % for one-second signals. Since even short stimuli of 200 ms can be correctly discriminated, not only temporal characteristics but also short-time spectral features can be cues for discrimination. To examine how listeners distinguish between these two voices, we conducted subjective experiments with <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voice stimuli whose voice quality and prosody were systematically distorted by using signal processing techniques. The experimental results suggest that spectral and prosodic cues complementarily contributed to perceptual judgments. Furthermore, a software system that can automatically discriminate between <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices and such performances is also reported...|$|R
