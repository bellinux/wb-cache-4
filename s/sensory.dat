5|$|Each <b>sensory</b> system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of <b>sensory</b> receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order <b>sensory</b> nucleus dedicated to one specific <b>sensory</b> modality. This primary <b>sensory</b> nucleus sends information to higher-order <b>sensory</b> areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other <b>sensory</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|The nerves {{also carry}} <b>sensory</b> {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of the vocal fold, as well as <b>sensory,</b> secretory and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the esophagus and the trachea.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sensory</b> ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as cranial <b>sensory</b> ganglia. <b>Sensory</b> ganglia exist for nerves with <b>sensory</b> function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sensory</b> {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of <b>sensory</b> information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and <b>sensory</b> signals are also integrated.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{isolated}} acute <b>sensory</b> loss can {{be regarded}} as a form of Guillain–Barré syndrome is a matter of dispute; this is a rare occurrence compared to GBS with muscle weakness but no <b>sensory</b> symptoms.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral <b>sensory</b> organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform <b>sensory</b> inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a <b>sensory</b> structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting <b>sensory</b> signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>sensory</b> adaptation, {{echolocation}} {{has evolved}} separately in cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats, {{but from the}} same genetic mutations.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is an {{important}} <b>sensory</b> system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and their ears.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of <b>sensory</b> inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from <b>sensory</b> organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, <b>sensory</b> signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows <b>sensory</b> information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of <b>sensory</b> information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain <b>sensory</b> inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual <b>sensory</b> and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these <b>sensory</b> responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to <b>sensory</b> stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|Tactile <b>sensory</b> {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in <b>sensory</b> and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a <b>sensory</b> cortex. The primary <b>sensory</b> areas receive signals from the <b>sensory</b> nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary <b>sensory</b> areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the <b>sensory</b> areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve {{has both}} motor and <b>sensory</b> functions. It does not carry {{parasympathetic}} fibers but does carry sympathetic fibers.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, other symptoms, such as ataxia, tremor or <b>sensory</b> losses, do {{not have}} proven treatments.|$|E
5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The poor visibility, chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that sea snakes and sea kraits may have unique <b>sensory</b> abilities {{to compensate for}} the relative lack of other <b>sensory</b> cues.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a <b>sensory</b> system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have <b>sensory</b> and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The <b>sensory</b> component receives input from the <b>sensory</b> organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} <b>sensory</b> organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized <b>sensory</b> organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded <b>sensory</b> organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear <b>sensory</b> or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique <b>sensory</b> structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>sensory</b> {{abnormalities}} {{include a}} {{distortion of the}} patient's sense of time, for example déjà vu, or a distortion {{of the sense of}} self (depersonalization) or sense of reality (derealization).|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{cranial nerves}} have <b>sensory</b> or {{parasympathetic}} ganglia (collections of cell bodies) of neurons, which are located {{outside of the}} brain (but can be inside or outside of the skull).|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{has been}} shown to inhibit <b>sensory</b> {{irritation}} when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium {{has been shown}} to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} {{millipede}} {{is typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of <b>sensory</b> cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of <b>sensory</b> organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral {{to the base of the}} antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} the spinal cord, {{contains}} many small nuclei involved {{in a wide variety}} of <b>sensory</b> and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sensory</b> {{organs and}} {{structures}} {{on the head}} show great variety, and the shape and form of these structures, as also their presence or absence, are important taxonomic indicators for classifying taxa into families.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sensory</b> {{organs of}} {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of <b>sensory</b> cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with <b>sensory</b> cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5|$|The trigeminal ganglia of the {{trigeminal nerve}} (V) {{occupies}} {{a space in}} the dura mater called Trigeminal cave. This ganglion contains the cell bodies of the <b>sensory</b> fibers of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} (X) {{provides}} <b>sensory</b> and autonomic (parasympathetic) motor innervation to {{structures in the}} neck and also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Consequently {{two types}} of <b>sensory</b> {{information}} are available if a speech unit is activated {{at the level of}} the speech sound map: (i) learned <b>sensory</b> target regions (i.e. intended <b>sensory</b> state for a speech unit) and (ii) <b>sensory</b> state activation patterns resulting from a possibly imperfect execution (articulation) of a specific speech unit (i.e. current <b>sensory</b> state, reflecting the current production and articulation of that particular speech unit). Both types of <b>sensory</b> information is projected to <b>sensory</b> error maps, i.e. to an auditory error map which is assumed to be located in the superior temporal cortex (like the auditory state map) and to a somatosensosry error map which is assumed to be located in the inferior parietal cortex (like the somatosensory state map) (see Fig. 4).|$|E
25|$|Cortical organization, {{especially}} in <b>sensory</b> systems, {{is often described}} in terms of maps. For example, <b>sensory</b> information from the foot projects to one cortical site and the projections from the hand target another site. As a result, the cortical representation of <b>sensory</b> inputs from the body resembles a somatotopic map, often described as the <b>sensory</b> homunculus.|$|E
25|$|Nerve excitability {{studies have}} {{established}} a number of biophysical differences between human <b>sensory</b> and motor axons. Even though the diameters and conduction velocities of the most excitable motor and <b>sensory</b> fibers are similar, <b>sensory</b> fibers have significantly longer strength-duration time constants. As a result, <b>sensory</b> nerves have a longer strength-duration time constant and a lower rheobase than motor nerves.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} kinds of <b>sensory</b> stimuli that are picked up by <b>sensory</b> neurons are grouped into two categories: epicritic and protopathic.|$|E
25|$|The mandibles are {{controlled}} by the stimulation of two large <b>sensory</b> neurons that project through the <b>sensory</b> mandibular nerve into the suboesophageal ganglion. To operate the mandible muscles, {{the ends of the}} <b>sensory</b> neurons lead to the thick dendritic trunks of the four motor neurons.|$|E
25|$|All <b>sensory</b> fibers {{from these}} nerves {{terminate}} in the trigeminal nucleus. On entering the brainstem, <b>sensory</b> fibers from V, VII, IX and X are sorted {{and sent to}} the trigeminal nucleus (which contains a <b>sensory</b> map of the face and mouth). The spinal counterparts of the trigeminal nucleus (cells in the dorsal horn and dorsal column nuclei of the spinal cord) contain a <b>sensory</b> map {{of the rest of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Articulatory and {{acoustic}} feedback signals {{are used for}} generating somatosensory and auditory feedback information via the <b>sensory</b> preprocessing modules, which is forwarded towards the auditory and somatosensory map. At {{the level of the}} sensory-phonetic processing modules, auditory and somatosensory information is stored in short-term memory and the external <b>sensory</b> signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the <b>sensory</b> feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained <b>sensory</b> signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). Auditory and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) <b>sensory</b> signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model).|$|E
25|$|Innervation of {{the tongue}} {{consists}} of motor fibers, special <b>sensory</b> fibers for taste, and general <b>sensory</b> fibers for sensation.|$|E
