5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman <b>still</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida early on October 16, <b>still</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Category1 hurricane. It {{turned to the}} north, {{remained}} a hurricane despite little convection, {{then turned to the}} northeast in response to an approaching upper-level trough. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17. On October 18, as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) with a pressure of 952mbar, a Category 2 hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.|$|E

The storm then abruptly, yet gradually, turned towards the south, and ultimately completed a counter-clockwise loop as it bent back westward. Steering currents were weak, and the hurricane continued to proceed slowly. Late on October 3, it turned to the northwest, <b>still</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to vie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a default on the external debt. However, a minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, quickly amassed support among the nation's élite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula {{in the second round}} of the 1989 elections. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of impeachment for his alleged embezzlement of public money.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the <b>still.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{wanted to}} retain Egypt {{as part of}} the British Empire. After a {{nationalist}} rising in the spring of 1919 Milner was appointed to head an inquiry, and in summer 1920 he proposed that Egypt be granted autonomy. Wilson agreed with Churchill, who thought that granting Egypt sovereign independence (even if <b>still</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> British puppet state) would set a bad example for India and Ireland. In the end, despite the reservations of Allenby, High Commissioner in Cairo, who also thought (September 1920) that it would make “another Ireland” out of Egypt, the Allenby Declaration of February 1922 was based on the Milner proposals whilst reserving Britain’s “special interest” in the country. Wilson was concerned about the British garrison being restricted to the Suez Canal area and wrote that “the white flag is once more up over 10 Downing Street”.|$|E
25|$|Sooke was a {{town with}} a {{sheltered}} small harbor near {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, and the route there from Victoria required Sechelt to cross {{the eastern part of the}} Strait of Juan de Fuca, a notoriously dangerous body of water, which had then recently (in 1904) claimed the then-new steamboat Clallam, a much larger, newer, and stronger built vessel than Sechelt, Clallams sinking in nearly the same waters was well known in shipping circles and there was talk that Sechelt was not fit for the route.

25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently <b>still</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> considerable place, in the fourth century.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{for the cause}} of motion sickness is that it functions as a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. The area postrema in the brain is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the inner ear transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain that everything is <b>still.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the discordance, the brain will {{come to the conclusion that}} the individual is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin. Treisman's indirect argument has recently been questioned via an alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis, as well as modified and extended via a direct poison hypothesis. The direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues that there are plausible means by which ancient real or apparent motion could have contributed directly to the evolution of aversive reactions, without the need for the co-opting of a poison response as posited by Treisman. Nevertheless, the direct poison hypothesis argues that there still are plausible ways in which the body's poison response system may have played a role in shaping the evolution of some of the signature symptoms that characterize motion sickness.|$|E
