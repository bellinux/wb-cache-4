I compared fish communities across 26 streams with and <b>without</b> <b>culverts.</b> Densities of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) increased whereas coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (C. asper) densities decreased, on both sides, relative to unculverted reference streams. I also found that simple retrofits for improving culvert passage may increase fish diversity over decadal timescales. I then {{examined the effects of}} four culverts within one urban watershed and show that successive culverts had a cumulative effect on fish distributions, particularly for prickly sculpin and cutthroat trout (negative and positive, respectively). Overall, this thesis demonstrates that culverts may drive changes in fish communities through species-specific impacts that are consistent both within and across watersheds. Understanding biotic responses to stream fragmentation can inform urban watershed restoration and conservation efforts...|$|R
50|$|Ross (1969) is {{the first}} {{examination}} of sluicing; he argued that sluicing involves regular wh-fronting followed by deletion of the sister constituent of the wh-phrase. This analysis has been expanded in greater detail in Merchant (2001), the most comprehensive treatise on sluicing to date. Such analyses account directly for the case and preposition-stranding facts, but have difficulty accounting {{for the absence of}} island effects. A second kind of analysis is represented by Ginzburg and Sag (2000) and Culicover and Jackendoff (2005), both of which present nonstructural analyses of ellipsis, and do not posit unpronounced elliptical material. Such analyses must be supplemented in some way to account for the case facts; nonstructural analyses have not been shown {{to be able to handle}} the cross-linguistic distribution of preposition-stranding under sluicing, which appears to track preposition-stranding possibilities in non-elliptical questions. Yet another account of sluicing builds on the catena unit; the elided material is a catena. Only the catena-based approach handles multiple <b>sluicing</b> <b>without</b> further elaboration. The structural movement analysis must rely on some other type of movement to evacuate the noninitial wh-phrase from the ellipsis site; proposals for this additional movement include extraposition or shifting. The nonstructural analysis must add phrase-structure rules to allow an interrogative clause to consist of multiple wh-phrases. The catena-based approach, however, does not account for the locality facts; since catenae can span multiple clauses, the fact that multiply-sluiced wh-phrases must be clausemates is a mystery.|$|R
40|$|While it {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that culverted road-stream crossings may impede fish passage, effects of culverts on movement of nongame and small-bodied fishes have not been extensively studied and studies generally have not accounted for spatial variation in capture probabilities. We estimated probabilities for upstream and downstream movement of small (30 - 120 mm standard length) benthic and water column fishes across stream reaches with and <b>without</b> <b>culverts</b> at four road-stream crossings over a 4 - 6 -week period. Movement and reach-specific capture probabilities were estimated using multistate capture-recapture models. Although none of the culverts were complete barriers to passage, only a bottomless-box culvert appeared to permit unrestricted upstream and downstream movements by benthic fishes based on model estimates of movement probabilities. At two box culverts that were perched above the water surface at base flow, observed movements were limited to water column fishes and to intervals when runoff from storm events raised water levels above the perched level. Only a single fish was observed to move through a partially embedded pipe culvert. Estimates for probabilities of movement over distances equal to at least the length of one culvert were low (e. g., generally ≤ 0. 03, estimated for 1 - 2 -week intervals) and had wide 95 % confidence intervals {{as a consequence of}} few observed movements to nonadjacent reaches. Estimates of capture probabilities varied among reaches by a factor of 2 to over 10, illustrating the importance of accounting for spatially variable capture rates when estimating movement probabilities with capture-recapture data. Longer-term studies are needed to evaluate temporal variability in stream fish passage at culverts (e. g., in relation to streamflow variability) and to thereby better quantify the degree of population fragmentation caused by road-stream crossings with culverts...|$|R
2500|$|An {{informal}} overflow or mule drink was {{a dip in}} the towpath allowing {{water to}} flow over, similar to a spillway, but without the bridge or the concrete construction (hence, were more informal). The canalers called these [...] "mule drinks". There are documented informal overflows at mileage 10.76, 49.70, and 58.08. These usually had a drainage ditch which was riprapped with stone to prevent erosion. Historically the towpath dropped two feet to form this overflow. Due to silting, construction, etc. many of these overflows are now difficult to find. Hahn states that clues to finding these overflows include: a gully <b>without</b> a <b>culvert,</b> a sudden lowering of the towpath, or the signs of riprap on the towpath or the gully itself. Many of these (e.g. the one at Pennyfield lock) were replaced by a waste weir.|$|R

In the event of heavy rain, the stream will back-up against the restriction in the bridge and overflow through the notch into the nearby quarry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantics and LF-representation of wh-phrases by attending to two phenomena: {{the effect of}} Focus in wh-phrases and reconstructed readings ofwh-phrases. ^ First, I exploit the semantics of Focus to show how certain peculiarities of <b>Sluicing</b> follow <b>without</b> the need for special LF-operations, contrary to Chung-Ladusaw-McCloskey (1995). I claim that remnant wh-phrases in a sluiced interrogative clause usually bear focal stress and I define a set of alternative semantic values for a focused wh-Determiner. From this, two consequences follow: the remnant wh-phrase has to contrast with its correlate in the antecedent clause [...] which derives the restriction on possible correlate phrases [...] and the denotation of the Sluicing clause and the denotation of the antecedent clause have to be identical in certain respects [...] which derives the inheritance of content and islands cases. ^ Second, I turn {{to the question of}} whether reconstructed readings of how many phrases and which phrases derive from Syntactic Reconstruction (SynR) or from Semantic Reconstruction (SemR). ^ I present two challenges for the SemR account of reconstructed scope readings of how many phrases. First, numerous examples are provided that show that Principle C Connectivity correlates with reconstructed scope readings, a fact which is predicted under the SynR approach and unexpected under the SemR view. Second, I investigate reconstructed scope readings of how many phrases in VP Phonological Reduction and argue that they cannot be derived within the SemR line without generating unwelcome results. ^ Two lines have been pursued in the literature to capture functional readings of which phrases: the choice function approach (Reinhart (1993, 1997)), which involves SynR of the restrictor of the which-phrase, and the skolem function approach (Engdahl (1986)), which amounts to SemR. Again, it is shown that Principle C Connectivity correlates with the embedding needed for the variable to get bound, which supports the SynR approach. However, I present two problems for the current implementation of the choice function SynR line: local presupposition accommodation readings are wrongly excluded, and intensional readings cannot be derived from transparent which phrases. I propose a new architecture of choice functions that derives these new data. ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, an {{alternative}} plan {{to widen the}} existing Route 25 to 4 lanes with a center turn lane in certain spots through Trumbull, Monroe, and Newtown was met with opposition, particularly in Newtown where there was strong opposition to any type of project that will change the existing profile of the Route 25 corridor, despite the high accident rate and congestion on the road. In the early 2000s the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) was forced to resort to a plan that will widen and improve intersections on Route 25 from the expressway terminus in Trumbull to the Monroe/Newtown town line, but opposition in Newtown has compelled ConnDOT to limit upgrades in that community to spot improvements at major intersections and routine maintenance and periodic rehabilitation or replacement of existing bridges and <b>culverts</b> <b>without</b> adding capacity to the road. To ease traffic congestion in Newtown, ConnDOT opened the Mile Hill Road Bypass (SR 860), cutting through the former Fairfield Hills Hospital property and connecting to I-84 and Route 34 at the freeway stub originally intended for Route 25 (now part of SSR 490). Under the belief an expressway will never be built along Route 25 or Route 34, ConnDOT plans to remove this freeway stub and the high-speed interchange, {{replacing it with a}} diamond interchange within the next 10 years. ConnDOT is also planning to build a rest area on land left over when the interchange conversion is complete.|$|R
40|$|The Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) {{has been}} {{full-scale}} crash tested in many configurations, including installations adjacent to slopes, with {{different types of}} wood posts, with and <b>without</b> blockouts, for <b>culvert</b> and bridge applications, and at high flare rates. Although {{the performance of the}} MGS and the dynamic deflection and working width of the barrier have been examined, {{little is known about the}} dynamic deflection and working width of the MGS when impacted at lower speeds. The MGS is a relatively low-cost barrier, and the Test Level 3 (TL- 3) version could be installed for TL- 2 and TL- 1 applications. The barrier is expected to capture or redirect errant vehicles impacting at speeds less than or equal to those used for crash testing according to TL- 3 of the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). Accurate dynamic deflections and working widths of the MGS when impacted at lower speeds are critical for the safe placement of guardrail to reduce the likelihood of vehicle impact with a shielded hazard in the Zone of Intrusion (ZOI) for use on level terrain and in combination with curbs. LS-DYNA computer simulation models of a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado impacting both a tangent MGS and MGS in combination with a curb at a 6 -ft 3 -in. (1. 9 -m) post spacing (i. e., standard post spacing) were calibrated against previous crash tests. Then, the model was simulated with two lower speeds and at five impact locations with a conservative soil model to determine the maximum dynamic deflection and working width of the system at TL- 1 and TL- 2 impact conditions of MASH...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{diversion}} of the Kaituna River from Maketū Estuary, out to sea at Te Tumu in 1956, the local community has continually voiced concerns over the estuary’s increased sedimentation rates and decreasing ecological health. These concerns led to the partial re-opening of Fords Cut in 1996. However, this has only resulted in a slight improvement in water quality, and no measurable reduction in sedimentation. The Bay of Plenty Regional Council is currently investigating {{a number of different}} re-diversion options to partially or fully restore the flow of the Kaituna River into Maketū Estuary, with the aim of restoring the estuary’s health. However, a consequence of re-diversion is the possible reduction in discharge through the inlet at Te Tumu. Significantly reducing the discharge would likely cause a large amount of sedimentation in, and around the cut, which could ultimately lead to the closure of the channel. In order to predict the geomorphic response to the proposed options of lowering the Ford’s Cut Culverts to RL - 1. 6 m (Option J), or reopening Papahikahawai Channel (Option N) a coupled 2 -dimensional, wave, hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was developed. Despite being unable to calibrate the hydrodynamic model due to the highly variable nature of the ADCP data collected, the coupled model was entirely calibrated through the sediment transport model. Comparisons between five transects extracted from a survey conducted in 2008 and from the model results of a simulation run over the same time period, showed predicted bed levels to match on average within 0. 35 m. Bed levels inside the river were predicted almost exactly, however, the error increased over the ebb delta, although, the same overall shape was still recreated. Through simulations of average and low river flows, and average and twice the average wave height conditions the morphological response of the Te Tumu Cut to various potential re-diversion options were found. Simulations of Option J showed that the majority of increased water entering the estuary through Ford’s Cut occurred during the incoming tide. This therefore increased the flood tidal volume and sediment transport capacity entering the cut, and caused the ebb channel to become shorter by approximately 20 metres. Similarly, reopening Papahikahawai Channel with one-way flapgated culverts caused an increase in the flood tidal volume entering the Cut. However, unlike Option J there was no corresponding increase in sedimentation around the river mouth. This was attributed to dredging required to install the flapgates, resulting in a loss of sediment from the system and the inlet not yet reaching a new equilibrium. When Papahikahawai Channel is reopened <b>without</b> flapgated <b>culverts</b> both the peak flood tidal discharge and peak ebb discharge increased. The increased ebb flows resulted in a small increase in size of the ebb channel through the delta, with the increase in size varying between the different river flow and wave condition simulations. The effect of adding parallel twin jetty structures to the Te Tumu Cut was also assessed at a preliminary level. Model simulations showed jetties spaced either 45 or 35 metres apart would aid in increasing the navigability through the river mouth. The 35 metre spaced jetties produced a more uniform and deeper channel compared to the 45 metre spaced option. However, further investigation is required to determine the ideal jetty configuration and long term effects on the surrounding coastlines...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master in Disaster Management, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 46 - 48). Water induced disaster including flood accounts over 30 % of total losses of lives due to natural disaster in Bangladesh. On one hand, spatial variation on geography over short reaches, young and complex geology, and uneven temporal distribution of rainfall contribute significantly to the occurrences of such water induced hazards, Exposure to such hazards and vulnerabilities of people mainly due to poverty, and lack of well preparedness explain the escalating loss of lives and property. The present comprehensive study investigates the impacts of flood on the life and livelihoods of the affected area. The objectives of the study are to assess the situation, the history, the causes, aggravating factors, extent and effects of the flood, to document the hazard and vulnerability, and various capacities of the community; to study the local knowledge, practices and beliefs in the community; to formulate community based plans for flood mitigation and flood disaster risk reduction. Findings of this phase of study are aimed {{to be used as}} input to second phase when a broader framework of community impacts analysis conducted. The study found that there are several causes of flood hazards. They are: construction of infrastructure such as roads, <b>culverts.</b> <b>Without</b> assessing the monsoon flood, narrow drainage capacity of the haphazard channel excavation for irrigation due to the absence of proper irrigation canal system, and poor drainage due to dense settlements. Flood is found to be a recurrent phenomenon in the study area. In 2000 and 2004 floods have made some devastating impact on the study area. These flood events were unique in a sense that the floods were mainly due to the heavy precipitation in the Padma belt. The flood has damaged the physical infrastructures like houses, schools, sub‐health post, hand pumps, culvert etc. as well as productive agriculture land, and livestock. Floods have caused difficulty in mobility, increased risk for living at houses, trends of fear and trauma, and erosion of social assets such as neighborhood, brotherhood and strong bondage of kinship. Likewise, damage of stored grain and spread of water borne diseases are other distresses. Increased health hazards, increased investment in treatment and farming, increase in price of seed, less return from animal husbandry, poor performance of social institutions, changes in cropping pattern and reduction in the crop production are immediate impacts of flood on the livelihood of farmers. Flood forecasting, early warning system and community based flood management save many lives and properties. People shared with me some of the indicators that forecast flood and those indicators are: position of the cloud in the sky, extent of rainfall in upper catchments and char area, mobility of ants, abnormal fly bite, abnormal crying/voices of animals and birds, intensity of thunderstorm and wind, position of stars, and magnitude of hotness. Strange sounds from river/torrents, muddy smell in the water, rising level of water flow are some indicators perceived as early warning of flood. Saleh Ur RahmanM. Disaster Managemen...|$|R
