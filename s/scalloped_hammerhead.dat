5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> and great hammerhead. Little {{competition}} occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> uses {{deep water}} {{to survive as}} safety and feeding. [...] Although they have high {{metabolic}} rates, they {{have a tendency to}} be sedentary and allow currents to carry them as they swim. As a result, this causes the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> to be selective where they swim and the depth at which they tend to stay. The <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> has a tendency to eat cephalopods.|$|E

50|$|From its {{southern}} {{end to the}} sloping channel, the marine fauna seen are <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> manta rays, big-eye jacks, bonito, yellowfin tuna, dolphins, big schooling of species of pelagic fish, and also whale sharks of up to 45 ft in length. The whale sharks are found from early July. Other marine fauna include Moorish idols, Galapagos sharks, eagle rays, green turtles, and Hawksbill turtles, silkie and white tipped reef sharks, barracuda and black jack sharks. Many birds are endemic and the species commonly noted is the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata), which breeds on Darwin Island.|$|R
30|$|Smooth hammerheads {{exhibit a}} greater {{reported}} range, extending further into cooler waters, than <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads</b> (Compagno et al. 2005; De Bruyn et al. 2005; Van der Elst 1981). This {{may contribute to}} the different regional distribution patterns seen in the samples. In parallel, cooler waters require a greater degree of fluidity of lipids to provide greater buoyancy (Ballantyne 1997), which may underlie the increased levels of PUFA, especially n- 3 PUFA, seen in the smooth hammerhead livers. This may also reflect adaptation of lipid profiles to increase fluidity to counteract the reduction caused by the temperature decrease. At the same time, this may also reflect a greater dietary intake and/or a greater availability within the foodweb. This could also explain the reduction in liver PUFA with the transition from Spring to Summer as water temperatures increase. Minor dietary composition changes are unlikely to be the reason, as both species are reported to predate on a similar profile of prey (Cliff and Wilson 1986; Compagno et al. 2005). However, changes in the amount predated, rather than prey species, might explain the differences seen between the two hammerhead species in similar geographical regions. Overall, little work has been published on the diet of either hammerhead species, although Bush (2004) reported on limited variability of the diet in juvenile <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads</b> around Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|The broad {{stingray}} feeds {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling crustaceans, while also taking polychaete worms and small bony fishes. It excavates large pits to uncover buried prey, {{and is often}} followed by opportunists such as jacks. Foraging rays favor areas close to reef boundaries, where many parrotfish, wrasses, gobies, and other reef fishes shelter at night. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium chengi, Rhinebothrium hawaiiensis, Pterobothrium hawaiiensis, Prochristianella micracantha, and Parachristianella monomegacantha. Like other stingrays, the broad stingray is aplacental viviparous. Kaneohe Bay {{appears to be a}} nursery area for this species, where it and juvenile <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads</b> (Sphyrna lewini) are the dominant predators.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{based on}} {{morphology}} have generally regarded the smooth hammerhead {{as one of}} the more derived members of its family, grouped together with the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (S. lewini) and the great hammerhead (S. mokarran). Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have concluded differently: while the smooth and great hammerheads are closely related, they are not as closely related to the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> as the other Sphyrna species. Furthermore, the smooth hammerhead is among the more basal hammerhead species, indicating that the first hammerheads to evolve had large cephalofoils.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the habits of the species. It is a sister species to S. lewini. The Carolina hammerhead is named in honor of Carter Gilbert, who unknowingly {{recorded}} the first known specimen of the shark off Charleston, South Carolina in 1967. [...] Dr. Gilbert, who was the curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History from 1961-1998, caught what he believed was an anomalous <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> shark with 10 fewer vertebrae than a typical <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead.</b> It was not confirmed to be a different species altogether until Quattro's discovery in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Potential predators of {{the silky}} shark include larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod Gnathia trimaculata, the copepod Kroeyerina cortezensis, and the {{tapeworms}} Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus and Phyllobothrium sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads</b> (Sphyrna lewini), {{and have been}} known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25grey reef sharks (C.amblyrhynchos) and a lone silvertip shark (C.albimarginatus). Silky sharks are themselves accompanied by juvenile pilot fish (Naucrates ductor), which [...] "ride" [...] the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by jacks, which snatch scraps of food and rub against the shark's skin to scrape off parasites.|$|R
50|$|King {{angelfish}} {{are sexually}} isomorphic, meaning {{males and females}} are visually identical on the outside. They do, however undergo significant changes in coloration {{and to a lesser}} degree shape as they mature.Juvenile king angelfish are primarily yellow, with iridescent-blue-rimmed fins and blue striping towards the posterior of their bodies, and an orange mask around the eye. Sexually mature king angelfish, on the other hand, have mostly brown or blue bodies (depending on the light) with the same blue rimming around the fins and a yellow dorsal fin. King angelfish generally grow to 35cm long. They have between 18 and 20 rays in their dorsal fin and each of their pectoral fins, and 17 to 19 in their anal fin. They also have a strong spike under their lower cheek for defensive purposes. King angelfish also clean <b>scallop</b> <b>hammerhead</b> sharks.|$|R

40|$|From the introduction] Within {{the last}} century shark populations have {{declined}} {{at an alarming rate}} (Baum et al. 2003; Dulvy et al. 2008; Ferretti et al. 2010) which is thought to influence the very structure of the marine world (Edgar et al. 2011). An explosion of literature has recently addressed these declines and the urgency at which protection is needed (Sims 2009). Historically, declines have been mainly attributed to factors including increased fishing pressure and habitat degradation in combination with life history traits (Ferretti et al. 2010; Garla et al. 2006) and a lack of laws and policies aimed to protect sharks (Pough et al. 2009). In this paper, after a closer examination of the issues, I will examine the current migratory and residency behaviors of <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> Sphyrna lewini, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. I will then address the impact of the tourism industry on this species and the effectiveness of marine protected areas for Sphyrna lewini conservation...|$|R
500|$|Young smalleye hammerheads under [...] {{long feed}} {{predominantly}} on penaeid shrimp, mostly Xiphopenaeus kroyeri. Larger sharks feed mainly on bony fishes, especially ariid sea catfish and their eggs. The shrimp {{and the surface}} mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments {{that appear to be}} the source of the sharks' golden color; [...] whether the pigments in the catfish also ultimately come from the shrimp is uncertain. Another shark species in the region, the yellow smooth-hound (Mustelus higmani), also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish color, albeit not nearly as bright. This species has also been known to consume swimming crabs, squid, grunts, and newborn <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerheads.</b> The smalleye hammerhead may fall prey to larger sharks such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), while smaller individuals may also be taken by bony fishes. Its coloration may provide camouflage. A known parasite of this species is the hexabothriid monogenean Erpocotyle schmitti; it may also serve as a host to common copepod ectoparasites such as Echthrogaleus coleoptratus, Pandarus satyrus, and P. cranchii.|$|R
