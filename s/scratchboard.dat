5|$|Marvel 1602 is an eight-issue {{comic book}} limited series {{published}} in 2003 by Marvel Comics. The limited series {{was written by}} Neil Gaiman, penciled by Andy Kubert, and digitally painted by Richard Isanove; Scott McKowen illustrated the distinctive <b>scratchboard</b> covers. The eight-part series {{takes place in a}} timeline where Marvel superheroes exist in the Elizabethan era; faced with the destruction of their world by a mysterious force, the heroes must fight to save their universe. Many of the early Marvel superheroes — Nick Fury, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man — as well as villains such as Doctor Doom and Magneto appear in various roles.|$|E
500|$|Editor Nick Lowe noticed theater posters done by Scott McKowen {{and decided}} that the [...] "engraving 'look' of the <b>scratchboard</b> would be {{interesting}} for the historical setting of this story." [...] <b>Scratchboard</b> is a technique where a sharp knife is used to scrape through a layer of black ink to a hard chalk surface underneath; in effect, artists draw white lines on an all-black surface. All McKowen's illustrations were done by hand and then colored later in Photoshop. For inspiration, McKowen looked at seventeenth-century engravings. He also added scrolls or flags to the covers for the Marvel 1602 titles, basing the designs on Renaissance paintings where scrolls are used {{to comment on the}} scenes depicted.|$|E

50|$|Much of Schaff's art {{deals with}} death and loss, {{as well as}} the {{consequences}} of, and responses to, human violence. Stories from the Old Testament and scenes from The Holocaust are recurrent in his art. Schaff works in paintings, drawings, collages, <b>scratchboards,</b> mail art, motion pictures, and comics. A graduate of the Maryland Institute College of Art, Schaff has exhibited and lectured at numerous institutions, including the United States Air Force Academy, the Rhode Island School of Design, Amherst College, and East Carolina University.|$|R
40|$|A trenchant {{critic of}} both British imperialism and Indian militarism, Brij Mohan Anand’s highly politicised {{aesthetic}} tracked India’s emergence from Partition, Independence and its {{journey through the}} technological challenges of the Cold War and the complex modernity of the later twentieth century. B. M. Anand (1928 - 1986), an accomplished and principally self-taught artist, fashioned an exceptional range of work from <b>scratchboards,</b> sketches, genre scenes, pastoral images and starkly modernist figure compositions {{to a series of}} late, apocalyptic landscapes. His expansive creativity and sharp eye for visual innovation extended into graphics-based design, educational and illustration work which was routinely commissioned and supported by some of India’s leading cultural and news organisations. Anand’s life and aesthetic intersected with some of the foundational events which defined and shaped modern Indian consciousness. From the bitter, family legacy of the Amritsar massacre, through to the trauma of Partition and the post-Independence realpolitik of Congress and Communist Party mandates, he recognised the self-deception and vanity of power and the complicity of the elites through which it was exercised. Anand’s legacy registers a singular consciousness; a profoundly human belief in a socially redemptive aesthetic and the agency of ordinary men and women to realise and to fashion their own futures within a contested modernity. Narratives for Indian Modernity follows the rediscovery and painstaking restoration of much of Anand’s oeuvre, the location of previously overlooked archival and family records and interviews with surviving peers and friends. In doing so, it offers a critical perspective on an outsider artist and maverick who eschewed the attractions and blandishments of a commercial or overseas career, but who nevertheless kept witness to India’s rebirth as a sovereign nation and ultimately, its emergence as a regional superpower...|$|R
500|$|The hardbound edition {{features}} a <b>scratchboard</b> illustration depicting {{the main characters}} whispering discreetly {{to each other on}} the cover. [...] According to McKowen, the image was inspired by a depiction of the masterminds behind the [...] "Gunpowder Plot", an attempt to blow up Parliament during the reign of King James. Since the characters of the story are all traitors in the eyes of King James, they were drawn in a similar fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{fine art}} won awards for {{original}} designs in <b>scratchboard,</b> brush and ink, and pen drawing. [...] She experimented {{in a wide}} variety of media, and developed a style that is at once abstract and lyrical. Much of her art was intended and used to illustrate her published books of poetry. Some of her art pioneered a new technique created by her, which she called wax painting. It involves a controlled flow and manipulation of poured colored molten wax onto canvas, board, or paper. She also used techniques of cut paper and collage in her art, often supplemented by India ink and acrylics. The subjects she focused on in her art were drawn from her rich, symbolic imagination and dream life. She developed a preference for [...] "primitive" [...] art, whose unassuming simplicity she felt was capable of representing the images she wished to portray.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 an {{organization}} was launched to help promote <b>Scratchboard</b> Art {{as a fine}} art medium, {{as well as to}} help educate the public about this unique medium. The organization is called the International Society of <b>Scratchboard</b> Artists (ISSA), and is a 501c3 nonprofit in the United States. ISSA holds at least one annual exhibition dedicated exclusively to <b>scratchboard</b> art in a gallery or museum each year. It is an international organization with membership from across the globe. The organization has several levels of membership, with Master <b>Scratchboard</b> Artist being their highest level.|$|E

Various techniques such as hatching or stippling {{can be used to}} detail the image. The 14" [...] X 18" [...] <b>scratchboard</b> Sunflower And Silver by Diana Lee is an example of black <b>scratchboard</b> colored with transparent ink. An extreme close up lets the detail of the scratching be more easily seen.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as scraperboard (especially in Great Britain), but usually called <b>scratchboard</b> in North America and Australia, {{is a form of}} direct engraving where the artist scratches off dark ink to reveal a white or colored layer beneath. <b>Scratchboard</b> refers to both a fine-art medium, and an illustrative technique using sharp knives and tools for engraving into a thin layer of white China clay that is coated with dark, often black India ink. There is also foil paper covered with black ink that, when scratched, exposes the shiny surface beneath. <b>Scratchboard</b> can be used to yield highly detailed, precise and evenly textured artwork. Works can be left black and white, or colored.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scratchboard</b> itself comes {{either with}} a paper (cardboard) backing, or a {{hardboard}} support. While the cardboard does have its uses, {{as it can be}} easily cut into size, the hardboard is much superior, giving greater stability to the work, being able to be corrected more often. It is more durable and easier to scratch into for cleaner, crisper details and lines. Several tools have been created specifically for scratchboard; however any sharp implement will do though a range of blades of different thicknesses allows the removal of more or less of the ink at will (see variety of tools listed below). Isopropyl Alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball, sandpaper and non-oily, fine, steel wool are also useful for removing large areas, and creating texture. Coloring <b>scratchboard,</b> black or white boards, can be done with many mediums applied with paint brush, air brush, and even cotton balls. Special <b>scratchboard</b> colored inks, made by ampersand, can be added to the white areas and then scratched again for additional highlights and volume for added dimension.|$|E

It proves to be a watershed when eight years later the artist returns to the concept of <b>scratchboard</b> by adapting it to layers of oil paint on canvas in [...] "grattage" [...] works such as Joseph Accused (1971) in which the image is made by scratching through the smoothed, palette-knife applied top layer of cadmium red to the lighter mid-color of turquoise and yellow-white base.|$|E
