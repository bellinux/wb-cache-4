40|$|<b>Support</b> <b>staff</b> are {{perceived}} to be highly important to schools in Britain (Department for Education (DfE), 2011; Department for Educational and Skills (DfES), 2000). The dramatic increase in <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> within schools has led to a range of roles being developed, impacting on their training and development needs (Training and Development Agency (TDA), 2010 a), and those “involved in employing, managing, supporting and training them” (Alborz et al., 2009, p. 4). Whilst guidance is available to schools (for example, Training and Development Agency (TDA), 2010 c) {{there is a lack of}} evidence regarding the forms of support available to <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> in schools, or what is helpful, in order to carry out their role effectively and develop professionally. A qualitative approach was adopted to explore perceptions of <b>support</b> for <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> and the role of educational psychologists. Questionnaires, focus groups and individual interviews were utilised to gather the views of secondary school <b>support</b> <b>staff,</b> senior management team members and educational psychologists. Thematic analysis identified key themes relating to enabling <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> to feel <b>supported</b> within their roles, and the role of educational psychologists in working with <b>support</b> <b>staff.</b> Findings suggest that, being valued, included and involved is important to <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> feeling <b>supported.</b> Relationships with other members of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> and school staff in addition to a school’s overall ethos were identified to have considerable influence on facilitating these aspects.

Method Face to face semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 21 participants. Participants were recruited by contacting pharmacists in HLPs who nominated <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> for potential participation. Each nominated staff member was then sent an information pack and written consent was obtained prior to interviews. A topic guide was developed which underwent face validity testing and piloting with one participant. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim then analysed using Framework. Setting Pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> from 12 HLPs in Northumberland. A range of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> roles and both HLP Champions (n= 16) and non-champion (n= 5) staff were included in the sample. Interviews took place in national multiple, small chain and independently owned pharmacies. Key findings Themes identified from the data included seven parent themes incorporating; factors which could be barriers or facilitators to HLP activity, the process to becoming a HLP from the perspective of pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff,</b> changes in pharmacy activity perceived by <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> since accreditation as a HLP, descriptions of integration of public health activity with traditional pharmacy roles by <b>support</b> <b>staff,</b> the views and attitudes of pharmacy staff on the HLP concept, feedback from pharmacy clients to <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> on public health activity and <b>support</b> <b>staff's</b> concerns about becoming a HLP. These themes pointed to four key elements of success for the HLP initiative including local leadership in HLPs, ensuring <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> have the knowledge and skills to deliver public health activity, commissioning for the HLP initiative and engaging pharmacy staff in the HLP programme.

40|$|Title Perceptions of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> {{with respect}} to {{discontinuation}} of long-term used antipsychotics for residential individuals with intellectual disability; a mixed method study Background Antipsychotics are the most used psychotropic drugs by residential intellectually disabled individuals and have harmful side effects. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of antipsychotics on challenging behaviour. Discontinuation is possible for a part of residential individuals with intellectual disability and decreases some harmful side effects. In order to discontinue antipsychotics the cooperation of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> is important. There is no knowledge on perceptions of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> {{with respect to}} discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in persons with intellectual disability. Aim This study wants to gain insights in the perceptions of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> about discontinuation of antipsychotics in residential individuals with intellectual disability. Method Four focus groups were conducted in this mixed methods study, followed by a survey with 29 Likert items. Results <b>Support</b> <b>staff</b> perceive antipsychotics as effective in decreasing anxiety, automutilation, agitation and aggression. <b>Support</b> <b>staff</b> perceives themselves as motivated to contribute to discontinuation of antipsychotics. A larger proportion of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> believes reduction is possible compared with the proportion that believes that complete discontinuation is possible. A clear plan for the multidisciplinary team is perceived indispensable. <b>Support</b> <b>staff</b> has no perceived knowledge deficits on side effects of antipsychotics. Conclusion In this first study directed at the perceptions of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> about discontinuation of antipsychotics a combination was found of {{a positive attitude toward}} contributing to discontinuation of antipsychotics on one hand {{and on the other hand}} the perceived efficacy of antipsychotics in reducing challenging behaviour and an expectation that discontinuation of antipsychotics is almost only possible in exceptional cases. Recommendations The development of a decision guide is recommended in order to contribute the use of tailor-made discontinuation or reduction plans...|$|R

40|$|Background: Most {{sales of}} {{complementary}} medicines within pharmacies are conducted by pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff.</b> The absence of rigorous {{evidence for the}} effectiveness of many complementary medicines raises a number of ethical questions regarding the sale of complementary medicines in pharmacies. Aim: Explore (1) what consumers expect from pharmacists/pharmacies {{with regard to the}} sale of complementary medicines, and (2) how pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> perceive their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines. Methods: One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> and consumers in pharmacies in Brisbane. Consumers were asked to describe their expectations when purchasing complementary medicines. Pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> were asked to describe their responsibilities when selling complementary medicines. Interviews were conducted and analysed using the techniques developed within Grounded Theory. Key Findings: Thirty-three consumers were recruited from three pharmacies. Consumers described complementary medicine use as a personal health choice. Consumer expectations on the pharmacist included: select the right product for the right person, expert product knowledge and maintaining a wide range of good quality stock. Twenty pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> were recruited from four pharmacies. Pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> employed processes to ensure consumers receive the right product for the right person. Pharmacy <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> expressed a commitment to aiding consumers, but few evaluated the reliability of effectiveness claims regarding complementary medicines. Conclusions: Pharmacists need to respect the personal health choices of consumers while also putting procedures in place to ensure safe and appropriate use of complementary medicines.

Motivation for the study: The lack {{of research on the}} well-being of <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> motivated the study. A need was identified to explore driving forces that might enhance their well-being. Research design, approach and method: A literature review guided by theoretical perspectives and theories on staff well-being was conducted. Subsequently, a qualitative action research design involving an Appreciative Inquiry (AI) workshop with <b>support</b> <b>staff</b> of an institution was followed. Main findings: The following strengths that might serve as driving forces for enhancing the well-being of the institution’s <b>support</b> services <b>staff</b> were identified: hard-working and dedicated <b>support</b> <b>staff,</b> positive relations among colleagues, a willingness to adapt to change,good remuneration and benefits, job security and a supportive work environment. Appreciative Inquiry was found to be well suited for identifying such strengths, as opposed to methods that focus on identifying problems or weaknesses of an organisation. As a result of this study, the relevant institution might react and build on these identified strengths towards promoting the well-being of its <b>support</b> <b>staff.</b> Practical/managerial implications: Institutions should make an effort to enhance staff well being.
