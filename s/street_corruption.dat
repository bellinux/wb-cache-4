50|$|Arms Aloft is an American punk {{group from}} Eau Claire, Wisconsin, formed in 2007. As {{described}} by frontman Seth Gile, the band's lyrics frequently focus on left politics {{and how they}} affect people personally. Their music accordingly has covered explicitly political topics such as pollution, global warming, Wall <b>Street</b> <b>corruption,</b> and drone strikes, as well as time-honored topics such as breakups and boredom.|$|E

50|$|Accepting bribes is {{a common}} form of <b>street</b> police <b>corruption</b> in Croatia. According to the International Victim Crimes Survey, 15 out of 100 {{respondents}} reported paying a bribe within the last year- 44% of which were paid to police officers. This frequency is higher than most other East-European countries, with respondents suggesting that police in Croatia are targeted more frequently for successful bribes compared to other countries in East-Europe. These results indicate that police corruption, {{especially in regards to}} the acceptance of a bribe by a police officer, seems to be more prevalent among Croatian police than among police in other East-European countries.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{the band}} {{recorded}} the album Outsourcing Morality in Garland, Texas. It was engineered by Kill the Client bassist, James Delgado, and mastered by Scott Hull of Pig Destroyer. It features guest vocals by “Champ” Morgan of Kill the Client, and art by Max Rodriguez and Kirk Kirkwood. It {{was released on}} Deepsend Records in 2006, and distributed internationally. This second album was significantly more complex, and featured much more virtuoso guitar work, elaborate drum sequences, sixty-fourth-note bass solos, and death metal influences. The guitar work had expanded its reach to include, for the first time, much more melodic movements, {{such as the ones}} that appear on the songs “Only in Death” and “A Dying Act of Defiance.” The lyrical content was as diverse as it was on the first album, and included songs about Wall <b>Street</b> <b>corruption,</b> existential philosophy, unethical corporate business practices, consumer culture, the virtues of suicide, and the inherent worthlessness of human beings. It was iconoclastic in its ability to cross multiple genres, and was reviewed in publications such as Metal Edge and Terrorizer magazine. Online reviews were mixed, citing the short album length and raw production as disappointments, and several reviewers recommended it only to die-hard fans of the genre.|$|E

50|$|Margaret's {{years in}} New Orleans intersected and paralleled that of vodou queen Marie Laveau (who died in 1881, {{preceding}} Margaret in death by one year); {{and the last}} five years of Margaret's life overlapped with the arrival to the city of Lafcadio Hearn, the writer who spread impressionistic tales of an exotic and mysterious New Orleans, and its environs, into an international sensation. He spoke of the city's political <b>corruption,</b> <b>street</b> crime, violence, intolerance and the failures of public health and hygiene officials, hauntings and strange events.|$|R

5000|$|Hearn's {{writings}} for the New Orleans newspapers included impressionistic {{descriptions of}} places and characters and many editorials denouncing political <b>corruption,</b> <b>street</b> crime, violence, intolerance, and {{the failures of}} public health and hygiene officials.

5000|$|Until {{recently}} the place name of Stirchley {{was accompanied by}} ‘Street’. Gelling suggests that major place-names like Strete or Streetly refer {{to the position of}} the settlement on or close to one of the main roads of Roman Britain. [...] It is possible that the name <b>Street</b> is a <b>corruption</b> of the OE Stroet which has been interpreted as a [...] "Roman road, a paved road, an urban road, a street". [...] The 1838 Tithe Map for King’s Norton Parish in the County of Worcestershire identifies the place, rather than the road name, as Stirchley Street. Other Place names associated with Roman occupation are Street Farm Northfield where the road from Wootton Wawen met the Bromsgrove Road, and Moor Street Bartley Green.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the key {{results of the}} crime victim surveys that were carried out {{as part of the}} fifth sweep of the International Crime Victim Surveys (ICVS) conducted in 2004 / 2005. A large portion of the these data are derived from the European Survey on Crime and Safety (EU ICS), organised by a consortium lead by Gallup Europe and co-financed by the European Commission, DGRTD. Wherever possible, results on 2004 have been compared with results from surveys carried out in earlier rounds since 1989. The ICVS and EU ICS cover ten conventional crimes, broken down into vehicle related crimes (theft of a car, theft from a car, theft of a motorcycle or moped, theft of a bicycle), burglary, attempted burglary, theft of personal property and contact crimes (robbery, sexual offences and assault & threat). In most countries in this report, questions {{have been added to the}} questionnaire on experiences with <b>street</b> level <b>corruption,</b> consumer fraud, including internet-based fraud and credit card theft, drug-related problems and hate crime. For most categories of crime trends over time can be studied in a broad selection of countries. Other subjects covered by the questionnaire are reporting to the police, satisfaction with the police, distribution and need of victim support, fear of crime, use of preventive measures and attitudes towards sentencing. This report presents data from 30 countries, including the majority of developed nations. Also the data from 33 main cities of a selection of developed and developing countries are presented in this report. Altogether data are presented from 38 different countries. A full text translation of this report in Spanish is also available...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I relate {{the work of}} both Arendt and Habermas {{concerning}} the public sphere to Moscovici's theory of social representations. I propose a distinction between social representations in and of the public sphere to show that (i) social representations are forms of symbolic mediation firmly grounded in the public sphere, and (ii) public life plays a constituent {{role in the development}} of representations and symbols. Drawing on Winnicott's concept of potential space, I show that the constitution of social representations and public life rests neither upon the individual nor upon society, but upon those spaces of mediation that link and separate them at the same time. The concept of public sphere is operationalised along two dimensions: the space of the streets and the arena of politics. The research comprises three empirical studies: (i) content analyses of the Brazilian press, (ii) focus groups with street children, taxi drivers, policemen, professionals, students and manual workers, and (iii) narrative interviews with Brazilian parliamentarians about the impeachment of the former president. The roles of the media, of conversation and of narratives in the shaping of both social representations and public life guide the analyses. The findings suggest that the blurred character of the relationship between self and other in Brazil lies at the very heart of social representations of public life. Threat and fear on the <b>streets</b> and <b>corruption</b> in political life are anchored in older metaphors of corrupt blood and a contaminated, ill, social body. The results suggest that the workings of social representations are inseparable both from the historical features of the society in which they develop and from the processes whereby a community struggles to maintain an identity, a sense of belonging and a location in the world...|$|R

As Mrs Boffin and Miss Wilfer drive out, or as Mr Boffin walks out at his jog-trot pace, the fishmonger pulls off his hat {{with an air of}} reverence founded on conviction. His men cleanse their fingers on their woollen aprons before presuming to touch their foreheads to Mr Boffin or Lady. The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways, as they would turn up their hands if they had any, in worshipping admiration. The butcher, though a portly and a prosperous man, doesn't {{know what to do with}} himself; so anxious is he to express humility when {{discovered}} by the passing Boffins taking the air in a mutton grove. Presents are made to the Boffin servants, and bland strangers with business-cards meeting said servants in the <b>street,</b> offer hypothetical <b>corruption.</b> As, 'Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin, my dear friend, it would be worth my while'--to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings.|$|R
40|$|Afghanistan is debatably {{the joint}} most corrupt {{country in the}} world. There have been {{extensive}} efforts of the international community, aid agencies, foreign governments and international financial institutions to enhance Afghan state institutions and state effectiveness with anti-corruption strategy as corruption is deemed a contributor to increased poverty and a waste of donor aid. Such anti-corruption strategy includes enhancing the role of law enforcement actors such as the police and judges with security sector reform (SSR), {{the promotion of the}} rule of law and justice, vetting, pay reform and anti-corruption units. Despite such efforts, corruption and clientelism still impedes Afghan security, justice and the public sector. This results in cronyism within President Hamid Karzai’s presidential family and close aides, <b>street</b> level <b>corruption</b> and petty bribery due to low wages and bidding for senior positions as governor or a district police chief who then appoint individuals to preserve loyalty and lucrative engagement in the opium industry. The causes of corruption in Afghanistan are analysed. This includes systemic corruption, patronage, nepotism, low wages and state capture infiltrating parts of the state to serve and protect drug trafficking and illegal armed group interests that hinders SSR, the rule of law and justice. There are multiple causes of corruption which lead to anti-corruption strategy and SSR addressing some causes that may address some cause but may unintentionally exacerbate other forms of corruption. This thesis provides an investigation of pay reform and a critical examination of police anti-corruption strategy in the lower levels of the Afghan police as there is a gap in the literature of primary research conducted with patrolmen. The researcher finds that internal Afghan police anti-corruption strategy includes pay reform which has not hit the lower levels significantly despite an increase in force size. In addition, the lottery assignments and rotation of Afghan police in random away provinces to reduce patronage-based appointments and loyalty with police commanders and warlords has actually increased survival-based corruption, including bribery and extortion, as a means of economic necessity due to many policemen having to live on low wages as the sole breadwinner for large families. Pay reform has the potential to combat petty corruption in the lower ranks but systemic corruption, clientelism and state capture will remain and the lottery assignments need further revision to avoid enhancing survival corruption which is counterproductive to successful anti-corruption strategy...|$|R
