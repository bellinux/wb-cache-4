5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime, or have argued that there are <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the official case.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy {{to justify the}} program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. <b>Serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E

25|$|As {{discussed}} in the earlier part of this article, sexual reproduction is conventionally explained as an adaptation for producing genetic variation through allelic recombination.

25|$|A common {{example of}} a {{population}} bottleneck is the Northern elephant seal. Due to excessive hunting throughout the 19th century, {{the population of the}} northern elephant seal was reduced to 30 individuals or less. They have made a full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however. The seals {{are more likely to have}} <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> disease or genetic disorders, because there is almost no diversity in the population.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 41 D.IIIs were {{delivered}} to frontline units between April and May 1918. Most aircraft were supplied to Jagdgeschwader II, whose pilots were {{enthusiastic about the}} new aircraft's handling and rate of climb. After only seven to 10 hours of service, however, the Sh.III engines started showing <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> overheating and piston seizure. The problem was later traced to the Voltol mineral oil {{that was used to}} replace the now-scarce castor oil. Furthermore, the close-fitting engine cowling provided inadequate cooling to the engine.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as 2001, Turnpike Authority {{officials}} and contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems. A $10 million contract, signed off as a cost overrun, was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of Modern Continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This information was not made public; engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found <b>serious</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the tunnel.|$|E
