40|$|Bridge-mixing was {{proposed}} earlier {{to explain why}} different combustibles might be ignited simultaneously during flashover. Different fuel vapors gasified from those combustibles were ignited by thermal radiation first. Thermal feedback from flames above the combustibles would then ignite the solid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach that}} improves the blasting efficiency in open pit mines. The aim {{of the study is}} the development of an environmentally friendly, low-emission production of dimension stone and gravel in six different quarries by optimizing the blasting technology. In addition to an improved energy-effective production of the muck pile two correlations of blast parameters were found. Both correlate the strain with the peak particle velocity: the first involves a “momentum-distance” relation and the second involves an “energy-distance ” relation. These relations suggest that the vibrations are controllable by adjusting the type of explosives, charge weights, borehole lengths, and borehole diameter. The <b>simultaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> of multiple charges according to the momentum theory does not increase the vibrations compared to consecutive ignition of smaller charges. This fact makes large blasting systems possible. The vibra-tion relations have to be determined individually for each quarry site. The zone of permanent deformation is defined on the basis of strain measurements at distances close to the blasting. Remarkably, damage in the form of crack formation does not occur in constructions outside of this zone, and this is independent of the construc-tion type. This is also valid for multiple blast impacts. parameters are calculated. If the forecast method is improved, the dimensioning of blasting systems is also improved...|$|E

We employ a novel numerical representation of the turbulent flame brush based upon ideas previously developed for modelling laboratory combustion and explore in some detail the sensitivity of the outcome to the manner in which burning is initiated. In particular, we simulate (1) a centrally ignited deflagration, (2) off-center ignition at a single ''point'', and (3) <b>simultaneous</b> off-center <b>ignition</b> at five ''points''. We find that the amount of " 5 " 6 Ni that is produced and other observable properties depend sensitively upon how the fuel is ignited. Because of the immediate onset of buoyant acceleration, the burning region in models ignited off center rises toward the surface more quickly than in the (commonly assumed) case of central ignition. With the exception of the model that ignited off-center at a single point, all models are unbound at the end of the computations and between 0. 59 M_sun (central ignition) and 0. 65 M_sun (ignition at multiple ''points'') of matter are processed into nuclear burning products. These results would guarantee an observable, though weak, type Ia supernova. Our results are expected to change for simulations in three dimensions, especially for the off-center ignitions discussed in this paper, and late detonations driven by pulsations are not unambigously excluded. We can, however, state that the chances for a direct transition to a detonation appear small because, in all our models, the turbulent velocity of the burning front remains very subsonic.

30|$|Biomass burning {{has a great}} {{influence}} on vegetation disturbance and succession, {{as well as on}} worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (Goetz et al. 2006, van der Werf et al. 2006, Chuvieco 2008). During recent years, severe fire seasons have been observed in several countries (Portugal, 2005; Greece, 2007; Australia, 2009; Russia, 2010; and others), due to climatic factors, such as heat waves or precipitation disturbances, {{and as a result of}} changes in land use derived from socio-economic trends (Martínez et al. 2009). For this reason, there is a growing emphasis on improving fire risk assessment systems, which predict when and where a fire is more prone to ignite or where it may cause more negative impacts (Chuvieco et al. 2010). Fire risk indices include different variables, such as weather conditions, topography (mainly slope gradient), fuel amount and geometric characteristics, and socio-economic conditions (Preisler et al. 2009). One of the main factors required to improve those fire risk indices is a more accurate estimate of the fuel moisture content (FMC), since this is closely related to fire ignition and fire propagation (Nelson 2001). In Spain, 96.1 % of all fires are human caused (Área de Defensa contra Incendios Forestales 2006). Fires caused by lightning are also very relevant (Vilar et al. 2010) as such fires tend to burn large areas because of their isolated locations and difficult accessibilities, and because they are characterized by <b>simultaneous</b> multiple <b>ignitions</b> (Wotton and Martell 2005). Since plants constitute the main ignition material in a forest, their moisture content plays an important role because it may serve to retard ignition or mitigate propagation of a fire. Fuels with high moisture content need higher temperatures or longer periods of heat exposure to ignite, because the heat is required for evaporation, leaving less energy available to initiate combustion (Dimitrakopoulos and Papaioannou 2001). In addition, fire propagates slower in wet fuels than in dry fuels as the evaporated fuel moisture inhibits combustion by diluting the flammable gases in the reaction zone and cooling the flames (Albini 1976, Shafizadeh et al. 1977). For this reason, the FMC is a common component of fire danger assessments (Blackmarr and Flanner 1968, Fosberg and Schroeder 1971).|$|R
40|$|Bacteria in a biofilm colony {{have the}} {{capacity}} to monitor the size and growth conditions for the colony and modify their phenotypical behaviour to optimise attacks, defence, migration, etc. The quorum sensing systems controlling this involve production and sensing of diffusive signal molecules. Frequently, quorum sensing systems carry a positive feedback loop which produces a switch at a threshold size of the colony. This all-or-none switch can be beneficial to create a sudden attack, leaving a host little time to establish a defence. The reaction-diffusion system describing a basal quorum sensing loop involves production of signal molecules, diffusion of signal molecules, and detection of signal molecules. We study the ignition process in a numerical solution for a basal quorum sensor and demonstrate that even in a large colony the ignition travels through the whole colony in a less than a minute. The ignition of the positive feedback loop was examined in different approximations. As expected, in the exact calculation the ignition was found to be delayed compared to a calculation where the binding of signal molecules was quasistatic. The buffering of signal molecules is found to have little effect on the ignition process. Contrary to expectation, we find that the ignition does not start when the threshold is reached at the center-instead it allows for the threshold to be approached in the whole colony followed by an almost <b>simultaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> of the whole biofilm aggregate...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{sustained}} behavior of a candle flame in microgravity determined in the glovebox facility aboard the First United States Microgravity Labomtofy. In a quiescent, microgmvjfy environment, diffusive transport becomes the dominant mode of heat and mass transfer; whether the diffusive transport rate is fast enough to sustain low-gravity candle flames in air was unknown to this series of about 70 tests. After an initial transient in which soot is observed, the microgravity candle flame in air becomes and remains hemispherical and blue (apparently soot-Ne) with a large flame standoff distance. Near flame extinction, spontaneous flame oscillations are regularly observed; these are explained as a flashback of flame through a premixed combustible gas followed by a retreat owed to flame quenching. The frequency of oscillations {{can be related to}} diffusive transport rates, and not to residual buoyant convective flow. The fact that the flame tip is the last point of the flame to survive suggests that it is the location of maximum fuel reactivity; this is unlike normal gravity, where the location of maximum fuel reactivity is the flame base. The flame color, size, and shape behaved in a quasi-steady manner; the finite size of the glovebox, combined with the restricted passages of the candlebox, inhibited the observation of true steady-state burning. Nonetheless, through calculations, and inference from the series of shuttle tests, if is concluded that a candle can burn indefinitely in a large enough ambient of air in microgravity. After igniting one candle, a second candle in close pximity could not be lit. This may be due to wax coating the wick and/or local oxygen depletion around the second, unlit candle. Post-mission testing suggests that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> may overcome these behaviors and enable both candles to be ignited...|$|E
40|$|One {{key element}} for the {{industrial}} use of applications using high current pulses is the electrical switch. Such applications are {{for example the}} recycling of composite materials using shock waves, magnetoforming for the contactless joining of work pieces, plasma accelerators for surface processing or pulsed plasma X-ray sources. In this work a radial multichannel switch for currents higher than 100 kA has been investigated {{with respect to the}} increase of the lifetime demanded by industrial use and stable operation for voltages up to 30 kV. For the increase of the operation voltage the electrode geometry has been optimised with the result of a maximum achieved hold-off voltage of 40 kV under the constraints given by the principle of the geometry of the radial multichannel switch. To increase the operation voltage the electronic supply of a high dielectric trigger unit has been matched to the requirements of multichannel operation. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> of at least 12 discharge channels has been demonstrated using this trigger concept. With the improvements of the electrode geometry and the trigger system a stable operation of at least 27 kV has been successfully demonstrated. Basic investigations of the type and the spatial distribution of the cathode spots reveal that the investigated electrode concept allows to distribute the discharge current homogeneously over the electrode surface which is necessary for low erosive operation. This low erosion has been demonstrated in lifetime tests with pulsed currents of 130 kA and a pulse duration around 20 #mu#s. For this parameter set a lifetime of more than one million pulses has been demonstrated {{for the first time with}} negligible electrode erosion. (orig.)

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{sensitivity}} of the flame propagation in a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf to initial conditions during the subsonic burning phase (deflagration), using 2 D simulations of the full WD. Results are presented {{for a wide variety of}} initial flame distributions including central and off-center single point and multi-point, <b>simultaneous</b> and non-simultaneous, <b>ignitions.</b> We also examine the effects of convective velocity field which should exist at the core before the thermo-nuclear runaway. Our main conclusion suggests that the amounts of burning products and their distributions through the deflagration phase are extremely sensitive to initial conditions, much more sensitive than presented in previous studies. In particular, we find that more complex configurations such as even slight off-center ignitions, non-simultaneous multi-point ignitions and velocity fields tend to favor solutions in which individual plumes rise faster than the bulk of a typical Rayleigh-Taylor driven, unstable burning front. The difference to previous calculations for an octant of a WD may be understood as a consequence of the suppression of l= 1, 2 modes. Our results are consistent with full star calculations by the Chicago group. Moreover, the total amount of nuclear burning during the phase of subsonic burning depends sensitively on the initial conditions and may cause the WD to pulsate or to become unbound.

40|$|We are {{applying}} our recently developed, LDRD-funded computational simulation tool to optimize and develop applications of Fast Ignition (FI) for stockpile stewardship. This report summarizes the work performed during a one-year exploratory research LDRD to develop FI point {{designs for the}} National Ignition Facility (NIF). These results were sufficiently encouraging to propose successfully a strategic initiative LDRD to design and perform the definitive FI experiment on the NIF. Ignition experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) will begin in 2010 using the central hot spot (CHS) approach, which relies on the <b>simultaneous</b> compression and <b>ignition</b> of a spherical fuel capsule. Unlike this approach, the fast ignition (FI) method separates fuel compression from the ignition phase. In the compression phase, a laser such as NIF is used to implode a shell either directly, or by x rays generated from the hohlraum wall, to form a compact dense ({approx} 300 g/cm{sup 3 }) fuel mass with an areal density of {approx} 3. 0 g/cm{sup 2 }. To ignite such a fuel assembly requires depositing {approx} 20 kJ into a {approx} 35 {micro}m spot delivered {{in a short time}} compared to the fuel disassembly time ({approx} 20 ps). This energy is delivered during the ignition phase by relativistic electrons generated by the interaction of an ultra-short high-intensity laser. The main advantages of FI over the CHS approach are higher gain, a lower ignition threshold, and a relaxation of the stringent symmetry requirements required by the CHS approach. There is worldwide interest in FI and its associated science. Major experimental facilities are being constructed which will enable 'proof of principle' tests of FI in integrated subignition experiments, most notably the OMEGA-EP facility at the University of Rochester's Laboratory of Laser Energetics and the FIREX facility at Osaka University in Japan. Also, scientists in the European Union have recently proposed {{the construction of a new}} FI facility, called HiPER, designed to demonstrate FI.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on fuel-air ignition and combustion (thermal effects) {{have been widely}} studied and well understood. However, a comprehensive understanding of nonequilibrium plasma effects (in situ generation of reactive species and radicals combined with gas heating) on the combustion process is still lacking. Over the past decade, research efforts have advanced our knowledge of electron impact kinetics and low temperature chain branching in fuel-air mixtures considerably. In contrast to numerous experimental investigations, research on modeling and simulation of plasma assisted combustion has received less attention. There is a dire need for development of self-consistent numerical models for construction and validation of plasma chemistry mechanisms. High-fidelity numerical models can be invaluable in exploring the plasma effects on ignition and combustion in turbulent and high-speed flow environments, owing to the difficulty in performing spatially resolved quantitative measurements. In this work, we establish a multi-scale modeling framework to simulate the physical and chemical effects of nonequilibrium, nanosecond plasma discharges on reacting flows. The model is capable of resolving electric field transients and electron impact dynamics in sub-ns timescales, as well as calculating the cumulative effects of multiple discharge pulses over ms timescales. Detailed chemistry mechanisms are incorporated to provide deep insight into the plasma kinetic pathways. The modeling framework is utilized to study ignition of H₂-air mixtures subjected to pulsed, nanosecond dielectric barrier discharges in a plane-to-plane geometry. The key kinetic pathways responsible for radicals such as O, H and OH generation from nanosecond discharges over multiple voltage pulses (ns-ms timescales) are quantified. The relative contributions of plasma thermal and kinetic effects in the ignition process are presented. The plasma generated radicals trigger partial fuel oxidation and heat release when the temperature rises above 700 K, after which the process becomes self-sustaining leading to igntion. The ignition kernel growth is primarily due to local plasma chemistry effects rather than flame propagation, and heat transport does not play a significant role. The nanosecond pulse discharge plasma excitation resulted in nearly <b>simultaneous</b> <b>ignition</b> over a large volume, {{in sharp contrast to}} hot-spot igniters. Next, the effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on the ignition characteristics of nC₇H₁₆ and air in a plane-to-plane geometry is studied at a reduced pressure of 20. 3 kPa. The plasma generated radicals initiate and significantly accelerate the H abstraction reaction from fuel molecules and trigger a “self-accelerating” feedback loop via low-temperature kinetic pathways. Application of only a few discharge pulses at the beginning reduces the initiation time of the first-stage temperature rise by a factor of 10. The plasma effect after the first stage is shown to be predominantly thermal. A novel plasma-flame modeling framework is developed to study the direct coupling of steady, laminar, low-pressure, premixed flames to highly non-equilibrium, nanosecond-pulsed plasma discharges. The simulations are performed with and without a burst of 200 nanosecond discharge pulses to quantify the effect of non-equilibrium plasma on a pre-existing lean premixed H₂/O₂/N₂ (ϕ = 0. 5) flame at 25 torr. Simulation results showed a significant increase in O and H densities due to plasma chemistry, with peak values increasing by a factor of 6 and a factor of 4, respectively. It is demonstrated that Joule heating alone cannot move the temperature and species profiles as far upstream (i. e. closer to the burner surface) as the pulsed plasma source of the same total power. LES (large eddy simulation) of ignition and combustion of H₂ jets injected into a supersonic O₂ crossflow is performed. Nanosecond plasma discharges are studied for their potential to produce radicals and impact on the flame-holding process. The plasma has a significant effect on the O atom distribution near the discharge domain {{as well as in the}} leeward side of the second jet. The other species distributions, however, remained unchanged with or without plasma. We believe the reason for this behavior was the high jet momentum ratios considered in the present study. The plasma generated radicals were unable to have an effect on the flame development downstream because of the strong penetration of the cold fuel jet. Ph. D...|$|E
