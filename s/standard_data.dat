25|$|Compact (SQL CE): The compact edition is an {{embedded}} database engine. Unlike the other editions of SQL Server, the SQL CE engine {{is based on}} SQL Mobile (initially designed for use with hand-held devices) and does not share the same binaries. Due to its small size (1MB DLL footprint), it has a markedly reduced feature set {{compared to the other}} editions. For example, it supports a subset of the <b>standard</b> <b>data</b> types, does not support stored procedures or Views or multiple-statement batches (among other limitations). It is limited to 4GB maximum database size and cannot be run as a Windows service, Compact Edition must be hosted by the application using it. The 3.5 version includes support for ADO.NET Synchronization Services. SQL CE does not support ODBC connectivity, unlike SQL Server proper.|$|E

40|$|As an {{important}} data quality dimension, semantic interoperability of data can potentially be improved using <b>data</b> <b>standards.</b> Certain <b>data</b> <b>standards</b> are extensible, allowing users to introduce custom data elements. How interoperable is data created using an extensible <b>data</b> <b>standard?</b> How does extensibility of a <b>data</b> <b>standard</b> affect interoperability of data created using the standard? How does a standard evolve {{and what is}} its impact on interoperability? This research address these questions by empirically measuring semantic interoperability of real world data created using a large extensible <b>data</b> <b>standard.</b> It also uses case studies to {{develop an understanding of}} how users extend <b>data</b> <b>standards.</b> Preliminary results of the impact of <b>standard</b> evolution on <b>data’s</b> interoperability are also discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Floppy {{disk storage}} {{had become the}} <b>standard</b> <b>data</b> storage medium in the United States by the mid-1980s; for example, by 1983 the {{majority}} of software sold by Atari Program Exchange was on floppy. Cassette remained more popular for 8-bit computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Amstrad CPC 464 in many countries such as the United Kingdom (where 8-bit software was mostly sold on cassette until that market disappeared altogether in the early 1990s). Reliability of cassettes for data storage is inconsistent, with many users recalling repeated attempts to load video games; the Commodore Datasette used very reliable, but slow, digital encoding. In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, and the Netherlands, cassette data storage was so popular that some radio stations would broadcast computer programs that listeners could record onto cassette and then load into their computer.

2500|$|The current Mac {{product family}} uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple {{introduced}} an emulator {{during the transition}} from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), {{much as it did}} during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two <b>standard</b> <b>data</b> transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. [...] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.|$|E

Without effective visualization, it is extremely difficult to understand such large <b>data</b> <b>standards.</b> This is further exacerbated when users are allowed to extend <b>data</b> <b>standards,</b> which in effect produces multiple versions of <b>data</b> <b>standards.</b> In this research, we develop a hyperbolic tree based visualization technique that uses different colors of node labels to distinguish different groups of relationships. Edge colors are also differentiated to visualize extensions to a given standard. The technique is applied to a real-world financial reporting <b>data</b> <b>standard</b> called the XBRL GAAP Taxonomy.
