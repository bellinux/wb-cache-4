5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulation</b> therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulation,</b> some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulation</b> based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently.

40|$|Background:- Wheat is {{believed}} to cause food allergy in {{children as well as}} in adults leading to severe abdominal discomforts, cramps, pains, indigestion, bloating and constipation. There are a few studies that address IgE mediated wheat allergy in people. Several papers have been published on various other methods of testing for food allergies but none on the actual elimination of food allergies. Objective:- We sought to determine the efficacy of NAET ® in permanently eliminating wheat allergy for a sample of patients. NAET ® is a natural treatment that utilizes standard medical diagnostic measures along with kinesiolgocal, chiropractic and oriental testing procedures to identify the allergens, as well as the intensity of reactions to the allergens which vary from individual to individual. Treatment consists of a sequence of <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulations</b> at specific thoracic and lumbar spinal levels along with acupuncture and/or acupressure on configurations of standard acupuncture points. Methods:- In a double blind study, 26 patients with diagnosed wheat allergy (13 males, 13 females, age range between 18 - 65 years) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (1) NAET®/Experimental group, and (2) Control group.

A total of 366 spinal surgeries, Federal Center of Traumatology, Orthopedics and Endoprosthesis from 2009 to 2015. From 2009 to 2013, the wake-up test was used as a control method in 116 (65. 9 %) cases. Results. Application of IONM revealed time-dependent risks and facilitated a reduction in the incidence of postoperative neurologic complications by 3 -fold (from 2. 6 % to 0. 8 %). In the second half of 2013, IONM was introduced for use in clinical practice. Since then, 250 surgeries were performed with IONM. Of these, the wake-up test was required in 9 (3. 6 %) patients. Clinical implementation of IONM extended the benefits of surgery to patients with severe pathologies. The number of surgeries for congenital pathologies increased by 10 -fold (from 1 % to 10 %) and by 2. 6 -fold for degenerative diseases. IONM possibility allows control of intraoperative neurologic complications among patients with spinal injuries (5 %) and neuro and muscular scoliosis. Conclusions.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{systematic}} review of diagnostic accuracy studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic {{accuracy of the}} premanipulative vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) tests. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The aim of premanipulative vertebrobasilar testing is to evaluate the adequacy of blood supply to the brain, by compressing the vertebral artery and examining for the onset of {{signs and symptoms of}} cerebrovascular ischemia. Although clinicians consider pre-manipulative testing important before applying <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulations,</b> the diagnostic accuracy has not been systematically reviewed. METHODS: A search was made in PUBMED, CINAHL and EMBASE databases from their date of inception until 2 nd May 2012. Studies were included if they compared a VBI test with a reference test, and sensitivity and specificity were reported or could be calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using QUADAS. Agreement between reviewers was calculated and expressed as a percentage and quantified by kappa statistics. RESULTS: Of the 1677 potential citations only 4 studies were included, all of questionable quality. Sensitivity was low and ranged from 0 to 57 %, specificity from 67 to 100 %, positive predictive value from 0 % to 100 %, and negative predictive value from 26 to 96 %. The positive likelihood ratio ranged from 0. 22 to 83. 25 and the negative likelihood ratio from 0. 44 to 1. 40. CONCLUSION: Based on this {{systematic review}} of only 4 studies {{it was not possible to}} draw firm conclusions about the diagnostic accuracy of premanipulative tests.

The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine the}} most effective chiropractic treatment protocol in the management of impingement syndrome due to supraspinatus tendonitis. This was done by comparing objective and subjective measures gained during a treatment protocol consisting either of administering corrective chiropractic manipulative therapy to the cervical spine and/or the thoracic spine, to the glenohumeral joint or to both of these areas. METHODS: This randomised controlled trial consisted of three groups of fifteen patients, each between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years old. All potential candidates were examined and cleared for participation in the clinical trials subsequent to a selection process and X-ray examination if necessary. Diversified chiropractic manipulative techniques were used for all patients provided joint restrictions were detected. Group A received glenohumeral joint manipulations, Group B received <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulations</b> and Group C received a combination of spinal and glenohumeral joint manipulations. PROCEDURE: Patients were treated for six consultations over a two-week period. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for four weeks after that in order to determine the lasting effects of the treatment protocol. At the first, third, sixth and follow-up visit, measurements were recorded. Objective data included pain free shoulder abduction range of motion, the presence of a painful arc {{of the shoulder}} and the presence of a positive supraspinatus test.

RESULTS: statistical analysis was conducted using the parametric One Way ANOVA (analysis of variance) and unpaired t-tests as well as the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum tests to compare intragroup and intergroup data. III CONCLUSIONS: Although all three groups showed numerical improvements throughout the treatment period, only group A showed statistically significant improvements.

40|$|Background Context: Acute {{back pain}} and sciatica are {{major sources of}} disability. Many medical {{interventions}} are available, including manipulations, with conflicting results. Purpose: To assess the short- and long-term effects of <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulations</b> on acute back pain and sciatica with disc protrusion. Study Design/Setting: Randomized double-blind trial comparing active and simulated manipulations in rehabilitation medical centers in Rome and suburbs. Patient Sample: 102 ambulatory patients with at least moderate pain on a visual analog scale for local pain (VAS 1) and/or radiating pain (VAS 2). Outcome Measures: Pain-free patients at end of treatment; treatment failure (proportion of patients stopping the assigned treatment for lack of effect on pain); number of days with no, mild, moderate, or severe pain; quality of life; number of days on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; number of drug prescriptions; VAS 1 and VAS 2 scores; {{quality of life and}} psychosocial findings; and reduction of disc protrusion on magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: Manipulations or simulated manipulations were done 5 days per week by experienced chiropractors, with a number of sessions which depended on pain relief or up to a maximum of 20, using a rapid thrust technique. Patients were assessed at admission and at 15, 30, 45, 90, and 180 days. At each visit, all indicators of pain relief were used. Results: A total of 64 men and 38 women aged 19 - 63 years were randomized to manipulations (53) or simulated manipulations (49). Manipulations appeared more effective {{on the basis of the}} percentage of pain-free cases (local pain 28 vs. 6 %; p<. 005; radiating pain 55 vs. 20 %; p<. 0001), number of days with pain (23. 6 vs. 27. 4; p<. 005), and number of days with moderate or severe pain (13. 9 vs. 17. 9; p<. 05). Patients receiving manipulations had lower mean VAS 1 (p<. 0001) and VAS 2 scores (p<. 001). A significant interaction was found between therapeutic arm and time. There were no significant differences in quality of life and psychosocial scores. There were only two treatment failures (manipulation 1; simulated manipulation 1) and no adverse events.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Abstract: Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to deduce whether full <b>spinal</b> {{chiropractic}} <b>manipulation</b> would have an immediate effect on the accuracy and delivery speed of male fast bowlers. Method: The study consisted of thirty (30) participants, medium-fast and fast bowlers. Seven sessions, were conducted, in which participants warmed up and stretched before bowling an over (consisting of six deliveries). The first three sessions were screening sessions where each participant was observed for consistent speed and angle of arm during delivery by using a high-speed camera, and then the speed of each delivery was recorded using a Doppler Speed gun. Any restrictions palpated were treated with chiropractic manipulation in the last four sessions. Post-manipulation recording of delivery speed and accuracy was recorded and analysed compared to the pre-manipulation speed via STATKON using the Pared Sample T-Test (if the data is normally distributed) and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (if the data is not normally distributed). Results: The analysis revealed full <b>spinal</b> chiropractic <b>manipulation</b> does immediately increase the bowling speed and accuracy of male bowlers. The difference between the minimum pre-manipulation speed and minimum post-manipulation speed was 5. 05 %. As with the maximum pre-manipulation and postmanipulation speed the difference was 7. 24 %. The mean speed difference for the group was 5. 1962 km/h for an over. For the objective values of accuracy, the first three pre-manipulation overs were compared only to the first three post-manipulation overs to remove the fourth over as an inconsistent variable. A difference between the minimum pre-manipulation speed and minimum post-manipulation accuracy was 66. 67 %. The maximum pre-manipulation and post-manipulation accuracy difference was 40 %. Conclusion: Intervention could be beneficial by enhancing speed and accuracy needed for fast bowling in cricket. This research indicates that pre-event chiropractic manipulation may enhance the performance of experienced male medium, medium-fast and fast bowlers The benefit of this study was not only to demonstrate the efficacy of chiropractic manipulation in pre-event intervention and to enhance cricketers’ bowling performance but also to provide evidence to secure a place for chiropractic in sports medicine in the high profile sporting arena where there is a focus on team sports.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} outcome {{after an}} alternative unilateral {{approach to the}} thoracolumbar spine for dorsal laminectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Dogs (n= 14) with thoracolumbar spinal cord compression. METHODS: Thoracolumbar spinal cord compression was lateral (6 dogs), dorsal (4), and dorsolateral (4) caused by subarachnoid (7) and synovial cysts (2) and intradural-extramedullary neoplasia (5). All dogs were treated by dorsal laminectomy with osteotomy of the spinous process using a unilateral paramedian approach. The contralateral paraspinal muscles were not stripped from the spinous process and the osteoligamentous complexes were preserved. Retraction of the spinous process and muscles to the contralateral side resulted in complete visualization of the dorsal vertebral arch thereby allowing dorsal laminectomy to be performed. RESULTS: No technique complications occurred. Approximately 75 % exposure of the spinal cord (dorsal and lateral compartments) was achieved providing adequate visualization and treatment of the lesions. Transient deterioration of neurologic state occurred in 5 dogs because of extensive <b>spinal</b> cord <b>manipulation.</b> At long-term follow-up, 6 dogs were normal, 6 had clinical improvement, and 2 were unchanged. CONCLUSION: Dorsal laminectomy after osteotomy and retraction of the spinous process may be considered in canine patients with dorsal, dorsolateral, or lateral compression to facilitate adequate decompression of the spinal cord.
