One of the applications of sintered SS products is as filters in the petrochemical and food processing industries. In these industries, the SS filters are subject to severe conditions associated with the removal of solid particles from the fluid. Hence, SS filters should have adequate mechanical strength and high corrosion resistance. Welding can be used to manufacture SS filters. In this study, sintered AISI 316 L specimens were welded using the TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) process. The weld joints were examined by optical microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|Controlled {{laboratory}} {{studies of the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of sea spray aerosol (SSA) must be under-pinned by a physically and chemically accurate representation of the bubble-mediated production of nascent SSA particles. Bubble bursting is sensitive to the physico-chemical properties of seawater. For a sample of seawater, any important differences in the SSA production mechanism are projected into the composition of the aerosol particles produced. Using direct chemical measurements of SSA at the single-particle level, this study presents an intercomparison of three laboratory-based, bubble-mediated SSA production schemes: gas forced through submerged <b>sintered</b> glass <b>filters</b> ("frits"), a pulsed plunging-waterfall apparatus, and breaking waves in a wave channel filled with natural seawater. The size-resolved chemical composition of SSA particles produced by breaking waves is more similar to particles produced by the plunging waterfall than those produced by <b>sintered</b> glass <b>filters.</b> Aerosol generated by disintegrating foam produced by <b>sintered</b> glass <b>filters</b> contained a larger fraction of organic-enriched particles and a different size-resolved elemental composition, especially in the 0. 8 – 2 μm dry diameter range. Interestingly, chemical differences between the methods only emerged when the particles were chemically analyzed at the single-particle level as a function of size; averaging the elemental composition of all particles across all sizes masked the differences between the SSA samples. When dried, SSA generated by the <b>sintered</b> glass <b>filters</b> had the highest fraction of particles with spherical morphology compared to the more cubic structure expected for pure NaCl particles produced when the particle contains relatively little organic carbon. In addition to an intercomparison of three SSA production methods, the role of the episodic or "pulsed" nature of the waterfall method on SSA composition was under-taken. In organic-enriched seawater, the continuous operation of the plunging waterfall resulted in the accumulation of surface foam and an over-expression of organic matter in SSA particles compared to those produced by a pulsed plunging waterfall. Throughout this set of experiments, comparative differences in the SSA number size distribution were coincident with differences in aerosol particle composition, indicating that the production mechanism of SSA exerts important controls on both the physical and chemical properties of the resulting aerosol with respect to both the internal and external mixing state of particles. This study provides insight into the inextricable physicochemical differences between each of the bubble-mediated SSA generation mechanisms tested and the aerosol particles that they produce, and also serves as a guideline for future {{laboratory studies}} of SSA particles...|$|R

The solution chemistry and the dissolution and precipitation of solid phases are correctly described by 2 D modeling with the GRAAL model implemented in the HYTEC reactive transport code. The spatial symmetry of the boron concentrations in both compartments of the cells results from dissolution coupled with simple diffusion, whereas the spatial asymmetry of the silicon and magnesium concentrations is due to strong coupling between dissolution, diffusion, and precipitation of secondary phases.

The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop.

These filters can provide particulate capture efficiencies of 99. 9 % or better. The temperature for filtration has been as high as 900 C. Along with filtration efficiency consideration, more important criteria such as corrosion resistance, mechanical strength at service temperature and cake release issues are being addressed. These issues are critical to operating the hot gas filter successfully and cost effectively. Concerns related to hot corrosion and strength at high temperatures lead the technical community towards using ceramic filters. While ceramics are mostly inert to hot corrosion environments, they are brittle, and are prone to failure during thermal cycling or under rapidly changing loads, such as during process upset or filter blowback. Metal filters can be designed with required strength at elevated temperatures, hot corrosion resistance and toughness to withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses.

In situ diffusion experiments were performed in vertical boreholes to determine diffusion and retention parameters of selected radionuclides. C-Ox clay exhibits a mild diffusion anisotropy due to stratification. Interpretation of in situ diffusion experiments is complicated by several non-ideal effects caused {{by the presence of}} a <b>sintered</b> <b>filter,</b> a gap between the filter and borehole wall and an excavation disturbed zone (EdZ). The relevance of such non-ideal effects and their impact on estimated clay parameters have been evaluated with numerical sensitivity analyses and synthetic experiments having similar parameters and geometric characteristics as real DIR experiments. Normalized dimensionless sensitivities of tracer concentrations at the test interval have been computed numerically. Tracer concentrations are found to be sensitive to all key parameters. Sensitivities are tracer dependent and vary with time. These sensitivities are useful to identify which are the parameters that can be estimated with less uncertainty and find the times at which tracer concentrations begin to be sensitive to each parameter. Synthetic experiments generated with prescribed known parameters have been interpreted automatically with INVERSE-CORE{sup 2 D} and used to evaluate the relevance of non-ideal effects and ascertain parameter identifiability in the presence of random measurement errors. Identifiability analysis of synthetic experiments reveals that data noise makes difficult the estimation of clay parameters. Parameters of clay and EdZ cannot be estimated simultaneously from noisy data. Models without an EdZ fail to reproduce synthetic data. Proper interpretation of in situ diffusion experiments requires accounting for filter, gap and EdZ. Estimates of the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity of clay are highly correlated, indicating that these parameters cannot be estimated simultaneously. Accurate estimation of D{sub e} and porosities of clay and EdZ is only possible when the standard deviation of random noise is less than 0. 01. Small errors in the volume of the circulation system do not affect clay parameter estimates. Normalized sensitivities as well as the identifiability analysis of synthetic experiments have provided additional insight on inverse estimation of in situ diffusion experiments and will be of great benefit for the interpretation of real DIR in situ diffusion experiments...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the ITER Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) Area was performed to assess dose rates outside {{the walls and ceiling}} of the facility after 1. 5 years of operation at shutdown, 2 days, and 10 days after shutdown. For this purpose a simplified Monte Carlo computer model was developed using the MCNP (MCNP 5 Ver. 1. 51) code. Two components are included: the smaller filter tank and the larger ion exchanger. These pieces of equipment are associated with the Integrated Blanket ELM Divertor Primary Heat Transfer System, which will have the largest dose rates associated with activated corrosion products during operation in comparison with other systems. The ion exchanger contained two source regions, a 1. 2 -m-thick resin bed above a 0. 55 m-thick skirt, and a 0. 8 -m-thick water region. The filter constituted an additional source. Thus the model consisted of three sources (filter, resin, water), homogeneously distributed within the appropriate source regions. However, much of the results (that address individual isotopes) are presented with the two sources in the ion exchanger combined. In these cases the sources are referred to as the 'ion exchanger source' and the 'filter source. ' Dimensions for the facility and components, as well as source isotopes and strengths, and material densities, were supplied by US ITER. Because of its simplification, the model does not contain pipes. Consequently, radiation streaming through pipe penetrations, radiation emanating from the pipes, and shielding from the pipes were not considered in this analysis. Dose rates on the outside of two walls and the ceiling were calculated. The two walls are labeled as the 'long' wall (aligned with the X-axis) and the 'short' wall (aligned with the Y-axis). These walls and ceiling were nominally set to 30 -cm-thick concrete. In the original analysis, standard concrete (2. 3 g/cc density) was used. In addition to the shielding walls/ceiling, a floor and an additional wall opposite the long wall were added for photon scattering contributions. These were both 10 -cm-thick, standard concrete structures. Other components (tanks, pipes, etc.), that {{were not included in the}} model, would potentially add additional scattering and shielding. Possibly these additional effects will be addressed in a later, more detailed analysis. The room was 29. 6 m in length (X-axis), but was limited to 15 m in the model. The inside width (Y axis) and height (Z axis) were 4 m and 3. 4 m, respectively. The origin for the model was located inside the room at the corner opposite the long wall and adjacent to the short wall at the floor level. The room was filled with air at standard temperature and pressure. The stainless steel (SS 304) wall thicknesses for the ion exchanger and filter were 2. 2 cm and 0. 8 cm, respectively. The axial center of the filter was located 140 cm from the short wall and 100 cm from the long wall (outer surface). The axial center of the ion exchanger was located 440 cm from the short wall and 250 cm from the long wall (inner surface). The resin was assumed to be a homogeneous mixture of equal atom density fractions of hydrogen and carbon* at a specified density of 1. 136 g/cc. The filter material was assumed to be homogeneous carbon at a specified density of 1. 8 g/cc. If the filter media were stainless steel and the accumulated activity were the same, the dose rate outside the filter would be lower, provided the density of the stainless steel <b>sintered</b> <b>filter</b> material is significantly higher than 1. 8 g/cc. The densities of the water and air were assumed to be 1. 0 g/cc and 1. 096 E- 3 g/cc, respectively. The model included 10 small volumes placed outside the model adjacent to the wall at locations where the dose rates were expected to be highest and which showed to a degree the fall-off of the dose rate with distance along a particular wall or ceiling. These 'tally cells' are shown in Fig. 2 and are described in Table 1. Each cell had dimensions of 50 cm x 50 cm x 1 cm and was oriented so that the 1 -cm-thick dimension was perpendicular to the wall against which the cell was located. Also, smaller tally volumes were placed at 5 cm (updated model), 30 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm from each source, both radially from the outside of each component at the height of each source mid-plane, and vertically, along the axial centerline, above the ion-exchanger and below the filter. (For the ion exchanger, the vertical distance was limited to 75 cm because of interference from the ceiling.) These tally regions can be seen in Fig. 3.

After leaching and filtration, the pH of the leach liquor was measured and samples were analyzed for dissolved metals (Ni, Fe and Co) using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The most significant variable effect on leaching of nickel was the ammonia concentration. The maximum dissolution of nickel from the unroasted ore was 11. 90 % at 4 M NH 3, 100 oC, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3 and 2 bar O 2 pressure. Optimization from the leaching data was done using response profiling and desirability in Statistica software. Optimum leaching conditions were determined to be 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 2, 100 oC and 2 bar O 2 pressure. The mineralogy of the ore before and after leaching was studied to understand why nickel extraction from unroasted ore was poor. XRF analysis of solids after leaching showed that iron, silicon, and magnesium remained the same. The only metal which showed significant decrease from solids was nickel. XRD analysis of solids after and before leaching showed that most mineral phases present in the ore are not affected by the leaching solution. SEM with EDS detection was used to determine nickel distribution within the ore. The results showed that nickel is mostly associated with iron. The iron is surrounded by magnesium and silicon. Silicate minerals do not react with ammonia and ammonium carbonate solution. From filtration experiments, the filtration differential pressure had no significant effect on the filtration rate. An average filtration rate of 0. 29 ± 0. 07 ml/min. cm 2 was obtained. The filtration rate from these experiments was very low. The main reason was due to quick pore clogging of sintered metals. Pore clogging was found to be mainly on the surface of the filter medium. Laterites have been found to have low permeability due a lot of clay present in the ore. Rheological studies on this ore showed that the ore has shear thickening behavior. However, a very clear filtrate was obtained. After each leach and filtration experiment, the sintered metals was unblocked by back flushing with water and air. Back flushing was successful because all 18 experiments were carried out using the same <b>sintered</b> <b>filter</b> medium. The effect of roasting the ore prior to leaching was investigated using optimum conditions obtained when leaching the unroasted ore. There was a slight improvement in nickel extraction when the ore was roasted. The average percentage extraction of nickel from 3 experimental runs was 19. 25 %± 0. 19 at 100 oC, 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3, and 5 bar oxygen pressure. Some part of nickel in the ore was unextractable due to association of nickel with recrystallized silicate minerals in the reduced ore. Roasting improved permeability of the ore. The filtration rate improved significantly after roasting the ore. The average filtration rate was 2. 60 ± 0. 05 ml/min. cm 2. Dissolution kinetics of the unroasted and roasted saprolitic laterite were investigated with regard to the effects of temperature, ammonia concentration, ammonium carbonate concentration, and oxygen pressure. For the unroasted ore, it was found that dissolution rate and degree of nickel extraction increases with increasing temperature. Increase in ammonia concentration improves the degree of nickel extraction. Nevertheless, nickel extraction does not depend entirely on ammonia concentration because even when ammonia concentration is high and ammonium carbonate concentration is zero nickel extraction is low. An increase in ammonium carbonate concentration also increases the degree of nickel extraction. Ammonium carbonate is critical for the extraction, since ammonium ions in the solution prevent hydrolysis of the nickel ammine complex. Oxygen did not have a significant effect on the degree of nickel extraction. The leaching of nickel laterite was found to be a two stage leaching process. In the first stage, the dissolution of nickel is faster but after 15 minutes, the reaction rate is reduced. The reaction rate is reduced by inert minerals which host nickel. These minerals contain iron magnesium and silicon. The fast dissolution of nickel in the first stage represents leaching of free nickel in the ore. The data for the second stage of leaching was analyzed by the shrinking core model, and the results suggested that the dissolution rate is controlled by mixture kinetics (ash layer diffusion and surface reaction control). The activation energy for the dissolution reaction was calculated as 56. 5 KJ/mol. The reaction order with respect to ammonia and ammonium carbonate were determined to be 0. 3 and 0. 26 respectively. For the roasted ore, the highest degree of nickel extraction was obtained at 60 oC, 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3, and 5 bar oxygen pressure. The percentage extraction under these conditions was 28. 7 %. Temperature did not have a significant effect on the leaching rate. An increase in NH 3 and (NH 4) 2 CO 3 increased the final extraction of nickel but did not have any effect on leaching rate in the first stage of leaching. In the absence of ammonium carbonate, nickel extraction is almost zero. The experimental data did not give linear fit to the shrinking core models investigated for the unroasted ore. The reason for this could be due to the sampling time interval which was too far apart, or the leaching behavior of roasted nickel is complicated and cannot explained by shrinking core model alone. Leaching experiments demonstrate that for a high degree metal extraction and improved reaction kinetics with ammonia and ammonium carbonate, the solution temperature should be high (> 100 oC) for the unroasted ore. In order to leach at high temperature with ammonia and ammonium carbonate a closed vessel is required to prevent reagent loses. The reaction kinetics showed that the reaction is controlled mostly by ash layer diffusion; this indicates that a low degree of nickel extraction in the unroasted saprolitic laterite is due to inert minerals (ash layer) which host nickel within the ore. In order to obtain a high degree of nickel extraction, the ore needs to be roasted under reducing conditions. Roasting conditions need to be carefully controlled to ensure high dissolution of nickel. In fact optimum roasting conditions which will give maximum dissolution of nickel, must be determined before working with the bulk of the ore. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Logingstoetse van saprolitiese lateriet met 'n oplossing van ammonia en ammonium karbonaat is gedoen in 'n druk houer. Die logingsvat vir hierdie studie is ontwikkel om die loging sowel as die vloeistof – vastestof skeiding te doen. Gesinterde metaal filter medium was gebruik vir die vloeistof – vastestof skeiding aangesien dit die volgende eienskappe vertoon; die vermoë om druk te weerstaan, die chemiese weerstand teen bytsoda oplossing, asook voordelige terugspoel eienskappe. Optimum loogkondisies is bepaal deur die temperatuur, ammoniak konsentrasie, ammonium karbonaat konsentrasie, en suurstof druk te varieer. Na loging en filtrasie is die pH van die loogvloeistof gemeet en monsters is deur atoom absorpsie spektrofotometrie geanaliseer vir opgeloste metale (Ni, Fe en Co). Die veranderlike wat die grootste effek op die loging van nikkel gehad het was die ammoniak konsentrasie. Die maksimum herwinning van nikkel van uit ongeroosterde erts was 11. 9 % by 4 M NH 3, 100 oC, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3 en 2 bar O 2 druk. Optimisering van die loogdata is gedoen deur die respons profiel te analiseer met Statistica sagteware. Optimum loogkondisies was bepaal as 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 2, 100 oC en 2 bar O 2 druk. Die mineralogie van die erts voor en na loging is bestudeer om te bepaal waarom die nikel opbrengs van ongeroosterde erts so laag was. XRF analise van die vastestof na loging het gewys dat yster, silikon en magnesium nie deur loging affekteer is nie. Slegs nikkel het 'n merkwaardige afname getoon. XRD analsiese van die vastestof voor en na loging wys dat die meeste mineraal fases teenwoordig in die erts nie deur die loogoplossing affekteer is nie. SEM met EDS deteksie is gebruik om die nikkel verspreiding in die erts te bepaal. Die resultate wys dat nikkel meestal met yster assosieer. Die yster is omring deur magnesium en silikon. Silikaat minerale reageer nie met ammoniak en ammonium karbonaat oplossing nie. In filtrasie eksperimente is daar gevind dat die filtrasie differensiële druk geen noemenswaardige effek op die filtrasie tempo gehad het nie. Die gemiddelde filtrasietempo was 0. 29 + 0. 07 ml/min. cm 2. Die filtrasie tempo van hierdie eksperimente was baie laag, hoofsaaklik as gevolg van blokkasie van porieë van die sinter metaal filter medium. Dit is gevind dat blokkasie van porieë hoofsaaklik op die oppervlak van die filter medium plaasvind. Lateriedes toon 'n lae deurlaatbaarheid as gevolg van die erts se hoë klei inhoud. Rheologiese studies op hierdie erts wys dat die erts skuif verdikking (“shear thickening”) gedrag vertoon. 'n Baie helder filtraat is egter verkry. Die gesinterde metale is na elke loog en filtrasie eksperiment skoongemaak deur terugspoeling met water en lug. Hierdie procedure was suksesvol, aangesien al 18 eksperimente met dieselfde filter medium uitgevoer is. Die effek van erts roostering voor loging is ondersoek by die optimum kondisies wat verkry was vir die loging van ongeroosterde erts. Nikkel ekstraksie het effens verbeter met geroosterde erts. Die gemiddelde persentasie ekstraksie van nikkel van drie eksperimentele lopies was 19. 25 % + 0. 19 by 100 oC, 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3, en 5 bar suurstofdruk. 'n Gedeelte van die nikkel in die erts was onherwinbaar as gevolg van die assosiasie van nikkel met her-gekristaliseerde sillikaat-minerale in die gereduseerde erts. Die porositeit van die erts is verbeter deur dit te rooster. Die filtrasie tempo het merkwaardig verbeter nadat die erts gerooster is. Die gemiddelde filtrasie tempo was 2. 6 + 0. 05 ml/min. cm 2. Kinetika vir die oplossing van ongeroosterde en geroosterde saprolitiese lateriet is ondersoek, met in ag geneem die effekte van temperatuur, ammonia konsentrasie, ammonium karbonaat konsentrasie en suurstofdruk. Vir ongeroosterde erts is gevind dat die oplossingstempo en graad van nikkel ekstraksie toeneem met toenemende temperatuur. Toename in ammoniak konsentrasie lei tot 'n toename in nikkel ekstraksie, maar nikkel ekstraksie is nie alleenlik afhanklik van ammoniak nie. 'n Toename in ammonium karbonaat konsentrasie lei ook tot 'n toename in nikkel ekstraksie. Ammonium karbonaat is krities vir die ekstraksie, aangesien ammonium ione in die oplossing die hidrolise van die nikkel-amien kompleks verhoed. Suurstof het nie 'n merkwaardige effek op die totale nikkel ekstraksie gehad nie. Vir die bepaling van reaksie kinetika is 100 ˚C gebruik as die logingstemperatuur. Die loging van saprolitiese nikkel lateriet vind in twee stadia plaas. In die eerste fase is die oplossing van nikkel vinnig, maar na 15 minute neem die reaksietempo af. Die reaksietempo word verlaag deur inerte minerale wat teenwoordig is in die nikkel erts. Hierdie minerale bevat yster, magnesium en silikon. Die vinnige oplossing van nikkel in die eerste fase verteenwoordig die loging van vry nikkel in die erts. Die data vir die tweede stadium is geanaliseer deur die krimpende kern model, en die resultate dui aan dat die oplossingstempo deur 'n gemengde meganisme beheer word (as laag diffusie en oppervlak reaksie beheer). Die aktiveringsengergie vir die oplossingsreaksie was bereken as 56. 5 kJ/mol. Die reaksieorde ten opsigte van ammoniak en ammonium karbonaat is onderskeidelik bepaal as 0. 3 en 0. 26. Die hoogste graad van nikkel ekstraksie vir die geroosterde erts is verkry by 60 oC, 3 M NH 3, 2 M (NH 4) 2 CO 3, en 5 bar O 2 druk. Die persentasie ekstraksie by hierdie kondisies was 28. 7 %. Temperatuur het nie 'n merkwaardige effek op loogtempo gehad nie. 'n Toename in NH 3 en (NH 4) 2 CO 3 het die graad van nikkel ekstraksie laat toeneem, maar het nie enige effek op die loogtempo gehad nie. In die afwesigheid van ammonium karbonaat het byna geen nikkel ekstraksie plaasgevind nie. Die eksperimentele data het nie 'n lineêre passing vir die krimpende kern model soos vir die ongeroosterde erts ondersoek gegee nie. Die rede hiervoor is dat die monsternemings interval te groot was, of dat die logings karakteristiek van geroosterde nikel gekompliseerd is en nie alleen deur die krimpende kern model voorspel kan word nie. Logings eksperimente wys dat die temperatuur hoog moet wees (> 100 oC) om 'n hoë graad van nikkel ekstraksie te verkry met die ongeroosterde erts. 'n Geslote reaktor word benodig om by 'n hoë temperatuur met ammoniak en ammonium karbonaat te loog om reagens verliese te verhoed. Die reaksie kinetika word grootliks deur aslaag diffusie beheer. Hieruit kan gesien word dat 'n lae graad van nikkel ekstraksie uit die ongeroosterde saprolitiese lateriet die gevolg is van nie-reaktiewe minerale (aslaag) waarin die nikkel binne die erts bevat word. Om 'n hoë graad van nikkel ekstraksie te verkry moet die erts onder reduserende kondisies gerooster word. Rooster kondisies moet versigtig beheer word om hoë oplossing van nikkel te verseker. Optimum rooster kondisies om maksimum nikkel oplossing te verkry, moet bepaal word voordat daar met groter hoeveelhede erts gewerk kan word...|$|E
