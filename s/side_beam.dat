50|$|The MOMBA 2C had a pod and {{boom type}} fuselage. The pilot's seat was just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, placing him in a {{reclining}} position under a long, single piece canopy, shaped from an uncut Slingsby Kestrel moulding. The cockpit had some unusual features, principally that access to it was by rolling the whole nosecone and canopy forwards along a rail from a join around the fuselage ahead of the wing. This provided an aerodynamically very clean and well sealed forward fuselage, as well as easy access for instrument panel servicing. The control column was side mounted on a raised <b>side</b> <b>beam</b> on the right; flap and undercarriage levers were similarly mounted on the other side. This arrangement avoided underfloor control cables, keeping the fuselage cross section low and simplifying the control linkages. The cockpit was narrow and low {{and would not have}} been comfortable for bigger pilots than Sunderland. The nosecone was skinned with glass cloth over balsa. Instrument panel, controls, seat and the retractable monowheel undercarriage were supported by a central, sturdy, sheet alloy frame linked to the wing. The fuselage tapered from the leading edge aft, an area covered glass cloth over PVC foam. Behind this the boom was a roughly oval metal tube, with flat top and bottom plates for ease of construction. Tail surfaces were all straight edged; the tall, metal skinned fin had a slightly swept GRP leading edge and carried a tapered, fabric covered rudder. The MOMBA 2C had a T-tail, with a metal surfaced, high aspect ratio, tapered tailplane and a plywood surfaced elevator. There was a small, semi-recessed tailwheel below the fin.|$|E

More importantly, opposite optical activities-a polarization rotation of a few degrees and a circular dichroism (CD) of about 20 % at the photonic band edges-are observed for the left-and right-handed spirals. Furthermore, the transmittance of circularly polarized light obeys the Lorentz reciprocity lemma for forward and backward incidence.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{an approach}} for laser holographic patterning of three-dimensional photonic lattice structures using a single diffractive optical element. The diffractive optical element is fabricated by recording gratings in a photosensitive polymer using a two-beam interference method and has four diffraction gratings oriented with four-fold symmetry around a central opening. Four first-order diffracted beams from the gratings and one non-diffracted central beam overlap {{and form a}} threedimensional interference pattern. The phase of one <b>side</b> <b>beam</b> is delayed by inserting a thin piece of microscope glass slide into the beam. By rotating the glass slide, thus tuning the phase of the <b>side</b> <b>beam,</b> the five beam interference pattern changes from face-center tetragonal symmetry into diamond-like lattice symmetry with an optimal bandgap. Three-dimensional photonic crystal templates are produced in a photoresist and show the phase tuning effect for bandgap optimization. Furthermore, by integrating an amplitude mask in the central opening, line defects are produced within the photonic crystal template. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration on the holographic fabrication approach of three-dimensional photonic crystal templates with functional defects by a single laser exposure using a single optical element. © 2009 Optical Society of America...|$|E

The wide selection of reflective surface materials and interference angles allow control of the ratio of s- and p-polarizations, and intensity ratio of side-beam to central beam for interference lithography. Photonic bandgap simulations have also indicated that both s and p-polarized waves are sometimes needed in the reflected <b>side</b> <b>beams</b> for maximum photonic bandgap size and certain filling fractions of dielectric inside the photonic crystals.

40|$|One of {{the first}} steps to provide {{security}} for sensor networks is to pre-distribute cryptographic keys among sensor nodes for bootstrapping security. Each node can use stored keys to establish secure links with surrounding neighbors once deployed in the sensor field. Jamming attacks can force a network to perform different coping techniques to avoid jamming {{in order to continue}} data transmission tasks. Performing such techniques may cause change in secure connectivity of the network. In this paper, we study the impact of jamming attacks on secure connectivity (provided by different key predistribution schemes) when the network uses directional antennas to cope with jamming. Directional transmissions can perhaps create more links to nodes that are further away (within the beamforming direction). However, a node may also lose some links to nearby nodes that are not within the main beam or strong <b>side</b> <b>beam.</b> We investigate changes in secure connectivity (provided by different key predistribution schemes) when nodes transmit with directional antennas to cope with jamming attacks. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
