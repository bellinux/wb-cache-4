50|$|In 1871, Congress officially {{expanded}} <b>the</b> Coast <b>Surveys</b> {{responsibilities to}} include geodetic <b>surveys</b> in <b>the</b> {{interior of the}} country, {{and one of its}} first major projects in the interior was to <b>survey</b> <b>the</b> 39th Parallel across the entire country.

To reflect its acquisition of <b>the</b> mission of <b>surveying</b> <b>the</b> U.S. interior and the growing role of geodesy in its operations, <b>the</b> U.S. Coast <b>Survey</b> was renamed <b>the</b> United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) in 1878.|$|R

5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E

5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology.

5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> Giant, probably {{during the}} First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926.

5|$|In 1900, local clandestine {{treasure}} hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved {{onto the}} temple's walls. This discovery stirred {{the interest of}} Theodore Macridy, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated {{the properties of}} detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> existing state of knowledge, they found several areas that warranted further investigation.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons {{traded on the}} river, which was tidal up to this point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> Aire, and Samuel Shelton <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> Calder.
