Represented {{in the family}} <b>Schizopathidae</b> are: Bathypathes seculata spec. nov.; Umbellapathes gen. nov.; U. helioanthes spec. nov.; U. bipinnata spec. nov.; Dendrobathypathes boutillieri spec. nov.; D. fragilis spec. nov.; Dendropathes gen. nov.; Dendropathes bacotaylorae spec. nov.; and Lillipathes wingi spec. nov.

A phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} of the <b>Schizopathidae</b> (containing nine of the 11 currently-recognized genera) based on a concatenation of three non-contiguous mitochondrial segments that included 1933 sites for 13 taxa (outgroups: the cladopathids C. formosa and T. pseudotristicha). Node support: Bayesian posterior probabilities are listed before maximum likelihood bootstrap support values (based on 1000 replicates). For the MrBayes analysis, the average standard deviation of split frequencies at 20 million generations was 0. 000817...|$|E
40|$|The {{family of}} antipatharian corals, <b>Schizopathidae</b> (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Antipatharia), is revised. The family is {{characterized}} by polyps elongated {{in the direction of}} the axis and having a transverse diameter of 2 mm or more. Genera are recognized on the basis of morphological features of the corallum. Schizopathes Brook (type species: S. crassa Brook) has a simple, pinnate corallum with a hook-like holdfast for support in soft sediments. Bathypathes Brook (type species: B. patula Brook) {{is characterized by}} a simple pinnate corallum and a flat discoidal basal plate for attaching to a solid substrate. Parantipathes Brook (type species: Antipathes larix Esper) has a largely monopodial corallum with simple pinnules in six or more rows. Taxipathes Brook (type species: T. recta Brook) has a branched corallum and simple pinnules in four to eight rows. Lillipathes gen. nov. (type species: Antipathes lilliei Totton) has simple pinnules in four rows. Stauropathes gen. nov. (type species: S. staurocrada spec. nov.) is branched with simple, bilateral, subopposite pinnules. Abyssopathes gen. nov. (type species: Bathypathes lyra Brook) is monopodial with two rows of simple, lateral pinnules and one (sometimes multiple) row of simple or branched anterior pinnules. Dendrobathypathes gen. nov. (type species: D. grandis spec. nov.) has a branched, planar corallum with two rows of subpinnulated primary pinnules. Saropathes gen. nov. (type species: Bathypathes scoparia Totton) is monopodial to sparsely branched, with four rows of subpinnulated primary pinnules...|$|E
