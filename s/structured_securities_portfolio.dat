40|$|Abstract: The {{business}} environment {{is full of}} uncertainty. Allocating the wealth among var-ious asset classes may {{lower the risk of}} overall portfolio and increase the potential for more benefit over the long term. In this paper, we propose a mixed single-stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection model. Specifically, we present a bi-objective mixed-integer stochastic programming model. Moreover, we use semi-absolute deviation risk functions to measure the risk of mixed asset portfolio. Based on the idea of moments approx-imation method via linear programming, we propose a scenario generation approach for the mixed single-stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection problem. The bi-objective mixed-integer stochastic programming problem can be solved by transforming it into a single objective mixed-integer stochastic programming problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the behavior of the proposed mixed single stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} general-equilibrium impact of social <b>security</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversi cation into private securities, either through {{the trust fund}} or private accounts. The {{analysis}} depends critically on heterogeneities in saving, production, assets, and taxes. Limited diversication weakly increases interest rates, reduces the expected return on short-term investment (and the equity premium), decreases safe investment, increases risky investment, and increases a suitably weighted social welfare function. However, the effects on aggregate investment, long-term capital values, and the utility of young savers hinges on assumptions about technology. Aggregate investment and long-term asset values can move in opposite directions. (JEL H 55) Policy discussions of social <b>security</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversi cation into equities have concentrated on the consequences for retirement bene ts and the budget viability of the system, ignoring general-equilibrium repercussions (and some...|$|R

40|$|Using a model {{similar to}} Sharpe's, the author {{discusses}} {{the shape of}} the efficient frontier of <b>security</b> <b>portfolios</b> and the determination of an optimal investment policy. Sharpe shows that in equilibrium, the expected returns and standard deviations of all efficient <b>security</b> <b>portfolios</b> lie along a straight line. In this article, the author demonstrates that this conclusion depends on the assumptions that there exist both a risk-free asset and a single interest rate at which all investors can borrow or lend funds. If either assumption is removed, the expected returns and standard deviations of efficient portfolios will not be linearly related. The author suggests that in equilibrium, the efficient frontier is not unique for all investors, but that the efficient frontier will be different for investors with different borrowing rates. Furthermore, if no risk-less asset exists, a portfolio may exist which has both higher expected real return and lower risk than does a default-free security. ...|$|R
