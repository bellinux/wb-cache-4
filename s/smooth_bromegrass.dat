40|$|Utilization of warm-season grass {{pastures}} {{in combination}} with cool-season pastures can enhance efficiency of forage growth for livestock production. By establishing legumes in warm-season grass pastures, forage quality can be improved. A complex mixture of legumes was interseeded into existing warm-season grass pastures in western Iowa. Forage quality values indicated that warm-season grass/legume pastures had potential to enhance livestock production; however, actual animal gains did not reflect this improvement. Observations were made of {{a high number of}} cool-season grass species present in pastures (39 - 78 % of the total species composition). Due to an invasion of cool-season grass (<b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass,</b> Bromus inermis) into warm-season grass pastures, pasture communities and qualities were not consistent over years. Despite encroachment of cool-season grass into warm-season grass pastures, warm-season grass pasture communities can be improved with legumes with proper management.;Spatial patterns of specific legume species were identified across landscape positions. Western Iowa pastures exhibit a number of significant relationships between specific legume species and soil and landscape position. Relationships along landscape positions indicated grass growth concentrated on summit positions and legume growth on sideslope positions would aid in site-specific pasture management techniques. Thereby, site-specific management for particular species across landscape positions can reasonably be expected to reduce the seed, labor and fertilizer costs associated with establishing legumes in topographically variable environments.

40|$|Due to {{the need}} for more and higher quality pasture many farmers in the Great Plains have become {{interested}} in the management of cool season irrigated pastures the past few years. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> is included in many irrigated pasture mixtures because of its productivity and persistence under heavy grazing. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> is a leafy, rhizomatous, cool season grass native to Europe and Asia. It is adapted to the northern region of the United States with the major area of production being in the northwestern corn-belt. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> is one of the primary grasses grown in grass-legume mixtures and can be grown on a number of different types of soil. It is noted for its winter hardiness, drought resistance and palatability. Management practices {{such as the use of}} fertilizer, irrigation and rotational grazing systems have increased the productivity and quality of pastures. It is important to consider the morphological development of grasses to obtain maximum production from intensive management practices. Shoots of <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> are produced in cycles and are formed from basal buds which pass through vegetative and reproductive stages. As shoots change from the vegetative to the reproductive stage the shoot apices (growing points) move rapidly upward and are susceptible to destruction by cutting or grazing. New tillers will not begin to develop until the growing points of primary shoots are destroyed or reach maturity. Therefore, yields and regrowth can be affected markedly by harvest management practices. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> often experiences a summer dormancy period which is believed to be caused by the destruction of the growing points of the central meristems at a time when basal buds are not developing into new shoots. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of cutting frequency and cutting height on the yield and regrowth of well managed irrigated <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass.</b> Total yield, rate of regrowth, and summer dormancy were the main items of interest.

40|$|Bromegrass species (Bromus) {{can produce}} high forage yields under the short growing season of western Canada and have {{excellent}} nutritive value. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.) {{are the most}} commonly cultivated bromegrass species. Hybrid bromegrass (B. riparius X B. inermis) was developed in Canada by hybridizing smooth and meadow bromegrass. Regrowth potential differs among these three bromegrass species, but the morphological and physiological basis for these differences is unclear. Regrowth characteristics of three bromegrass species following defoliation to 5 cm at the vegetative and stem elongation stages of growth were studied {{in the field and}} greenhouse. Above-and below-ground dry matter production, leaf area index (LAI) development, individual leaf area expansion, leaf-to-stem ratio, photosynthetic rate, tiller and axillary bud development, etiolated regrowth, and nitrogen concentration in stem bases were evaluated. Regrowth was similar among the three species when defoliated at the vegetative stage. Meadow bromegrass consistently produced more (P¡Ü 0. 05) above-and below-ground dry matter than <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> following defoliation at the stem elongation stage, while that of hybrid bromegrass was generally intermediate to the other two species. Individual leaf photosynthetic rates did not differ among the three species. Individual leaf area expansion rate was faster (P¡Ü 0. 05) in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> than meadow and hybrid bromegrass. LAI of the three bromegrass species increased linearly with days of regrowth (r 2 ¡Ý 0. 88, P¡Ü 0. 05), and the increase was greatest in meadow bromegrass, intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and least in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> in all stages of defoliation. Similarly, the leaf-to-stem ratio was highest in meadow bromegrass, intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and lowest in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> following all defoliations. Defoliation at the vegetative stage had no effect (P¡Ý 0. 05) on tiller development relative to the undefoliated treatment, whereas tiller development was negatively affected by defoliation at the stem elongation stage. After 60 days of regrowth, final tiller density was greatest in meadow bromegrass, intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and least in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> in the field. A lower proportion of tillers in meadow bromegrass reached the reproductive stage compared to the other two species. The final tiller density following defoliation was similar among species in the greenhouse. Total buds tiller- 1 and elongated buds tiller- 1 were similar (P¡Ý 0. 05) among three species following defoliation at each growth stage; however, defoliation at stem elongation stage visually delayed bud development. Etiolated regrowth was greater in meadow and hybrid bromegrass (P¡Ü 0. 05) than <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> 10 days after defoliation, but was similar thereafter. Concentration of N in stem bases was similar among species, but decreased with advancing maturity. Rapid regrowth of meadow bromegrass appears to be associated with more tillers, rapid remobilization of organic reserves during early regrowth, and allocation of more biomass to leaf tissue than to stems compared to the other two bromegrasses. Variation in regrowth among the species was not associated with expansion of individual leaf area, photosynthetic rates, total organic reserve remobilization, or nitrogen concentration in stem bases.

40|$|Supplementing cattle {{on grass}} is an {{effective}} way of increasing animal efficiency and grass utilization. Distiller grains plus solubles (DGS) supplementation has been repeatedly proven as an effective supplement by providing ruminally undegradable protein (RUP), fat, and highly digestible fiber. The effects of monensin supplementation on grazing cattle are variable. Although some research has shown a decrease in forage organic matter intake (FOMI), the popular belief is monensin increases ADG while maintaining DMI in a grazing situation. Two experiments were designed to observe the effects of DGS and monensin supplementation on cattle grazing <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass.</b> In the first study, ADG and modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) intake were measured for cattle grazing <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass.</b> Steers were supplemented MDGS at 0. 05, 0. 4, 0. 6, or 0. 8 % BW and were either given 0 or 200 mg monensin. In the second study, FOMI was estimated when cattle grazing <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> were supplemented with MDGS at 0. 4 % BW was given 0 or 200 mg monensin. In the first study, monensin did not affect ADG (P = 0. 53). There was a monensin x MDGS intake interaction (P = 0. 05). Monensin decreased MDGS consumption only when supplement was offered at 0. 8 % BW (P = 0. 01). In the second study, monensin tended to decrease FOMI by 9 % (P = 0. 10). Advisor: Terry J.

40|$|Successful {{grass seed}} {{production}} depends on identifying a suitable {{environment for the}} species and proper agronomic practices. Previous research on many species has addressed identifying appropriate agronomic practices for grass seed production, but these studies have not evaluated the effects of environment. By conducting the same experiments in Jiuquan, China (a desert climate) and Tongliao, China (a semiarid continental monsoon climate), the effects of environment, seeding rate, row spacing and their interactions were determined for <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus inermis Leyss) seed production. Three seeding rates (. 3,. 5, and. 7  g m− 1 pure live seed) and four row spacings (30, 50, 70, and 90  cm) were evaluated over three years. Jiuquan had comparable seed yield (SY) and greater thousand-seed weight (TSW) than Tongliao. Three-year average SY decreased with increased row spacings at both sites. Results suggest that in both climates, successful <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> seed production was possible, but greater TSW is predicted for desert climates with good irrigation conditions than in semiarid continental monsoon climates due to greater sunshine duration (574  h compared with 527  h) and low relative humidity during seed development (48 % vs. 66 %). A seeding rate of. 3  g m− 1 and a row spacing of no wider than 30  cm appears to be adequate for <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> seed production in these research locations and in similar ecological regions around the world...|$|E
40|$|A 4 yr {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the mineral element concentration of <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> and mixed warm-season grasses. Liver biopsies were used during production cycles to determine trace element status. Ruminally fistulated cows were used to determine diet selection and estimate in situ mineral disappearance of clipped grass. Mineral elemental concentrations in warm season grass did not change with maturity. Copper and Fe concentrations were higher in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> leaves than stems. Increased maturity decreased in situ disappearance for Zn and Cu in <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> and warm season grass. Cows did not select a diet different in trace element concentration than clipped samples. Results indicate <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> and warm-season grass at this location can maintain trace element status of the beef cow in the absence of trace element supplementation. ^ Two studies were conducted to compare elemental concentrations in the liver biopsy specimen with the same site removed at death of the animal. Five beef cows were liver biopsied and slaughtered, liver recovered, and cut into 20 sections. An area within 8 cm caudal and cranial to the portal vein was different for Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Mg, and Ca than the remainder of the liver. Liver biopsy mineral element concentrations were lower than whole liver concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, Mg, and P, and greater for Fe, Ca, and Na. Eight lambs were liver biopsied and euthanized by lethal injection or a simulated slaughter within 10 min. No difference was detected between the biopsy and the biopsy site post-slaughter, and Mg and P were higher in the biopsy of necropsy lambs. ^ In beef heifers with chronic indwelling catheters, portal Cu concentrations were greater for heifers fed 200 mg CuSO 4 than 400 mg CuSO 4 and arterial Cu concentrations were greater than 200 mg Cu-proteinate. More of the 400 mg of Cu from CuSO 4 was absorbed than 200 mg Cu from Cu-proteinate, and slightly more of the Cu-proteinate was absorbed than same level of CuSO 4.

40|$|Performance of {{livestock}} grazing warm-season, perennial grasses is generally greater {{than would be}} expected given their relatively low protein concentrations. Two experiments were conducted to assess ruminal escape protein using an in situ rumen technique for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus inennis Leyss.). Whole-plant, leaf, and stem samples were harvested at specific stages of maturity in 1987. Duplicate samples of each grass were incubated for 12 h in situ. Escape protein values were expressed as concentration [grams escape protein per kilogram dry matter (DM) adjusted for acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) ] and {{as a percentage of}} total plant protein concentration (grams protein per kilogram DM adjusted for ADIN) to characterize protein composition. Whole-plant escape protein concentration was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in switchgrass (31. 8 g kg- 1 DM) than <b>smooth</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (22. 3 g kg- 1 DM), averaged across all growth stages, and generally declined with maturity in both species. Escape protein concentration was consistently greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in leaves (50. 8 g kg- 1 DM) than in stems (193 g kg- 1 DM) averaged over species and growth stages.
