5|$|The first {{hydropower}} plant {{was built in}} 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and produced 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants. Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW plant on the Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum <b>smelting</b> <b>plant</b> that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E

25|$|Since polluting {{nations were}} to be held {{responsible}} for harms caused to another nation's environment, this was not applicable in the arbitration because the players involved were sub-groups of each nation's population and the populus that was most affected were not the sovereign states but the sub-groups. Although Canada accepted responsibility for the actions of the <b>smelting</b> <b>plant,</b> conflict resolution put the onus on Canada to compensate for COMINCO's past pollution rather than forcing COMINCO to prevent future harm to U.S. soil. The legacy of this decision includes the eventual creation of regulatory regimes to prevent environmental degradation, which allow nations to put states in charge of taking positive steps to control pollution. The failure by states to meet these responsibilities means they are breaching international law.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium <b>smelting</b> <b>plant</b> on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the <b>smelting</b> <b>plant</b> attempted to run using national grid electricity, and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a strip mill. The industrial activity had involved an area of hardstanding covering almost , which then was used for screening coal from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for coal screening, and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|E

He and fellow mutant Caliban live in an abandoned <b>smelting</b> <b>plant</b> across the border in Mexico, where they care for a senile Charles Xavier, who had inadvertently killed several of his X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier. He is tasked by Gabriela, a nurse for Transigen, to escort an 11-year-old girl, Laura, to a place in North Dakota called [...] "Eden." [...] Logan, Charles, and Laura escape the Transigen hunters called the [...] "Reavers," [...] and discover that Laura is Logan's [...] "daughter", as she was bred with his DNA. After accepting shelter from a family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by X-24, a perfect clone of Logan. Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, which is a safe haven run by Rictor and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian border and entrusts Laura to them before departing on his own. However, when the children are located and captured by the Reavers, Logan uses a mutant serum given to him by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He then plows through the Reavers, but the serum quickly wears off before he meets Zander Rice, the head of the Transigen project, who sought to avenge his father's death during the Weapon X program by creating the virus. Logan kills Rice and confronts X-24. However, with his healing factor now gone, Logan is no match for X-24, who impales him through a tree. Laura shoots X-24 in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years, destroying his brain and half his skull. After Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, Laura and the children bury him before continuing their journey across the border. As they all leave, Laura returns to Logan's grave, removes the cross, and places it on its side to create an [...] "X" [...] to honor Logan as the last of the X-Men.|$|E

Benthic metal fluxes were evaluated using incubation chambers under dark conditions, and by further examining key variables (O 2, CO 2, redox potential and pH) affecting metal release and sequestration processes.
