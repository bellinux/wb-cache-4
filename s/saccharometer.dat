25|$|About {{two weeks}} after the Epsom, Lord Clifden {{travelled}} to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, which was run over 3,000 metres and worth 100,000 francs. It was a cloudy day in Paris and there was a large crowd, including the Emperor and Empress, King Fernando of Portugal and the Prince of Orange. La Toucques, who had won the Oaks and Derby at Chantilly, was the 2/1 favourite, with Lord Clifden starting as the second favourite at 7/2. Unlike in the Derby, the horses got away to a good start on the first attempt. Lord Clifden was settled {{at the rear of the}} field by jockey Tom Chaloner. Both La Toucques and Lord Clifden made progress though the pack together and when the field turned into the finishing straight the pair were vying for the lead along with The Ranger and <b>Saccharometer.</b> However, Lord Clifden was the first one to fade and the finish was fought out between La Toucques and The Ranger. The Ranger won the race by one length from La Toucques, who was two lengths in front of <b>Saccharometer.</b> Lord Clifden finished in fifth place, seven lengths behind the winner.|$|E
25|$|Macaroni {{began his}} season at Newmarket in April {{when he won}} a one-mile stakes race by three lengths. Although the event was not {{particularly}} important, it proved that the colt went well on the course and coped well with the unusually hard ground. Two weeks later over the same course and distance he started at odds of 10/1 against eight opponents for the 2000 Guineas, for which the favourite was the French colt Hospodar. Ridden by Tom Chaloner, he won by half a length from <b>Saccharometer.</b> The defeat of the French horse, who finished unplaced, and the popularity of Macaroni's owner, led to his win being warmly received by the Newmarket crowd.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 1863, Lord Clifden faced 30 {{rivals in}} the Derby Stakes at Epsom Downs. Ridden again by George Fordham, {{he started the}} race as the 4/1 favourite. Also {{near the front of}} the betting were Hospender and Gellie at 9/1 and Macaroni and <b>Saccharometer</b> at 10/1. There was a delay to the start of almost one hour after the horses were fifteen minutes late going to post and then there were over thirty false starts. When they finally got under way, Lord Clifden was {{positioned}} in about tenth place by Fordham, as Bright Cloud led the field. With one mile still to run Bright Cloud faded and left Donnybrook and Lord Clifden in the lead. The Cloud was in third place until the six-furlong pole, where he swerved and brought down <b>Saccharometer.</b> The incident also caused King of the Vale to unseat his rider and almost brought down Fantastic. As the horses rounded Tattenham Corner, Lord Clifden had a slight lead over Donnybrook, with Tom Fool lying in third. As then entered the finishing straight Donnybrook and Lord Clifden's nearest challengers were Tom Fool and Macaroni. Inside the final furlong Macaroni closed down the leader and with Lord Clifden stumbling in the last stride got the better and won by a short-head. Rapid Rhone finished in third place, half a length behind Macaroni and Lord Clifden. After the race many people thought that the race was either a dead heat or that Lord Clifden had won. The following day Lord Clifden turned out for the Great Surrey Foal Stakes, where his only rival was the French horse Jarnicoton. Lord Clifden led until the final furlong, where he was challenged. The pair raced side by side, but Jarnicoton's stirrup broke and Lord Clifden won by a head.|$|E
50|$|He was the {{inventor}} of the <b>saccharometer.</b> Furthermore, he gave silicon its current name.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>saccharometer</b> is a {{hydrometer}} {{used for}} determining the amount of sugar in a solution, invented by Thomas Thomson. It is used primarily by winemakers and brewers, and {{it can also be}} used in making sorbets and ice-creams. The first brewers' <b>saccharometer</b> was constructed by Benjamin Martin (with distillation in mind), and initially used for brewing by James Baverstock Sr in 1770. [...] Henry Thrale adopted its use and it was later popularized by John Richardson in 1784.|$|E
50|$|Hydrometers are {{calibrated}} {{for different}} uses, {{such as a}} lactometer for measuring the density (creaminess) of milk, a <b>saccharometer</b> for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid, or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of alcohol in spirits.|$|E
50|$|The first Professor was Thomas Thomson, {{inventor}} of the <b>saccharometer</b> and discoverer of Thomsonite. He was succeeded by Thomas Anderson, who assisted Joseph Lister, Regius Professor of Surgery, with his work on antisepsis, and who discovered pyridine. The Chair was later held by Nobel laureate Sir Derek Barton.|$|E
5000|$|Historically gravity was {{measured}} and recorded in brewer's pounds (also known as just [...] "pounds"). If a wort {{was said to}} be [...] "26 lbs. gravity per barrel" [...] it meant that a standard barrel of 36 imperial gallons of the wort weighted 26 pounds more than a barrel of pure water. The actual measurement was by <b>saccharometer</b> (ie hydrometer) correcting for temperature by a calibration scale or else by a special brewers sliding rule.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was born}} at Kelheim on the Danube, in Bavaria, on 5 January 1803. He was {{appointed}} professor of technology at the University of Munich in 1851, and in 1868 became professor of applied chemistry at the Technical University Munich. His scientific researches into the chemistry of fermentation are of importance; a <b>saccharometer</b> invented by him in 1842 serves for {{the determination of the}} percentages of the contents of wort. He died at Munich, 28 August 1871.|$|E

50|$|Thomson {{dabbled in}} publishing, {{acted as a}} {{consultant}} to the Scottish excise board, invented the instrument known as Allan's <b>saccharometer,</b> and opposed the geological theories of James Hutton, founding the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh as a platform in 1808. In Mar 1811 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1815 was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1813 he founded Annals of Philosophy a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.|$|E

50|$|During {{the primary}} fermentation, the yeast cells {{feed on the}} sugars in the must and multiply, {{producing}} carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. The temperature during the fermentation affects both {{the taste of the}} end product, as well as the speed of the fermentation. For red wines, the temperature is typically 22 to 25 °C, and for white wines 15 to 18 °C.For every gram of sugar that is converted, about half a gram of alcohol is produced, so to achieve a 12% alcohol concentration, the must should contain about 24% sugars. The sugar percentage of the must is calculated from the measured density, the must weight, {{with the help of a}} specialized type of hydrometer called a <b>saccharometer.</b> If the sugar content of the grapes is too low to obtain the desired alcohol percentage, sugar can be added (chaptalization). In commercial winemaking, chaptalization is subject to local regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Lloyd's {{scientific}} {{impact was}} based on her pioneering studies of sugars in sugar beets, using analytical techniques such as the <b>saccharometer.</b> Lloyd's studies made use of test plots of sugar beets {{in various parts of}} Nebraska. Her scientific reports on sugar production in sugar beets first appeared in 1890, helping establish the economic viability of sugar beet farming {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, critical to Nebraska farmers.Following the passage of the Hatch Act of 1887, the University of Nebraska was awarded a grant of $15,000 to create the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station.Lloyd rose to full professor in 1888 and continued to teach until 1894, when she resigned due to ill health. After her death, Acting Chancellor Charles E. Bessey said in a memorial lecture at the University of Nebraska, ″She was not only an eminent chemist, she was a great teacher, and more than that, she was the beloved advisor and counselor of students.″ [...] She lived in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area for the last seven years of her life, to be closer to friends and relatives.|$|E
40|$|Effect of raw and biologically treated {{lignocellulosic}} biomass using {{cow dung}} slurry for biogas production is reported. Biomass is an energy source. Water containing biomass such as sewage sludge, cow dung slurry and lignocellulosic waste, has several important advantages {{and one of}} the key feature is renewability. Cow dung slurry has the potential to produce large amounts of biogas. Four categories of bacteria viz., hydrolytic, fermentative, fermentative acidogenic and acidogenic-methanogenic bacteria are involved in the production of biogas. The different characteristics of the cow dung slurry were determined according to standard methods. Hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin content of the lignocellulosic waste were also determined in our earlier studies. The substrates were digested under anaerobic condition for 5 days. The total biogas and methane produced during anaerobic digestion were estimated on 5 th day. The total biogas produced during digestion was estimated by water displacement method. Biological methane production was estimated by using <b>Saccharometer.</b> DOI: [URL] International Journal of Environment Vol. 4 (2) 2015 : 341 - 347 </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the British beer-brewing industry around 1800 {{as a case}} study exploring current themes in the history of science and technology: the imposition of reliable standards, the use of instruments and quantities, and the nature of industrial growth. I begin by addressing Michael Combrune, author of the first thermometric brewing account, showing the influence of Boerhaavian fermentation theory and the eighteenth-century agenda for "commercial chemistry" on his work: Combrune's fellow brewers, however, did not generally rely on the chemical scheme of management he had established, developing instead highly localised thermometric operations which did not challenge established understandings. Next, I consider the determination of beer strength, focusing here on the brewer John Richardson's innovation of the <b>saccharometer,</b> a gravimetric philosophical instrument. I show how Richardson presented both the device and the quantity in which it was scaled, later termed the `brewer's pound, ' as offering brewery-specific advantages, in order to ensure its acceptance whilst at the same time denying its roots in the disputatious field of spirits hydrometry. Richardson did not achieve his wider goal of monopolist control over the device, but his project of saccharometric determination was widely taken up, contributing to a significant change in the composition of beer, as brewers moved from using traditional brown- malts to the saccharometrically preferable pales. This development is then reviewed {{in the context of an}} analysis of the identity of London porter, the staple brown beer of London: I investigate the relationship of porter's identity to the uniquely vast and industrialised plants which produced it. Finally, I highlight the ambiguous nature of appeals to `science' or `chemistry' before 1830 by discussing the widespread contemporary panic over adulteration, popularly assumed to be practised by those who associated with chemists and did not pursue a `traditional' approach to brewing. This controversy was settled, I contend, only with the later development of a common laboratory-analytical context between brewers, pharmacists and public analysts who were able to redefine the concept of adulteration itself.
