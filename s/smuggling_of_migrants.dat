5000|$|In {{the waters}} of Deception Pass, {{just east of the}} present-day Deception Pass Bridge, is a small island known as Ben Ure Island. The island became infamous for its {{activity}} <b>of</b> human <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> Chinese people for local labor. Ben Ure and his partner Lawrence [...] "Pirate" [...] Kelly were quite profitable at their human smuggling business and played hide-and-seek with the United States Customs Department for years. Ure's own operation at Deception Pass in the late 1880s consisted of Ure and his Native-American wife. Local tradition has it that his wife would camp on the nearby Strawberry Island (which was visible from the open sea) and signal him with a fire on the island's summit to alert him to {{whether or not it was}} safe to attempt to bring the human cargo he illegally transported ashore. For transport, Ure would tie the people up in burlap bags so that if customs agents were to approach he could easily toss the people in bags overboard. The tidal currents would carry the entrapped drowned migrants' bodies to San Juan Island to the north and west of the pass and many ended up in what became known as Dead Man's Bay.|$|R

40|$|Migrant {{smuggling}} is a dangerous, sometimes deadly, criminal activity.

Introduced in the Canadian House of Commons in June 2011, the Preventing Human Smugglers from Abusing Canada’s Immigration System Act (Bill C- 4) includes proposed amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would enhance the existing offence <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> <b>smuggling,</b> modify the general detention provisions for foreign nationals on arrival in Canada on grounds of serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality, and require mandatory detention for groups <b>of</b> <b>smuggled</b> <b>migrants.</b> This article analyzes Bill C- 4 and proposes amendments to it that would provide a more balanced response to migrant smuggling. The article concludes by arguing that a comprehensive approach to addressing migrant smuggling ultimately requires three primary strategies be pursued together at the national and international levels: (1) national jurisdictions must take greater action to discourage illegal migration and disrupt migrant smuggling operations and through international cooperation; (2) national jurisdictions must establish more efficient refugee-determination processes and expedient procedures to remove failed claimants; and, (3) {{as part of the}} solution, the international community should continue to develop a proactive response to the global refugee situation. </p...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{inherent}} bias in studies of ‘mobility regimes’ toward {{the perspective of the}} authorities. This article suggests the concept of ‘subversive mobilities’ to offer a novel perspective on the construct of mobilities regimes, by stressing the ways such regimes are penetrated by adversaries through diverse routes and practices, despite the regimes’ various control and defense mechanisms. We investigate how ‘smugglers’ make use of weaknesses in existing mobility regimes to facilitate their subversion, using three case studies <b>of</b> subversive mobilities, <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> Rohingya <b>migrants,</b> <b>of</b> Colombian cocaine and of South African rhino horns, to substantiate the potential of our approach. The subversive mobilities of all three case studies reveal some common traits: a multiplicity of routes and means of travel, informal personal networks based on trust and retribution rather than formal organization, and interconnected series of assemblages of differently involved actors. We claim that the continued success of ‘smugglers’ to subvert the existing mobility regimes is their greater flexibility: they tend to be pro-active, initiating new routes and means of movement, and the cooperation of illicit and legitimate role-bearers, while the mobility regimes are mostly reactive, giving the former at least a temporary advantage over the latter. Our approach leads to a more inclusive and dynamic view of mobilities regimes, and enables a better understanding of why the ‘smuggling’ of goods and ‘trafficking’ in people is increasingly successful, despite the efforts of mobilities regimes to block these activities...|$|R

The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combating human trafficking. The Government also created a Prosecutorial Task Force to investigate and prosecute human trafficking and the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> unaccompanied <b>migrant</b> youth. In addition, the Government created the Directorate of Childhood, Adolescence, and Family (DINAF) to better monitor children’s rights and implement national plans concerning children and their families. However, children in Honduras are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation {{as a result of}} human trafficking. The Government’s procedures for enforcement of child labor laws do not sufficiently deter employers from using child labor, and both labor inspectors and criminal investigators lack the resources they need to effectively carry out their mandates.

40|$|The {{development}} of stowaway and illegal migrant problems worldwide {{is believed to}} induce public resentments because of its negative impact on social order and the financial burden it imposes on {{the public and private}} sectors.

30|$|The {{distinction}} between regular and irregular moves is blurred, as migrants use both channels {{in the course}} of migration. Some legally registered agents are also involved in undocumented migration, as this study reveals. A recent assessment of undocumented migration from the Horn of Africa to South Africa shows that Ethiopia and Somali, but also Kenya, are the major source countries, with two-thirds of the estimated flows <b>of</b> <b>smuggled</b> <b>migrants</b> originating from Ethiopia (Horwood, 2009). The departure <b>of</b> skilled <b>migrants</b> to Western countries and other emerging economies in Africa is also on the rise. While studies on female labour migration to Arab countries shed some light on the plights of domestic workers and their vulnerability to various forms of abuse and exploitation, the patterns and determinants of southward migration to South Africa are little understood and will be addressed in comparison with Gondar, one of the most notable migrant-sending areas, since the late 1970 s in this paper. This is the first paper attempting to make a comparative analysis, using migration and remittance data from different migrant-sending areas in Ethiopia.|$|R
40|$|Migrant {{smuggling}} is a dangerous, sometimes deadly, {{criminal activity}} which cannot be rationalized, justified, or excused. From both a {{supply and demand}} side, failing to respond effectively to migrant smuggling and deter it will risk emboldening those who engage in this illicit enterprise, which generates proceeds for organized crime and criminal networks, funds terrorism and facilitates clandestine terrorist travel; endangers the lives and safety <b>of</b> <b>smuggled</b> <b>migrants,</b> undermines border security, with consequences for the Canada/U. S. border, and undermines the integrity and fairness of Canada’s mmigration system. Introduced in Parliament in June, 2011, the Preventing Human Smugglers from Abusing Canada’s Immigration System Act (Bill C- 4) includes amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) that would: 1. Enhance the existing offence <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> <b>smuggling,</b> in terms <b>of</b> {{the elements of the}} offence, the penalties available, and recognized aggravating factors; 2. Modify the general provisions of the IRPA to provide for detention of foreign nationals on arrival in Canada on grounds of serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality; and 3. Create a separate legislative scheme for groups <b>of</b> <b>smuggled</b> <b>migrants</b> who arrive in Canada that relates to detention, release, and timing to apply for various forms of immigration status. This paper supports Bill C- 4, but with two necessary amendments, namely: 1. Initial review of detention of designated foreign nationals should take place within 48 hours of detention, with further reviews every three or six months thereafter, in order to comply with binding Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence; and 2. An exemption for designated foreign nationals who are minors (persons under 18 years of age) from the detention provisions of Bill C- 4, which would instead subject them to the general rules related to detention of foreign nationals who are minors. These changes would provide Bill C- 4 with a more balanced response to migrant smuggling. Bill C- 4 is just part of the overall action being taken by the Government of Canada to address migrant smuggling. A comprehensive approach to addressing migrant smuggling ultimately requires three primary strategies pursued together at the national and international levels: 1. National jurisdictions must take greater action to discourage illegal migration and disrupt migrant smuggling operations through legislation like Bill C- 4 and through international cooperation; 2. National jurisdictions must establish more efficient refugee-determination processes and expedient procedures to remove failed claimants; and, 3.

50|$|The Crimes Amendment Act 2002 added Sections 98C and 98D to the Crimes Act 1961 which {{prohibit}} the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> unauthorized <b>migrants</b> for material benefit, and the trafficking of persons by coercion or deception. As {{a crime against}} humanity, the penalties are comparable to rape and murder, with a maximum of 20 years imprisonment or $500,000 fine, or both. In accordance with the government’s “victim centred approach", human trafficking may be established even if the victim acted voluntarily. Several aggravating factors are provided to allow for appropriate sentencing. All proceedings under these provisions require consent of the Attorney-General, and a claim may be filed even if the victim(s) did not actually enter New Zealand. The New Zealand Courts have extraterritorial jurisdiction over the crime of human trafficking and may prosecute New Zealand citizens who commit the offence on foreign territory. To date, no convictions have been recorded {{and it has been}} suggested that the lack of prosecutions and investigations is due to the high evidentiary bar of the current law. In August 2014, Immigration New Zealand charged three individuals with human trafficking, who have pleaded not guilty to arranging by deception the trafficking of 18 Indian nationals into forced labour in 2008-2009. The case has been referred to the High Court, and is pending trial in late 2015 to early 2016. In 2014, the Organised Crime and Anti-corruption Legislation Bill was introduced to Parliament.
