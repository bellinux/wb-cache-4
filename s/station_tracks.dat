5|$|North of the <b>station,</b> <b>tracks</b> 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the <b>station,</b> <b>tracks</b> 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{important}} for transport along the coast until 1944, when {{the completion of the}} Sørland Line made Flekkefjord a branch station. At the same time, the line was converted to standard gauge, the number of <b>station</b> <b>tracks</b> was reduced, and the station received an overhaul. The station building was demolished in 1970, but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990. The tracks and depot buildings still exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{building}} additional tracks for suburban service between Gdańsk and Sopot {{were taken in}} 1912. <b>Station</b> <b>tracks</b> were modified, and buildings were torn down on the planned route. The project was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

25|$|All <b>station</b> <b>tracks</b> are {{powered by}} 12 kV {{overhead}} wire. Tracks 5–21 also have 750 V DC third rail. Due {{to the lack}} of proper ventilation in the tunnels and station, only electric locomotives and dual-mode locomotives are scheduled to enter Penn Station. Diesel-only NJT trains terminate at Hoboken Terminal or Newark Penn Station, and diesel-only LIRR trains terminate at or prior to Long Island City.|$|E

The main building itself was completed in 1908. Of its 32 <b>station</b> <b>tracks,</b> 20 enter from the northeast and terminate at the station's headhouse. The remaining 12 tracks enter below ground level from the south via a 4,033-foot twin-tube tunnel passing under Capitol Hill and a 898-foot long subway under Massachusetts Avenue which allow through traffic {{direct access to the}} rail networks both north and south of the city.|$|E

500|$|Lynn (signed as Central Square - Lynn) is a {{passenger}} rail {{station on the}} MBTA Commuter Rail Newburyport/Rockport Line in downtown Lynn, Massachusetts, located 11.5 route miles from North Station. [...] The station consists of a single center island platform serving the two <b>station</b> <b>tracks</b> on an elevated grade {{that runs through the}} downtown area of Lynn. A large parking garage is integrated into the station structure. The present station, built in 1992, {{is the latest in a}} series of depots built on approximately the same Central Square site since 1838. A number of other stations have also been located on several different rail lines in Lynn.|$|E
