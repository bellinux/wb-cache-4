5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 2011, astronomers, {{using data}} from NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{announced}} the first partial-eclipse-based discovery of a circumbinary planet. The planet, called Kepler-16b, is about 200 light years from Earth, in the constellation Cygnus, and {{is believed to be}} a frozen world of rock and gas, about the mass of Saturn. It orbits two stars that are also circling each other, one about two-thirds the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sun, the other about a fifth the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sun. Each orbit of the stars by the planet takes 229 days, while the planet orbits the system's center of mass every 225 days; the stars eclipse each other every three weeks or so.|$|E
25|$|NGC 3982 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy {{that spans}} about 30,000 light-years, {{about one-third of}} the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Milky Way galaxy.

It harbors a supermassive black hole at its core and has massive regions of star formation in the bright blue knots in the spiral arms. Supernovae are likely to be found within these regions.|$|E

They've earned the right to keep reinventing themselves". In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau praised the vocal interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, stating that the band [...] "emerges as a diary of adulthood in all its encroaching intricacy". Sara Sherr of The Village Voice gave high marks to Tucker's vibrato, describing it as [...] "a human teardrop [...] The one that hits you and feels like a kiss".|$|E

The song [...] "Banned from the End of the World" [...] deals with the Y2K crisis and an uncertain future, while [...] "God Is a Number" [...] alludes {{to the impact of}} technology in society. The single [...] "Get Up" [...] features lead guitar lines by Brownstein and staccato riffs by Tucker. For Tucker, the song reflects the album's thematic structure: [...] "It's more metaphorical and spiritual [...] It's not about one concrete thing; it's about searching for meaning and maybe finding it an unexpected place". The tracks [...] "The <b>Size</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Love" [...] and [...] "Memorize Your Lines" [...] feature violin lines by Seth Warren of Red Stars Theory. The Village Voice described the former song, a ballad about two lovers in trouble, as [...] "the saddest of the sad".

2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like this a long time ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} {{between our two}} proposed schemes is in the step size by which the access probability changes adaptively.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{deterministic}} number theoretic construction for matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Furthermore, {{we show that}} the number theoretic properties <b>of</b> <b>our</b> RIP matrices allow their products with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrices to be well approximated via a few highly sparse matrix multiplications. Hence, our RIP matrices may be approximately multiplied by the DFT of any input vector in sublinear-time by reading {{only a small fraction}} of its entries. As a consequence, we obtain small deterministic sample sets which are guaranteed to allow the recovery of near-optimal sparse Fourier representations for all periodic functions having an integrable second derivative over a single period. Explicit bounds are provided for the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> RIP matrices, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> their associated sublinear Fourier sampling sets, and the errors incurred by quickly approximating their products with DFT matrices.
