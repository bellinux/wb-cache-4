5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|With its hairless leaves, P. daurica, {{does not}} seem te be adapted to a typical Mediterranean climate, but to rather more humid {{circumstances}} in summer. The population on Mount Orjen grows in forest consisting of <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> European beech, Turkish hazel, the maple species Acer pseudoplatanus and A. intermedium, and ash, and is further accompanied by widespread species such as European spindle, mountain cherry, drooping bittercress, Turk's cap lily, but also with endemics such as the Orjen iris.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecology of}} the area can be {{understood}} by following a west-to-east line {{at the southern end}} of the North Cascades, at approximately 47.5 degrees north. As the line passes through the Cascade range, it passes through a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees: western hemlock, Pacific <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> subalpine mountain hemlock, alpine, subalpine fir, and grand fir/Douglas fir.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve is}} located in the Bieszczady Mountains on the border with Slovakia and Ukraine. There are four {{distinct}} altitude-dependant vegetation ecosystems in the mountains starting with beech forest (Fagetum sylvaticae), followed by mixed forests of beech and <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba), forested areas of green alder (Alnetum viridis), and finally a belt of treeless poloniny, a subalpine meadows dominated by grasses. Over 100 species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (Ciconia nigra) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is deciduous oak forest: both sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur), with European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and hazels in {{the coolest}} and deepest soil {{at the bottom}} of the valley. The mountain layer is characterised by the presence of beeches and at times, in the Pyrenees, by <b>silver</b> <b>firs</b> (Abies alba); these beeches and <b>silver</b> <b>firs</b> occupy the cool slopes with shallow soil. The Mediterranean influence is felt in the presence of Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) with bay laurel, which are situated on the warmest crests and slopes, especially above chalky soil, where the dryness becomes more pronounced.|$|R

25|$|In {{late summer}} (July-September) the fully {{developed}} nymphs {{emerge from the}} galls and crawl out onto the needles, where they molt and develop wings. These adult adelgids may fly to other susceptible conifers, such as larch (Larix), pine (Pinus) and <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba) or may continue the cycle on the same tree, as some are poor flyers. Several generations are raised on these secondary hosts, however no galls are formed. In July of the following year winged adelgid appear and fly to the spruces to breed there again, completing the life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} cover 70% of the park's territory. The lowest zones (800–1500m) are {{occupied with}} beech forests consisting primarily of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), riparian deciduous forests dominated by grey alder (Alnus incana) and mixed forests of beech, common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia).
