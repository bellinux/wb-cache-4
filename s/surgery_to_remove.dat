5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E
50|$|Robert's father, Bruce, {{was unable}} to work for two years due to a car {{accident}} that occurred while Robert was a child. He filed for bankruptcy twice: in 1999 and 2003.

5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E

5000|$|Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845-1916) {{became the}} strongest {{supporter}} {{of the idea of}} colon cleansing; he thought that toxins could shorten the lifespan. Over time, the concept broadened to [...] "auto-intoxication", which supposes that the body cannot fully dispose of its waste products and toxins, which then accumulate in the intestine. In some cases, the concept led <b>to</b> radical <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the colon for unrelated symptoms.|$|R
50|$|His health {{problems}} got {{worse in the}} 1979 season, when, on the team plane coming home from a road trip, Benirschke collapsed. He underwent two <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> his large intestine {{and he was in}} the intensive care unit for weeks. When released from the hospital, he weighed only 123 pounds and had to adjust to life with two ostomy appliances. His ileostomy was eventually reversed in a Koch pouch procedure.|$|R
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Stansfield {{underwent}} <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{part of his}} colon.

His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died on 10 August in Exeter, with his death being announced shortly after Exeter's loss to Ipswich Town in the League Cup.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was injured}} while {{present at the}} W.I.P nightclub in the SoHo {{district}} of New York City when a brawl broke out between entertainers Chris Brown and Drake. Parker filed a $20 million suit against the night club.

50|$|Demsey {{played on}} the PGA Tour in 1997, {{when he made the}} cut in only nine of 27 events as a rookie. Back {{injuries}} slowed his career on the Nationwide Tour, but the real jolt came in 2002 when he felt constant pressure in his left sinus. At the end of the year, doctors found a tumor, a fifth nerve schwannoma, behind his left sinus going into his brain. He has had two <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the tumor.|$|R

5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, eat, or drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. <b>Surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach had <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of 2007 to 2010, there were two {{fatalities}} in mixed martial arts matches. The first was the death of Sam Vasquez on November 30, 2007. Vasquez collapsed shortly after being knocked out by Vince Libardi {{in the third round}} of an October 20, 2007 fight at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Vasquez had two separate <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> blood clots from his brain, and shortly after the second operation suffered a devastating stroke and never regained consciousness.|$|R
25|$|Barker {{said in a}} December 2008 online {{interview}} (published in March 2009) that he had polyps in {{his throat}} which were so severe that a doctor {{told him he was}} taking in ten percent of the air he {{was supposed to have been}} getting. He has had two <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior <b>to</b> the <b>surgeries.</b> He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.|$|R
50|$|By May 1947, Taniguchi {{could finally}} sit up, and on March 20, 1949, he was {{discharged}} from the Omura hospital. However, his wounds were not treated properly until 1960, and continue to cause him great physical discomfort to this day. The improper burn healing {{and to some degree}} possibly the delayed stochastic effects of radiation exposure during and after the bombings manifested in the growth of numerous burn keloid tumors. As of 2007, Taniguchi had undergone ten <b>surgeries</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> benign growths.|$|R
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E
5|$|From 1976 to 1980, {{he was one}} of {{the premier}} {{pitchers}} in the majors, leading the National League twice in strikeouts, once in earned run average, and three times in hits allowed per nine innings, winning at least 18games between 1976 and 1979. On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a stroke and collapsed while playing a game of catch before an Astros game, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> a life-threatening blood clot in his neck. His condition brought a sudden end to his major league career at the age of 30. His 313strikeouts in 1979 remains an Astros franchise record, and he held the team's record for career strikeouts (1,493) until 1987. Two-time National League MVPs Johnny Bench and Dale Murphy both named Richard as the toughest pitcher they ever faced.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013 Perry had a mole removed {{that turned}} out to be melanoma.

In a lengthy blog post in June, Perry wrote that he fell in love with psychologist and breast cancer survivor Kellie Nash, who died from cancer in December 2012, and that he himself suffered a recent cancer scare. Perry was by Nash's side as she battled cancer.|$|R
