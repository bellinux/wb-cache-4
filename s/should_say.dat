5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|I <b>should</b> <b>say</b> I {{wanted to}} write poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, we <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> that God exists in the usual sense of the term, all we can safely say is that God is not nonexistent. We <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> that God is wise, but we can say that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> that God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that fractals are scale-invariant, although more precisely, one <b>should</b> <b>say</b> {{that they are}} self-similar.

But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.|$|E

25|$|Salat al-Istikhaarah is {{a prayer}} {{performed}} when a Muslim needs guidance {{on a particular}} matter, such as whether they should marry a certain person. In order to perform this salah one should pray a normal two rakats salah to completion. After completion one <b>should</b> <b>say</b> a du'a called the Istikhaarah du'a. The intention for the salah should be in one's heart to pray two rakats of salah followed by Istikhaarah. The salah can be performed {{at any of the}} times where salah is not forbidden.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{also more}} open to {{explaining}} {{their way of life}} to the humans than her husband is. Leslie tries to curb her, but Sarah says what she believes she <b>should</b> <b>say.</b> Sarah does not fully share Leslie's prejudices and tries to make the humans understand her. For example, Sarah shares information on their reproduction and how she and Leslie met. It is also Sarah who tells the humans why they decided {{to come out of the}} sea. Leslie is reluctant to part with this information.|$|E
25|$|When {{flying the}} four wings are spread quite far apart, fore and hind {{wing of the}} same side far apart, body horizontal. Flight slow enough so that the {{movements}} of each separate wing can be seen—insect consequently moves slowly but can dodge. Mr. Barnes compared {{the movements of the}} wings to that of a windmill, but the revolving movements are lacking; I <b>should</b> <b>say</b> the effect produced by the wings is more like that of a jumping-jack with moveable arms and legs pulled by one string, rather slowly, but, of course, at regular intervals.|$|E

They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they <b>should</b> <b>say</b> so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with delight to teach to move us to good; as if one <b>should</b> <b>say</b> with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E
25|$|James S. Donnelly, Jr., a {{historian}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{wrote in his}} book, Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland:I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed {{in a major way}} to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one <b>should</b> <b>say</b> in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during {{and as a result of}} the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.|$|E

25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what the law says, not what it <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I <b>should</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one <b>should</b> <b>say</b> as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|E
