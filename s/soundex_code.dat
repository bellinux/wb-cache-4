5000|$|Search {{functionality}} {{will often}} use phonetic algorithms to find results that don't match exactly the term(s) {{used in the}} search. Searching for names can be difficult as there are often multiple alternative spellings for names. An example is the name [...] It has two alternatives, Clare/Clair, which are both pronounced the same. Searching for one spelling wouldn't show results for the two others. Using Soundex all three variations produce the same <b>Soundex</b> <b>code,</b> C460. By searching names based on the <b>Soundex</b> <b>code</b> all three variations will be returned.|$|E
50|$|The {{registries}} {{filing system}} was based originally on <b>Soundex</b> <b>Code</b> {{which is a}} phonetic way of coding giving numeric value to consonants and ignores vowels, except as a first letter. This system allows for matching despite some differences in spelling. It was a perfect foundation for a situation where often people did not know exact spelling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Soundex</b> <b>code</b> for a name {{consists}} of a letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. Consonants at a similar place of articulation share the same digit so, for example, the labial consonants B, F, P, and V are each encoded as the number 1.|$|E

50|$|Soundex was {{developed}} by Robert C. Russell and Margaret King Odell and patented in 1918 and 1922.

The <b>Soundex</b> <b>code</b> came to prominence in the 1960s when it was the subject of several articles in the Communications and Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, and especially when described in Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.|$|E
5000|$|The Cologne {{phonetics}} matches {{each letter}} {{of a word}} to a digit between [...] "0" [...] and [...] "8". To select the appropriate digit, at most one adjacent letter {{is used as a}} context. Some rules apply specifically to the initials of words. In this way similar sounds are supposed to be assigned the same code. The letters [...] "W" [...] and [...] "V" [...] for example, are both encoded with the number [...] "3". The phonetic code for [...] "Wikipedia" [...] is [...] "3412" [...] (W=3, K=4, P=1, and D=2). Unlike the <b>Soundex</b> <b>code,</b> the length of the codes from the Cologne phonetics method is not limited.|$|E
40|$|Most of {{previous}} methods on Thai soundex encoding {{are based on}} Odell and Russell's algorithm. These methods still have limitations in grouping words of similar sound. To improve the accuracy of Thai soundex encoding, we propose a new method that combines a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and phonetic trigrams. Our <b>soundex</b> <b>code</b> consists of three features, i. e. initial consonant sound, vowel sound, and final consonant sound. The HMM and phonetic trigrams are used as a soundex converter. First, the HMM generates all possible soundex codes, and then the answers are re-ranked by combining probabilities from phonetic trigrams with probabilities from the HMM. The experimental results show that our algorithm surpasses the previous works and gives the best performance with 95 % and 84 % in precision and recall, respectively...|$|E

The individual search provides a quick method for locating an individual in the pedigree database. This search uses a modified <b>soundex</b> <b>coding</b> and an inverted file structure based on a composite key. The navigational search uses a set of pedigree traversal operations (individual, parent, mate, offspring, and sibling) and conventional Boolean logic to extract information from a pedigree database...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} injecting drug users {{have a higher}} than usual risk of death from {{overdose}} in the 2 weeks after release from prison. DESIGN: <b>Soundex</b> <b>coding</b> of surnames and information on date of birth were used to link entry and release dates from the local prison between 1983 and 1994 with clinical data from Edinburgh City Hospital's cohort of male injecting drug users who are infected with HIV. SETTING: Edinburgh City Hospital and Edinburgh Prison. SUBJECTS: 316 / 332 male injecting drug users infected with HIV in the City Hospital HIV cohort; 16 were excluded because they were enrolled after developing AIDS or because their precise date of death was not available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative risk of dying from overdose before developing AIDS and relative risk of dying of all causes before developing AIDS during the 2 weeks after release from prison; this was compared with relative risks of death during other time at liberty. RESULTS: 238 / 316 (75 %) injecting drug users served time in the prison between 1983 and 1994. 33 out of 316 injecting drug users who were infected with HIV died before developing AIDS during 517, 177 days at risk. 20 of these men died of an overdose; 6 of these deaths occurred within 2 weeks of release during 5903 days at risk. Death rates from overdose before the development of AIDS were 1. 02 / 1000 days during the 2 weeks after release (recently released) and 0. 029 / 1000 days during other times of liberty. The relative risk of death from overdose became 7. 7 (1. 5 to 39. 1) after temporal matching (when the comparison {{was limited to the}} first 2 weeks after release v the next 10 weeks). The crude relative risk in an analysis combining stratified prison term and the 2 weeks after release was 4. 5 (1. 7 to 11. 7) for death from overdose. After temporal matching these risks became 1. 8 (0. 4 to 9. 2). CONCLUSION: Prisons should evaluate interventions {{to reduce the risk of}} death from overdose after release...|$|R
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Konzept und die praktische Umsetzung einer fehlertoleranten Volltextsuche vorgestellt, welche die unscharfe Recherche nach Suchmustern in umfangreichen, digitalen, enzyklopädischen Werken ermöglichen. Das dabei zur Anwendung kommende neue Verfahren, welches durch Gewichte gesteuert das ursprüngliche Benutzer-Suchmuster in seiner Gestalt verändert (Weighted Pattern Morphing, WPM) und anschließend mit einer nachgeschalteten exakten Volltextsuche sucht, konnte in zahlreichen kommerziellen Anwendungsfällen seine Praxistauglichkeit beweisen. Darunter ist die Anwendung zur unscharfen Suche in einer mittelalterlichen, handschriftlichen Chronik besonders interessant, da diese die frühneuhochdeutsche Sprache {{verwendet}} und es zur damaligen Zeit noch keine vereinheitlichte Rechtschreibung gab. Aber nicht nur bei der Endbenutzer-Suche kann WPM eingesetzt werden - auch im redaktionellen Umfeld konnten mit dem Verfahren noch mehrere hundert Tippfehler in einem bereits mehrfach lektorierten digitalen Lexikon gefunden werden. Dabei arbeitet das Verfahren deutlich schärfer, als die sonst zur unscharfen Suche (und damit zur Fehler-Suche) verwendete Edit-Distanz. Abschließend wird in der Arbeit noch ein Verfahren vorgestellt, mit dem aus einem 3 D-Drahtgitter-Modell und den Faksimile-Scans einer mittelalterlichen Handschrift automatisch ein virtuelles Buch zum Durchblättern am PC erstellt wurde. In {{the work}} reported here, {{we present a}} new way of performing fault-tolerant fulltext retrieval on large text corpora, such as scientific encyclopedias. The weighted pattern morphing (WPM) technique introduced in this paper overcomes disadvantages of both the popular edit distance measure and the <b>Soundex</b> <b>code</b> approaches, yet keeping their flexibility. This algorithm handles phonetic similarities; common typing errors such as omission or transposition of letters, and inconsistent usage of abbreviations and hyphenation. After showing how WPM can be implemented efficiently, we present a novel method of how the weights of the internal penalty matrix can be automatically adjusted for even better results. Though the described technique can be applied without prior knowledge of actual user patterns, re-examination with a large number of online-user's patterns proves the portability of this fine-tuning approach. We further show how shifting the penalty matrix from one language to another can be accomplished. The described WPM technique is integrated into a large commercial pharmaceutic ency­clopedia CDROM, an online dermatological encyclopedia, and an online-reference encyclopedia of parasitology research, thus also proving its “road capability”. The thesis shows further the possibility to use WPM in the development phase of a digital encyclopedia to spot and correct typos and errors. A few hundred errors could be corrected in a text corpus that was reviewed several times before. Finally, the work presents an automatic approach in building a virtual book from a 3 D-wireframe model and facsimile scans of a medieval handwriting. The user can flip pages back and forth in this virtual book, where the original version of the book is not accessible to the masses...|$|E
