25|$|At {{one time}} the {{petroleum}} industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity {{by means of the}} Saybolt viscometer, and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (<b>Saybolt</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>universal)</b> or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Saybolt</b> <b>universal</b> <b>second</b> (SUS or SSU) is {{a measure}} of {{kinematic}} viscosity used in classical mechanics. It is the time that 60 cm3 of oil takes to flow through a calibrated tube at a controlled temperature, 38°C. The SUS is used for oils with flowing time up to 5600 seconds, in the range of low to medium viscosity such as machine oils.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Norcross {{viscometer}} after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device {{is based on a}} piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space which is formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain thixotropic liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), <b>Saybolt</b> <b>universal</b> <b>second</b> (SUS) or centipoise.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel {{modification of the}} polymerase chain reaction for efficient in vitro amplification of genomic DNA sequences flanking short stretches of known sequence.

Subsequently, following ligation with a <b>second</b> <b>universal</b> linker primer, the selected fragments can be amplified to amounts suitable for further molecular studies. The procedure {{has been applied to}} recover T-DNA flanking sequences in transgenic tomato plants which could subsequently be used to assign the positions of T-DNA to the molecular map of tomato.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} two experiments that use artificial grammar learning {{in order to test}} proposed phonological universals. The first universal involves limits on precedence-modification in phonological representations, drawn from a typology of ludlings (language games). It is found that certain unattested precedence-modifying operations in ludlings are also dispreferred in learning in experimental studies, suggesting that the typological gap reflects a principled and universal aspect of language structure. The <b>second</b> <b>universal</b> involves differences between vowels and consonants, and in particular, the fact that phonological typology finds vowel repetition and harmony to be widespread, while consonants are more likely to dissimilate. An artificial grammar task replicates this bias in the laboratory, suggesting that its presence in natural languages is not due to historical accident but to cognitive constraints on the form of linguistic grammars...|$|R
