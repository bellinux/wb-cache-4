40|$|International audienceSugar {{alcohols}} are incompletely digested in {{the human}} small intestine. The residual amounts reaching the colon are digested by colonic bacteria or excreted in stools. Clinical tolerance and energy value of <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols</b> are related to their respective rates of digestion in the small intestine and the colon. Six healthy volunteers were tested in 5 periods during which they ingested 10 g lactulose, and then, in a random order, an iso-osmotic solution of 20 g isomalt, sorbitol, maltitol, and lactitol. The fraction of <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols</b> absorbed in the small intestine was evaluated by comparing the amounts of hydrogen excreted in breath for 8 h after the ingestion of lactulose and of <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Energy value of <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols</b> was determined knowing the amounts absorbed in the small intestine and digested in the colon. Tolerance to the <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols</b> was good in all volunteers, and not different between <b>sugar</b> <b>alcohols.</b> The mean percentage of malabsorption in the small intestine was significantly higher for lactitol (84 +/- 14 percent, m +/- SEM) than for maltitol and isomalt (44 +/- 7 and 40 +/- 7 percent), its energy value (2. 3 +/- 0. 3 kcal/g) was {{significantly lower than the}} energy value of maltitol (3. 1 +/- 0. 1 kcal/g, P less than 0. 05); whereas those of sorbitol and isomalt were close (2. 7 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 8 +/- 0. 1 kcal/g, respectively).
