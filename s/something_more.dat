5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to <b>something</b> <b>more</b> animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> playable.|$|E

Both Harding and Hoover realized <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E

5|$|The Grinch realizes {{then that}} Christmas is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than its trappings.

Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E
5|$|The series won several {{international}} advertising {{awards for}} BBH. The brand's creaminess was emphasised through {{items such as}} face cream, ice cream, sun cream and whipped cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> stylish, {{to make it more}} appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream.

5|$|David's first book, A Book of Mediterranean Food, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} by the abbreviated title of Mediterranean Food, was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it needed <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E

Six Flags Great Adventure's version of the ride officially {{opened to the public}} on April 17, 2003. In preparation for the ride's installation at Six Flags Great America, the park removed Shockwave, an Arrow Dynamics roller coaster that was located on part of the park's parking lot. Grading works also had to take place to convert the parking lot into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> suitable for Superman: Ultimate Flight. The ride at Six Flags Great America opened on May 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to <b>something</b> <b>more</b> appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
