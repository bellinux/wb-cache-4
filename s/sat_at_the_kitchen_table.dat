2500|$|Reuben Mattus {{invented the}} [...] "Häagen-Dazs" [...] name {{supposedly}} {{as a tribute}} to Denmark's exemplary treatment of its Jews during the Second World War, and included an outline map of Denmark on early labels. [...] Mattus claimed the name was [...] "Danish-sounding," [...] although it is not Danish, which has neither an umlaut ä (rather, the ligature æ is the corresponding counterpart) nor a digraph zs, nor did the name have any meaning in any language before its creation. (The surname Haagen, without an umlaut, does exist in Denmark.) Mattus felt that Denmark was known for its dairy products and had a positive image in the United States. His daughter Doris Hurley reported in the 1999 PBS documentary An Ice Cream Show that her father <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> for hours saying nonsensical words until he came up with a combination he liked. The reason he chose this method was so that the name would be unique and original.|$|E

He {{paid no attention to}} anyone. His attitude, Curiously like his father's, was perfectly definite to Howard. It meant that from that time forward there were to be no words of any sort between them. It meant that they were no longer brothers, not even acquaintances. [...] "How inexorable that face!"

They will take me away from you all. Already the papers have: 'Intern all the Huns.'" [...] He <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table and {{buried his face in}} hands still grimy from his leather work. Mrs. Gerhardt stood beside him, her eyes unnaturally big.|$|R
50|$|Each episode {{follows the}} same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair {{would get into}} bed but in later seasons they <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually {{insulting}} him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee, Neil Down, Mickey Scratcher and Inspector Bush) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.|$|E

40|$|Bill <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> {{adding up}} last month’s {{expenses}} from running his fishing boat. With his trawler he fishes for bottom fish {{from his home}} base in Terrebone Bay, Louisiana—snapper and grouper mostly. But {{for the last few}} summers he has had to boat further and further out from the Louisiana shore to get to decent fishing grounds. The additional fuel costs were killing him. He rubbed his tired eyes and tried running the numbers through his calculator again. “Hi Dad, ” said his daughter Sue, walking into the kitchen. “How does it look this month?” “Not so good, ” said Bill, tossing his pencil onto the table. “The fuel bills were higher than ever this summer. It’s going to be tight for our finances. I wish I knew why the fish disappear near shore in the summer. ” He privately worried about {{how he was going to}} be able to afford Sue’s college tuition this fall. Maybe it was time to get out of the fishing business, except fishing was all he knew. Plus, all his money was tied up in his fishing boat and gear. Who would buy it now that fishing in the Gulf was so problematic? Sue sat down at the table and toyed with the pencil. She knew about her dad’s worries. “You know, Dad,” she said, “I’ve been thinking. Let me talk with some of my professors at the university. Maybe I can get some information from them about what causes the fish to disappear, and whether anyone is working on a solution. Someone at school ought to know something. ...|$|E
40|$|KKK {{first came}} to the flat where NA and BP are staying on a Sunday morning, after prior arrangement. However, it turned out that she felt uncomfortable {{speaking}} Even to two near-strangers, especially with a microphone and video camera, so we agreed that she would come again and bring an Even audience with her. She therefore came again on Monday evening, bringing three boys with her to whom she could tell some fairy tales. The boys <b>sat</b> opposite her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table, and NA and BP sat off to the side. KKK was clearly very nervous during the recording, her audience notwithstanding. It was very quiet during the recording, though there might be some dog barking and a truck may have gone by; also, one of the boys coughed several times. The recording was done in mono with a Marantz recorder and a Sony handycam on videotape. The videofilm was transferred to the computer as. avi and later converted to mpeg 2...|$|R
