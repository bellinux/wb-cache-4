40|$|Despite many sensational and intimidating {{reports in}} the mass media, {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) are not contagious in the usual sense. Successful transmission requires both specific material (an affected individual's tissue, from or adjacent to CNS) and specific modes (mainly penetrating contact with the recipient). Nevertheless, <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> are mandatory to avoid accidental transmission and to decontaminate any infectivity. The autopsy is essential for definite diagnosis of these disorders. Recommendations are given here for safe performance of the autopsy, for neuropathology service and appropriate decontamination; {{they are based on}} the current literature and on precautions taken in most laboratories experienced in handling tissue from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In essence, special care must be taken to avoid penetrating wounds, possible contamination should be kept to a minimum, and potentially infectious material must be adequately decontaminated by specific means.

40|$|Several {{household}} fires {{have occurred}} in the United States and Canada when flammable contact adhesive vapors were ignited by nearby pilot lights. While the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the sale of extremely flammable adhesives in the U. S., its Canadian counterparts have focused more attention on product labeling. This field experiment examined the impact of the flame and poison warning symbols prescribed by the Canadian Government for a flammable adhesive. The results suggest that although the generic meanings of these two symbols are well understood, people have difficulty inferring the <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> most necessary for this particular product, apparently because they do not realize that adhesive vapors, rather than the adhesive itself, pose the fire hazard. Users also tended to overestimate the significance of the toxicity hazard. This incorrect assessment was corrected for a subset of subjects by reading the product specific text provided {{on the back of the}} container. Implications for the design and evaluation of safety symbols are provided as are recommendations for modifying several features of the adhesive's label...|$|E
40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a {{non-invasive}} optical {{measurement technique}} {{which has been}} used for many decades to measure fluid velocity. Conventionally, PIV systems are equipped with a laser system for illuminating the flow field. However, laser systems are expensive, and their usage usually creates <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions.</b> In this work, we used a low cost LED based illumination system in conjunction with the refractive-index matching method to measure flow velocities in porous media. Hydro jelly beads were used as a transparent porous medium which have the same refractive index as water. The movement of tracer particles which were illuminated by the LED pulse was captured by a high-speed double pulsed camera and the resulting images were processed for receiving the pore-scale fluid velocity. Interstitial velocity vectors averaged over a specified region were presented and compared with the vertical velocity component calculated from the volumetric flow rate. In general, our results demonstrated the usability of LED based PIV system for investigating flow conditions in porous media. The future aim of this study is the investigation of micro-scale seepage induced internal erosion of granular structures...|$|E

40|$|P>Aims To {{investigate}} the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an exercise programme {{for patients with}} diabetic complications. Methods In this pre-post design study, 22 patients from a diabetic foot outpatient clinic participated in a 12 -week individualized exercise programme, consisting of aerobic and resistance exercise, with <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions.</b> Feasibility was assessed {{on the basis of}} programme adherence, adverse events, achievement of the target training intensity and patient satisfaction. Preliminary effectiveness was evaluated with pre-post-changes in blood glucose regulation (HbA(1 c)), muscle strength (isometric peak torque) and perceived limitations in functioning (Patient Specific Function Scale with visual analogue scale). Results Twenty patients completed the exercise programme with a high mean attendance (85 %). No training-related severe adverse events occurred. The target training intensity was achieved by 70 % of the participants. Patient satisfaction was high. HbA(1 c) decreased from 8. 2 % before to 7. 8 % after the programme (P = 0. 005), muscle strength increased from 136. 4 to 150. 4 Nm (P = 0. 046) and perceived limitations in functioning decreased from 7. 2 to 5. 8 mm (P = 0. 003).

40|$|Before {{disinfecting}} any surface, {{make sure}} it is thoroughly clean. Cleaning is {{the most important part of}} the phrase “Cleaning and Disinfection, ” or C&D. Disinfectants do not work, or work poorly, if dirt and feces are present. You are wasting your time and money applying disinfectant to dirty surfaces. Thoroughly spray cleaned surfaces with the disinfectant solution. Wash off boots with soap and water (pressurized if available) and make sure there is no adhering mud and feces before stepping into a disinfecting foot bath. Change foot bath solution frequently; change immediately if it becomes highly contaminated with dirt and feces. Place hand sanitizer stations at entrance of buildings and pens. Alcohol-based sanitizers are effective against AI virus. Get in the habit of disinfecting your hands every time you enter and leave. Below are listed a few disinfectants that are effective in inactivating the AI virus. Use them for general disinfection of equipment and in foot baths. Choose the disinfectant that works best in your operation as far as cost and availability; however, do not mix disinfectants. Always follow <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> listed on the product container. The choice of which disinfectant to use is less important than having things clean first.

40|$|BackgroundEvery health {{professional}} {{around the world}} is at risk of blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury as a result of exposure to blood or body fluids and needle or sharp injuries. However, the extent of these hazards and their driving forces are not well documented in Ethiopia. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess determinants of blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury among nurses working in Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia. MethodsAn institution-based census was conducted among 318 nurses working in Jimma zone public hospitals from March 10 to 30, 2016. Data were collected by using pretested self-administered questionnaire. Epi info and SPSS were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Descriptive statistics were done. Bivariate and inter multivariate logistic regression analysis was also carried out to identify predictors of occupational hazards. ResultsThe overall prevalence of blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury was found to be 249 (78. 3 %). Blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury incidents were reported by 62. 6 and 58. 8 % of respondents, respectively. Majority of the hazards occurred during morning shift. Being male [AOR: 2. 20, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 09, 4. 4], being single (AOR: 2. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 09, 4. 69), and having no training on infection prevention (AOR: 5. 99, 95 % CI: 3. 14, 11. 41) were positively associated with blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury; while working in chronic illness follow-up clinic (AOR: 0. 19, 95 % CI: 0. 05, 0. 71) showed negative association at p value of 0. 05. ConclusionPrevalence of blood/body fluid exposure and needle stick/sharp injury was high among the nurses. The safety of nurses depends directly on the degree to which nurses can identify and control the varied occupational hazards specific to jobs. Thus, working unit <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> and basic infection prevention in-service training might improve nurses’ safety practice and thereby decrease the on job hazard...|$|E

40|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a {{non-invasive}} method {{and a key}} technology to study functional root traits of different plant species or genotypes. It allows monitoring transport processes in plants consecutively {{over a longer period}} of time as well as plant reactions to environmental changes or induced stresses in vivo. Radioactive carbon dioxide, which is labelled with the positron emitting 11 C (half-life: 20 min), can be administered to a plant to follow up and quantify CO 2 uptake as well as transport and storage of the labeled photoassimilates in particular in the roots without harming the plants. Since in the experiment radioactive tracer is handled, <b>specific</b> <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> have to be met. We have developed a prototype of a gas exchange system that enables measuring of gas exchange rates (CO 2 and water) of a plant and, at the same time, ensures safe administration and discharge of the radioactive 11 CO 2 during the measurements with the PET system. Initially, the gas exchange system provides a certain gas composition in which both CO 2 concentration and humidity can be adjusted. Under the control of mass flow rate (range 0. 5 to 3. 0 L/min) and differential pressure towards atmosphere the gas is delivered to the plant, which is enclosed in a glass cuvette. An infrared gas analyzer detects the delta CO 2 and H 2 O concentrations between the gas flow entering and leaving the plant cuvette with an accuracy of +/- 1 µmol/mol or mmol/mol, respectively. For the administration of the radioactive species of CO 2 to the plant, the system can be operated in a closed cycle by which the plant will be exposed to a certain amount of 11 CO 2 for short time (seconds to minutes). After the pulse labeling is completed, the CO 2 together with the radioactive 11 CO 2 will be adsorbed on the outlet of the system for safe discharge. We are currently evaluating the prototype system under real test conditions for adaptation and optimization. Future work will include automation of the 11 CO 2 administration and gas exchange measurements...|$|E
