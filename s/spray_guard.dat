2500|$|Steamboats {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} nicknames, {{not all of them}} complimentary. [...] As mentioned, the Tomkins was called the Pumpkins. [...] The Greyhound was called the Hound, the Pup and the Dog. [...] Wealleale was known to all as Weary Willie. [...] The Robert Duinsmere, originally as a sidewheel steamer in Canada for the Vancouver-Nanaimo route, was later rebuilt as propeller collier, thereby suffering the misfortune of becoming known as the Dirty Bob. [...] The City of Shelton, lacking a <b>spray</b> <b>guard</b> over her paddlewheel, was called Old Wet-Butt by crew of [...] the propeller Marian, her competitor on the Olympia-Shelton route. [...] And in the 1920s, Barely-Gets-There was the appellation for the once-sleek Bailey Gatzert sponsoned-out as she was to carry as many autos as could be loaded on her, and made more ugly yet {{with the addition of a}} loading elevator on her foredeck.|$|E
5000|$|June 14, 2011: A team of six gunmen {{and suicide}} bombers dressed in police uniforms {{attacked}} Diyala provincial council’s {{offices in the}} center of Baqubah. The assault began about 9:20 a.m. with a suicide car bomb attack at the gates of the Diyala provincial council's headquarters. As police officers and Iraq Security Forces (advised by US Army Special Forces) rushed to the scene, other militants attacked a second checkpoint, one detonating a suicide vest and the others <b>spraying</b> <b>guards</b> and civilians with gunfire. Four civilians and three police officers reported killed. Five of the attackers were also killed, and one was captured.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{restoration}} was made possible with the pledge and realisation of support from Chepstow-based steel bridging and infrastructure manufacturer [...] which, {{as part of its}} [...] community support programme, donated time, equipment and paint to enable the stabilisation of the vessel and arrest further deterioration. Mabey Bridge apprentices along with other employees of the company removed the turntable, winch and wheel capstan from the ferry and relocated them to the Mabey Bridge manufacturing facility for refurbishment. The majority of <b>spray</b> <b>guards</b> were similarly removed and relocated. However, some have been left as a template for future rebuilding. Holes were also drilled in the lower hull to drain the ferry of rainwater and Mabey Bridge staff secured the cabins. The winch chain hull tears were sent to be plated.|$|R
5000|$|... 9 June:- A massive truck bomb {{ripped through}} the five-star Pearl Continental hotel in Peshawar on Tuesday killing 11 people and more than {{wounding}} 60. The attackers entered the compound on two vehicles at about 10:30pm, <b>spraying</b> the security <b>guards</b> at the hotel gate with bullets from one and blowing up {{the other in the}} hotel parking. The death toll later rose to 17.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} planned arrests {{occurred}} when people locked themselves to heavy machinery. On September 3, 2016, the DAPL {{brought in a}} private security firm. The company used bulldozers to dig up part of the pipeline route that was subject to a pending injunction motion; it contained possible Native graves and burial artifacts. The bulldozers arrived within a day from when the tribe filed legal action. When unarmed protesters moved near the bulldozers, the <b>guards</b> used pepper <b>spray</b> and <b>guard</b> dogs to attack the protesters. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 protesters were pepper-sprayed before the security guards and their dogs exited the scene in trucks.|$|R
5000|$|When unarmed protesters {{crossed the}} {{perimeter}} fence {{to stop the}} bulldozers, the <b>guards</b> used pepper <b>spray</b> and <b>guard</b> dogs to attack. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 were pepper-sprayed before the guards and their dogs left the scene in trucks. A woman that had taken part in the incident stated, [...] "The cops watched the whole thing from up on the hills. It {{felt like they were}} trying to provoke us into being violent when we’re peaceful." [...] The incident was filmed by Amy Goodman and a crew from Democracy Now! Footage shows several people with dog bites and a dog with blood on its muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear <b>spray</b> <b>guards</b> (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|R
50|$|The E2 nightclub stampede {{occurred}} on February 17, 2003, at the E2 nightclub located above the Epitome Chicago restaurant at 2347 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Illinois, in which 21 people died {{and more than}} 50 were injured when panic ensued {{from the use of}} pepper <b>spray</b> by security <b>guards</b> to break up a fight. The club's owners, Dwain Kyles and Calvin Hollins, were later convicted of criminal contempt for their persistent failure to keep the facility up to code, and sentenced to two years in prison.|$|R
50|$|On September 30, 2008, Curcio, dressed identically to his decoy applicants, {{pretended to}} work the grounds near the bank. Wearing a blue shirt, jeans, yellow safety vest, work boots and painter’s mask, he pepper-sprayed the Brink's armored-car guard who was pushing a dolly loaded with money into the bank. The pepper <b>spray</b> forced the <b>guard</b> to reach for his eyes and release the cart that held the money. Curcio grabbed two bags of money, {{containing}} more than $400,000, and ran toward the creek. Meanwhile, police arrived to find the bank’s parking lot filled with men matching the robber’s description.|$|R
5000|$|The attack {{occurred}} {{just before}} midnight. Five off duty civil guards, {{belonging to the}} local traffic department, were drinking in the Aizea bar, along with at least 20 other people. Shortly before midnight, two individuals, armed with machine guns, entered the bar. After shouting slogans in support of ETA such as [...] "Gora ETA" [...] they <b>sprayed</b> the civil <b>guards</b> with bullets. The attack was rapid, lasting less than ten seconds. Four of the civil guards were killed, with the other injured. Two waiters and another three customers were injured in the attack. One of the customers died the following morning, having been {{hit in the head}} and throat by bullets. The ETA members then escaped in a Renault 18, driven by an accomplice. Another three ETA members were involved in the attack, helping the participants to escape.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the recent}} spate of attacks, many parents are now {{worried about their}} children's safety in schools and have since asked local {{officials}} and school governors to step up security at the schools. The education ministry has formed an emergency panel to tackle the violence and some local police authorities have distributed such instruments as steel pitchforks and pepper <b>spray</b> to security <b>guards</b> in schools. However, not all schools increased their security {{because of lack of}} funds to hire extra security. The state media has also been keeping news of these attacks quiet by deleting forum entries on the internet and releasing few facts on the incident for fear of copycat crimes and mass panic. In May 2010 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao commented on the school attacks and said that the 'social tensions' in China must be addressed. He also said society was changing rapidly and that subsequent changes in policy were needed. Why these attacks have been specifically targeted at young school children is not entirely explicable, however.|$|R
500|$|Tryon was {{alerted to}} the {{presence}} of the Americans in Bethel around 1 am on April 27, cutting short thoughts of remaining for another day in Danbury. [...] Rousing the troops, he ordered the houses of Patriots to be burned; in all, more than twenty structures were destroyed. [...] The troops then left Danbury around dawn, and marched south toward the village of Ridgefield in an attempt to avoid General Wooster's force. [...] Hoping to delay General Tryon until overwhelming reinforcements arrived, General Wooster split his force. The main body, about 400 men, went with Generals Arnold and Silliman across the countryside to Ridgefield, where they were met by another 100 militiamen, and erected crude barricades on the road through town. [...] General Wooster personally chased after the British column with the remaining 200; [...] his effort was assisted by local Patriots who created impediments before the British column, including the destruction of at least one bridge. [...] Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Wooster engaged Tryon's rear guard as it paused for breakfast about [...] north of the town of Ridgefield, killing at least two British soldiers.Wooster took about forty prisoners in this first engagement, and then retreated for cover in nearby woods. [...] He struck again an hour later, but the British were more prepared for a second engagement, having positioned three artillery pieces with their rear <b>guard,</b> <b>spraying</b> the colonials with grape shot. Rallying his men, the 67-year-old General Wooster was mortally wounded moments after yelling [...] "Come on my boys! Never mind such random shots!" [...] about [...] from Ridgefield's town center; his inexperienced militia dissolved in confusion. [...] Wooster died five days later in Danbury at the home of Nehemiah Dibble, whose house had also served as General Tryon's temporary quarters in Danbury. [...] Wooster's last words were reported to be [...] "I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence." [...] Wooster's harassment of the British column had provided enough time for Arnold and Silliman to prepare a crude defensive position at Ridgefield.|$|R
