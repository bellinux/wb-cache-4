2500|$|Deep diving {{tests were}} delayed until the {{acquisition}} of the submarine rescue vessel Remora in December 1995. Collins performed her first deep dive on 19 January 1996 without any problems. However, during a later deep dive trial, the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> began to leak excessively. Although designed to leak at [...] an hour, the seal had previously shown itself to be faulty, with an hourly leak rate {{in the hundreds of}} litres. On this occasion, the water pressure meant the flow rate was significantly greater, {{to the point where the}} aft bilge pump was barely keeping up. When the senior engineer entered the compartment, he found personnel trying to stem the flow, including one sailor who was underneath the shaft, attempting to tighten the seal manually. The engineer instructed the commander to take the submarine to the surface as quickly as possible, but keep the boat level—had the engineer instead informed the commander that the submarine was flooding, Collins would have blown all ballast and driven for the surface at a steep angle, likely drowning the sailor under the shaft. Collins reached the surface without further incident. Modified seals were fitted to all submarines to bring the leak back to the accepted rate. It was later calculated that the submarine was taking on water at over [...] a minute.|$|E

50|$|Selection of the internal/external drive {{arrangement}} is often idiosyncratic. The service {{life of the}} high-pressure <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> {{can be difficult to}} predict, and it may safely be assumed that the seal will cost a good deal more than the motor itself. For instance, a 2 in, 150 psi seal for a 50 hp motor will cost $2,000, whereas the motor itself is half that much. Generally, the combination of vessel pressure, shaft diameter, and fan speed encountered in autoclaves is such as to make the use of a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> reasonably practicable.|$|E

5000|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal uses both rigid and flexible elements that maintain contact at a sealing interface and slide on each other, allowing a rotating element {{to pass through}} a sealed case. The elements are both hydraulically and mechanically loaded with a spring or other device to maintain contact. For similar designs using flexible elements, see Radial <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> (a.k.a.

50|$|Fan drives can be {{internal}} or external. Internal drives have the motor inside the autoclave in an unheated chamber. A thick wall of insulation keeps the heat out, and the motor is under full autoclave pressure. External drives require a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> {{to carry the}} drive shaft through the pressure vessel wall. Internal drives are simpler, result in slightly less floor space taken, and impose a small but essential cooling load; external drives require more elaborate drive shaft arrangements and use high pressure seals.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 February 1991, {{the cruiser}} [...] struck two {{influence}} mines in the Persian Gulf just forward of her after 5 in gun mount during Operation Desert Storm, {{resulting in a}} cracked superstructure, a jammed port rudder and leaking port <b>shaft</b> <b>seal.</b> Despite severe damage to her stern, her forward weapon systems and Aegis combat system were back online within fifteen minutes. Princeton remained on station for 30 hours until relieved. Repairs in the Mina Jebel Ali near Dubai took five weeks, performed by the destroyer tender on duty: Acadia, after which Princeton returned to the United States under her own power for additional repairs.|$|E

50|$|Radial <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> {{also known}} as lip seals, are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem <b>seals.</b> Early radial <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a garter spring which helps the sealing lip compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|R
40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been}} noted during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and actuator assemblies, degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the actuator assemblies, and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the actuator assemblies. The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet. Recommended repair, verification, and possible preventative maintenance measures are discussed in the paper...|$|R
50|$|All cogs of each gear {{component}} of magnetic gears {{act as a}} constant magnet with periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear components are mounted with a backlash capability similar to other mechanical gearings. Although they cannot exert as much force as a traditional gear, such gears work without touching and so are immune to wear, have very low noise and can slip without damage making them very reliable. They {{can be used in}} configurations that are not possible for gears that must be physically touching and can operate with a non-metallic barrier completely separating the driving force from the load. The magnetic coupling can transmit force into a hermetically sealed enclosure without using a radial <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> which may leak.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing of}} the tests {{depended}} on the local weather conditions, with the wind being the critical factor. The tests were underground, but due {{to a number of}} <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> failures that had occurred during tests conducted by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the sealing of the shaft could not be guaranteed to be leak-proof. By early afternoon, the winds had died down and the test sequence was initiated. Dr. K. Santhanam of the DRDO, in charge of the test site preparations, gave the two keys that activated the test countdown to Dr. M. Vasudev, the range safety officer, who was responsible for verifying that all test indicators were normal. After checking the indicators, Vasudev handed one key each to a representative of BARC and the DRDO, who unlocked the countdown system together. At 3:45 pm the three devices were detonated.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnetic}} gear resembles in part, the traditional mechanical gear. All cogs of each gear component of {{magnetic gear}}s {{act as a}} magnet with periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear components are mounted with a [...] "cushioned" [...] backlash capability similar to other mechanical gearings with no cushioning effect. Although they can exert as much force as a traditional gear, such gears work without touching and so are immune to wear of mating surfaces, have very low noise and can slip without damage making them very reliable. They {{can be used in}} configurations that are not possible for gears that must be physically touching and can operate with a barrier completely separating the driving force from the load. The magnetically coupled gear can transmit force into a hermetically sealed enclosure without using a radial <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> which may leak. Hermetically sealed processes are not contaminated or chemically affected by the magnetic gear. This can be an advantage in explosive or otherwise hazardous environments where leaks constitute a real danger.|$|E

5000|$|Traxxas brought {{on-board}} {{electric starting}} systems into widespread use for nitro fuel powered models. Most of their nitro-powered models carry this [...] "EZ Start" [...] system. It {{consists of a}} small electric motor geared to a rear engine shaft and a wiring harness to start the nitro engine in a way similar to full size automobiles. The wiring has leads to the electric motor and the electrically heated glow plug. The starter battery is kept separate from the model in a wand-like device. The end of the wand is inserted into the vehicle's receiver, and then the user presses the button on the wand. The electric motor turns the rear shaft until ignition, or until the wand's battery drains. Traxxas has also released pull start systems for their engines, so that the EZ Start system can be replaced if the owner so chooses. Some models may be started with starter or [...] "bump" [...] boxes, allowing the installation of engines with no on-car starting method, no rear shaft (and no leaking <b>shaft</b> <b>seal),</b> and less rotating and overall ...|$|E
50|$|The primary design {{factors of}} a high {{efficiency}} glandless circulating pump include an electronically commutated synchronous motor, a permanent magnet rotor, and canned rotor technology. An electronically commutated synchronous motor is used to convert the energy current from a DC energy source into an AC current which is supplied to the drive motor. It utilizes the magnetomotive force which is generated by surface currents placed on the surfaces of the stator and rotor and the permanent magnets to generate the electric current which is in output to the drive motor. The canned rotor technology {{eliminates the need for}} a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> that many conventional pumps must use through its unique design. Whereas standard pumps with shaft seals have multiple chambers with different rotating parts in each, canned rotor technology allows all of the rotating parts within the pump to exist in a single chamber. This increases the overall efficiency since the liquid used to lubricate the shaft bearings is also used to cool the motor. The electronic components of the motor are attached outside this system by means of an encapsulated motor cartridge, which is an independent metal compartment used solely for housing the electronic components.|$|E
