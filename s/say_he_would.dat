25|$|Vic {{wanted to}} become a boxer at the age of 5 and dreamed of {{becoming}} a world champion in the professionals. His father told him there was no professional boxing in Armenia (or any Soviet countries; this changed when the Union fell in 1991) and instead wanted Vic to follow in his footsteps and take up wrestling. Vic also wrestled as a kid, but always continued to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become a world champion someday. He eventually left wrestling in pursuit of his dream to become a world boxing champion.|$|E

25|$|The jurors of {{the trial}} voted the guilt of Socrates by a narrow margin (36a). In the Apology of Socrates, Plato cites no numbers of votes condemning or acquitting the philosopher of the accusations of moral {{corruption}} and impiety; although Socrates did <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been acquitted if thirty more jurors had voted in his favour. In such cases — where the penalty of death might arise as legal sanction for the accusations presented — Athenian law required that the prosecutor and the defendant each propose an administrative penalty to punish the actions reported in the accusations.|$|E
25|$|While {{in charge}} of cricket at the College, he {{arranged}} an officer cadets' match against W.G. Grace's XI. Two days before the game Grace wrote to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be unable to play, but after learning none of the cadets had seen him play, Wynyard cleverly disguised himself with make-up and false beard and played in the match with the visiting team, batting, making several runs and getting purposely hit on the hand to retire 'hurt'. He revealed his identity minus beard and cap at the teams' lunch {{but no one had}} seen through the disguise and his realistic imitation of Grace's batting style.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} called Joseph Faulkner, {{a tailor}} who knew Whelan in Montreal, {{hoping that he}} would testify about Whelan's Fenian connections; while he said he recollected Whelan being angered by McGee during the election season, which was contradicted by other witnesses who claimed Whelan showed no interest in politics, {{he said there was}} no known Fenian connection. Another witness identified as Turner testified that he had heard a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E

25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
25|$|By February 1, six Southern {{states had}} {{followed}} South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession, declaring themselves to {{no longer be}} a part of the United States. On February 18 Jefferson Davis was sworn in as the President of the Confederate States. Meanwhile, Washington was astir with talk of coups and conspiracies. Stanton thought that discord would ravage the capital on February 13, when electoral votes were being counted; nothing happened. Again, Stanton thought, when Lincoln was sworn in on March 4 there would be violence; this did not come to pass. Lincoln's inauguration did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but he did say that he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful. In Stanton, Lincoln's words were met with cautious optimism. The new President submitted his choices for his cabinet on March 5, and by that day's end, Stanton was no longer the attorney general. He lingered in his office for a while to help settle in and guide his replacement, Edward Bates.|$|E

[...] These tracks included [...] "Radio Suckers", which Ice-T wrote to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not compromise his music to have it played on radio. He noted his albums still sold well without radio support. The final track on the album [...] "Soul on Ice" [...] was Ice-T's tribute to Iceberg Slim, whose books he read in high school. Ice-T described Slim as [...] "fascinating" [...] and said his books [...] "made me wanna be a pimp".|$|E

The call for an inquiry was {{rejected}} by David Cameron, prompting Miliband to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> set up his own. In a BBC Radio 4 interview shortly after the riots, Miliband spoke of an irresponsibility that applied {{not only to the}} people involved in the riots, but [...] "wherever we find it in our society. We've seen in the past few years...MPs' expenses, what happened in the banks". Miliband also said Labour did not do enough to tackle moral problems during its 13 years in office. In December 2011 Miliband appointed Tim Livesey, a former adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be his full-time chief of staff.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Society {{suggested}} command {{be given}} to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. However, First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused, {{going so far as}} to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman. In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop [...] in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. Edmond Halley. The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography. Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to Lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition.|$|E
500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like you {{to go to bed with}} him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably different from the rest of the album.|$|E

500|$|Most of the European-style vessels {{were built}} in the {{shipyard}} that Nguyễn Ánh had commissioned in Saigon. He took a deep personal interest in the naval program, directly supervising the work and spending several hours a day dockside. One witness noted [...] "One principal tendency of his ambition is to naval science, as a proof of this he has been heard to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> build ships of the line on the European plan." [...] By 1792, fifteen frigates were under construction, with a design that mixed Chinese and European specifications, equipped with 14 guns. The Vietnamese learned European naval architecture by dismantling an old European vessel into its components, so that Vietnamese shipbuilders could understand the separate facets of European shipbuilding, before reassembling it. They then applied their newfound knowledge to create replicas of the boats. Nguyễn Ánh studied naval carpentry techniques and was said to be adept at it, and learned navigational theory from the French books that Pigneau translated, particularly Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie. The Saigon shipyard was widely praised by European travelers.|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stones {{needed to}} find a new guitarist, and the {{recording}} sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (UK 2; US 1) (1976) in Munich provided an opportunity for some hopefuls to work while trying out for the band. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that they would never have joined. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed that he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll". He had earlier declined Jagger's offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to the Faces, saying [...] "that's what's really important to me". Faces' lead singer Rod Stewart {{went so far as to}} <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.|$|E

He suggested an approach that General Motors did after the September 11 attacks when they reduced interest rates for their customers. [...] "We need a similar response by the mortgage lenders.
