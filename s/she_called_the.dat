5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E
5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E

She debuts in {{the third}} season as a singer for a nightclub, but leaves the job at Gomer's urging to return home to Turtle Creek, North Carolina, and marry her beau Monroe Efford. In a later episode in the same season, she returns to California and reveals that <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> wedding off.

40|$|Our aim in {{this essay}} is to {{critically}} examine Iris Young’s arguments in her important posthumously published book against what <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> liability model for attributing responsibility, {{as well as the}} arguments that she marshals in support of what <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> social connection model of political responsibility. We contend that her arguments against the liability model of conceiving responsibility are not convincing, and that her alternative to it is vulnerable to damaging objections...|$|R

25|$|From 1980 {{until her}} death, Hepburn {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Dutch actor Robert Wolders, the widower of actress Merle Oberon. She had met Wolders through a friend during the later years of her second marriage. In 1989, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> nine years she had spent with him the happiest years of her life, and stated that she considered them married, just not officially.|$|E
25|$|Sewall is {{best known}} for her work in the woman's {{suffrage}} movement, especially her ability to organize and unify women's groups through a concept <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> council idea. The national and international councils she helped organize brought women of diverse backgrounds together to work toward larger interests. Beginning in 1878, when she helped form the Indianapolis Equal Suffrage Society, Sewall became active in campaigns for female suffrage in Indiana and was heavily involved in woman's suffrage at the national level.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, the Netherlands {{remained}} neutral. As a Dutch subject, Zelle {{was thus}} able to cross national borders freely. To avoid the battlefields, she travelled between France and the Netherlands via Spain and Britain, and her movements inevitably attracted attention. During the war, Zelle {{was involved in}} what {{was described as a}} very intense romantic-sexual relationship with a Russian pilot serving with the French, the twenty-five year old Captain Vadim Maslov, whom <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> love of her life. Maslov was part of the 50,000 strong Russian Expeditionary Force sent to the Western Front in the spring of 1916.|$|E

25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E
25|$|Paramount {{attempted}} {{to use the}} coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come {{to be seen as}} arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Feist self-produced seven songs at home which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Red Demos, which have never been {{released}} commercially. She spent {{more than two years}} touring throughout Europe with Gonzales. In that same year she joined a group of old friends in forming a new version of Toronto indie rock group Broken Social Scene, adding vocals to many tracks after being forbidden to play guitar by de facto bandleader Kevin Drew. She subsequently recorded You Forgot It in People with the band. While on tour in Europe with Gonzales, they began recording new versions of her home recorded Red Demos, which would later become her major label debut Let It Die. Let It Die featured both original compositions and covers, and Feist has been noted both as a songwriter and as an innovative interpreter of other artists' songs.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> episode [...] "unexciting" [...] {{and concluded that}} the final scene was [...] "anti-climactic". In addition, Vitaris noted that the introduction of Monica Reyes was not satisfactorily explained.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.

500|$|When the {{national}} {{tour of the}} show visited the city of its setting, most San Francisco reviewers gave the show very positive reviews, though the Oakland Tribune critic described the musical as one [...] "which has little by way of witty dialogue, outstanding songs or vigorous choreography".

500|$|In 1979, {{the record}} company {{executive}} Sylvia Robinson assembled a group <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Sugarhill Gang and recorded [...] "Rapper's Delight".
