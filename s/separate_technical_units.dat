5000|$|Following Prime Minister Winston Churchill's {{decision}} {{to create a}} parachute corps within the British Army after German successes using airborne force {{during the early stages}} of the war, a parachute training school known as the Central Landing School was set up at RAF Ringway near Manchester in June 1940. On 31 August 1940, it was expanded within the school becoming the Central Landing Establishment. There was a <b>separate</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>unit</b> and the addition of the Glider Training Squadron which would be used by pilots training for the Glider Pilot Regiment.|$|R
50|$|It {{simplifies}} the documentation, designates the {{type approval number}} of a <b>separate</b> <b>technical</b> <b>unit</b> by a certificate of conformity, and defines the vehicles, individual <b>technical</b> <b>unit(s),</b> and component(s). Certificates of Conformity, as specified in Annex IX of EU Directive 92/53, will be required for an automobile to enter into service. For component approvals, an endorsement that is issued under the relevant regulations by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is recognised as equivalent to an approval granted under comparable EU legislation. In March 1992, the EU Council formally adopted the few remaining pieces of component-related legislation {{that are necessary to}} make the whole-vehicle type approval a reality for passenger cars. In June 1992, EU member state officials approved the adoption of EU legislation creating a single system for the certification of passenger cars, in turn defining the safety, and other technical, requirements. Legislation established an EU type approval system to replace the national schemes of the twelve member states. In 1996, the EU type approval system became mandatory.|$|R

50|$|Certificates of Conformity {{have been}} defined in EU’s Single Internal Market and Type Approval Directive (EC-92). EU’s single {{internal}} market became official on 1 January 1993. Part of the “EC-92” effort was {{to remove the}} technical barriers preventing the free movement of products within the EU market. The greatest impact of this effort {{has been in the}} area of standards in the automotive sector. The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states. EU legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise, particle emissions and safety. In addition, the EU’s directive on Type Approval (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for national type approval requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU. This directive aims at the clarification of the type approval procedure for motor vehicles, <b>separate</b> <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> (i.e., trailers), and components.|$|E

40|$|Feedback is {{certainly}} among {{essential elements of}} a learning environment and developing an effective feedback process is highly desirable. Evidence from literature (e. g. Walker 2009; Ferguson 2011; Orsmond & Merry 2011; Bailey & Garner 2010) show that detailed feedback to students could enhance their learning. Moreover, early informative feedback is an essential requirement for encouraging students to change their performance in future (Brown et al. 1997). Feedback can take many shapes and forms. It can be simply a final grade or a comprehensive descriptive response for an assessment. Nevertheless, it should be designed and provided {{in a way that}} it could manage students' expectations, learning process need and be consistent and supportive of course material. There are challenges, however, when engineering students carry out a course in management where content and feedback processes are somewhat different from other scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> they often have. These <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> unlike management units seem to provide more objective, measurable often linear understanding of a knowledge area. Therefore, education process in general and feedback mechanism specifically should help students to deal with this disparity between management and <b>technical</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
