500|$|In an {{interview}} that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place [...] "about five or more years in the future... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people {{with the result that}} the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. <b>Something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember... It isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." [...] Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept [...] "isn't apparent at all" [...] and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future.|$|E

[...] Although authentic airchecks of KBOX's coverage from later in the day do exist and have been posted online, they do not include the moment when the station first broke the news.|$|E
