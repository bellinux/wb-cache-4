40|$|Inexpensive {{broadband}} routers are {{a popular}} {{way for people}} to create an internal, and sometimes wireless, network in their homes. By purchasing such a router and plugging it in, they can have a network set up in seconds. Unfortunately, by visiting a malicious web page, a person can inadvertently open up his router for attack; settings on the router can be changed, including the DNS servers used by the members of this <b>small,</b> quickly erected <b>internal</b> <b>network.</b> In this paper, we describe how a web site can attack home routers from the inside and mount sophisticated pharming attacks that may result in denial of service, malware infection, or identity theft among other things. Our attacks do not exploit any vulnerabilities in the user’s browser. Instead, all they require is that the browser run JavaScript and Java Applets. We also propose countermeasures to defeat this type of malware — new methods that must be used since the traditional technique of employing client-side security software to prevent malware, is not sufficient to stop our proposed attacks. ...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish sport {{movement}} {{is based on}} an idea that everyone is welcome to join and should be able to contribute and effect on those decisions that affects themselves. Although, recent studies show that a large percent of all power positions in the Swedish world of sports is held by men. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the road to a board commission in one of Sweden’s most established sports where a large amount of the practitioners are men. The Swedish federation of Motorbike- and Snowmobile has 81 percent men as their practitioners and 89 percent men of their board members are male. Through interviews with people in the election committee in all six districts of the federation, this study shows the processes and the criterial that is behind a nomination to the districtal board. Overall, the participations show that most of the work behind a recruitment is based on <b>small</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>networks.</b> Not rarely a person that has a finished career of his own is chosen to be the best suited for the job. Strong criterias for a suitable board member is also having knowledge about the sport and to have a lot of time on their hands for the job. The main conclusion of this study is that it’s not that woman are not wanted as board members, but the processes and social constructions about who’s suitable for this kind of job is making it so much harder for a woman to get it. There will always be men on the top of the pyramid in sports if we don’t change the way we recruit people and challenge our mindsets on how a suitable candidate for board membership looks like...|$|R

A home router DMZ host is a single address (e.g., IP address) on the <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> that has all traffic sent to it which is not {{otherwise}} forwarded to other LAN hosts. By definition {{this is not a}} true DMZ (demilitarized zone), since it alone does not separate the host from the <b>internal</b> <b>network.</b> That is, the DMZ host is able to connect to hosts on the <b>internal</b> <b>network,</b> whereas hosts within a real DMZ are prevented from connecting with the <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> by a firewall that separates them, unless the firewall permits the connection.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} in relationship marketing suggests network ties and organisational identification {{to be critical}} factors in member retention and performance (Ahearne et al. 2005; Bhattacharya, 1998). Based on Bendapudi and Berry’s (1997) relationship maintenance model, we test a model within three professional associations (PAs). Results show Reputation and <b>Internal</b> <b>Networks</b> are positively related to Identification leading to member Retention, Advocacy and Performance. Member Performance also {{is directly related to}} <b>Internal</b> <b>Networks.</b> External Networks show no relationship with Identification and are negatively related to <b>Internal</b> <b>Networks,</b> indicating members with extensive external ties tend not to form strong internal relationships. Accordingly, managers should assist PA members in the development of <b>Internal</b> <b>Networks,</b> benefiting both members and PAs simultaneously. 9 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|A {{firewall}} must restrict {{access to}} the <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> but allow external access to services offered to the public, such as web servers on the <b>internal</b> <b>network.</b> This is usually accomplished by creating a separate <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> called a DMZ, a play on the term “demilitarized zone." [...] External devices are allowed to access devices in the DMZ. Devices in the DMZ are usually maintained more carefully to reduce their vulnerability to malware. Hardened devices are sometimes called bastion hosts.|$|R

50|$|Hosts in the DMZ are {{permitted}} to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the <b>internal</b> <b>network,</b> as the content of DMZ is not as secure as the <b>internal</b> <b>network.</b> Similarly communication between hosts in the DMZ and to the external network is also restricted, to make the DMZ more secure than the Internet, and suitable for housing these special purpose services. This allows hosts in the DMZ to communicate with both the <b>internal</b> and external <b>network,</b> while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the DMZ servers and the <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> clients, and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the DMZ from the external network.|$|R

40|$|We {{initiate}} {{the study of}} network monitoring algorithms {{in a class of}} hybrid networks in which the nodes are connected by an external <b>network</b> and an <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> (as a short form for externally and internally controlled network). While the external network lies outside of the control of the nodes (or in our case, the monitoring protocol running in them) and might be exposed to continuous changes, the <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> is fully {{under the control of the}} nodes. As an example, consider a group of users with mobile devices having access to the cell phone infrastructure. While the network formed by the WiFi connections of the devices is an external network (as its structure is not necessarily under the control of the monitoring protocol), the connections between the devices via the cell phone infrastructure represent an <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> (as it can be controlled by the monitoring protocol). Our goal is to continuously monitor properties of the external network with the help of the <b>internal</b> <b>network.</b> We present scalable distributed algorithms that efficiently monitor the number of edges, the average node degree, the clustering coefficient, the bipartiteness, and the weight of a minimum spanning tree. Their performance bounds demonstrate that monitoring the external network state with the help of an <b>internal</b> <b>network</b> can be done much more efficiently than just using the external network, as is usually done in the literature...|$|R
