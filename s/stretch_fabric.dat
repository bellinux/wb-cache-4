The use of cotton made the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on <b>stretch</b> <b>fabric</b> after 1960 simplified construction; alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s. Crochet, lace, PVC, raffia, fur, latex, velvet and other uncommon items are also used as bikini material.|$|E

500|$|Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the {{adolescent}} boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. DuPont introduced lycra (DuPont's name for spandex) {{in the same}} decade. [...] Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits {{could be made to}} fit like a second skin without heavy linings. [...] "The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini," [...] wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." [...] Increased reliance on <b>stretch</b> <b>fabric</b> led to simplified construction. It allowed designers to create the string bikini, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini.

40|$|Product {{variability}} of manufactured leather goods such as garment leathers could be {{closely related to}} the wear comfort because each material forming the garments are affected the comfort properties of the products. Considering the significant demand to elastic woven <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the advantages provided to leather goods like allowing easy body movements, well-fitting and keeping the shape make the use of <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics</b> focus in interest. In this study, the performance properties of stretch leathers, leathers and spandex fabrics were presented and the differences between the characteristic properties of the leathers were described. For this purpose, physical characteristics of leathers were investigated in terms of thickness, weight, drape ability, stiffness, bending stiffness, air and water vapor permeability. The drape ability, stiffness and bending stiffness properties were significantly affected by the <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics</b> laminated on the suede side of the leathers. The drape ability, stiffness and bending values were increased due to the implementation of <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the air permeability values of the leathers prior and after the implementation of <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics</b> in contrast to water vapor permeability. The results of this study showed that the aesthetic behavior of clothing materials such as drape and stiffness properties as well as water vapor permeability was mainly affected from the implementation of the <b>stretch</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R

For the 1965 season, some of {{her most}} memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black and white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers, and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties– just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian era nostalgia. According to Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me, Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on {{a new line of}} fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's [...] "softer" [...] new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In America, TV Guide ran a four-page photospread on Rigg's new [...] "Emmapeeler" [...] outfits (10–16 June 1967).
