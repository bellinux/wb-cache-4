"Freshly-fractured" silica appears to be 2 to 5 times more reactive with animal lung tissue than "weathered" silica, though weathering occurs within several days and with exposure to water.

50|$|The {{engine shed}} {{was not just}} a {{building}} for housing locomotives. It was a combined 'stable', workshop, office and servicing area, often with living accommodation integrated. There were external locomotive facilities such as cleaning pits, water cranes and nearby coaling bunkers. Inside there were <b>sanding</b> <b>facilities.</b> There was a work table and vice, an office with the duty roster, regulations, operating instructions and other reference material as well as clothes lockers and washing facilities for the staff.

50|$|The Eisenbahnmuseum Bochum-Dahlhausen is {{a railway}} museum {{situated}} {{south of the}} city of Bochum in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It was founded by DGEG, the German Railway History Company in 1977 and is based in a locomotive depot that was built between 1916 and 1918 and ceased operation in 1969. Then DGEG took over the whole area of 46,000 square metres and built up the biggest railway museum in Germany. In the middle of the museum, there is an engine shed with fourteen tracks. A preserved turntable, coaling, watering, and <b>sanding</b> <b>facilities</b> are still in operation. This museum is integrated into The Industrial Heritage Trail (Route der Industriekultur) a route of monuments from the history of the industry.|$|E

50|$|Early control {{efforts on}} the complex were {{unsuccessful}} due to dry conditions and high winds. Suppression activities were focused around the oil <b>sands</b> <b>facilities</b> and the hamlet of Fort MacKay on the southern flank of the fire. Back burning operations were conducted to remove unburned fuel and direct the fire. Over 850 personnel and 40 helicopters were assigned, in addition to bomber groups from throughout the province. Crews from across Canada and a small contingent of Mexican firefighters worked on the complex. Control lines were constructed using bulldozers and other heavy equipment.|$|R
