Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not {{and never will be}} is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of the}} playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner."

500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E

2500|$|This {{can be an}} {{important}} factor in some situations, sometimes a [...] "driving factor", since a college {{may be more likely to}} <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> a student likely to matriculate. Accordingly, it has been advised to become knowledgeable about schools being applied to, and [...] "tailor each application accordingly." [...] College visits (including overnight ones), interviews, attending College Fair days, comments in the essay, contacting college faculty members, answering and opening emails, place position of the college on the FAFSA form or its FAFSA position, and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their yield—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment. According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, it is important to have numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done. Schools such as Connecticut College and Emory University have been credited as [...] "popularizing the yield game" [...] by refusing well-qualified students who failed to show much real interest in attending, as a way to boost their yield scores.
