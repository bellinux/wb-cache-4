40|$|Two bar-press {{experiments}} with rats tested {{the rule that}} reducing expectation of reward increases the variation from which reward selects. Experiment 1 used a discrete-trial random-interval schedule, with trials <b>signaled</b> <b>by</b> <b>light</b> or sound. One signal always ended with reward; the other signal ended with reward less often. The 2 signals were randomly mixed. Bar-press duration (how long the bar was held down) varied more during the signal with the lower probability of reward. Experiment 2 closely resembled Experiment 1 but used a random-ratio schedule rather than a random-interval schedule. Again, bar-press duration varied more during the signal with the lower probability of reward. The results support the rule-the first well-controlled comparisons to do so...|$|R

50|$|DMX512-A uses {{a single}} pair of conductors, so can be {{connected}} using the cheaper 3-pin XLR connectors. Some manufacturers made units with three-pin XLR connectors, {{because of their}} lower cost. However, as 3-pin XLRs are commonly used for connecting microphones and sound mixing consoles, there is then a risk of wrongly connecting DMX512 equipment to microphones and other sound equipment. The +48 volt phantom power emitted by mixing consoles could damage DMX512 equipment if connected to it. The DMX512 <b>signals</b> emitted <b>by</b> <b>lighting</b> desks can damage microphones and other sound equipment if connected to it. Hence best practice is to use only 5-pin XLRs for DMX512 signals, to avoid risk of confusion with connectors used for sound signals.|$|R

Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing {{parameters of the}} quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the variation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. We present an intuitive diagrammatic approach for calculating ultrafast spectroscopy <b>signals</b> induced <b>by</b> quantum <b>light,</b> focusing on applications involving entangled photons with nonclassical bandwidth properties - known as "time-energy entanglement". Nonlinear optical <b>signals</b> induced <b>by</b> quantized <b>light</b> fields are expressed using time ordered multipoint correlation functions of superoperators. These are different from Glauber's g- functions for photon counting which use normally ordered products of ordinary operators. Entangled photon pairs are not subjected to the classical Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and spectral resolution.

40|$|Cebus albifrons monkeys {{received}} {{electrical stimulation}} of the hindlimbs {{over a wide range}} of intensities. On trials <b>signalled</b> <b>by</b> a blue <b>light,</b> the animals were permitted to escape shock by pressing a disc, or shock was terminated after 8 sec (free escape). Escape force (disc pressure) was found to increase as stimulation intensity increased well beyond escape threshold, while shock duration curves reached plateau at the mid-range of intensities. The shock duration curves generated by free escape responses should be comparable to pain detection functions obtained by similar operations in humans, and the curves were stable over months of testing, as is generally found in pain-detection studies. On trials <b>signalled</b> <b>by</b> a red <b>light,</b> the animals received intense tail shock immediately after escape responses (punished escape), or, if they endured leg shock for 8 sec without escaping, then they could avoid tail shock with a panel press. The shock duration curves generated by punished escape responses should be comparable to pain tolerance functions as defined for human subjects, and the escape thresholds were considerably higher on red-light trials. As in human studies, the tolerance curves were not stable over repeated testing sessions, and some feature of the paradigm forced a progression toward extremely high levels of tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{a plethora of}} {{mechanisms}} {{to respond to the}} environment and modulate growth and reproduction. Abiotic <b>signals</b> provided <b>by</b> <b>light,</b> temperature and the availability of water, oxygen and nutrients are controlling factors. Many species possess strategies to endure abiotic assaults, and to respond to challenges from bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Although these responses are frequently regulated at the transcriptional level, there is extraordinary diversity in the post-transcriptional mechanisms that promote developmental plasticity and adaptation. The phenomenon of silencing of heterologous genes also involves transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Current research links gene silencing to ordinary post-transcriptional mechanisms as well as defense of viral RNAs. An EMBO Workshop in Leysin, Switzerland, explored the mechanisms, implications and connections of post-transcriptional processes in plants.

40|$|International audienceLuminescence and ESR dating {{methods of}} quartz {{sediment}} {{are based on}} the natural resetting of the <b>signal</b> <b>by</b> <b>light</b> exposure (optical bleaching). When the bleaching is incomplete, a residual dose (DeR) is added to the post-depositional dose accumulated since the deposit and hence the age is overestimated. Insufficient bleaching is usually linked to the environment and conditions of transport/deposition of the quartz grains affecting the light exposure duration. Indeed, each transportation mode – fluvial, marine or aeolian – is associated to specific conditions of light exposure, depending mainly to the location of grains in the transport agent during the transport phase, the opacity of the transport environment and the velocity of the transport. The present study attempts to discriminate the modes of transport/deposition providing a satisfying reset of the ESR signals of quartz grains. For this purpose, we investigated bleaching rates and ESR residual doses of aluminum centers from “present-day” aeolian, fluvial and marine sediments sampled in various sedimentary environments. The bleaching efficiency evaluation in these different environments may help for {{a better understanding of the}} resetting phenomenon for quartz signals which represents presently the main difficulty for ESR dating. The results show that the residual doses are small enough to allow an ESR dating of the main part of the sediment transported in almost all the context examined in this study. The smallest residual doses are obtained from quartz grains within the range of 100 – 200 μm and transported in clear water. Some limits for the application of optically bleached quartz ESR dating appears nevertheless, mainly when the residual dose and the dose accumulated after the deposit are quite similar, i. e. for Upper Pleistocene samples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{simultaneously}} monitored {{changes of}} intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) following different light stimuli from different inner retinal neurons of the turtle retina slice preparation.

40|$|Evolution in Materio (EiM) is {{the concept}} of {{exploiting}} intrinsic properties of various materials, or "black boxes", to perform computation. Motivation for EiM is multitudinous; new paradigms for computing, increased performance, and basic research on what computation is or can be. The work herein is part of the NASCENCE project, which aims at exploring nanoscale devices for computation and, further, how such information processing devices can emerge from bottom-up design processes, e. g. artificial evolution. In EiM research, instability and lack of determinism has been an ongoing problem regarding the evolution of useful computation. Meanwhile there has also been a lack of a clear, distinct border between the mechanism that exploits the material and the material itself. This raises questions like; where does computation arise? In the material, in the interface to the environment, or a combination? In this thesis we have investigated the effect of drawing such a border by designing and implementing a material interface named optowall. This interface electrically isolates the material by using opto-isolators to transmit all <b>signals</b> <b>by</b> <b>light</b> instead of <b>by</b> an electrical connection. An experimental approach has been taken to develop methods to define properties in the material such as stability, functionality, and the nature of instability. By developing software that extracts the values of these properties, we have compared them in different configurations of the interface and found that the method of delivering the signal into the material has a significant effect on the computational properties. Hence, the impact also influence the search landscape for any evolutionary algorithm. We have also discovered that non-linear functionality can be exploited by the adjustment of current. Furthermore we have shown that the potential differences between concurrent input signals {{have a significant effect on}} stability and functionality...|$|R
