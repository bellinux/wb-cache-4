5|$|Through its Global Trade Finance Program, the IFC {{guarantees}} trade payment {{obligations of}} more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions. The Global Trade Finance Program provides guarantees to cover payment risks for emerging market banks regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange, letters of credit, bid and performance bonds, <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> for capital goods imports, and advance payments. The IFC issued $3.46 billion in more than 2,800 guarantees in 2010, of which over 51% targeted IDA member nations. In its fiscal year 2011, the IFC issued $4.6 billion in more than 3,100 guarantees. In 2009, the IFC launched a separate program for crisis response, known as its Global Trade Liquidity Program, which provides liquidity for international trade among developing countries. Since its establishment in 2009, the Global Trade Liquidity Program assisted with over $15 billion in trade in 2011.|$|E

These direct credits must be secured by dollar-denominated promissory notes signed by the importers. If an importer fails to make any payment as agreed, the exporter or assignee (e.g., U.S. financial institution) must submit a notice of default.

50|$|Agricultural {{value chain}} finance is {{concerned}} with the flows of funds to and within a value chain {{to meet the needs of}} chain actors for finance, to secure sales, to buy inputs or produce, or to improve efficiency. Examining the potential for value chain finance involves a holistic approach to analyze the chain, those working in it, and their inter-linkages. These linkages allow financing to flow through the chain. For example, inputs can be provided to farmers and the cost can be repaid directly when the product is delivered, without need for farmers taking a loan from a bank or similar institution. This is common under contract farming arrangements. Types of value chain finance include product financing through trader and input <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> or credit supplied by a marketing company or a lead firm. Other trade finance instruments include receivables financing where the bank advances funds against an assignment of future receivables from the buyer, and factoring in which a business sells its accounts receivable at a discount. Also falling under value chain finance are asset collateralization, such as on the basis of warehouse receipts, and risk mitigation, such as forward contracting, futures and insurance.|$|E
50|$|China is {{involved}} in the development of Pakistan Railways and {{for the past five years}} it has been increasing its stake in the country's communication sector. The freight-passenger earnings comprise 50% of the railway's total revenue. Pakistan Railways carries 65 million passengers annually and operates 228 mail, express and passenger trains daily. It introduced new mail and express trains between major terminals from 2003 to 2005. Pakistan Railways has entered agreements with Chinese railway companies for its development. In 2001, Pakistan Railways signed a $91.89 million contract with China National Machinery Import and Export Corp for the manufacture of 175 new high-speed passenger coaches. The project was funded by Exim Bank China on a <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> basis. Forty completely built passenger coaches have been received and 105 will be assembled in Pakistan Railways' carriage factory by next December. These coaches are being used on Pakistan Railways' mail and express trains from Rawalpindi-Lahore-Karachi, Lahore-Faisalabad and Rawalpindi-Quetta. The manufacturing kits for the remaining 30 coaches have also been received and manufacturing is in progress with 12 already assembled. The technology transfer for these coaches has been obtained from China's Chang Chun Car Co. Under an agreement signed with China in 2003, Pakistan Railways purchased 69 locomotives, of which 15 were delivered as completely built units and are in use by Pakistan Railways. The remaining 54 are to be built at Pakistan Railways' locomotive factory. The Chinese locomotives are 37% cheaper than the European locomotives. Some in Pakistan have been criticizing the faulty locomotives purchased by Pakistan Railways from Dongfang Electric Corporation of China. Pakistan Railways have decided to purchase 45 more 2,000-3,000-horsepower locomotives from the same company. The company is willing to redesign the already-delivered 30 locomotives of the original order, such that the underframe is strengthened and the weight reduced to less than 140 tons. A Chinese company, Beijing Research and Design Institute, is committed to providing 300 rail cars to Pakistan Railways.|$|E

Using firm-level data from five African countries, I show <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> is {{positively correlated with}} capacity utilization; the result continues to hold when credit access is instrumented using supplier characteristics.

40|$|Integrated {{logistics}} {{and financial}} services have been practiced by third party logistics (3 PL) firms for years; however, the literature has been silent {{on the value of}} 3 PL firms as credit providers in budget-constrained supply chains. This paper investigates an extended supply chain model with a supplier, a budget-constrained retailer, a bank, and a 3 PL firm, in which the retailer has insufficient initial budget and may borrow or obtain trade credit from either a bank (traditional role) or a 3 PL firm (control role). Our analysis indicates that the control role model yields higher profits not only for the 3 PL firm but also for the supplier, the retailer, and the entire supply chain. In comparison with a <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> model where the supplier provides the trade credit, the control role model yields a better performance for the supply chain as long as the 3 PL firm’s marginal profit is greater than that of the supplier. We further demonstrate that, for all players, both the control role and <b>supplier</b> <b>credit</b> models can outperform the classic newsvendor model without budget constraint...|$|E

Since all cash outflows related to inventory control that occur at different points of time have different values, we use the discount cash-flow (or DCF) approach to establish the models, and obtain the optimal ordering policies to the problem. We find that the DCF approach is not only simple to understand but also easy to identify which alternative is less cost. In addition, we also characterize the optimal solution and provide the closed-form solution to the problem. Furthermore, we also compare the optimal order quantity under <b>supplier</b> <b>credits</b> with the classical economic order quantity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} financial markets in Mexico after 1994 and finds {{that there has been}} a reduction in the depth of the traditional financial markets.

Key questions are: where are firms getting financing; are these sources of finance sustainable, and will investment and monetary policies be affected? We find that contrary to the bank vs. market literature, traditional financial markets are complements rather than substitutes.

Using unique cross-sectional survey data of Japanese SMEs, we conduct a deep investigation into the substitutability between bank loans and trade credit. This survey contains rich information on the <b>suppliers</b> of trade <b>credit</b> to SMEs, thus enabling the examination of the channel through which credit is provided from suppliers to customers. We find that SMEs with little access to bank credit depend more on large <b>suppliers</b> for trade <b>credit.</b> We also find that when a purchase is made from a large <b>supplier,</b> more <b>credit</b> is indeed provided in the form of trade credit. Furthermore, this channel of <b>credit</b> from large <b>suppliers</b> to SMEs is only observed for solvent customers, not for insolvent customers.
