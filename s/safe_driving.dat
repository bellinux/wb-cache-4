5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Safe</b> <b>Driving</b> Awards were {{presented}} to encourage <b>safe</b> <b>driving.</b> Initially they were given out every year that an officer went without having an accident. This practice ceased. Subsequently, <b>Safe</b> <b>Driving</b> Awards were revived in five year blocks instead of every year with awards being available in five year blocks, with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 year awards. The 10 year pin has a silver star in its center, followed by the 15 with 2 stars, 20 with 3 stars and 25 with 4 stars.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the differences in underlying factors of Zagreb cycling, compared to the "types of cyclists" (driving style), i. e. different ways of using bicycles as a means of transport. The study included over 3, 000 frequent participants in urban traffic cycling, sample of members of the association Cyclist Union (N = 1259) and snowball sample of "typical" of cyclists, i. e. people who are using the bike, but are not the members of the Cyclist Union (N = 1831), using the conveniently assembled questionnaire. Study participants who bike used in various applications prefer the <b>safest</b> <b>driving</b> style (only on sidewalks and bike paths / lines). Barriers of the weather conditions are ubiquitous in the <b>safest</b> <b>driving</b> style. Daily, weekly and yearly riding a bicycle are more often found in those who prefer the <b>safest</b> <b>driving</b> style. Cyclists who drive with medium secure style (roads with less traffic and lower speeds), more often ride a bike, as compared with those who prefer the <b>safest</b> <b>driving</b> style. Having a better bike line / track and other infrastructure is the most often considered at those with the highest risk driving style. The results provide the guidance for local authorities and for the cyclists to improve the conditions for a safer and more often by bicycle circulation in the City of Zagreb and its surroundings...|$|R

25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be in contact with the road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Regular {{users of}} the highway have {{suggested}} that poor driving {{is to blame for}} the majority of collisions, with impatient drivers making poor decisions. [...] Local MLA Mike Allen stated that he has seen drivers taking unnecessary risks every time he has driven on the highway. [...] An Alberta Transportation spokeswoman in 2012 stated that Highway63's collision rate is below the provincial average for two-lane highways, though the metric does not account for the percentage of those collisions that are fatal. [...] Alberta implemented aerial enforcement on multiple highways to catch speeders and reckless drivers in 2012, including Highway63. The Coalition for a Safer 63 and 881 was created in an attempt to increase awareness and encourage <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> on the highway and neighbouring Highway881.

2500|$|The studies {{conducted}} by Ludwig, Geller, and colleagues focused on inducing drivers to use safety belts and turn signals {{and to come}} to a complete stop at intersections. The interventions assessed in this research included awareness-raising, safety pledges, individual and group goal-setting (with goals assigned by managers or developed by workers), directives from management, and individual and group competitions for rewards. [...] In general, the researchers found that high-involvement interventions were effective in changing the targeted behaviour, and that in some cases these also seemed to be associated with positive changes in other <b>safe</b> <b>driving</b> behaviours. [...] In addition, individualized public feedback was more effective than generic feedback, and worked well for those who were initially non-compliant with low-level, non-intrusive interventions. When external consequences were discontinued, compliance was not sustained. The researchers recommended that organizations begin with low-intensity, low-cost interventions such as group meetings, signage, or other media, progressing to more intrusive interventions for those who fail to respond to low-level interventions. They also noted that those who comply initially can be enlisted as agents of change who can influence co-workers, family, and friends to drive safely.|$|E

50|$|But {{apart from}} their {{personal}} significance, these memorials {{also serve as a}} reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage <b>safer</b> <b>driving.</b> In the 1940s and 1950s, the Arizona State Highway Patrol began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police.
