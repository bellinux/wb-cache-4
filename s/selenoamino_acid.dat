Three <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> could be baseline-separated from 19 amino acids using gradient elution conditions for amino acids and determined under new six-potential waveform.

Niboshi is processed from Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and commonly used to prepare soup stock for Japanese dishes. In this study, we characterized selenium species in the Niboshi extract by ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry. Selenium species in the Niboshi were more extractable by polar solvents (water and ethanol) than an apolar one (hexane) along with amino acids and proteinous species.

A pre-column derivatization of <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> with o-phthalaldehyde was necessary for their determination.

Reactions of bromine- 80 activated by radiative neutron capture and bromine- 82 activated by isomeric transition were investigated in aqueous solutions of bromomethane and 1 -bromobutane. Bromine- 80 organic yields decreased with decreasing solute concentrations. The tendency for aggregation of the solute molecules diminished as the solute concentration approached zero where the probable state of the solute approached a monomolecular dispersion. Unlike reactions of 80 Br born by 79 Br(n,γ) 80 Br reaction, the total organic product yields resulting from the 82 mBr(I. T.) 82 Br process showed no solute concentration dependence.

30|$|Despite the {{sizeable}} interest, the metabolism of selenium {{by higher}} fungi remains poorly understood. This process is most widely characterized in plants, motivating us to compare our {{data on the}} biosynthesis of Se-methyl-seleno-l-cysteine in L. edodes with reports concerning plants. According to Ellis and Salt (Ellis and Salt 2003), plants primarily take up selenium as selenate or selenite, which are then metabolized via the sulfur assimilation pathway to yield selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and other selenium analogs of various sulfur metabolites. Non-specific incorporation of <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> into proteins is thought to contribute to selenium toxicity (Ellis et al. 2004). A proposed mechanism of selenium tolerance in plants is the specific conversion of potentially toxic <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> into non-protein derivatives such as Se-methyl-seleno-l-cysteine (Wang et al. 1999).

40|$|The {{research}} study {{was divided into}} two main objectives, the chemical characterization and speciation of organic selenium species in cultivated selenium-enriched Agaricus bisporus mushroom and the biological evaluation of the organic Se species using a rat model. The biological evaluation of the mushroom organic Se species determined the effect of dietary supplementation with mushroom Se on the colonic antioxidant selenoprotein status markers cytosolic glutathione peroxidase- 1 (GPx- 1), gastrointestinal tract glutathione peroxidase- 2 (GPx- 2), thioredoxin reductase- 1 (TrxR- 1) and selenoprotein P (SeP). Furthermore, dietary effects of the mushroom organic Se supplementation on gut physiological function, (ileal) mucosal permeability and antioxidant selenoenzymes status during heat induced oxidative stress in rats were evaluated. We also evaluated the effects of dietary Se supplementation with the mushroom Se and with or without additional α-tocopherol on the regulation of the expression of colonic selenoproteins GPx- 1, GPx- 2, TrxR- 1 and SeP in hyperthermally induced oxidative stress in rat. Selenocystine (SeCys), selenomethionine (SeMet), and methyl-selenocysteine (MeSeCys) were separated, identified and quantified by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry from water solubilised and acetone precipitated proteins. Although all three <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> were detected for both the control and selenium-enriched mushrooms, significant increases of the <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> were observed for the selenium-enriched mushrooms. The most notable result was the much higher levels of SeCys accumulated by A. bisporus compared to SeMet and MeSeCys, for both control and selenium-enriched A. bisporus. The maximum <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> concentration recorded in caps and stalks of control/selenised mushrooms was 4. 16 / 9. 65 µg/g dried weight (DW) for SeCys, 0. 08 / 0. 58 µg/g DW for SeMet, and 0. 031 / 0. 10 µg/g DW for MeSeCys, respectively. The protein bound selenocysteine rich mushroom Se fed to the rats was observed to up-regulate all colonic selenoproteins under study. Rats maintained under thermoneutral conditions and fed the mushroom Se in dietary supplementation at a 1 µg Se/g feed showed a significant (P< 0. 05) fold increase in mRNA expression relative to the basal treatment (rats fed the control diet) of GPx- 1 (2. 98 ± 0. 82), GPx- 2 (1. 8 ± 1. 4), TrxR- 1 (1. 83 ± 0. 64) and SeP (2. 77 ± 0. 92). However, supplementation with α-tocopherol alone under thermoneutral conditions only affected the expression of GPx- 1 (1. 83 ± 0. 82) and SeP (2. 21 ± 0. 92) and no effect was observed with GPx- 2 and TrxR- 1. Rats exposed to heat stress and placed on the low Se control diet also showed a significant (P< 0. 05) fold increase in mRNA expression relative to the basal treatment for all colonic selenoproteins at GPx- 1 (3. 15 ± 0. 82), GPx- 2 (1. 6 ± 1. 4), TrxR- 1 (1. 55 ± 0. 64) and SeP (1. 93 ± 0. 92). However, heat stressed rats on the mushroom Se diet displayed a much higher mRNA expression of GPx- 2 (3. 2 ± 1. 4) and SeP (4. 23 ± 0. 92). Heat stressed rats placed on the α-tocopherol diet alone displayed the highest expression level of selenoproteins relative to all diets with TrxR- 1 at 4. 10 ± 0. 64 and SeP at 7. 44 ± 0. 92 fold increase. In correlation with mRNA expression, GPx- 1 activity was observed to increase in rats placed on the mushroom Se diet and maintained under thermoneutral conditions, however in contrast with mRNA expression, GPx- 1 activity was not up-regulated by α-tocopherol alone. Heat stress was observed to {{have a negative impact}} on GPx- 1 activity which was recovered by mushroom Se, but not by α-tocopherol, in the diet. Although supplementation with α-tocopherol to the mushroom Se diet also displayed an increase in GPx- 1 activity under thermoneutral conditions and also restored GPx- 1 activity during heat stress, α-tocopherol did not enhance the Se effect. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with Se-enriched A. bisporus mushroom (1 µg Se/g feed) reduced (P < 0. 05) gut (ileum) permeability markers baseline short-circuit current (Isc) and epithelium conductance (Ge) during heat stress to 1. 74 and 1. 91 fold, respectively, indicating protection from heat stress-induced mucosal permeability increase and restoration of gut barrier function. Thus, Se-enriched A. bisporus mushroom presented an efficient source of functional organic Se with demonstrated beneficial biological effects of up-regulating gut antioxidant selenoproteins linked to anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and disease prevention and protection against heat induced oxidative stress and gut dysfunction and injury.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this non-protein <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acid</b> in preventing and treating cancer (Bhattacharya 2011; Rayman 2005; Rayman 2012). Se-methyl-seleno-l-cysteine in garlic and broccoli has been shown to more efficiently reduce the incidence of mammary and colon cancer in rats than selenomethionine in yeast or broccoli supplemented with selenite (Finley et al. 2001). This effect may be due to {{substantial differences}} in the mechanisms of chemoprevention by Se-methyl-seleno-l-cysteine and other selenocompounds (Suzuki et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, selenocystine, a nutritionally {{available}} <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acid,</b> {{was identified}} {{for the first}} time as a novel agent with anti proliferative activity on human keloids. The 20 μM concentration after 48 h treatment used here was the most effective to reduce keloid fibroblast growth. We analyzed the gene expression profile of selenocystine treatment response in keloid fibroblasts by the microarray system to characterize the effects of selenocystine on human keloids. The major alterations in keloid fibroblasts following selenocystine exposure included up-regulation of the genes encoding cell death and transcription factors. Prominent down-regulation of genes involved in development, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton, as well as extra cellular matrix genes, usually strongly up-regulated in keloids, resulted following selenocystine exposure. The range of the down-regulated genes and the degree of the decreased expression appeared to be correlated with the degree of the morphological alterations in selenocystine treated keloids...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploration}} of selenium containing herbs {{was carried out}} in the Kerinci -Sumatera, Toraja highland-Sulawesi and Rinjani-Lombok. The herbs were sampled according to their morfofisiological characters and local etnopharmalogical information. The analitical parameters were the selenium and selenomethionine content as measured by AAS and GC respectively, gluthathione peroxidase as measured biochemically dan cell model shrinkage observation to reveal the selenium containing extract effect on celluler development. The result indicates the diversity of both content and functional selenium compounds in the selected herbs. The relatively high selenium content herbs such as A Ilium sativuin 1 NHR had hingher gluthathione peroxidase and hence its antioxidant activity. However the relatively lower selenium content of Physalis angulata 33 NHR was able to induce more cell model shrinkage. The phenomenon of relation among selenium based <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acid,</b> antioxidant and cell shrinkage potential need to be futher studied on these selected herbs...|$|E
40|$|Selenium (Se) {{plays an}} {{indispensable}} role in human nutrition {{and has been}} implicated to have important health benefits, including being a cancer preventative agent. While different forms of Se vary in their anticarcinogenic efficacy, Se-methylselenocysteine (SeMSC) has been demonstrated {{to be one of}} the most effective chemopreventative compounds. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is known for its ability to accumulate high levels of Se with the majority of the <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> in the form of Se-methylselenocysteine. Therefore, it serves as a good model to study the regulation of SeMSC accumulation in plants. A cDNA encoding selenocysteine Se-methyltransferase, the key enzyme responsible for SeMSC formation, was cloned from broccoli using a homocysteine S-methyltransferase gene probe from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). This clone, designated as BoSMT, was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and its identity was confirmed by its substrate specificity in the methylation of selenocysteine. The BoSMT gene represents a single copy sequence in the broccoli genome. Examination of BoSMT gene expression and SeMSC accumulation in response to selenate, selenite, and sulfate treatments showed that the BoSMT transcript and SeMSC synthesis were significantly up-regulated in plants exposed to selenate but were low in plants supplied with selenite. Simultaneous treatment of selenate with selenite significantly reduced SeMSC production. In addition, high levels of sulfate suppressed selenate uptake, resulting in a dramatic reduction of BoSMT mRNA level and SeMSC accumulation. Our results reveal that SeMSC accumulation closely correlated with the BoSMT gene expression and the total Se status in tissues and provide important information for maximizing the SeMSC production in this beneficial vegetable plant...|$|R
40|$|Selenium {{has been}} shown to have {{multiple}} biochemical effects ranging from nutrient deficiency at low levels to toxicity at high levels. This duality of concern has led to a demand for increased numbers of highly accurate and precise determinations of selenium in biological materials. A convenient procedure was developed for determining <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> by HPLC-THG-AAS, based on the derivatization of these analytes with Sanger's reagent. Selenomethionine, selenocystine and selenocysteine (after blocking the free selenol group with phenylmercurio cation) were converted to their N- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl derivatives, and separated on a Nucleosil 5 -NO$ sb 2 $ column with methanolic mobile phase containing acetic acid and triethylamine. Furthermore, an improved HPLC-AAS interface design was modified and optimized for the detection of selenium in HPLC column eluate. The new design was (i) compatible with aqueous mobile phases containing volatile buffers and (ii) provided equivalent molar response to analytes containing Se($-$II), Se(+IV) and Se(+VI). A method for simultaneously determination of selenate, selenite, selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine was developed by using the HPLC-AAS system with aqueous acetic acid containing ammonium acetate as eluate solution on the cyanopropyl column. The equivalent low ng limits of detection (1 - 2 ng as Se) for different oxidation states of selenium analytes were obtained using several different mobile phases and/or columns. A phenol extraction procedure for selenate, selenite, selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine was evaluated for the determination of these selenium analytes in natural waters and wheat samples. The current HPLC-AAS system provides an inexpensive alternative to conventional techniques for the determination of selenium analytes in environmental samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} trace element, selenium (Se), {{has multiple}} biological activities, which {{depend on the}} level of Se intake. Relatively low Se intakes determine the expression of selenoenzymes in which it serves as an essential constituent. Higher intakes have been shown to have anti-tumorigenic potential; and very high Se intakes can produce adverse effects. This hierarchy of biological activities calls for biomarkers informative at different levels of Se exposure. Some Se-biomarkers, such as the selenoproteins and particularly GPX 3 and SEPP 1, provide information about function directly and are of value in identifying nutritional Se deficiency and tracking responses of deficient individuals to Se-treatment. They are useful under conditions of Se intake within the range of regulated selenoprotein expression, e. g., for humans < 55 μg/day and for animals < 20 μg/kg diet. Other Se-biomarkers provide information indirectly through inferences based on Se levels of foods, tissues, urine or feces. They can indicate the likelihood of deficiency or adverse effects, but they do not provide direct evidence of either condition. Their value is in providing information about Se status over a wide range of Se intake, particularly from food forms. There is need for additional Se biomarkers particularly for assessing Se status in non-deficient individuals for whom the prospects of cancer risk reduction and adverse effects risk are the primary health considerations. This would include determining whether supranutritional intakes of Se may be required for maximal selenoprotein expression in immune surveillance cells. It would also include developing methods to determine low molecular weight Se-metabolites, i. e., <b>selenoamino</b> <b>acids</b> and methylated Se-metabolites, which to date have not been detectable in biological specimens. Recent analytical advances using tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry suggest prospects for detecting these metabolites...|$|R
