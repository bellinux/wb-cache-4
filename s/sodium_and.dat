5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. <b>Sodium</b> <b>and</b> iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E

50|$|Household bleach is, in general, a {{solution}} containing 3-8% <b>sodium</b> hypochlorite <b>and</b> 0.01-0.05% <b>sodium</b> hydroxide; the sodium hydroxide {{is used to}} slow the decomposition of sodium hypochlorite into <b>sodium</b> chloride <b>and</b> <b>sodium</b> chlorate.|$|R
5|$|Rocks from Incapillo {{are rich}} in <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> have high ratios of {{lanthanum}} and samarium to ytterbium and high ratios of barium to lanthanum, as well as high lead-206 to lead-204 and strontium-87/strontium-86 ratios. These rare-earth element patterns {{are similar to the}} Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks. The changes occurred {{at the same time as}} the arc migrated eastward, terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt. The element ratios are pronouncedly arc-like with some adakitic signatures. The rocks contain considerably more <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> alumina than almost all Central Andes siliceous volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form many {{intermetallic}} compounds {{with each other}} and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, such as the sodium amalgams with mercury, including Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The eutectic mixture melts at −12.6°C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% <b>sodium,</b> <b>and</b> 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78°C.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium, NaK is {{a liquid}} {{used as a}} heat-transfer medium and a {{desiccant}} for producing dry and air-free solvents.

5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E

5|$|Indium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two {{in terms of its}} properties. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic {{elements}} play critical {{roles in}} metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium) while others function at minute concentrations.

5|$|Lithium has a {{very low}} density (0.534 g/cm3), {{comparable}} with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only two thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium.|$|E
5|$|Lithium, <b>sodium,</b> <b>and</b> {{potassium}} {{have many}} applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Most {{alkali metals}} have many {{different}} applications.

A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits light very efficiently. Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. <b>Sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the four}} major {{elements}} in seawater – hydrogen, oxygen, <b>sodium,</b> <b>and</b> chlorine – only sodium takes on intense, short-term radioactivity {{with the addition of}} a single neutron to its nucleus: common sodium-23 becomes radioactive sodium-24, with a 15-hour half-life. In six days its intensity drops a thousandfold, but the corollary of short half-life is high initial intensity. Other isotopes were produced from seawater: hydrogen-3 (half-life 12 years) from hydrogen-2, oxygen-17 (stable) from oxygen-16, and chlorine-36 (301 thousand years) from chlorine-35, and some trace elements, but due to low abundance or low short-term intensity (long half-life) they were considered insignificant compared with sodium-24.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>and</b> {{potassium}} {{occur in}} {{water in the}} Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably more common than potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter.

5|$|Sodium forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. <b>Sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with sodium.
