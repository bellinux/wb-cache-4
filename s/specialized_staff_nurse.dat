40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} key {{variables}} used {{in research on}} <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and patient outcomes {{from the perspective of}} an international panel. DESIGN: A Delphi survey (November 2005 -February 2006) of a purposively-selected expert panel from 10 countries consisting of 24 researchers <b>specializing</b> in <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and quality of health care and 8 nurse administrators. METHODS: Each participant was sent by e-mail an up-to-date review of all evidence related to 39 patient-outcome, 14 nurse-staffing and 31 background variables and asked to rate the importance/usefulness of each variable for research on <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and patient outcomes. In two subsequent rounds the group median, mode, frequencies, and earlier responses were sent to each respondent. FINDINGS: Twenty-nine participants responded to the first round (90. 6 %), of whom 28 (87. 5 %) responded to the second round. The Delphi panel generated 7 patient-outcome, 2 nurse-staffing and 12 background variables in the first round, not well-investigated in previous research, {{to be added to the}} list. At the end of the second round the predefined level of consensus (85 %) was reached for 32 patient outcomes, 10 <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> measures and 29 background variables. The highest consensus levels regarding measure sensitivity to <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> were found for nurse perceived quality of care, patient satisfaction and pain, and the lowest for renal failure, cardiac failure, and central nervous system complications. Nursing Hours per Patient Day received the highest consensus score as a valid measure of the number of <b>nursing</b> <b>staff.</b> As a skill mix variable the proportion of RNs to total <b>nursing</b> <b>staff</b> achieved the highest consensus level. Both age and comorbidities were rated as important background variables by all the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a snapshot of the state of the science on nurse-staffing and patient-outcomes research as of 2005. The results portray an area of nursing science in evolution and an understanding of the connections between human resource issues and healthcare quality based on both empirical findings and opinion. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Hospitals are {{challenged}} to understand {{factors related to}} <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> retention {{in the context of}} the nursing shortage slowdown (Huselid, 1995; Mancino, 2008; Mancino, 2009). Leadership is a major factor in organizational success (Gandossy 2 ̆ 6 Guarnieri, 2008; Gettler, 2003; Wooten 2 ̆ 6 Crane, 2003) and nurse managers are the direct link between the executive nurse leaders and the registered nurses (RN) in the staff position (Taunton, Boyle, Woods, Hansen, 2 ̆ 6 Bott, 1997). Studies show that nurse manager leader behaviors influence <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction (Blegen, 1993; Irvine 2 ̆ 6 Evans, 1995; Lashinger 2 ̆ 6 Finegan, 2005). A primary role of the nurse leader is to plan strategies for recruiting nursing personnel and to prevent rapid and frequent turnover of <b>nursing</b> <b>staff</b> (American <b>Nurses</b> Association [ANA] Nursing Administration Scope and Standards of Practice, 2009). Nurse managers are in a position to influence <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> 2 ̆ 7 job satisfaction and retention through their leader behaviors. McGuire and Kennerly (2006) and Brown and Reilly (2009) conducted studies that show managers perceive their leadership behaviors different than those who reported to them. Bass and Avolio (2004) pointed out that leadership is in the 2 ̆ 7 eye of the beholder 2 ̆ 7 and the leadership behavior ratings represented the people 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of leaders (p. 9). Understanding the <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> perception of their nurse manager leadership behaviors that are related to <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction will contribute to improving <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> retention strategies. The Magnet Recognition program is one approach to improving <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction and retention. The Magnet Recognition program (Magnet) considers that the nurse leaders are the key to nursing excellence (American Nurses Credentialing Center [ANCC], n. d.). The sample population for this study was <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> in an acute care hospital applying for Magnet Recognition status. The purpose of this correlational research study was to describe the relationship between the <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> perception of their nurse manager leadership behaviors associated with both the facets of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction (job satisfaction with: work on present job, pay, promotion, supervision, and co-workers) and <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> overall job satisfaction and the relationship between the facets of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction and <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> overall job satisfaction in an acute care hospital applying for Magnet Recognition status (Magnet status). The intent to depart is conceptually and empirically shown to be a direct antecedent to actual turnover. Overall job satisfaction and turnover are inversely related. Brodke et al. (2009) reported overall job satisfaction was the best predictor of intent to quit. Many studies examined facets of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction but the researcher identified that few if any studies examined nurse manager leadership behaviors related to facets of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> job satisfaction and <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> overall job satisfaction in a hospital in the process of applying for Magnet status...|$|R
40|$|Nurses 2 ̆ 7 lack of {{autonomy}} {{has been identified}} as a leading cause of job dissatisfaction, but attempts to increase satisfaction by increasing autonomy have not always been successful. This survey of 356 randomly selected <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and 130 head nurses from 16 hospitals extends previous work by identifying the preferred level of involvement in 21 patient care and 21 unit operation decisions. <b>Staff</b> <b>nurses</b> agreed on 60 percent of the decisions and, in general, preferred independent decision-making for patient care decisions and shared decision-making for unit operation. Head <b>nurses</b> indicated that <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> should have a higher level {{of autonomy}} than the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> indicated for themselves...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} behaviors strongly {{influence the}} job satisfaction of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and {{an extremely important}} factor {{for the prevention of}} burnout and the promotion of retention. Additionally, among internal factors that may affect worker's mental health, a sense of coherence (SOC) is an important concept from the view of the salutogenic theory and stress recognition style. Individual's SOC increases in relation to recognition behavior. However, in Japan, few studies have examined the effect of recognition behaviors on the SOC of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> perceive recognition behaviors of the nurse manager and to determine the relationship between recognition behaviors and the staff nurses’ SOC. This quantitative, cross-sectional study involved 10 hospitals in Japan. A total of 1425 nurses completed the questionnaire. As a result, the perceptions of nurse manager's recognition behaviors by <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> were evaluated by presentation and report, individual value and the transfer of responsibility, and professional development. The median score of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> SOC- 13 was 50 (IQR; 45 – 55). Significant differences in SOC scores were found in marital status, age, years of experience, and mental and physical health condition. In conclusion, recognition behaviors by the nurse manager can improve <b>staff</b> <b>nurse's</b> SOC and effectively support the mental health of the <b>staff</b> <b>nurse...</b>|$|R

40|$|Enhancing {{involvement}} in organizational decisions is one strategy {{to improve the}} work environment of registered nurses and to increase their recruitment and retention. Little {{is known about the}} type of decision making and the level of involvement nurses desire. This was a descriptive study exploring <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> and nurse manager ratings of actual and preferred decisional involvement and differences between <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and nurse managers. A sample of 320 RNs from a Midwestern health care network was surveyed using the Decisional Involvement Scale. <b>Nurse</b> managers and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> had statistically significant differences in their perceptions of who was involved in actual decision making in the areas of unit governance and leadership and collaboration or liaison activities.

40|$|<b>Staff</b> <b>nurses</b> should possess job {{satisfaction}} {{to ensure that}} quality nursing care {{is given to the}} patients. Job satisfaction is important so that productivity does not fall and turnover of personal is not high. Hence, a cross sectional study was carried out among the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> in Kuala Lumpur Hospital to determine the factors influencing {{job satisfaction}} and intention to resign. Seven units were chosen by simple random and proportionate sampling was done to get 330 <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Data was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. The response rate was 92. 4 %. Based on ethnicity, 77. 4 % of the respondents were Malay, 15. 4 % Chinese and 7. 2 % Indians. Generally, respondents were dissatisfied with workload and rewards while they were satisfied with interpersonal staff relationships and with status and autonomy. Meanwhile they had neutral attitude towards career development. This study found that 56. 4 % of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> were generally satisfied while 27. 6 % were dissatisfied with their jobs and the remainder were neutral. With regards to intention to resign within the next one year. 28. 9 % of the respondents had no intention to resign at all while 19. 3 % of respondents had 100 % intention to resign from their jobs. Initial analysis found no associations between the social demography factors like ethnicity, age, marital status, duration of service as <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> income and duration of contract as <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> with general job satisfaction (p > 0. 05). There were associations between the social demography factors as mention above toget 11 er wit 11 general job satisfaction with intention to resign. From the multiple linear regression analysis, predictors of intention to resign were ethnicity, age, duration of service as <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and general job satisfaction. It is hope that the findings of t 11 jS study will be helpful to the organization of Kuala Lumpur Hospital in addressing the problems of the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and hence improve the job satisfaction among the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Acute care {{settings}} {{continue to be}} the primary setting for undergraduate nursing education clinical experiences. <b>Staff</b> <b>nurses</b> in acute {{care settings}} are expected to provide nursing care with pre-licensure nursing students at their side (even though there are little to no incentives for <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> to provide mentoring leadership), which most often takes the form of professional role modeling. In addition, there is no clear evaluative expectation that motivates <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> to provide contextual role modeling. Without stated expectations, <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> perception of the significance of role modeling for pre-licensure non-precepted nursing students may be deficient. Because fifty-six percent of registered nurses are employed in hospital settings, the purpose of this DNP project was to assess <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> perception of professional role modeling for pre-licensure nursing students in the hospital-based clinical learning environment. Information gleaned was used to create a tool to be used by nurse administrators to evaluate <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> who work with non-precepted nursing student that includes role modeling expectations. A mixed method design was used to explore <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> perception of professional role modeling in the clinical learning environment. A convenience sample of <b>staff</b> registered <b>nurses</b> (RNs) employed on a number of medical and surgical inpatient units at a Midwest pediatric hospital was the target population. A 10 -item questionnaire containing a 5 -point Likert type scale was accessible using an online survey platform to determine the participant’s perception of each statement about professional role modeling.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} sleep {{quality of}} hospital <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> both by subjective questionnaire and objective measures. Methods. Female <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> at a regional teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan were recruited. The Chinese {{version of the}} pittsburgh sleep quality index (C-PSQI) {{was used to assess}} subjective sleep quality, and an electrocardiogram-based cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) technique was used to analyze objective sleep stability.

40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} psychometric {{properties}} of a newly developed measure of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> clinical leadership derived from Kouzes and Posner 2 ̆ 7 s model of transformational leadership. BACKGROUND: While nurses have been recognized for their essential role in keeping patients safe, there has been little empirical research that has examined clinical leadership at the <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> level. METHODS: A non-experimental survey design was used to test {{the psychometric properties}} of the clinical leadership survey (CLS). Four hundred and eighty registered nurses (RNs) providing direct patient care in Ontario acute care hospitals returned useable questionnaires. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis provided preliminary evidence for the construct validity for the new measure of <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> clinical leadership. Structural empowerment fully mediated the relationship between <b>nursing</b> leadership and <b>staff</b> <b>nurse</b> clinical leadership.
