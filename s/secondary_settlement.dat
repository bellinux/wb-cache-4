Consequently, these settlements can {{play a key role in}} performance, serviceability, and safety of engineering works such as buildings, roads, embankments, and pipelines. This paper addresses the development of a predictive settlement model for a railway embankment built on soft clayey–peaty soils by following an original procedure consisting of three cascading steps: (i) preliminary detection of the most settlement-affected portions of the infrastructure; (ii) development of an equivalent subsoil model to study secondary settlements; (iii) back-calculation of the parameters of a predictive settlement model (design subsoil model) via a variational data assimilation scheme that exploits ground displacement measurements derived from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) data. The main achievement relies on the retrieval of a stochastic prediction of <b>secondary</b> <b>settlements</b> that can contribute to rationalize both conventional monitoring campaigns and management of key infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Sabkha {{soils are}} coastal and inland saline {{deposits}} of arid climates consisting mainly of loosely cemented sandy silt to silty clay particles. Invariably the soils contain an appreciable amount of organic material and, therefore, characterized by being highly compressible. In this paper, the secondary consolidation {{behavior of a}} typical sabkha formation from the Southwestern region of Saudi Arabia was experimentally investigated. Series of long-term one-dimensional consolidation tests were conducted on undisturbed samples taken from the compressible sabkha layer. The results of this laboratory investigation, substantiated by existing field data, indicated that {{a significant part of}} sabkha settlement takes place as a secondary compression. The coefficient of secondary compression was estimated and the Cα/Cc concept was found to be applicable to this unusual soil formation, with the value of Cα/Cc ratio being within the range reported in the literature. The applicability of the Cα/Cc concept to the compressible sabkha soils was further examined by comparing the <b>secondary</b> <b>settlements</b> as predicted by the concept with the <b>secondary</b> <b>settlements</b> measured directly in the field from an instrumented field test embankment. A reasonable agreement has been found between predictions and field observations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Peat usually undergo large <b>secondary</b> <b>settlements</b> {{depending}} {{on the amount of}} organic content present in the soil. This is because of its special microstructure. The microstructure of peat has interdependence with mechanical and physical characteristics, such as compressive and tensile strength, and water retention. In the present research, peat samples were admixed with different concentrations of cement to enhance its physical, chemical, electrical, and microstructural properties. As a result, the surface electrical of the peat colloids influence the rate of flocculation, and in turn further strength achievement. The results is in contrary with the microstructural analysis that performed by SEM and EDX on the treated peat. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The first Anglo-Saxon {{settlements}} in England {{were created by}} the invaders themselves.

40|$|Special {{consideration}} {{should be}} given to <b>secondary</b> consolidation <b>settlements</b> during service in the construction of high road embankments in lands underlain by thick layers of soft peaty clay.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Discharge {{capacity}} {{is the most}} important factor to evaluate the well resistance of prefabricated vertical (PV) drains. In this study, large-scale test apparatus were devised to investigate the accurate discharge capacity of plastic board drain (PBD) and fiber drain (FD). A series of laboratory flow test of PBD and FD has been carried out to evaluate those discharge capacities with same condition in the field. Drain sample length tested ranging from 0. 7 m to 30 m by confining the drain in clay. It is found that discharge capacity qw of PV drains decreases with increasing the confining pressure, the hydraulic gradient, and drain length. It is strongly recommended that for determining the design value of qw and kw the discharge capacity test should be performed using a half sample length of real field depth. It is found out that well resistance calculated from Onoue’s equation is underestimated comparing to that of Hansbo’s one. 1 INTODUCTION One of the largest changes {{in the last ten years}} of the use of prefabricated vertical (PV) drains and has been the change in terminology and common acceptance of their use as a soft ground improvement tool throughout the world.

At the trial embankment sites the founding soil mainly consisted 01 very soft highly compressible peaty or organic soil layers of thickness varying from 3 - 8 m.
