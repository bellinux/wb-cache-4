40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine to what extent moderate elevation of renal perfusion pressure (RPP) via the mechanism of ‘pressure natriuresis’ contributes to the natriuresis induced by acute i. v. saline loading. Nine Beagle dogs maintained on ample sodium intake (5. 5 mmol (kg body mass) − 1 day− 1) were chronically equipped with an aortic occluder to <b>servocontrol</b> RPP, a bladder catheter to measure renal function, and catheters for measurement of RPP and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). A swivel system allowed free movement in the kennel during experiments. Isotonic saline loading (500 ml in 100 min) was studied as follows: with and without <b>servocontrol</b> of RPP, and these two protocols repeated in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI, Enalapril, 2 mg (kg body mass) − 1). Saline loading increased MABP by about 12 mmHg and sodium excretion from about 28 μmol min− 1 up to about 350 μmol min− 1. Without ACEI, <b>servocontrol</b> of RPP at 10 % below control 24 h MABP slightly delayed the onset of the saline-induced natriuresis, but did not reduce peak sodium excretion or cumulative sodium excretion. The slight delay most probably resulted from pressure-controlled renin release because, with ACEI, <b>servocontrol</b> of RPP did not delay or reduce the saline-induced natriuresis. In conclusion, pressure natriuresis does not contribute to the natriuresis following acute saline loading...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to take advantage of telemetry data acquisition and develop an easy and reliable system to <b>servocontrol</b> renal perfusion pressure (RPP). Digitized pressure signals from lower abdominal aorta in rats, reflecting RPP, was obtained by a telemetry device and dynamically exported into an Excel worksheet. A computer program (LabVIEW) compared the RPP data with a preselected pressure range and drove a bidirectional syringe pump to control the inflation of a vascular occluder around the aorta above renal arteries. When RPP was higher than the preselected range, the syringe pump inflated the occluder and decreased RPP, and vice versa. If RPP was within range, there was no action. In this way, RPP was servocontrolled within the desired range. In experiments with norepinephrine- or ANG II-induced acute increases in systemic arterial pressure (120 – 145 mmHg), the system controlled RPP at a constant range of 100 – 105 mmHg within 30 – 50 s and differentiated the pressure-dependent and -independent effects on renal functions. In Dahl S rats with high-salt-induced hypertension, this system maintained RPP at 100 – 120 mmHg over 10 days, while systemic arterial pressures were 150 ± 5. 9 mmHg in uncontrolled animals. This system also has the ability of simultaneity and multiplexing to control multiple animals.

40|$|Abstract—Renal {{oxidative}} stress {{is thought to}} contribute to both the etiology and the associated renal injury in angiotensin (Ang) II–dependent hypertension. The contribution of Ang II versus elevated renal perfusion pressure (RPP) on albuminuria and renal {{oxidative stress}} in this model of hypertension was explored {{in the present study}} by chronically <b>servocontrolling</b> RPP to the left kidney and comparing responses with the right uncontrolled kidney and the left kidney of sham rats. Hypertension was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a 4 % NaCl diet by chronic IV infusion of Ang II (25 ng/kg per minute). The RPP to the left kidney was <b>servocontrolled</b> to mean daily pressures averaging 120 mm Hg, whereas the uncontrolled kidneys averaged 170 mm Hg over 14 days of Ang II infusion. Ang II infusion resulted in a 2. 4 -fold increase in albuminuria, which was RPP dependent. Kidneys exposed to both elevated RPP and Ang II (uncontrolled kidneys) displayed a 3. 5 -fold increase in malondialdehyde excretion and a 37 % and 27 % increase in renal cortical and outer medullary superoxide production, respectively. Elevated RPP significantly contributed to global renal oxidative stress (70 % increase in malondialdehyde excretion) and outer medullary superoxide production. Elevated circulating levels of Ang II, per se, were responsible for a 1. 5 -fold and 2. 0 -fold increase in renal cortical and outer medullary NADPH oxidase activity, respectively. In summary, this study demonstrates that elevated RPP is directly responsible for the excess albuminuria in Ang II–infused rats, whereas both elevated RPP and Ang II directly contribute to the observed renal oxidative stress.
