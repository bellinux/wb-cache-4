40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genome {{contains}} three origins of replication: oriL and two copies of oriS. These origins contain specific sequences, box I and box II, linked by an AT-rich segment, that are recognized by an HSV- 1 -encoded origin binding protein (UL 9 protein) which also possesses DNA helicase activity. Despite its intrinsic helicase activity, the UL 9 protein is unable to unwind oriS or the box I element of oriS, either in {{the presence or absence}} of the HSV- 1 -encoded <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein,</b> ICP 8. However, a complex of the UL 9 protein and ICP 8 can unwind box I if it contains a 3 ′ single-stranded tail at least 18 nt in length positioned downstream of box I. These findings suggest a model for the initiation of HSV- 1 DNA replication in which a complex consisting of the UL 9 protein bound to box I, and ICP 8 bound to single-stranded DNA generated at the A+T rich linker, perhaps as a consequence of transcription, unwinds an HSV- 1 origin of replication to provide access to the replication machinery with the consequent initiation of viral DNA replication. This mode of unwinding is distinct from that observed for other animal viruses—e. g., simian virus 40 or bovine papilloma virus—in which the initiator protein, T antigen, or E 1 protein alone, unwinds elements of the origin sequence, and the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein</b> serves only to keep the separated strands apart...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDNA repair is an {{essential}} process for preserving genome integrity in all organisms. In eukaryotes, recombinational repair is choreographed by multiprotein complexes that are organized into centers (foci). Here, we analyze the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Mre 11 nuclease and the ATM-related Tel 1 kinase are the first proteins detected at DSBs. Next, the Rfa 1 <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein</b> relocalizes to the break and recruits other key checkpoint proteins. Later and only in S and G 2 phase, the homologous recombination machinery assembles at the site. Unlike the response to DSBs, Mre 11 and recombination proteins are not recruited to hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks unless the forks collapse. The cellular response to DSBs and DNA replication stress is likely directed by the Mre 11 complex detecting and processing DNA ends in conjunction with Sae 2 and by RP-A recognizing single-stranded DNA and recruiting additional checkpoint and repair proteins...|$|E

40|$|PriA helicase is {{the major}} DNA {{replication}} restart initiator in Escherichia coli and acts to reload the replicative helicase DnaB back onto the chromosome at repaired replication forks and D-loops formed by recombination. We have discovered that PriA-catalysed unwinding of branched DNA substrates is stimulated specifically by contact with the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein</b> of E. coli, SSB. This stimulation requires binding of SSB to the initial DNA substrate and is effected via a physical interaction between PriA and the C-terminus of SSB.

Correlation between the DNA repair and recombination defects of strains harbouring an SSB C-terminal mutation with inhibition of this SSB–PriA interaction in vitro suggests that SSB plays {{a critical role in}} facilitating PriA-directed replication restart.

40|$|Cdc 45, which binds to the minichromosomal {{maintenance}} (Mcm) proteins, has {{a pivotal}} role in the initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes. Here we show that throughout the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc 45 forms a complex with a novel factor, Sld 3. Consistently, Sld 3 and Cdc 45 associate simultaneously with replication origins in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay: both proteins associate with early-firing origins in G 1 phase and with late-firing origins in late S phase. Moreover, the origin associations of Sld 3 and Cdc 45 are mutually dependent. The temperature-sensitive sld 3 mutation confers a defect in DNA replication at the restrictive temperature and reduces an interaction not only between Sld 3 and Cdc 45, but also between Cdc 45 and Mcm 2. These results suggest that the Sld 3 –Cdc 45 complex associates with replication origins through Mcm proteins. At the restrictive temperature in sld 3 - 5 cells, replication factor A, a <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein,</b> does not associate with origins.

We find that the DNA binding activity of POT 1 is required for telomerase inhibition. Furthermore, POT 1 is incapable of inhibiting telomeric repeat addition to substrate primers that are defective for POT 1 binding, suggesting that in vivo, POT 1 likely affects substrate access to telomerase. Telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes {{at the ends of}} eukaryotic linear chromosomes, serve a number of vital cellular functions.

40|$|The human Rad 51 {{recombinase}} {{is essential}} for the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA that occur in somatic cells after exposure to ionising irradiation, or in germ line cells undergoing meiotic recombination. The initiation of double-strand break repair is thought to involve resection of the double-strand break to produce 3 '-ended single-stranded (ss) tails that invade homologous duplex DNA. Here, we have used purified proteins to set up a defined in vitro system for the initial strand invasion step of double-strand break repair. We show that (i) hRad 51 binds to the ssDNA of tailed duplex DNA molecules, and (ii) hRad 51 catalyses the invasion of tailed duplex DNA into homologous covalently closed DNA. Invasion is stimulated by the <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein</b> RPA, and by the hRad 52 protein. Strikingly, hRad 51 forms terminal nucleoprotein filaments on either 3 ' or 5 '-ssDNA tails and promotes strand invasion without regard for the polarity of the tail.

We identified a protein specifically implicated in meiotic homologous recombination that we named: meiosis specific with OB domain (MEIOB). This protein is conserved among metazoan species and contains single-strand DNA binding sites {{similar to those}} of RPA 1. Our studies in vitro revealed that both recombinant and endogenous MEIOB can be retained on single-strand DNA. Those in vivo demonstrated the specific expression of Meiob in early meiotic germ cells and the co-localization of MEIOB protein with RPA on chromosome axes. MEIOB localization in Dmc 1 (-/-) spermatocytes indicated that it accumulates on resected DNA. Homologous Meiob deletion in mice caused infertility in both sexes, due to a meiotic arrest at a zygotene/pachytene-like stage. DNA double strand break repair and homologous chromosome synapsis were impaired in Meiob (-/-) meiocytes. Interestingly MEIOB appeared to be dispensable for the initial loading of recombinases but was required to maintain a proper number of RAD 51 and DMC 1 foci beyond the zygotene stage.

Deletion of this C-terminal arm reduces cooperativity in <b>DNA</b> <b>binding,</b> suggesting a hook-on model for cooperativity. Based on this structural work and mutant studies, we propose that DBP forms a protein core around which the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> winds...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli K- 12 strains {{that carry}} the {{mutation}} ssb- 1 in {{the gene for}} <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein,</b> {{the presence of the}} F sex factor partially reverses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype caused by the mutation. The region of F (EcoRI fragment 3) responsible for this compensation has been identified and subcloned onto pBR 322. A BamHI cleavage site has been found to intersect the essential coding region for this F function. By using this site, mutational blocks in the function have been constructed and used to identify a protein product (Mr approximately 22, 000, slightly larger than the E. coli K- 12 <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>binding</b> <b>protein)</b> which is correlated with the ssb- 1 -complementing activity. Labeled extracts from maxicells were used to show that this protein binds tightly to <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> The gene on F that codes for this protein is denoted ssf and is located at approximately 55. 2 kilobases on the standard map of F, in the region transferred very early during bacterial conjugation...|$|R
