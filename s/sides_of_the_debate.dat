5|$|In June1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition {{sued the}} San Diego City Council to {{require them to}} move the western {{terminus}} of SR56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August1, the City of San Diego received a petition {{in which more than}} 45,000people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September13, and several local residents representing both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.|$|E
5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> confirmed by top Bush administration officials, that politics {{played a role}} in the decision to impose tariffs. Namely, the large and important Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia would benefit from the tariffs. The placement of the tariffs was an odd one for Bush, who has signed numerous free trade agreements during his term in office. This was widely believed to be a calculated political decision, insofar as the localities that stood to benefit were marginal ones. Both the George H. W. Bush administration and the Reagan administration also imposed import limits on steel.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 a {{documentary}} film entitled Wind Over Water about {{the controversy over}} the Cape Wind Project was released. The film by journalist Ole Tangen Jr. chronicled the debate as it unfolded on the Cape. An independent production, the filmmaker interviewed subjects from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> including Jim Gordon, the driving force behind Cape Wind and Isaac Rosen, then director of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. Focusing also on wind power in general, Wind Over Water features aerial footage of the offshore wind farm at Horns Rev in Denmark and footage from various wind farms in the U.S. On December6, 2003 the film made its world and Cape Cod premiere at the Lillie Auditorium in Woods Hole.|$|E
25|$|The lead-up to {{the review}} vote {{was marked by}} high {{emotions}} on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> and allegations of rule breaking. Such allegations were risen when caucus members sent letters on party letterhead seeking support for Tory. The letters signed by Tory MPPs Bob Runciman and Toby Barrett were a clear {{violation of the rules}} of the party, as the party in general is supposed to be neutral on the leadership review question. Tory responded by stating that he and his supporters will reimburse the party for the letters that the caucus members had sent in support of Tory's position as leaders. As a result, the party's president, Blair McCreadie, had stated that the matter is closed. A supporter of Tory's, PC Youth President Andrew Brander, launched a series of last-minute challenges of delegates {{on the grounds that they}} are representing ridings where they neither live nor work.|$|E

25|$|Méliès made 48 {{films in}} 1899 as he {{continued}} to experiment with special effects, for example in the early horror film Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb. The film is not a historical reconstruction of the Egyptian Queen, and instead depicts her mummy being resurrected in modern times. Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb was believed to be a lost film until a copy was discovered in 2005 in Paris. That year, Méliès also made two of his most ambitious and well-known films. In the summer he made the historical reconstruction The Dreyfus Affair, a film based on the then-ongoing and controversial political scandal, in which the Jewish French Army Captain Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused and framed for treason by his commanders. Méliès was pro-Dreyfus and the film depicts Dreyfus sympathetically as falsely accused and unjustly incarcerated on Devil's Island prison. At screenings of the film, fights broke out between people on different <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> and the police eventually banned the final part of the film where Dreyfus returns to prison.|$|E
500|$|Researchers on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> {{gathered}} on August 14–16, 2008, at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{for a conference}} that included back-to-back talks on the current IAU definition of a planet. Entitled [...] "The Great Planet Debate", the conference published a post-conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about the definition of planet. On June 11, 2008, the IAU had announced in a press release that the term [...] "plutoid" [...] would henceforth be {{used to refer to}} Pluto and other objects that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of Neptune and enough mass to be of near-spherical shape.|$|E
500|$|Upon its publication, The Shortest Way {{provoked}} {{immediate and}} passionate reactions from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Some {{made use of}} it as a genuine vindication of the anti-Dissenter opinion, although speculation later occurred over whether it was ironic. The pamphlet generated a great deal of publicity over the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry. This resulted in the issuing of a warrant by the High Tory Secretary of State for the Southern Department, the Earl of Nottingham, for the arrest of Defoe on the charge of seditious libel, the order being given to [...] "… make Strict and diligent Search for Daniel Fooe and him having found you are to apprehend and seize together with his Papers for high Crime and misdemeanours and to bring him before me …" ...|$|E

50|$|The book {{analyzes}} the two passionately divided <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>debate,</b> or “food fight.” One side argues that obesity, like smoking, {{is a public}} health crisis that demands governmental involvement {{in order to achieve}} a solution. Advocates of this viewpoint suggest that government use its legislative power to subsidize production of healthier foods, to regulate food industry practices, and to minimize <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> junk food advertising to children. Brownell and Horgen support this <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> throughout their book.|$|R

500|$|Marburger {{characterized}} {{his participation}} {{as a learning}} experience, and the experience was credited with profoundly changing his view {{on the relationship between}} the scientific community and the public. He had never been to a public hearing prior to his participation in the Shoreham commission, {{and he said that he}} had initially expected that the issues could be resolved by examining scientific data and establishing failure probabilities. However, he quickly became aware of the importance of the public participation process itself, stating that it was [...] "one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously." [...] Marburger's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> with his focus on listening to all viewpoints and his ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted.|$|E
500|$|Mao then {{sought the}} support of Peng, {{who had not yet}} taken a strong position, to lead the PVA. Peng flew to Beijing from Xi'an (where he was still {{administering}} northwest China and directing the incorporation of Xinjiang into the PRC), and arrived on October 4. Peng listened to both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> and on October 5 decided to support Mao. Peng's support for Mao's position changed the atmosphere of the meeting, and most leaders changed their positions to support a direct Chinese intervention in the Korean War. On October 5 Peng was named the Commander and the Commissar of the People's Volunteer Army and held both titles until the [...] in 1953. Mao directed China's general strategy, and Zhou was appointed general commander, coordinating Peng's forces with the Soviet and North Korean governments, {{and the rest of the}} Chinese government. Over the next week, Peng established a headquarters in Shenyang, and prepared his invasion strategy with his officers.|$|E
500|$|Tailer {{was elected}} to the Governor's Council from 1712 to 1729, [...] and was on three {{separate}} occasions commissioned as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. [...] Despite his connection by marriage to the Dudleys, he had an awkward political relationship with the governor during the period of his first two commissions. [...] A number of Anglicans in the colony, Tailer among them, were skeptical of Dudley's faith. [...] (Dudley had been raised in the Puritan way, and had formally adopted Anglican practices while in England in the 1690s.) [...] He and Dudley were also on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> on the province's currency problems. [...] Dudley favored the issuance of public bills of credit as a means to circumvent the inflationary issuance of paper currency that had become a serious problem by the end of Queen Anne's War in 1713, while Tailer, along with his father-in-law Nathaniel Byfield and others, favored the establishment of a private land bank, that would issue bills secured by the lands of its investors.|$|E

500|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries {{historians have}} focused {{less on the}} rightness or wrongness of the conquest itself, instead concentrating {{on the effects of}} the invasion. Some, such as Richard Southern, have seen the conquest as a {{critical}} turning point in history. Southern stated that [...] "no country in Europe, between the rise of the barbarian kingdoms and the 20th century, has undergone so radical a change in so short a time as England experienced after 1066". Other historians, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, believe that the transformation was less radical. In more general terms, Singman has called the conquest [...] "the last echo of the national migrations that characterized the early Middle Ages". The debate over the impact of the conquest depends on how change after 1066 is measured. If Anglo-Saxon England was already evolving before the invasion, with the introduction of feudalism, castles or other changes in society, then the conquest, while important, did not represent radical reform. But the change was dramatic if measured by the elimination of the English nobility or the loss of Old English as a literary language. Nationalistic arguments have been made on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> with the Normans cast as either the persecutors of the English or the rescuers of the country from a decadent Anglo-Saxon nobility.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dot was {{featured}} in a storyline about euthanasia, when her oldest friend Ethel, who had terminal cancer, asked her to help her die. The storyline allowed the production team to present all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> about euthanasia, {{from the perspective of}} the sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing, religious and moral opposition. According to author Dorothy Hobson, [...] "Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience and she tried to resist the request [...] to assist [...] in the ultimate sin". In the storyline, Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening. Assisted by Dot, she took an overdose of her medication and died. Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot [...] "you're the best friend I ever had". Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode. The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was [...] "Guilty" [...] by Al Bowlly. Ben Summerskill from The Observer has suggested that Dot's part in the euthanasia storyline was [...] "one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV". The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of 4,000 readers in 2006.|$|E
