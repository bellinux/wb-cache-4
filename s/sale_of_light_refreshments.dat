40|$|Historically, Brazil has {{promoted}} {{the development and}} <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicles running on ethanol (firstly, ethanol-dedicated cars, and recently flexfuel cars). In the 1990 s, the country also favored the <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> compact cars to middle and low-income classes. However, in the last years, the profile of vehicles sold in Brazil has converged towards larger and less-efficient vehicles. In 2008, Brazil launched the vehicle labeling program. Based on the outcomes of the historical programs oriented towards the development of automotive innovations, and on a survey conducted with the country's main auto makers, this article evaluates whether the vehicle labeling program will both improve the energy efficiency <b>of</b> <b>light</b> vehicles, and introduce new technologies. Our results indicate that, despite its virtuous intentions, the program will not control the tendency of rising fuel consumption of passenger cars sold in Brazil. Therefore, other policies are needed to boost innovations in Brazil's automotive industry. Energy efficiency Vehicle labeling program Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Products {{designed}} for long-life often have significant potential for better sustainability performance than standard products due to less material and energy usage {{for a given}} service provided, which usually also results in a lower total cost. These benefits are not always obvious or appealing to customers, who often focus on price. Long-life products are therefore at an inherent disadvantage: due to lower volume <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> that results from the products’ longer-life, the margins (price) often need to be higher. In this paper, we demonstrate that when the revenue base is shifted to be the service <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (instead <b>of</b> the <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> tubes), {{there is an opportunity}} for a “win-win-win” for the light user, the long-life light provider and society.
