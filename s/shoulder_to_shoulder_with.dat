But Khrushchev is trying in vain... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society... Our Party is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism... On this course, marching <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, our Party and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies.

Eleven batteries {{with a total}} of 48 guns (varying from 3-pdrs to 24-pdrs) and 18 siege mortars (varying from 30 to 60 pounds caliber) were in place. These guns would fire about 14,000 projectiles during the three days of the bombardment, that started on 28 April. The devastation of the fortress and town was immense. Hardly a house remained undamaged. The front of the attack was leveled. Around 2,000 people (both soldiers and civilians) were killed (one mortar bomb killed a woman and her eight children at one stroke). But the civilians took part in the defense, organised as artilleurs-bourgeois (burgher artillerists) and stood <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> the battalions of the Meuse and [...] Moselle that formed the garrison.

2500|$|For a {{few years}} in the early eighteenth century Wesley {{found himself in the}} vortex of controversy. Brought up in the dissenting tradition, he had swerved into {{conformity}} {{at some point during the}} 1680s, possibly under the influence of Tillotson, whom he greatly admired (of. Epistle to a Friend, pp.5–6). In 1702 there appeared his Letter from a Country Divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in their private academies, apparently written about 1693. This attack upon dissenting academies was published at an unfortunate time, when the public mind was inflamed by the intolerance of overzealous churchmen. Wesley was furiously answered; he replied in A Defence of a Letter (1704), and again in A Reply to Mr. Palmer's Vindication (1707). It is scarcely to Wesley's credit that in this quarrel he stood <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> that most hot-headed of all contemporary bigots, Henry Sacheverell. His prominence in the controversy earned him the ironic compliments of Daniel Defoe, who recalled that our [...] "Mighty Champion of this very High-Church Cause" [...] had once written a poem to satirize frenzied Tories (Review, II, no. 87, 22 September 1705). [...] About a week later Defoe, having got wind of a [...] collection being taken up, for Wesley—who in consequence of a series of misfortunes was badly in debt—intimated that High-Church pamphleteering had turned out very profitably for both Lesley and Wesley (2 October 1705). But in such snarling and bickering Wesley was out of his element, and, he seems to have avoided future quarrels.|$|E
