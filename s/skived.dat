40|$|Abstract Background Foot orthoses {{are often}} used to treat lower limb {{injuries}} associated with excessive pronation. There are many orthotic modifications available for this purpose, with one being the medial heel <b>skive.</b> However, empirical evidence for the mechanical effects of the medial heel <b>skive</b> modification is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effect that different depths of medial heel <b>skive</b> have on plantar pressures. Methods Thirty healthy adults (mean age 24 years, range 18 – 46) with a flat-arched or pronated foot posture and no current foot pain or deformity participated in this study. Using the in-shoe pedar-X® system, plantar pressure data were collected for the rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot while participants walked along an 8 metre walkway wearing a standardised shoe. Experimental conditions included a customised foot orthosis with the following 4 orthotic modifications: (i) no medial heel <b>skive,</b> (ii) a 2 mm medial heel <b>skive,</b> (iii) a 4 mm medial heel <b>skive</b> and (iv) a 6 mm medial heel <b>skive.</b> Results Compared to the foot orthosis with no medial heel <b>skive,</b> statistically significant increases in peak pressure were observed at the medial rearfoot – there was a 15 % increase (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) with the 4 mm <b>skive</b> and a 29 % increase (p[*] Conclusions This study found that a medial heel <b>skive</b> of 4 mm or 6 mm increases peak pressure under the medial rearfoot in asymptomatic adults with a flat-arched or pronated foot posture. Plantar pressures at the midfoot and forefoot were not altered by a medial heel <b>skive</b> of 2, 4 or 6 mm.

5000|$|For the fit to last, so to speak, {{the boot}} {{had to hold}} the shape. In the {{construction}} of the boot itself, as with {{the construction of the}} last, Charlie had some secrets. He drew on a lifetime of incorporating ideas and practices from the dozens of bootmakers with whom he worked and his own, constant effort to improve his practices. By the 1970s, something like a Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] for bootmaking had taken shape. Put simply, he made boots the old-fashioned way, never trying something new unless it improved the boot, and sometimes not even then, for he preferred the traditional way. This [...] "code" [...] had practices that were not negotiable for Charlie. The boot must have hard maple, not plastic or metal, pegs in securing various elements. He insisted on spinning his own flax threads for stitching and binding, though doing so {{took a long time to}} perfect and was expensive. Nylon thread, though sometimes more durable, was never used. Though almost every other bootmaker, including custom fitters, used plastic toe boxes as inserts to shape the toe of the boot, Charlie insisted on shaping them exclusively with leather boxes because they were tougher, could be built in almost any appropriate shape, and retained the tradition of bootmaking by hand. Where leather joined to leather, he <b>skived,</b> or thinned, both pieces to obtain a smoother, less abrasive seam, one that not only felt better to the wearer but also retained the lines of the boot. To provide support for the foot of the boot, Charlie used only iron spikes pounded flat by his hammer of 70+ years on his anvil affixed to a tree stump. For small men and women, he used a 40-penny spike; for larger men, he used a 60-penny spike, about six inches long and half-inch wide, known as a [...] "bridge timber spike." [...] And [...] "The sole has got to be leather and got to be thick leather," [...] and that's the way it was, for Charlie. These and other elements defined the Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] of making boots that had passed through the centuries of bootmaking, refined in his hands and on shop machines nearly as old as he was.|$|E

40|$|Adhesion {{of copper}} and solution-deposited {{polymers}} to fluoropolymers was studied using films of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a TFE-perfluoroalkylvinylether co-polymer (PFA) with different manufacturing histories (cast, <b>skived,</b> laminated). These films {{were exposed to}} three surface modification techniques (lamination, sodium naphthalenide etching, acid-stripping). The depth of defluorination from the sodium etching was measured gravimetrically {{and the nature of}} the resultant chemical functionalities determined using internal reflectance (FTIR-IRS) and x-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies. The surface functionality produced by the treatments was independent of fluoropolymer type. Surface area was the major variable affecting defluorination rate. For all but the <b>skived</b> PTFE films, there was little change in surface texture after one hour sodium etch or after subsequent acid stripping of the defluorinated layer. ^ Adhesive testing with three test geometries (90 degree peel test, torsional shear test, and stripping of transmission electron micrograph replicas) revealed that a combination of chemical and physical surface modification is required to produce good peel adhesion, with the relative importance of each dependent upon the specific adhesion test used. For relatively smooth films, the Na/Naphth appeared to function by increasing both the chemical functionality and the mechanical integrity of the surface layer. Polymer replicating films which were solution-deposited onto untreated PTFE and PFA gave interfacial failure and negligible adhesion. Smooth PTFE films which were superficially modified frequently failed by fibrillation of the fluoropolymer surface. For short etch times, adhesion improved and failure was interfacial. For long etch times, a mixed mode of failure occurred. Adequate adhesive strength could only be achieved by an increase in surface roughness. ^ The best adhesion was achieved by surface roughening followed by Na/Naphth treatment. For such PTFE surfaces plated with copper, peel and shear tests gave a mixed mode of failure, with copper and fluoropolymer found on both fracture surfaces. Extensive fibrillation occurred at the locus of failure. Provided chemical modification was adequate to allow wetting, the roughness of the surface (mechanical adhesion) dominated the properties of the adhesive bond. Prolonged Na/Naphth treatment (one hour) caused a reduction in peel strengths. ...|$|E
40|$|Gaseous {{and liquid}} xenon {{particle}} detectors {{are being used}} {{in a number of}} applications including dark matter search and neutrino-less double beta decay experiments. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is often used in these detectors both as electrical insulator and as a light reflector to improve the efficiency of detection of scintillation photons. However, xenon emits in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region (175 nm) where the reflecting properties of PTFE are not sufficiently known. In this work we report on measurements of PTFE reflectance, including its angular distribution, for the xenon scintillation light. Various samples of PTFE, manufactured by different processes (extruded, expanded, <b>skived</b> and pressed) have been studied. The data were interpreted with a physical model comprising both specular and diffuse reflections. The reflectance obtained for these samples ranges from about 47 % to 66 % for VUV light.
