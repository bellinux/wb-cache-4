500|$|Fincher {{wanted the}} {{vignette}} to be a [...] "personal nightmare" [...] for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. [...] "Early on, {{we knew it}} was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like a nightmare," [...] Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, {{standing in the middle of}} a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the [...] "gooey" [...] element that was so desired. [...] "David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette," [...] Miller recalled. [...] "It ties everything together other than the black on black." ...|$|E
500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated {{many times in the}} film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to [...] "plumb the depths" [...] while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E
2500|$|Earlier that autumn MacKenzie {{had already}} {{provoked}} controversy in Liverpool by stating in a Press Gazette {{interview that he}} had never knowingly printed any lies in The Sun and that even stories which later turned out to be untrue were still [...] "good stories". In relation to the publishing of false or misleading reports in The Sun, MacKenzie asked [...] "What am I <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed about?" [...] MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the Liverpool Echo published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a [...] "good story").|$|E
5000|$|... "You do {{whatever}} {{you do when you}} have a gun in your ear - you hand over your wallet. You are not <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> good about it. But it is the logical and rational thing to do at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Weston added, [...] "that {{he could}} only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he could <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> any {{interest}} in him; and {{that he might be}} expected at Hartfield very soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>supposed</b> you <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{just these}} {{questions}} of study, {{of the artistic}} education, as you've called it to me, so fascinating," [...] the girl persisted. She was sometimes so flatly lucid.|$|R
2500|$|Virtually all {{actors who}} worked with Ozu—including Chishu Ryu, who collaborated with the {{director}} on almost all his films—agree {{that he was an}} extremely demanding taskmaster. He would direct very simple actions by the performer [...] "to the centimeter." [...] As opposed to those of both Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ozu's characters, according to Sato, are [...] "usually calm... they not only move at the same pace but also speak at the same measured rate." [...] He insisted that his actors express emotions through action, even rote action, rather than by directly expressing their innermost feelings. Once, when the distinguished character actress Haruko Sugimura asked the director what her character was supposed to be feeling at a given moment, Ozu responded, “You are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> you are supposed to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study found}} that it was not {{uncommon}} for adolescent girls in relationships to report they felt little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they think might place strains on their relationships. The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be [...] "good girls"; the pressure to be [...] "good" [...] may make adolescent girls think they are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> desire like boys do. Even when girls said they did feel sexual desire, they said that they felt like they were not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings. This {{is an example of how}} societal expectations about gender can impact adolescent sexual functioning.|$|E
2500|$|Stone took on {{the role}} of a {{clinically}} depressed woman in the independent drama When a Man Falls in the Forest (2007), premiered in competition at the 2007 Berlin Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. She found her part [...] "challenging" [...] to play, remarking: [...] "It was a watershed experience. I think {{that we live in a}} [...] Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> about something." [...] Her next film roles have been in independent productions, including the late 2000s films If I Had Known I Was a Genius (2007), The Year of Getting to Know Us (2008), Five Dollars a Day (2009) and Streets of Blood (2009), all of which went directly-to-DVD in North America.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not look}} {{so very much}} surprised," [...] she said, in her sweet {{pleading}} way. [...] "May I not be <b>supposed</b> able <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that noble kindness and gracious manner, and be glad to have some one to look up to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I have no {{ambition}} to be confidant," [...] said Mara, all her spirit sparkling in her eyes; [...] "although when one stands {{to you in}} the relation of an only sister, I might be <b>supposed</b> perhaps <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> some interest <b>to</b> be in your confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's what I {{always knew}} I had {{got to come}} to, first or last. And I <b>suppose</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> glad enough I {{did n't have to}} come to it at first." ...|$|R
2500|$|Swarm began {{life as a}} {{submission}} to the Great Canadian Video Game Competition held by Telefilm Canada. [...] The game was chosen as one of four finalists, and Hothead Games received $300,000 in order to fund further production on the game. [...] It sprang from AI research by Dr. Mike Hayward, who was doing PhD research on how artificial life would interact one with another when given a task. [...] "We were trying to enter an indie developer contest back in 2006, and Mike pitched this idea forward" [...] stated producer Joel DeYoung. [...] Lead Designer Pete Low stated {{that one of the}} biggest challenges was designing the camera controls to be able to accommodate all 50 swarmites. [...] Each swarmite in the swarm is controlled by individual AI. [...] The group does not have a leader, but instead interact with each other dynamically. [...] "The idea is it's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like controlling a flock of fish" [...] stated Dr. Mike Hayward, who designed the AI. [...] The game features leaderboards and in addition the PlayStation 3 version includes a live tally of the sum of all swarmites killed by players.|$|E

60|$|Richard {{was thus}} {{passing through a}} country full of enemies, and he might {{naturally}} be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> some anxiety about the result; but, instead of proceeding cautiously, and watching against the dangers that beset him, he went on quite at his ease, believing that his good fortune would carry him safely through.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>suppose</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that way," [...] said Eltwin, with a remorse which March {{suspected}} a reproachful {{pressure of}} his wife's hand had prompted in him. [...] "I reckon he means well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was interesting," [...] she remarked. [...] "Talks {{better than}} he knows, and I <b>suppose</b> we ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> flattered, because he took our {{comprehension}} for granted. After all, it was rash to talk about Canadian progress to two English girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You jealous!" [...] William exclaimed. [...] "I assure you, Katharine, you've not the {{slightest}} reason to be jealous. Cassandra dislikes me, so far as she feels about me at all. I was foolish enough {{to try to explain}} the nature of our relationship. I couldn't resist telling her what I <b>supposed</b> myself <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for her. She refused to listen, very rightly. But she left me in no doubt of her scorn." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{men looked}} round in surprise. At that moment {{a great idea}} seemed to fill my soul. I cannot explain what it was. To this day I {{do not know what}} it was. It was a mystery--an indescribable mystery. I felt as one might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> whose spirit were capable of eating {{material}} food, and had eaten too much. It was awful! Under the impulse of this sensation, I again shouted-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is the gal, in {{this part}} of the country, that holds her head so much higher than one of Thousandacres' sons?" [...] demanded the old squatter, with some such surprise, real or affected, as a Bourbon might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> at having his {{alliance}} spurned on the score of blood. [...] "I'd like to see her, and to convarse with this young woman. What did you call her name, Zeph?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Fred, with a sigh, [...] "he won't {{even let}} me call to see my sister too--that's the worst of it. For the rest I care not; my brush has {{sustained}} me hitherto, and my love for my profession increases every hour. I feel towards it, John, as a man may be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> towards the sweet, young girl whom wicked guardians had {{for a long time}} refused to let him wed. Nothing but death shall separate us now!" ...|$|E
60|$|Rose did {{not hold}} that Carl had any claim upon her. The {{incidents}} of two years before were lived down, both by herself and Carl, for as manhood and womanhood came to them they put away all that which they had done in the thoughtlessness of childhood. To Rose it was an unpleasant memory, because associated with her father's grief. She <b>supposed</b> Carl <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{in the same way}} about it, and so no allusion to it was ever made by any one.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, {{and wished}} {{he would not}} say such things. She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wont <b>to</b> <b>suppose.</b> She began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the {{possibility}} of his turning out well at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her, and ought {{not to think of}} her.|$|R
6000|$|I ordered three pairs, though I {{had only}} wanted two, and quickly left. I had, I {{do not know}} quite what feeling of being part, in his mind, of a {{conspiracy}} against him; or not perhaps so much against him as against his idea of boot. One does not, I <b>suppose,</b> care <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like that; for it was again many months before my next visit to his shop, paid, I remember, with the feeling: [...] "Oh! well, I can't leave the old boy--so here goes! Perhaps it'll be his elder brother!" ...|$|R
60|$|The white tents of {{the militia}} were {{stretched}} in regular lines immediately beneath her. The light was shining {{in the window of}} her aunt, who, Frances easily fancied, was watching the mountain, racked with all the anxiety she might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for her niece. Lanterns were playing about in the stable yard, where she knew the horses of the dragoons were kept, and believing them to be preparing for their night march, she again sprang upon her feet, and renewed her toil.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps the attentions most {{grateful}} to Janet {{were those of}} her old friend Mrs. Crewe, whose attachment to her favourite proved quite too strong for any resentment she might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> on the score of Mr. Tryan. The little deaf old lady couldn't do without her accustomed visitor, whom she had seen grow up from child to woman, always so willing to chat with her and tell her all the news, though she was deaf; while other people thought it tiresome to shout in her ear, and irritated her by recommending ear-trumpets of various construction.|$|E
60|$|It is my {{intention}} constantly to address my readers from the chimney-corner, and I would fain hope that such accounts as I shall give them of our histories and proceedings, our quiet speculations or more busy adventures, {{will never be}} unwelcome. Lest, however, I should grow prolix in the outset by lingering too long upon our little association, confounding the enthusiasm with which I regard this chief happiness {{of my life with}} that minor degree of interest which those to whom I address myself may be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for it, I have deemed it expedient to break off as they have seen.|$|E
6000|$|Brooke {{glanced at}} his fingers reflectively. [...] "On the contrary, I <b>suppose</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> proud of them, though I {{scarcely}} think I am. Building flumes and dams, though that will hardly convey any very clear impression to you. It implies swinging the axe and shovel most of every day, and working up to the waist in water occasionally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Room {{enough and}} to spare," [...] the host replied. [...] "There is no {{scarcity}} of rooms, {{though there is}} of good fare; a party of soldiers from Ghent {{paid a visit to}} us yesterday, and have scarce left a thing to eat in the village. However, I <b>suppose</b> we ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> thankful that they did not take our lives also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{only want}} mamma here," [...] {{she said a}} little later, as she took her seat in a deck chair, [...] "to {{complete}} the illusion that we are sailing along somewhere on the Devonshire coast. The hills are higher and more wooded, but the general idea is the same. I <b>suppose</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it very shocking, cruising about with you, without anyone but Anna with me; but somehow it does not feel so." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a very}} {{pleasant}} visit, and a great relief. He looked at the plans, heard the fresh arrangements, admired, was interested, and took pleasure in having something to tell Amabel. He asked for Marianne, and heard that {{she was one of}} the best of children--amiable, well-disposed, only almost too sensitive. Miss Wellwood said it was remarkable how deep an impression Sir Guy had made upon her, and how affectionately she remembered his kindness; and her distress at hearing of his death had been far beyond what such a child could have been <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> both in violence and in duration.|$|E
60|$|At length {{he asked}} her, {{with as much}} calmness as he could assume--if she was contented--if aught {{could be done to}} render her {{situation}} more easy--if there was aught of which she could complain which {{he might be able to}} remedy? She answered gently, that she was calm and resigned, when her brother would permit her to stay at home; but that when she was brought into society, she experienced such a change as that which the water of the brook that slumbers in a crystalline pool of the rock may be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> when, gliding from its quiet bed, it becomes involved in the hurry of the cataract.|$|E
60|$|She {{reflected}} {{that she had}} never yet asked him whether he had been in love. They had got further and further from that subject instead of drawing nearer to it, and she could not help feeling it a relief when William Pepper, with all his knowledge, his microscope, his note-books, his genuine kindliness and good sense, but a certain dryness of soul, took his departure. Also she could not help feeling it sad that friendships should end thus, although in this case to have the room empty was something of a comfort, and she tried to console herself with the reflection that one never knows how far other people feel the things they might be <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor young gentleman,' {{said the}} Colonel, 'I <b>suppose</b> he begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the {{difficulties}} of his situation. Well, dear Waverley, {{this is more than}} kind, and shall not be forgotten while Philip Talbot can remember anything. My life--pshaw--let Emily thank you for that; this is a favour worth fifty lives. I cannot hesitate on giving my parole in the circumstances; there it is (he wrote it out in form). And now, how am I to get off?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather surprised, I {{pulled it}} up afresh and held it, {{and must have}} dozed off, as I <b>suppose.</b> Awoke, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it being pulled again; it was slipping, slipping, {{and then with a}} sudden, violent jerk it was thrown on the floor. Il faut dire that during all this I had glanced several times at Bolter, who seemed profoundly asleep. But now alarmed I tried to wake him. In vain, he slept like the dead; his face, always a pasty white, now like marble in the moonlight. After some {{hesitation}} I put the blanket back on the bed and held it fast. The pulling at once began and increased in strength, and I, by this time thoroughly alarmed, put all my strength against it, and hung on like grim death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed they do! They had {{an awful}} quarrel {{just before they}} got to Nuremberg: about his wanting to send some of the baggage to Liverpool by express {{that she wanted to}} keep with them.
