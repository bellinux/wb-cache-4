5000|$|The term ukaznik {{derives from}} the Russian term [...] "ukaz" [...] that means [...] "decree". It applies to those convicted {{according}} to various Soviet ukazes, but the most common usage refers {{to a series of}} decrees related to what was later formalized in Soviet law as parasitism, or evasion from socially-useful work. Among the first of these was the decree of 2 June 1942 [...] "On criminal culpability for evasion from <b>socially</b> <b>useful</b> <b>work</b> and for social parasitism in the agricultural sector" [...] (Об ответственности за уклонение от общественно полезного труда и за ведение антиобщественного паразитического образа жизни в сельском хозяйстве). It was usually applied to kolkhozniks who failed to carry out their corvée (trudodni, [...] "labour-days"). The term of exile was 8 years. During 1948-1952 33,266 special settlers ("ukazniks") were registered. Unlike other exile settler categories, children of these exiles were not subject to the Decree.|$|E

The story ended with robberies, sexual orgies and a drunken murder.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study was}} undertaken {{of students in}} the United Kingdom and Germany in order to investigate whether their attitudes were moving away from traditional patterns towards those that might be expected in more marketised higher education systems. The British students were found to be more instrumental and materialistic in relation to their future career and earning prospects. They stressed the intellectual dimension of higher education, whereas the Germans tended to stress personal development, and were keener on <b>socially</b> <b>useful</b> <b>work.</b> However, the United Kingdom students cared much more about human relationships within their higher education institutions, and rated them much more positively. Despite fears that market-oriented knowledge concepts lead to theory-aversion, the United Kingdom students displayed more intellectual enthusiasm and expressed more interest in future graduate study and research. It is speculated that the underlying concept of knowledge may be different in the United Kingdom. The British students were more aware of quality assurance measures within their institutions and more satisfied with their courses than their German counterparts. By contrast, the British staff were in important respects less satisfied in their work than the German staff, so the satisfaction of the students seems to be achieved at their expense. By Rosalind M.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss and support my claim that caring for young {{children}} is <b>socially</b> <b>useful</b> <b>work,</b> and to trace some of the attention which the women's movement has given to this topic. It comments on the lack of impact of the women's movement on the lives of this particular group of women. Finally it considers what might be done to begin to redress the situation. This article draws on the international theoretical literature, but makes particular use of recent Australian quantitative and qualitative research. Like life in Australia, this article is both particular to this context and part of what happens in the rest of the world. My impression is that Britain, Europe, New Zealand and North America share a similar social construction of this work with Australia. Marilyn Waring's (1988) analysis points out that so-called 'developing' countries run the risk that 'development' projects will undermine the economic status of women in those countries by treating women's work as non-work. I believe that the issues canvassed in this article are international, and I hope that readers from a range of cultures will find some interest in a discussion which challenges the conventional ways of viewing this topic...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{climate change}} politics, {{dominated}} by neoliberal and ecological modernisation framings, has reached an impasse. This thesis investigates whether a Marxist critique focused on trade unions might {{offer an alternative}} approach. It critically analyses the social science literature on climate change and utilises insights from the employment relations literature to interrogate trade union activities. The thesis makes original contributions to both the climate change and employment relations literatures. First, it offers {{a critique of the}} dominant climate politics and suggests an alternative framing. Second, it proposes a theorisation of organised workers and trade unions as strategic climate actors, applying Hyman's triangular model of market, society and class to understand union behaviour on climate change. Third, it contains a theoretically informed and empirically grounded investigation of UK trade union policy and practice on climate change {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. The main findings are that some socialists, trade unionists and activists in the UK have introduced a working class perspective into climate discourse, including challenges to property relations, climate inequality and through mobilisation. Some trade unionists have foreground the occupational aspects of climate change and climate policy, and made distinctive demands for a radical just transition, climate jobs and <b>socially</b> <b>useful</b> <b>work.</b> Trade union climate representatives ("green reps") in some workplaces have made an independent contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation. The occupation of the Vestas wind turbine manufacturing factory and the resulting climate solidarity illustrate the potential power of workers' climate action. The principal conclusions are that workers have the interest and collective capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to address the differential impacts of climate and climate policy, and to coalesce other actors to tackle climate change. The recent experience of UK trade unions suggests they have a vital role to play as climate actors and, suitably reconfigured, the capability to lead a renewed climate movement.

40|$|Este texto se presentó como comunicación al II Congreso Internacional de Etnografía y Educación: Migraciones y ciudadanías. Barcelona, 5 - 8 Septiembre 2008. The {{demand for}} an {{indigenous}} educational {{system to be}} different from the one introduced by the colonial power was from the very beginning an integral part of India´s strive for independence. When in 1937 the Indian National Congress formed governments of its own in the majority of the provinces of British India, Gandhi directed the focus again on education. He convened an All India Educational Conference and a small committee of educationists prepared a primary education scheme under the title „Basic National Education?, also known as the „Wardha Scheme?. In a first part the paper will briefly deal with the main features of the „Wardha Scheme?. With an emphasis on educationally productive and <b>socially</b> <b>useful</b> <b>work,</b> it tried to overcome the artificial distinction between physical and mental work. It aimed at educating children {{on the basis of their}} native culture and in equipping them with all the basic abilities and attitudes deemed to be essential for a common citizenship. The Indian National Congress directed its provincial governments to introduce the scheme. Taking into consideration the limited implementation of the „Wardha Scheme? one is surprised about its political repercussions, especially from Muslim quarters which will be dealt with in the second part of the paper. In a country with such a diverse population, professing different religions, speaking various languages and differing from one another in a large number of social and cultural traits, education was bound to become an area of contestation among people belonging to distinct communities. For the majority of the population education was embedded in and linked to a larger Hindu religious-cultural background which more or less all the minorities even partly shared. In the sphere of education, however, the Indian Muslims wanted their traditions and cultures not to be found in a subordinate position, as partly experienced, but equally to be recognised and protected. The issue became a suitable tool in the hands of Muslim League politicians for communitarian mobilization, for bridging intra- Muslim differences and for finally demanding a distinct type of education based on Islamic religion, Muslim culture and converging with the idea of a separate homeland...|$|E
