40|$|Soil {{disinfestation}} by steam is {{an agricultural}} technique that recently has been attracting growing interest for its low ecological impact. The process represents {{a viable alternative}} to methyl bromide, which will soon be banned in many countries. However, high fuel costs render the treatment only economically feasible for high-profit cultures. In this paper, a predictive control structure is presented, aimed at reducing the fuel consumption and optimising the treatment duration. The controller is based on a multiple linear parameter varying switching dynamic model that describes the soil temperature at different depths during <b>sheet</b> <b>steam</b> disinfestation. This fairly new approach allows the construction of simple models, thus overcoming the complexity introduced by physical equations...|$|R

Sides for this dish usually consist of chả lụa (Vietnamese pork sausage), sliced cucumber, and bean sprouts, with the dipping sauce which is fish sauce called nước chấm. Sometimes, a drop of cà cuống, which is the essence of a giant water bug, Lethocerus indicus, is added to the nước chấm for extra flavor, although this ingredient is scarce and quite expensive.|$|R
40|$|A single enzyme {{treatment}} with a-amylase, {{prior to the}} quantification of added folic acid (FA) in fortified instant fried Asian noodles with analysis performed by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV detection, is described. The method was validated and optimized for capillary electrophoresis (CE) with separation achieved using a 8 mM phosphate- 12 mM borate run buffer with 5 % MeOH at pH 9. 5. FA was well separated from matrix components with nicotinic acid (NA) employed as an internal standard. In a comparative study, separation of FA was performed using HPLC with a mobile phase consisting of 27 % MeOH (v/v) in aqueous potassium phosphate buffer (3. 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 3. 2 mM K 2 HPO 4), pH 8. 5, and containing 5 mM tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate as an ion-pairing agent. For both methods, excellent results were obtained for various analytical parameters including linearity, accuracy and precision. The limit of detection was calculated to be 2. 2 mg/L for CE without sample stacking and 0. 10 mg/L with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sample extraction involved homogenization and enzymatic extraction with a-amylase. Results indicated that FA was stable during four main stages of instant fried noodle manufacturing (dough crumbs, cut <b>sheets,</b> <b>steaming</b> and frying) ...|$|R
5000|$|Surface {{steaming}} {{with special}} sheets (<b>sheet</b> <b>steaming)</b> {{is a method}} which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m² in one step. If properly applied, <b>sheet</b> <b>steaming</b> is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m² can be steamed in 4-5 hours down to 25-30 cm depth / 90 °C. The usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5 mm thick, 500 gr / m², can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet {{after it has been}} laid out and weighted with sand sacks.|$|E
5000|$|A {{steaming}} hood is {{a mobile}} device consisting of corrosion-resistant {{materials such as}} aluminum, which is put down onto the area to be steamed. In contrast to <b>sheet</b> <b>steaming,</b> cost-intensive working steps such as laying out and weighting the sheets don’t occur, however the area steamed per working step is smaller in accordance {{to the size of}} the hood.|$|E
50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with <b>sheet</b> <b>steaming.</b> The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7-8 kg/m². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|E
40|$|A simple, rapid procedure, using {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE), {{that can}} efficiently measure added folic acid in fortified instant fried noodles {{has been developed}} and validated. Optimum separation of folic acid was obtained on a 72 cm × 75 μm capillary using 8 mM phosphate- 12 mM borate run buffer with 5 % MeOH at pH 9. 5, temperature of 30 °C and voltage of 28 kV. The extracts were introduced into the capillary via electrokinetic injection and the folic acid monitored at 214 nm. For quantification purposes, nicotinic acid was added as internal standard to all samples. Under these conditions the analysis required approximately 12 min. Good results were obtained for different analytical parameters including linearity, accuracy and precision. The limit of detection was calculated to be 5. 3 mg/L. Prior to CZE determination, noodle samples were homogenized in the buffer solution for 1 h followed by treatment with α-amylase solution for 1 h at 65 °C or protease solution for 4 h at 37 °C. The enzyme solution was added at a concentration of 25 mg/L and then adjusted to pH 7. 0. Using standard addition to eliminate the effect of sample matrix interference, results showed that a higher and more efficient recovery of added folic acid could be obtained when using α-amylase. During the four main stages of instant fried noodle manufacturing (dough crumbs, cut <b>sheets,</b> <b>steaming</b> and frying) folic acid {{was found to be}} stable with recoveries of 96 – 103 %...|$|R
5000|$|Special copper or {{aluminum}} cylinders, {{with several}} small holes (the {{size of a}} needle eye), shape the cooked dough into noodle form. Pressing the dough requires great strength, as the dough is hard and the holes are small, so it is usually done with leverage. When one person presses the dough, another [...] "catches" [...] the noodles coming out on the other side, presses them together and cuts them off every 10 cm or so, creating a kind of mesh of noodle, which is then laid onto a flat surface, but not in layers. Finally, the <b>sheets</b> are <b>steamed</b> one last time for about five minutes.|$|R

40|$|Four {{months after}} {{application}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>steaming</b> {{to the soil}} in an organic greenhouse, the treatment had still {{a significant effect on}} the diversity of the soil microflora (bacterial and fungal populations).

40|$|Soil {{disinfection}} by steam is {{a well-known}} technique used within horticulture and market gardening. The most common steam application technique is <b>sheet</b> <b>steaming,</b> where the soil {{is covered with a}} thermo resistant sheet, which is sealed at the edges and then blowing steam under the sheet so that the steam penetrates through the soil. The method is effective for control of weed, plant pathogens and nematodes. However, high fuel consumption and low capacity are serious disadvantages. Moreover all living organisms, harmful and useful, in the treated soil are killed, and therefore the method is not in line with the basis ideas of organic farming. A new concept and technique for performing band heating has been developed. By heating only a narrow band of 6 – 8 cm around the rows to a depth of 5 cm, energy savings of more than 90 % can be obtained. In practice, the system may be combined with a computer-controlled sowing machine for the subsequent sowing of plants in the centre of the treated bands. The system will result in the crop growing in rows free of plant competition. It was seen that soil temperatures of 80 - 90 °C, were needed to achieve god effect in the field...|$|E
50|$|Noodles from instant ramen {{noodle soup}} are {{continuous}} viscoelastic gluten matrix evenly mixed with starch granules, salt, gums, and other additives and preservatives. There are three key ingredients {{in making the}} noodle dough, which are wheat flour, water and salt. After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveying belt which transports noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of blades on the slitters; therefore, noodle dough sheet could be pressed multiple times {{up and down and}} produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, noodle dough <b>sheets</b> undergo <b>steaming</b> and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of instant noodles.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Oxidative etching of {{graphene}} flakes {{was observed}} to initiate from edges {{and the occasional}} defect sites in the basal plane, leading to reduced lateral size and {{a small number of}} etch pits. In contrast, etching of highly defective graphene oxide and its reduced form resulted in rapid homogeneous fracturing of the sheets into smaller pieces. On the basis of these observations, a slow and more controllable etching route was designed to produce nano-porous reduced graphene oxide <b>sheets</b> by hydrothermal <b>steaming</b> at 200 C. The degree of etching and the con-comitant porosity can be conveniently tuned by etching time. In contrast to nonporous reduced graphene oxide annealed at the same temperature, the steamed nanoporous graphene oxide exhibited nearly 2 orders of magnitude increase in the sensitivity and improved recovery time whe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} drying paper by {{direct contact with}} {{superheated}} steam was determined {{with respect to the}} physical, optical and chemical properties of the dried sheet. The results were compared with those for paper dried in a similar fashion by direct contact with hot air. It was found that the results depended on the type of pulp from which the sheet was made. For thermomechanical pulp <b>sheets,</b> superheated <b>steam</b> drying resulted in improved strength properties; burst index, tensile index and elastic modulus were 20 - 30 % higher relative to the air dried sheets. The increase in strength was found to be due to an increase in bonded area, especially of the fine fraction, caused by the higher sheet temperatures occurring in the constant rate period of steam drying. As a result of the increased bonding but not due to any color change, brightness of the <b>steam</b> dried <b>sheet</b> decreased by 5 points. Steam drying of TMP sheets results in strength and optical properties more characteristic of paper made from CTMP. Superheated steam drying of kraft pulp sheets had a smaller and opposite effect, as strength properties decreased and optical properties increased relative to the properties of sheets dried in air. Unlike mechanical pulp, no increase in bonded area was observed because of the already high bonding potential of kraft fibres; a thermally induced drying stress relaxation is thought to be the cause of the decreased strength properties...|$|R
50|$|Early {{designers}} fitted curved <b>sheets</b> {{below the}} <b>steam</b> collector pipe, {{but these were}} not successful as {{the whole of the}} steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, blowdown valves ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's gauge glass and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level {{to the extent that the}} firebox crown becomes dangerously exposed.|$|R

40|$|Continuously {{increasing}} {{price of}} oil and gas, energy crisis and increased environmental consciousness towards the greenhouse gas emission have opened a new opportunity to the biomass, the oldest source of energy known to mankind. The energy source neutral to CO 2 needs to be utilized efficiently. One of the options {{to do so is}} gasification of biomass for transport biofuel production. In this work, the emphasis is on the composition of syngas production which can be further processed for conversion of biomass to transport biofuels. Biomasses such as wood chips are heated in a gasification reactor to produce a mixture of gases, mainly CO and H 2. Process flow <b>sheets</b> for <b>steam</b> gasification of woody biomass have been simulated in the process simulation program ASPEN PLUS to study the process and to optimize the process parameters, materials, catalysts and reaction condition for syngas production. The Peng-Robinson equation of state with Boston-Mathias is selected for the considered model. The model describes the hydrodynamic parameter and reaction kinetics modeling. The required kinetic expressions and hydrodynamic equations are extracted from the literature. Gasification temperature, biomass moisture, steam to biomass ratio (STBR), air-fuel ratio, air and steam temperature are the most important operating parameters that is considered and studied to examine the gasifier performance. The impact of these process parameters on gasification is determined by sensitivity woody analysis. The results regarding composition of the syngas and the heating value for the considered biomass is compared with experimental data from the literature. The suggested model can be used as the guideline for more complex gasifier design and selection of the process equipment...|$|R
40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} coated paper production: first, when drying the base paper, then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on coated paper quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base paper and coated paper drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight coated (LWC) paper. A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry coated paper by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the coated paper physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base paper was coated and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright coated paper than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the coated sheet. The biggest effect on LWC coated paper quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried coated paper were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in air. Print mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the coated <b>sheet.</b> Superheated <b>steam</b> drying of coated paper has advantages only if used for the coated sheet not the base sheet...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{superheated}} steam drying were determined for surface properties and pore structure of paper, properties which {{are important in}} the end use of paper. Two furnishes were investigated, thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and a TMP/kraft pulp blend. Drying of handsheets under matched conditions in air {{was used as the}} basis of comparison. TMP paper dried in {{superheated steam}} has a slightly higher surface roughness, by about 0. 5 $ mu$m at a roughness around 8 $ mu$m. This difference decreases with drying fluid temperature. It is also reduced by about half after a very light blade coating. Surface roughness of paper from 50 / 50 TMP/kraft blend is unaffected. Superheated steam drying reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30 %- 60 % depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of drying in superheated steam drying is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments. The Z-direction bond strength of TMP paper after surface treatment with water is about 20 % higher for <b>sheets</b> dried in <b>steam.</b> Time for water absorption is 100 %- 150 % longer for superheated steam dried TMP paper and contact angle of water is also substantially increased. Superheated steam drying substantially reduces the volume of micropores of diameter 0. 2 - 0. 6 $ mu$m while having no significant effect on larger pores. Thus superheated steam drying affects only the pore structure of the micronetwork. The decrease of micropore volume in superheated steam drying is associated with an increase of Z-direction bond strength and a decrease of light scattering coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The steam {{generator}} plays a primary {{role in the}} safety and performance of a pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant. The cost to utilities is {{in the order of}} millions of Rands a year {{as a direct result of}} damage to {{steam generator}}s. The damage results in lower efficiency or even plant shutdown. It is necessary for the utility and for academia to have models of nuclear components by which research and analysis may be performed. It must be possible to analyse steam generator performance for both day-to-day operational analysis as well as in the case of extreme accident scenarios. The homogeneous model for two-phase flow is simpler in its implementation than the two-fluid model, and therefore suffers in accuracy. Its advantage lies in its quick turnover time for development of models and subsequent analysis. It is often beneficial for a modeller to be able to quickly set up and analyse a model of a system, and a trade-off between accuracy and time-management is thus required. Searches through available literature failed to provide answers to how the homogeneous model compares with the two-fluid model for operational and safety analysis. It is expected to see variations between the models, from the analysis of the mathematics, but it remains to be shown what these differences are. The purpose of this study was to determine how the homogeneous model for two-phase flow compares with the two-fluid model when applied to a u-tube steam generator of a typical pressurized water reactor. The steam generator was modelled in both RELAP 5 and in Flownex. A custom script was written for Flownex in order to implement the Chen correlation for boiling heat transfer. This was significantly less detailed than RELAP 5 ’s solution of a matrix of flow regimes and heat transfer correlations. The geometry of the models were based on technical drawings from Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant, and were simplified to a one-dimensional model. Plant data obtained from Koeberg was used to validate the models at 100 %, 80 % and 60 % power output. It was found that the overall heat transfer rate predicted with the RELAP 5 two-fluid model was within 1. 5 % of the measured data from the Koeberg plant. The results generated by the homogeneous model for the overall heat transfer were within 4. 5 % of the measured values. However, the differences in the detailed temperature distributions and heat transfer coefficient values were quite significant at the inlet and outlet ends of the tube bundle, at the bottom tube <b>sheet</b> of the <b>steam</b> generator. In this area the water-level was not accurately modelled by the homogeneous model, and therefore there was an under-prediction in heat transfer in that region. Large differences arose between the Flownex and RELAP 5 solutions due to difference in the heat transfer correlations used. The Flownex model exclusively implemented the Chen correlation, while RELAP 5 implements a flow regime map correlated to a table of heat transfer correlations. It was concluded that the results from the homogeneous model for two-phase flow do not differ significantly when compared with the two-fluid model when applied to the u-tube steam generator at the normal operating conditions. Significant differences do, however, occur in lower regions of the boiler where the quality is lower. We conclude that the homogeneous model offers significant advantage in simplicity over the two-fluid model for normal operational analysis. This may not be the case for detailed accident analysis, which was beyond the scope of this study. Master...|$|R
