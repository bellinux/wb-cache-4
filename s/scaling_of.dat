5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E

The <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> fluctuation estimated from the sampling programs were compared with the predefined <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> fluctuation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation in risk-adjustment models for health-care costs affects the covariate effect, where the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> {{interest for the}} covariate effect may {{be different from the}} <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. As an illustrative example, we use claims data to estimate the incremental costs associated with heart failure within one year subsequent to myocardial infarction. Here, the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest for the effect of heart failure on costs is additive. However, traditional methods for modeling costs use predetermined <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation - for example, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes an additive scale while log-transformed OLS and generalized linear models with log-link assume a multiplicative <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We compare these models with a new flexible model that lets the data determine the appropriate <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We use a variety of goodness-of-fit measures along with a modified Copas test to assess robustness, lack of fit, and over-fitting properties of the alternative estimators. Biases up to 19 % in the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest are observed due to the misrepresentation <b>of</b> the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. The new flexible model is found to appropriately represent the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation and less susceptible to over-fitting despite estimating additional parameters in the link and the variance functions.
