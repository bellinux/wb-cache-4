They developed a shorter international version of the survey which has been used in their home region of Victoria BC as well as in Brazil. The Pennocks also collaborated with Ura in the production of a policy lens which is used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan ...|$|E

2500|$|Sadie Hawkins Day and [...] are {{two terms}} {{attributed}} to Al Capp that {{have entered the}} English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include skunk works and Lower Slobbovia. The term shmoo has also entered the lexicon, defining highly technical concepts in no less than four separate fields of science, including the variations shmooing (a microbiological term for the [...] "budding" [...] process in yeast reproduction), and shmoo plot (a technical term {{in the field of}} electrical engineering). In socioeconomics, a [...] "shmoo" [...] refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to [...] "widgets" [...] which require resources and active production.) In the field of particle physics, [...] "shmoo" [...] refers to a high energy <b>survey</b> <b>instrument,</b> as utilized at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the Cygnus X-3 constellation. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as druthers, schmooze and nogoodnik, neatnik, etc. In his book The American Language, H.L. Mencken credits the postwar mania for adding [...] "-nik" [...] to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning—not with beatnik or Sputnik—but earlier, in the pages of Li'l Abner.|$|E

Eleven <b>survey</b> <b>instruments</b> were identified, of which nine were evaluated on participation. All of the nine instruments measure participation to some extent. The two instruments closest to solely involve items on participation level are the Perceived Handicap Questionnaire (PHQ) and the London Handicap Scale (LHS). The PHQ is measuring the perception of participation. In the LHS, the items are formulated in terms of participation, while the response categories include all components of the ICF, from problems in body function to participation...|$|R
