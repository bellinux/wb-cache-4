40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the subject matter of visual communication in presentation brochures of two Swedish regions: Region Halland and Region Dalarna. My focuses are the following questions: what is the aim of the brochures and in what ways does the visual material relate to that aim? How can <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> through a visual perspective and in what ways is it useful in the context of presentation brochures of the regions? What sort of communicational functions are specific for the visual material in relation to the written language of the brochures? Lead by these questions, I start by analyzing the brochures through a textual analysis and a social semiotic approach. The result shows that the aim seems to be both political and commercial, but that the visual elements relate more strongly to the commercial aim than to the political aim by the way they strive to present a positive image of the region. The visual elements work in strategic ways that I define as visual strategies. This concept <b>is</b> further <b>defined</b> by three different aspects of it: visual strategies seen as a visual communication chain, visual strategies as a subcategory to <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> and finally visual rhetoric and social semiotics as tools for working with visual elements strategically, as well as analyzing them.

5000|$|<b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> <b>strategic</b> {{when it is}} {{completely}} consistent with the organisation mission, vision, values {{and when it is}} able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization’s perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this <b>communication,</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> should follow ‘The nature of organisational communication in general, and <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> in particular, <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission’ stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> something that does happen in the organisation, businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This {{will make it easier for}} them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‘These changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships’( [...] Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it <b>is,</b> <b>communication</b> strategy should <b>be</b> a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} institutionalization of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> as a dynamic interplay between macro- and mesolevel discourses.

40|$|Summary. <b>Strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> wage. This master thesis {{discuss the}} term from the widest {{definitions}} down to NATOs <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> in Afghanistan. The essence of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> {{to convince a}} designated population to place their confidence in a politically approved narrative. <b>Strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> a top-down process, where the narrative is communicated in every possible way, through kinetic and none kinetic means. “In military operations, actions speak as loudly, if not louder, than words” (NATO, 2010). Is the way NATO plans and performs <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> really supporting the alliance desired end state in Afghanistan? This thesis is a literature study of external communication in NATO. Afghanistan is utilized as a case study. The thesis employ communication theory to analyze the way NATO <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> conducted in the ISAF operation. The theoretical focal point is Jürgen Habermas theory of communicative action. The analysis is done according to a hermeneutic circle method. First an analysis of NATO communication, when a synthesis of the alliance presence in Afghanistan, {{and in the end}} a consequence analysis. This thesis argue that the NATO long term goal, a self sustained Afghanistan that represents no threat to the NATO members, best can be achieved through communicative social action - dialogue. Attempting to sell inn NATOs narrative in Afghanistan is a strategic social action, and will according to the theory be an obstacle for long term relation building, trust and coherent inner motivation for supporting the NATO effort in Afghanistan. An open and curios approach to <b>communication</b> will <b>be</b> far more beneficial, than the current strategic approach. If NATO utilizes its resources in collaboration with central and local afghan leaders, the support for and success of the ISAF operation is far more likely. Relation building and respect for afghan culture and tradition is a key to mutual understanding, and a prerequisite for dialogue. A possible arena for this dialogue is the traditional afghan jirga gatherings. Generative dialogue with NATO and among afghan leaders, may conceive the feeling that the afghan people are masters of their own destiny.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{approaches the}} manifestations of ideology in U. S. <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication.</b> The discussion approaches <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> by relating {{it to the}} Enlightenment narratives and suggesting these narratives maintain similar social and political functions. This dissertation aims to address the key contents and mechanisms of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> by covering the perspectives of (i) communication as leadership as well as (ii) communication as discourse, i. e. practice and contents. Throughout the empirical part of the dissertation, the <b>communication</b> theoretical discussion <b>is</b> supported by a methodological framework that bridges Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and functional language theory. According {{to the principles of}} CDA, <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> treated as ideological, hegemonic discourse that impacts social order. The primary method of analysis is transitivity analysis, which is concerned with how language and its patterns construe reality. This analysis is complemented with a discussion on the rituals of production and interpretation, which can be treated as visual extensions of textual transitivity. The concept of agency is the key object of analysis. From the perspective of leadership, <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> essentially a leadership model through which the organization defines itself, its aims and legitimacy. This dissertation arrives to the conclusion that <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> used not only as a concept for managing Public Relations and information operations. It is an esse ntial asset in the inter-organization management of its members. The current developments indicate that the concept is developing towards even heavier measures of control. From the perspective of language and discourse, the key narratives of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>are</b> advocated with the intrinsic values of democracy and technological progress as the prerequisites of ethics and justice. The transitivity patterns reveal highly polarized agency. The agency of the Self is typically outsourced to technology. Further, the transitivity pa tterns demonstrate how the effects-centric paradigm of warfare has created a lexicon that is ideologically exclusive. It has {{led to the development of}} two mutually exclusive sets of vocabulary, where the desc riptions of legitimate ac tion exclude Others by default. These ideological discourses have become naturalized in the official vocabulary of strategic planning and le adership. Finally, the analysis of the images of the captures and deaths of Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Muammar Gaddafi bring the discussion back to the themes of the Enlightenment by demonstrating how democracy is framed to serve political purposes. The images of democracy are essentially images of violence. Contrary to the official, instrumental and humanitari an narratives of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication,</b> it <b>is</b> the grammar of expressive, violent rituals that serve as the instrument of unity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> a {{relatively}} young discipline, which gains {{more and more}} acknowledgement in practice and academia. <b>Strategic</b> <b>communication</b> respects that organisations are not only communicating by words, pictures, symbols and logos, but as well by products and brands. Even more important became the communication by corporate behaviour and acceptance of corporate social responsibility. In this understanding, organisations depend and rely much on stakeholder management, proposing that simple shareholder orientation is not sufficient within the permanent struggle for survival. This splits corporate communications into two streams, market and non-market <b>communication,</b> which <b>are</b> both important with regard to create a unitary perception for an organisation and involves a variety of disciplines with their different theoretical frameworks. Hence, the approach of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> comprises three major disciplines, strategy, marketing and communication. In the understanding of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication,</b> these disciplines {{should not be taken}} as separate organisational efforts to address target groups, but should be united in one holistic endeavour for the achievement of an organisation's unitary perception. This challenges the present borderlines especially between marketing and communication as not being any more appropriate in the ways they are applied and implemented in organisational structures. Unitary perception itself is an important means for gaining competitive advantage and, as a tool, for achieving wider awareness in an over-communicating world. As well, <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>is</b> oriented towards the markets of the future, which cannot be seen as those today. This means that theories, concepts and models of marketing and <b>communication</b> need to <b>be</b> developed further to deal with permanently changing consumer behaviour, especially with regard to postmodern hyper-consumers. <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> as an overarching discipline and coordinating function for an organisation's marketing and <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> therefore suggested as an appropriate synthesis for value-oriented and sustainable organisational performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> {{held to be}} a {{key process}} by which organisations respond to {{environmental}} uncertainty. In the received view articulated in the literatures of organisational communication and public relations, <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> results from collaborative efforts by organisational members to create shared understanding about environmental uncertainty and, {{as a result of this}} collective understanding, formulate appropriate communication responses. In this study, I explore how such collaborative efforts towards the development of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>are</b> derived from, and bounded by, culturally shared values and assumptions. Study of the influences of an organisation‟s culture on the formulation of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental conceptual challenge for public relations and, to date, a largely unaddressed area of research. This thesis responds to this challenge by describing a key property of organisational culture – the action of cultural selection (Durham, 1992). I integrate this property of cultural selection to extend and refine the descriptive range of Weick‟s (1969, 1979) classic sociocultural model of organizing. From this integration I propose a new model, the Cultural Selection of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Communication</b> (CSSC). Underpinning the CSSC model is the central proposition that because of the action of cultural selection during organizing processes, the inherently conservative properties of an organisation‟s culture constrain development of effective <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> in ways that may be unrelated to the outcomes of “environmental scanning” and other monitoring functions heralded by the public relations literature as central to organisational adaptation. Thus, by examining the development of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication,</b> I describe a central conservative influence on the social ecology of organisations. This research also responds to Butschi and Steyn‟s (2006) call for the development of theory focusing on <b>strategic</b> <b>communication</b> as well as Grunig (2006) and Sriramesh‟s (2007) call for research to further understand the role of culture in public relations practice. In keeping with the explorative and descriptive goals of this study, I employ organisational ethnography to examine the influence of cultural selection on the development of <b>strategic</b> <b>communication.</b> In this methodological approach, I use the technique of progressive contextualisation to compare data from two related but distinct cultural settings. This approach provides a range of descriptive opportunities to permit a deeper understanding of the work of cultural selection. Findings of this study propose that culture, operating as a system of shared and socially transmitted social knowledge, acts through the property of cultural selection to influence decision making, and decrease conceptual variation within a group. The findings support the view that <b>strategic</b> <b>communication,</b> as a cultural product derived from the influence of cultural selection, is an essential feature to understand the social ecology of an organisation...|$|R
