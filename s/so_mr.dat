5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|The {{fireplace}} hearth in {{the living}} room integrates boulders found on the site and upon which the house was built— ledge rock which protrudes up to a foot through the living room floor was left in place to demonstrably link the outside with the inside. Wright had initially intended that the ledge be cut flush with the floor, but this {{had been one of the}} Kaufmann family's favorite sunning spots, <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kaufmann suggested that it be left as it was. The stone floors are waxed, while the hearth is left plain, giving the impression of dry rocks protruding from a stream.|$|E

25|$|Now {{fully aware}} of Carbunkle's plan, a desperate Sara informs the whole of Greendale about Carbunkle's true {{intentions}} and explaining that deep down, Pat has not changed. They all agree to head to London to support Pat, {{in an effort to}} thwart Carbunkle's plan. Meanwhile, Jess, who had been stowing away on one of the SDS helicopter replicas that one of the Patbot 3000s used, manages to make his way to where Pat’s performance, and he helps Pat escape after he is almost locked away in a dressing room by a Patbot and Mr Carbunkle, who reveals that Pat's publicity was just to make people like him, <b>so</b> <b>Mr</b> Carbunkle could replace him with Patbots. They are then pursued by the Patbots.|$|E
25|$|By that time, Drake sails and rigging {{had been}} reduced to tatters by Ranger broadsides, and even the masts and yardarms were seriously damaged; in the light wind, the sloop was more or less immobilised, not even able to turn to aim a broadside. Unable to load fast enough, the small-arms fighters had retreated to cover, so only about a dozen people were left on Drake main deck. A few minutes after the captain died, the two {{remaining}} petty officers on deck went to the master and advised him that they should strike their colours and surrender; after further consultation, he agreed. The colours had already been shot away, <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Walsh had to shout and wave his hat instead. According to John Paul Jones's records, the duel lasted one hour and five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. <b>So</b> <b>Mr.</b> Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

25|$|In Sentell v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company, 166 U.S. 698 (1897), Mr. Sentell {{sued the}} New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company {{to recover the}} value of his female Newfoundland dog that he alleged to have been negligently killed by the {{railroad}} company. The company claimed that Louisiana law held that only people who licensed their dogs were entitled to sue for compensation if the dog were killed, and that Mr. Sentell was not entitled to damages since he had not licensed his dog. The trial court in Orleans Parish found for Mr. Sentell and awarded him $250 US, so the railroad company appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, which reversed the decision of the trial court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear the case, <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sentell then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which agreed to hear the case.|$|E
25|$|Overnight {{there was}} a strong {{northwest}} wind and heavy sea, drenching everyone in the boats. At first light on 24 October the boats could not see each other. Mr Vernon's boat hoisted its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat to heave to with her sea anchor. At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top pintle, so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild <b>so</b> <b>Mr</b> Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her sea anchor and sail.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Burns makes {{a million}} dollar bet with Aristotle Amadopolis, {{owner of the}} Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory, Mr. Burns decides to hire major league stars, {{including}} Shoeless Joe Jackson, Pie Traynor, Harry Hooper, Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Nap Lajoie, Gabby Street, Mordecai [...] "Three Finger" [...] Brown, and Jim Creighton to join his team. Smithers informs Mr. Burns that the players he picked have all retired and died (noting Creighton {{had been dead for}} 130 years), <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns orders him to find current players. He hires nine Major League Baseball players— Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, Jose Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia— and gives them token jobs at the plant so they can play on the team, to the dismay of the plant workers. Mr. Burns also hires a hypnotist to train the team, and Wonder Bat is destroyed, to Homer's dismay, by a pitch from Clemens during practice.|$|E

500|$|On February4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach {{improved}} sketches {{for both}} sides. Beach {{had been under}} the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates 1775—1925; on February5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words [...] "PILGRIM" [...] and [...] "HUGUENOT" [...] respectively before [...] "HALF DOLLAR", and proposed that the word [...] "PATRIOT" [...] appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April19, the anniversary of both battles, is Patriot Day in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words [...] "THE CONCORD MINUTE MAN" [...] appear even if it was illegible, [...] "the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stone and I have been very particular to come to an agreement as to all details." ...|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in November 1891, and the Republicans took {{a two-thirds majority}} in the legislature. [...] During the campaign, supporters of both Foraker and Sherman had sought pledges from candidates, and {{in the aftermath of}} the legislative elections, both men expressed confidence. Sherman was handicapped by his age (68), unpopularity, and a cold personality; according to Horner, [...] "Foraker was simply more of a man of the people than Sherman could ever hope to be." [...] Sherman's aide, Jacob C. Donaldson, later wrote, [...] "the situation was bad, almost desperate". [...] Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates, and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker; according to his biographer, Herbert Croly, [...] "The situation looked desperate; but it was saved, <b>so</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sherman himself stated to his friends, by Mr. Hanna's energy, enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will. Three of the Cleveland representatives, who had gone into hiding, were unearthed and forced into line." [...] Donaldson noted, [...] "Several of them were ruined by their perfidy." [...] Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus, first on a vote to hold a secret ballot (which would have benefited him), and then on the endorsement vote, which supported Sherman, who was subsequently elected by the legislature. [...] According to Horner, [...] "It is difficult to know which mattered more to Hanna—making sure his old friend Sherman kept his job or making sure that Foraker did not get it." ...|$|E

Ms Frizzle thinks the meeting is tomorrow, but it is really today. <b>So</b> <b>Mr</b> Wilde, the assistant principal, decides to catch her so he can tell her about the meeting.

2500|$|From 1983 to 1985, Fischer was {{a member}} of the Bundestag for the Green party. His stint in federal {{parliament}} saw him frequently engage in a frank and confrontational debating style, exemplified by an incident on 18 October 1984, when he addressed Richard Stücklen, then vice president of the parliament, with the words: [...] "If I may say <b>so,</b> <b>Mr.</b> President, you are an asshole" [...] (German: [...] "Mit Verlaub, Herr Präsident, Sie sind ein Arschloch."). In 1985, Fischer became Minister for the Environment in the Landtag of Hesse in the first governmental Red-Green coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Greens. Fischer caused a stir when he appeared at his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers. These sneakers are now part of the shoe collection at the German Leather and Shoe Museum in Offenbach, Hesse.|$|E
2500|$|The cases seem to {{show that}} the divide between [...] "fact" [...] and [...] "opinion" [...] is partly {{affected}} by the balance of knowledge and expertise between the parties. In Bisset v Wilkinson Mr Bisset said his land in New Zealand could support 2000 sheep. Both he and Mr Wilkinson knew sheep had not been farmed before. Mr Wilkinson tried to pull out after the contract was signed, but the Privy Council advised that the statement was only one of opinion, not fact given that there was no dishonesty, and considering the [...] "knowledge of the parties respectively, and their relative positions". In the more recent case of Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR emphasised again that knowledge of facts was crucial in being liable for a misrepresentation. Here Esso told Mr Mardon, a prospective franchisee, that its Southport petrol station would have 200,000 customers a year. In fact the projections were wrong, and <b>so</b> <b>Mr</b> Mardon was entitled to claim compensation for his losses. The distinction between Esso and Mr Bisset is that Esso was in a far better position to know what was true.|$|E
