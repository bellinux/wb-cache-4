5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as <b>stage</b> <b>machinery</b> and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E

Long shots showing the car were filmed with a miniature car and a landscape rolling past it, creating a multiplane effect. Most scenes, including the detailed and faithful recreation of the Place de l'Opéra outside the Opera House, were painted studio sets, as was Méliès's custom. However, the last scene, showing the arrival at Monte Carlo, was filmed not in the studio but outdoors in Méliès's garden.|$|E

Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate <b>stage</b> <b>machinery</b> to create special effects.

25|$|Nevertheless, Mazarin {{proceeded}} with a newly composed Italian opera, Luigi Rossi's Orfeo.

Another group of Italian singers was brought to France, and after many delays Orfeo finally premiered on 2 March 1647.

25|$|Torelli {{was born}} in Fano, where he may have first worked on amateur theatre {{productions}} at the Palazzo della Ragione, and he may also have gained experience in theatre design in nearby Pesaro or Urbino. His first documented work was in January 1641 {{for the opening of}} the Teatro Novissimo in Venice, where he was involved in the design of scenery and <b>stage</b> <b>machinery</b> for Francesco Sacrati's opera La finta pazza. This was followed with designs for two other works by Sacrati at the same theatre, Bellerofonte in 1642 and Venere gelosa in January 1643. He may also have worked on Francesco Cavalli's Deidamia, staged in 1644, also at the Teatro Novissimo. Torelli's last work in Venice was for Sacrati's L'Ulisse errante, performed during the carnival season of 1644 at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo.|$|E

60|$|They would err greatly, {{who should}} {{regulate}} their ideas of this dramatic exhibition upon those {{derived from a}} modern theatre; for the rude shows of Thespis were far less different from those exhibited by Euripides {{on the stage of}} Athens, with all its magnificent decorations and pomp of dresses and of scenery. In the present case, there were no scenes, no <b>stage,</b> no <b>machinery,</b> no pit, box, and gallery, no box-lobby; and, what might in poor Scotland be some consolation for other negations, there was no taking of money at the door. As in the devices of the magnanimous Bottom, the actors had a greensward plot for a stage, and a hawthorn bush for a greenroom and tiring-house; the spectators being accommodated with seats on the artificial bank which had been raised around three-fourths of the playground, the remainder being left open for the entrance and exit of the performers. Here sate the uncritical audience, the Chamberlain in the centre, as the person highest in office, all alive to enjoyment and admiration, and all therefore dead to criticism.|$|R

500|$|In the {{original}} 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens.

Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of Chicago Ring cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on bungee cords anchored in the fly space above the stage, enabling them to dive up and down, as intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.|$|E

500|$|Although {{contained}} {{within a single}} stage set, the production was lavish, with 300 men employed to manipulate the <b>stage</b> <b>machinery.</b> Follino's report described the set as [...] "a wild rocky place {{in the midst of}} the waves, which in the furthest part of the prospect could be seen always in motion". As the action began, Apollo was revealed [...] "sitting on a very beautiful cloud... which, moving down little by little... reached in a short space of time the stage and... disappeared in a moment". Thereafter, all the performers proved excellent in the art of singing; [...] "every part succeeded more than wondrously". Follino's enthusiasm was echoed in other reports made by dignitaries to their own courts. The ambassador for the House of Este, who referred to the work as [...] "a comedy in music", mentioned in particular Andreini's performance which, in her lament, [...] "made many weep", and that of Francesco Rasi, who as Bacchus [...] "sang divinely". Monteverdi's fellow composer Marco da Gagliano wrote that Monteverdi's music had [...] "moved the entire audience to tears". In all, the opera lasted for two and a half hours.|$|E
500|$|Rinuccini {{extended}} the libretto during the rehearsals, after complaints from the duchess that {{the piece was}} [...] "too dry"; {{as a result the}} early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven, were added. Preparations for the opera's performance were disrupted when, in March 1608, the leading soprano Caterina Martinelli died of smallpox. A replacement had to be found rapidly, and the title role fell to Virginia Andreidi, a renowned actress-singer who used the stage name [...] "La Florinda"; she reportedly learned the part in only six days. In his analysis of Monteverdi's theatrical works, Carter suggests that the lament may {{have been added to the}} work to make the most of Andreini's acting and vocal abilities. The premiere, on 28 May 1608, was staged in a specially erected temporary theatre, which according to contemporary reports could hold an audience of several thousands. The production was lavish; apparently 300 men were required to manipulate the <b>stage</b> <b>machinery.</b> Federico Follino, who prepared the Mantuan court's official report on the occasion, praised the beauty of the work, the magnificence of costumes and machinery, and the sweetness of the music. Monteverdi's fellow-composer Marco da Gagliano was equally complimentary, writing that the opera had [...] "visibly moved the entire audience to tears." [...] It is possible that L'Arianna was performed in Florence in 1614; a projected performance in Mantua in May 1620 to celebrate Duchess Caterina's birthday was cancelled for unknown reasons. Otherwise, there are no records of the opera's performance before its revival in 1640 at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice. In his study of late Renaissance opera, Gary Tomlinson surmises that the work's enthusiastic reception in Venice was a significant factor in Monteverdi's decision to resume opera composition during his final years.|$|E
2500|$|Torelli's most {{significant}} innovation was the Pole and Chariot system of <b>stage</b> <b>machinery,</b> consisting of sub-stage trolleys connected by ropes {{to a central}} drum, that allowed multiple flats to be changed quickly {{in full view of}} the audience in a highly co-ordinated manner by a single assistant under the stage, rather than slowly by a crew of as many as sixteen stage hands. [...] This not only saved labour, amongst other things, but also created spectacular scenic effects, the popularity of which led to a notable increase in the number of set changes per opera. Torelli also designed machinery for flying characters around the stage, mimicking weather effects, and so on, and was nicknamed the ‘grand stregone’ (great magician).|$|E

A Watch Tower presentation to Warwick planning authorities said the complex would house up to 850 people. In July 2012, the Warwick planning commission approved the environmental impact statement for building the Warwick site. In July 2013, Warwick approved building plans of the multiple building complex of the new headquarters, including four residence buildings of 588 rooms for about 1,000 people.

His innovations in <b>stage</b> <b>machinery</b> allowed not only stage flats to be changed, but also {{the borders of the}} sky. [...] This allowed an interchange between interior and exterior sets, and Torelli would often alternate between open and enclosed sets to create a new sense of rhythm in the visual aspect of opera.
