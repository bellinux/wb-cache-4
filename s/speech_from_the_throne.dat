5|$|Although a Liberal {{by family}} {{heritage}} and disposition, Primrose never sought public office, or ever actively participated in politics. On September 10, 1936, {{on the advice}} of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Primrose was appointed to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Alberta by Governor General John Buchan, succeeding William L. Walsh, his old friend. He was sworn in on October 1, 1936. During his time as Lieutenant-Governor, Primrose and his wife resided in Government House, however, during this time, he was plagued by illness, therefore making him essentially unable to fulfill his duties of office, remaining in medical care from October 19, 1937 until his death. Most of his duties were carried out by his wife, Lily, who hosted the 1937 New Year's Day reception at Government House, and served as an honorary officer of the Royal Alexandra Hospital Women's Auxiliary. Public functions were also attended by others family members, assisting in the absence of Primrose.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is focused on}} developing an exploratory model that can help explain the factors that affect the political desire for electoral reform. The model, premised on institutional and rational actor theories, develops a set of “endogenous” and “exogenous” factors that allow for evaluation of electoral reform discourse. While some {{attention is paid to}} the major reforms that the electoral system has undergone since Confederation, detailed analysis is reserved to the post- 1980 period. Data was collected from party manifestos and <b>Speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Throne.</b> Because <b>the</b> federal government has not made any structural changes to its electoral system, provincial and international electoral reforms are considered for the potential influence by “contagion”. Institutional barriers to reform are also factored into the model.

Understandings of the task and {{possibilities}} of politics This paper analyses three different periods with the Swedish Social Democratic Party in office (1960 - 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1995 - 2000). The paper analyses how questioning of modernity {{and the role of}} science and technology is dealt with in policy documents, such as <b>speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> governmental declarations and party programmes. In this discussion the environmental issue is of special interest, since it in a special way challenge the modernistic ideas of progress and possibility to control the future. The analysis shows an increasing emphasis of the modern in the late 1990 s. This could be defined as a modernistic answer to the challenges modern society and its institutions have met during the latest decades.

This thematic cycle replicates earlier results from an analysis of party platforms in American presidential elections. The thematic cycle is correlated with the Kondratieff economic cycle, the latter reflecting recurring crises in capitalist societies. The 52 -year thematic cycle reflects a debate within society as to the legitimacy of capitalist political economy under varying economic conditions and in light of periodic structural reorganizations of the economy. Finally, the content-analytic findings are {{discussed in terms of}} Wallerstein's "world system " concept and the two dominant conceptions of power in macrosocial analysis. Do you know those charts, where the movement of prices, discount rates, etc [...] during the year is plotted? To analyze the phenomenon of crisis, I have attempted several times to compute the formulas of those irregular curves (I think that is possible if sufficient reliable material can be made available) in order to determine mathematically the main laws governing the crisis. 1 Marx to Engels, May 1873 How is the legitimacy of capitalism maintained despite long-term structural changes in political economy?

When in 1867 PedroII openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in his <b>Speech</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Throne,</b> Porto Alegre {{was one of the few}} individuals who supported him, sending him a letter of congratulation. On 18 June 1869, the Partenon Literário (Literary Parthenon), a spiritual successor to the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro, was created and Porto Alegre was made an honorary member. In one of its sessions, the count, who had already embarked on a plan of gradually freeing his own slaves, proposed the creation of a civil association devoted to slavery's abolition. His idea was not only welcomed but came to fruition. The Sociedade Libertadora (Liberation Society) was founded on 29 August, with Porto Alegre as its president, its primary purpose being the purchase of freedom for enslaved children.|$|E

5000|$|The Constitution of 1856 {{unequivocally}} re-established royal sovereignty. [...] "Sovereign power {{resides in}} the person of the King-Grand Duke …." [...] The Chamber of Deputies again assumed its old name of an [...] "Assembly of Estates". It lost its power over the annual budget and taxes, the right to elect its president, the right to meet beyond a brief period when summoned, as well as the right to respond to <b>speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> with an address. The members of the government were no longer responsible to the parliament. The Constitution of 1856 strongly reinforced executive power, and weakened the national elected representatives. In order to counterbalance the drawbacks of unicameralism, William III created the Council of State, whose members were appointed by the King and which shared legislative power with the Assembly of Estates. The revision of 1856 also subordinated national law to federal law. The members of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, conscious of the danger of being absorbed by the German unification movement, had confined themselves to stating that Luxembourg [...] "is part of the Confederation, in line with existing treaties". The text of 1856 declared that [...] "the Grand Duchy … is part of the Germanic Confederation and participates in the rights and duties of the federal Constitution". This meant that the restrictive laws on the press and associations in force in Germany were applicable in Luxembourg. For a short while, after the revision of the Constitution, the government worked without the legislature, by making use of decrees. It enacted around forty decrees on the press, the electoral system, the pay and status of civil servants, the internal order of the Assembly of Estates, the organisation of the courts, the cadaster, the Chamber of accounts, the communes and the militia.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing hath humbled me so much, or shewn {{a greater}} {{disposition}} to a contemptuous treatment of Ireland in some chief governors,[17] than that high style of several <b>speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> delivered, as usual, after the royal assent, in some periods {{of the two}} last reigns. Such high exaggerations of the prodigious condescensions in the prince, to pass those good laws, would have but an odd sound at Westminster: Neither do I apprehend how any good law can pass, wherein the king's interest is not as much concerned {{as that of the}} people. I remember after a speech on the like occasion, delivered by my Lord Wharton, (I think it was his last) he desired Mr. Addison to ask my opinion of it: My answer was, [...] "That his Excellency had very honestly forfeited his head on account of one paragraph; wherein he asserted by plain consequence, a dispensing power in the Queen." [...] His Lordship owned it was true, but swore the words were put into his mouth by direct orders from Court. From whence it is clear, that some ministers in those times, were apt, from their high elevation, to look down upon this kingdom {{as if it had been}} one of their colonies of outcasts in America. And I observed a little of the same turn of spirit in some great men, from whom I expected better; although to do them justice, it proved no point of difficulty to make them correct their idea, whereof the whole nation quickly found the benefit?--But that is forgotten. How the style hath since run, I am wholly a stranger, having never seen a speech since the last of the Queen.|$|R
6000|$|... (M55) The {{antecedents of}} the memorable crisis of 1866-7 were curious. Reform bills had been {{considered}} by five governments since 1849, and mentioned in six <b>speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> Each political party had brought a plan forward, and Lord John Russell had brought forward three. Mr. Bright also reduced his policy to the clauses of a bill in 1858. In 1859 Lord Derby’s government had introduced a measure which old whigs and new radicals, uniting their forces, had successfully resisted. This move Mr. Gladstone—who, as the reader will recollect, had on that occasion voted with the tories(140)—always took to impose a decisive obligation on all who withstood the tory attempt at a settlement, {{to come forward with}} proposals of their own. On the other hand, in the new parliament, the tory party was known to be utterly opposed to an extension of the franchise, and a considerable fringe of professing liberals also existed who were quite as hostile, though not quite as willing to avow hostility before their constituents. All the leaders were committed, and yet of their adherents the majority was dubious or adverse. The necessity of passing a Reform bill through an anti-reform parliament thus produced a situation of unsurpassed perplexity. Some thought that formidable susceptibilities would be soothed, if the government were reconstructed and places found for new men. Others declared that the right course would be first to weld the party together by bills on which everybody was agreed; to read a good Reform bill a first time; then in the recess the country would let ministers see where they were, and the next session would find them on firm ground. But Lord Russell knew that he had little time to spare—he was now close upon seventy-four—and Mr. Gladstone was the last man to try to hold him back.|$|R

60|$|It {{is proper}} that his Majesty {{and all his}} people should be {{informed}} that the House of Commons have proceeded, {{with regard to the}} East India Company, with a degree of care, circumspection, and deliberation, which has not been equalled in the history of Parliamentary proceedings. For sixteen years the state and condition of that body has never been wholly out of their view. In the year 1767 the House took those objects into consideration, in a committee of the whole House. The business was pursued in the following year. In the year 1772 two committees were appointed for the same purpose, which examined into their affairs with much diligence, and made very ample reports. In the year 1773 the proceedings were carried to an act of Parliament, which proved ineffectual to its purpose. The oppressions and abuses in India have since rather increased than diminished, on account of the greatness of the temptations, and convenience of the opportunities, which got the better of the legislative provisions calculated against ill practices then in their beginnings; insomuch that, in 1781, two committees were again instituted, who have made seventeen reports. It was upon the most minute, exact, and laborious collection and discussion of facts, that the late House of Commons proceeded in the reform which they attempted in the administration of India, but which has been frustrated by ways and means the most dishonorable to his Majesty's government, and the most pernicious to the Constitution of this kingdom. His Majesty was so sensible of the disorders in the Company's administration, that the consideration of that subject was no less than six times recommended to this House in <b>speeches</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|R

It involved four parties, and only very implausible ideological combinations (e.g., Liberals + Conservatives; Liberals + BQ; Conservatives + BQ + NDP) could actually command a majority of the seats, a necessity if a government is to retain power.

The reference to Lucas was unmistakable, and the commons, on a motion of Sir Richard Cox, ordered Lucas and his printer to appear at the bar of the house. Esdall, Lucas's publisher, absconded; but the copy of his publications presented to the lord-lieutenant was put in evidence against him. The feeling of the house ran strongly against him, although the people of Dublin were hotly in his favour.
