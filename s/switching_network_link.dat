40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of controlling a network of locally interacting mobile agents, subject {{to a set of}} non-local topology constraints, towards a group flocking objective. As opposed to <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> <b>links</b> directly in the space of discrete graphs, yielding a divide in spatial configuration and communication topology, we regulate topology through mobility, enabling adjacent agents to retain or deny links spatially on the basis of constraint satisfaction. Specifically, we propose a distributed formulation consisting of a switching control and smooth potential fields for local link discrimination and flocking, coupled with consensus-based coordination over proposed topology changes, yielding transitions in communication that respect non-local constraints and correspond to agent configuration. An analysis of the interplay between the topology consensus and constraint composition, together with a Lyapunov-like convergence argument guarantee the flocking, collision avoidance, and constraint satisfaction properties of the system. Finally, simulations of a novel constrained coordination scenario highlight the correctness and applicability of our proposed methods. I...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{complexity}} of embedded multiprocessor architectures for digital media processing will soon require highly scalable communication infrastructures. Packet switched networks-on-chip (NoC) {{have been proposed}} to support the trend for systems-on-chip integration.

It consists of a library of soft macros (<b>switches,</b> <b>network</b> interfaces and <b>links)</b> that are design-time composable and tunable so that domain-specific heterogeneous architectures can be instantiated and synthesized. Links can be pipelined with a flexible number of stages to decouple link throughput from its length and to get arbitrary topologies.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} energy saving in IP {{networks}} and proposes a distributed energy-aware traffic engineering solution, named DAISIES, for <b>switching</b> off <b>network</b> <b>links</b> according to traffic variations. DAISIES {{works in a}} connection-oriented network, e. g. an IP/MPLS network, and follows a routing-based approach, i. e. it acts on the routing algorithm whilst link switch-off/on are consequence of routing decisions. The basic idea is to re-compute the path of each traffic demand when its requested capacity changes. A specific cost function is used to compute link weights into the shortest path routing algorithm {{with the goal of}} keeping unused as many links as possible. The main advantages of DAISIES can be summarized as follows: (i) no changes are required to current routing and signaling protocols, (ii) packet loss is completely avoided, (iii) both traffic decreasing and increasing and changing network conditions are automatically managed, and (iv) link switch-off/on take place transparently to the routing protocol and to other nodes. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of energy saving relative to a static network optimized to support the peak traffic. Results show that DAISIES is able to save about 30 % of energy in several traffic conditions. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible keeping the additional complexity low and still reaching high energy efficiency. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Network {{robustness}} and throughput can {{be improved}} by routing each source-to-terminal (s, t) demand via two link-disjoint paths (TLDP). However, the use of TLDP incurs higher energy cost. Henceforth, we {{address the problem of}} minimizing the energy usage of networks that use TLDP. Specifically, our problem is to maximally <b>switch</b> off redundant <b>network</b> <b>links</b> while maintaining at least 0 ≤T≤ 100 % of (s, t) TLDP in the network, for a given T, and limiting the maximum link utilization (MLU) to no greater than a configured threshold. To address this problem, we present a fast heuristic, called TLDP by Shortest Path First (TLDP-SPF), and extensively evaluate its performance on both real and/or synthetic topologies and traffic demands. Our simulation results show that TLDP-SPF can reduce network energy usage, on average, by more than 20 %, even for MLU below 50 %. As compared to using Shortest Path routing, while reducing energy by about 20 %, TLDP-SPF does not significantly affect (s, t) path length, even for MLU< 50 %...|$|R

In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity.
