25|$|In 2012, {{a decree}} in Paris allowed cyclists {{in that city}} to turn right or, {{if there is no}} street to the right, proceed {{straight}} ahead on red, under the condition that they “exercise caution” and yield to pedestrians, after road safety experts deemed the measure would reduce collisions. During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or going straight at a T-junction.|$|E
25|$|Police {{vehicles}} are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or {{position on the}} road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such {{as the right to}} exceed speed limits, or to treat red <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists {{to move out of the}} direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are being}} used with {{increasing}} frequency in automotive lamps. They offer very long service life, extreme vibration resistance, and can permit considerably shallower packaging compared to most bulb-type assemblies. LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in <b>stop</b> <b>lights,</b> because when power is applied they rise to full intensity approximately 250 milliseconds (¼ second) faster than incandescent bulbs. This fast rise time not only improves the intentional conspicuity of the stop lamp, but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the stop lamps. However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED stop lamps less likely to be struck from behind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>lights</b> and lane {{indicators}} are generally observed on major streets, but are often viewed more as suggestions rather than legally enforced traffic rules unless traffic {{police officers are}} present. Speed limits are often not enforced, except where specifically designated speed detection cameras are present and marked with signs, making traffic conditions {{some of the most}} dangerous on the island. Most major intersections have traffic signs with Romanized names. However, despite the fact that Taichung City has recently declared Hanyu Pinyin the official romanization system for the city, there are numerous signs left over from previous romanizations, while a large number of minor intersections have no romanization of any kind. Navigation in Taichung City is extremely difficult for those who are unable to read Chinese characters.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} such emergency-braking {{indicator}} systems is to catch following drivers' attention with special urgency. However, there remains considerable {{debate over whether}} the system offers a measurable increase in safety performance. To date, studies of vehicles in service have not shown significant improvement. The systems used by BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes differ not only in operational mode (growing vs. intensifying vs. flashing, respectively), but also in such parameters as deceleration threshold of activation. Data are being collected and analyzed {{in an effort to}} determine how such a system might be implemented to maximise a safety benefit, if such a benefit can be realised with visual emergency braking displays. An experimental study at the University of Toronto has tested <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> which gradually and continuously grow in illuminated area with increasing braking.|$|E

500|$|Annoyed that Peter {{spends more}} time {{watching}} television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to [...] "rev" [...] her engine twice at <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, {{and is about to}} admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.|$|E

2500|$|Advocates for Idaho stop laws {{argue that}} they improve safety. Two studies of the Idaho stop show that it is measurably safer. One study showed that it {{resulted}} in 14% fewer crashes and another indicated that Idaho has less severe crashes. Similarly, tests of a modified form of the Idaho Stop in Paris [...] "found that allowing the cyclists to move more freely cut down the chances of collisions with cars, including accidents involving the car's blind spot." [...] And, less definitively, a study of rolling stops in Seattle determined that [...] "these results support the theoretical assertion that bicyclists are capable of making safe decisions regarding rolling stop," [...] while a 2013 survey of stop as yield in Colorado localities where it is legal reported no increase in crashes. Another study done in Chicago showed that compliance with stop signs and <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> by cyclists was low when cross-traffic was not present, but that most were still performing an Idaho Stop; and therefore [...] "enforcing existing rules at these intersections would seem arbitrary and capacious(sic)." [...] Some supporters maintain that changing the legal duties of cyclists provides direction to law enforcement to focus attention where it belongs—on unsafe cyclists (and motorists). Additionally, some claim that, because bicycle laws should be designed to allow cyclists to travel swiftly and easily, the Idaho stop provision allows {{for the conservation of}} energy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subject matter}} of his work turned toward the rapidly {{approaching}} 500th anniversary in 1992 of Christopher Columbus, and his arrival in North America. He found in this event, a rich source for a discussion {{on the nature of}} culture, as well as revisions and versions of history. He created at this time,(1989–1992) a body of work entitled The Columbus Project. Its first stage had exhibition venues in Peterborough, Ontario at both ArtSpace (curated by Shelagh Young), and also the Art Gallery of Peterborough. The second phase of the Columbus Project was an exhibition at The Power Plant in Toronto, curated by Richard Rhodes entitled the Columbus Boat. The exhibition continued on to venues in Italy and the United States. Beam's imagery for the Columbus Project was cross-culturally vast, and contained the primary images of Columbus, and Native peoples, but also images of Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, [...] Albert Einstein, and Abraham Lincoln, Italian Christian iconography, diverse animal species, self-portraits and technology (<b>stop</b> <b>lights,</b> rockets). There were two sculptural elements, Voyage a partial reconstruction of the Santa Maria, and the Ampulleta, a [...] hourglass, with one obstructive stone within the sand, as well as several installations, and a video performance of Beam in the Dominican Republic, making a representational graveyard on the beaches where the landing could have taken place.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of slow and <b>stopped</b> <b>light</b> have attracted a {{growing interest in}} recent years, not only in relation to fundamental physics but also due to the possibility to enhance the density of states over a broad bandwidth. In this thesis the effects of both loss and gain on slow and <b>stopped</b> <b>light</b> are investigated in a representative metamaterial and plasmonic waveguide setting, using both semi-analytic calculations and numerical time-domain simulations. Initially the influence of material loss {{on the ability to}} <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> in these passive structures is considered. By directly measuring the propagation of wavepackets it is demonstrated that extremely low group velocities, with deceleration factors of the order of 200, 000, can be achieved even in the presence of realistic material loss, resolving a previous dispute that this would not be possible. It is further shown that <b>stopped</b> <b>light</b> in the plasmonic waveguide is robust to low levels of surface roughness, currently a limiting factor in other slow light devices such as photonic crystal waveguides. The inclusion of gain materials into the waveguides is then investigated for loss compensation. Here full compensation of losses and even amplification of the modal fields is observed while maintaining zero group velocities. Importantly for the metamaterial waveguide it is found that the effective negative refractive index is maintained even in the amplification regime, as previously it had been suggested this would not be possible. Finally it is shown that in the amplification regime <b>stopped</b> <b>light</b> provides an inherent feedback mechanism leading to the dynamic formation of a lasing mode. The properties of these stopped-light lasing states are studied and it is shown that subwavelength localisation of the modal fields can be achieved, thus presenting a new route to creating nanoscale light sources.
