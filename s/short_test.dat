Because <b>short</b> <b>tests</b> have large measure-ment error, the authors ask whether they are reliable enough for classifying patients into a treatment and a nontreatment group. For a given certainty level, proportions of correct classifications were computed for varying test length, cut-scores, item scoring, and choices of item parameters. <b>Short</b> <b>tests</b> were found to classify at most 50 % of a group consistently.

2500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{underground}} railway linking the City of London {{with some of the}} railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s, and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854. To prepare construction, a <b>short</b> <b>test</b> tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological properties similar to London. This test tunnel was used for two years {{in the development of the}} first underground train, and was later, in 1861, filled up. The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for {{an underground}} [...] "inner circle" [...] connecting London's main-line termini.

40|$|Semiconductor {{manufacturing}} companies aim to achieve <b>shortest</b> <b>test</b> times for products {{while maintaining the}} product quality. Achieving <b>shortest</b> <b>test</b> times for devices requires multiple updates to the test flow and test content. Test cost varies {{in direct proportion to}} production test time required to test chips and detect fails. This thesis presents a method to achieve <b>shortest</b> <b>test</b> times by determining when the updates are needed and what are the changes to the test flow and test content. This thesis introduces a new Adaptive Test Scheme (ATS). ATS estimates individual test fail rates dynamically, per die, and makes real-time modifications to test order and test contents. ATS computes data-driven test fail rate estimates and uses the estimates to identify the required changes and trigger updates to test flow and test content. ATS uses Bayesian statistics to model the per test fail rates and update the test orders. ATS achieves test time reductions by employing per wafer elimination. ATS also incorporates a simple quality monitor, by resetting the test content at the start of next wafer. This thesis evaluates the performance of ATS with synthetic data generated by a Monte Carlo method and with production wafer sort data for two manufactured products. The product data results show ATS reduced by 20 % the total test-time for one product and by 40 % for a second product, with changes in product quality level below industry targets...|$|R
