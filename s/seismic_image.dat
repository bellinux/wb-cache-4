2500|$|Helioseismic holography, {{introduced}} in detail by Lindsey and Braun {{for the purpose}} of far-side (magnetic) imaging, a special case of phase-sensitive holography. The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions {{on the far side of}} the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a <b>seismic</b> <b>image</b> of a solar flare. Acoustic holography, applied to MDI data, is ideal for the detection of sources and sinks of acoustic waves on the Sun. Braun and Fan [...] discovered a region of lower acoustic emission in the 3 – 4 mHz frequency band which extends far beyond the sunspots (the ‘acoustic moat’). Acoustic moats extend beyond magnetic regions into the quiet Sun. In addition, Braun and Lindsey [...] discovered high-frequency emission (‘acoustic glories’) surrounding active regions.|$|E

40|$|Channels are {{important}} geologic {{features in the}} exploration for oil and gas, because channel sands make excellent reservoirs for oil and gas. With 3 D <b>seismic</b> <b>images</b> channels can often be mapped easily on time or depth slices, but in some situations they {{can be difficult to}} detect due to structural complexity or other factors. The steerable pyramid is a transform in which an image is decomposed in scale and orientation. Features can then be characterized according to dimensionality and direction using the partitioned image. An implementation of the steerable pyramid in 2 D and 3 D is used to highlight channels in <b>seismic</b> <b>images.</b> Examples of processing to enhance channels in synthetic <b>seismic</b> <b>images</b> demonstrate the efficacy of this approach...|$|R

5000|$|In {{reflection}} seismology, a {{flat spot}} is a seismic attribute anomaly that {{appears as a}} horizontal reflector cutting across the stratigraphy elsewhere present on the <b>seismic</b> <b>image.</b> [...] Its appearance can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons.

50|$|Dispersive {{body waves}} is an {{important}} aspect of seismic theory. When a wave propagates through subsurface materials both energy dissipation and velocity dispersion takes place. Energy dissipation is frequency dependent and causes decreased resolution of the seismic images when recorded in seismic prospecting. The attendant dispersion is a necessary consequence of the energy dissipation and causes the high frequency waves to travel faster than the low-frequency waves. The consequence for the <b>seismic</b> <b>image</b> is a frequency dependent time-shift of the data, and so correct timings for lithological identification cannot be obtained.|$|E

[...] Examples of seismic attributes can include measured time, amplitude, frequency and attenuation, in addition to combinations of these. Most seismic attributes are post-stack, but those that use CMP gathers, such as amplitude versus offset (AVO), must be analysed pre-stack.

Our technique combines conjugate gradient-based convolution operator inversion with noise regularization that is performed using non-linear curvelet coefficient shrinkage (thresholding).

The main goal is to adapt the mesh generation techniques in order to directly process digital <b>images</b> obtained by <b>seismic</b> survey. Traditionally, such images must first be examined by geologists and geophysicists who, in turn, model the fundamental geometric shapes, i. e., horizons and faults. The proposed technique generates meshes directly from the <b>seismic</b> <b>images,</b> by combining image processing and physical modeling.

The nature of the seismic experiment and the ever present sedimentary layering of the subsurface result in oscillatory and complex 3 -D <b>seismic</b> <b>images</b> In principle, computer programs can enhance geologically significant image features, such as faults, erosional surfaces, and salt boundaries. Standard edge enhancement, however, fails to compute useful seismic discontinuity maps.

A third approach, prediction-error filtering, yields detailed fault maps for images with sharp faults. For images with rather smooth fault zones, prediction error unfortunately fails...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of seismic migration, specularity {{is defined as the}} cosine of the angle made by the surface normal vector and the angle {{bisector}} of the angle defined by the directions of the incident and diffracted rays. For a purely specular seismic event the value of specularity should be equal to unity, as the angle between the surface normal vector and the angle bisector should be zero, according to Snell's Law. For a diffractive seismic event, the specularity can be sub-unitary. During the seismic migration, one can filter each seismic event according to the value of specularity, in order to enhance the contribution of diffractions in the <b>seismic</b> <b>image.</b> Alternatively, the events can be separated in different sub-images according to the value of specularity to produce a specularity gather.|$|E

50|$|In the {{situation}} of complex geology, e.g. faulting, folding, fracturing, salt bodies, and unconformities, pre-stack migration (PreSM) is used due to better resolution under such complex geology. In PreSM, all traces are migrated before being moved to zero-offset. As a result, much more information is used, which results {{in a much better}} image, along with the fact that PreSM honours velocity changes more accurately than post-stack migration. The PreSM is extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the velocity field. Thus the inadequacy of isotropic velocity models is not suitable for the pre stack depth migration. P-wave anisotropic prestack depth migration (APSDM) can produce a <b>seismic</b> <b>image</b> that is very accurate in depth and space. As a result, unlike isotropic PSDM, it is consistent with well data and provides an ideal input for reservoir characterization studies. However, this accuracy can only be achieved if correct anisotropy parameters are used. These parameters cannot be estimated from seismic data alone. They can only be determined with confidence through analysis of a variety of geoscientific material - borehole data and geological history.|$|E

When observed, a <b>seismic</b> <b>image</b> {{is the result of}} an initial deposit system that has been {{transformed}} by a set of successive geological deformations (flexures, fault slip, etc) that occurred over a large period of time. The goal of seismic restoration consists in inverting the deformations to provide a resulting image that depicts the geological deposit system as it was in a previous state. Providing a tool that quickly generates restored images helps the geophysicists to recognize geological features that may be too strongly altered in the observed image. The proposed approach is based on a minimization process that expresses geological deformations in terms of geometrical constraints.

In this project the subject is the use of curvature as a feature for automatic highlighting of saltdomes in <b>seismic</b> <b>images.</b> Saltdomes are of particular interest in seismic exploration, as they are often linked to hydrocarbon finds. By using the so-called dip to extract discrete curve segments representing the seismic horizons in the image, the local curvature may be estimated.

Derivative approximation is done by locally fitting a parabola to each data point, and approximating the derivatives in that point by the derivatives of the parabola.
