40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of the paper is identification and characteristics of a new research area that combines collective investment schemes and process of <b>securitisation.</b> In the paper we provide a descriptive analysis of <b>securitisation</b> investment funds in Poland and consider {{their role in the}} process of <b>securitisation.</b> We also identify major issues related {{to the development of the}} <b>securitisation</b> and <b>securitisation</b> funds market. The paper contains considerations related to the potential and to the direction of the <b>securitisation</b> funds development in Poland. In the paper we used critical analysis of legal solutions in Poland, as well as statistical data analysis. The work is based on statistical data of the domestic market of investment funds from The Chamber of Fund and Asset Management. The background for the analysis is the results of the original research prepared and conducted by the authors. The questionnaire was directed at management boards of nineteen Investment Fund Companies, which manage <b>securitisation</b> investment funds in Poland. At present a share of <b>securitisation</b> funds in the investment funds market in Poland isn’t large, however it is very quickly increasing. We can observe that the development of the <b>securitisation</b> fund market is intense. Despite this, the participation of investment funds in the process of <b>securitisation</b> is still in an early stage in Poland, however its influence on the future development of <b>securitisation</b> is considered as high. In Poland, Investment Fund Companies systematically increase the offer of <b>securitisation</b> funds by creating funds directed to individual investors (non-dedicated). Investment certificates of non-dedicated <b>securitisation</b> funds may encourage individual investors to diversify their investment portfolios. The potential development of the domestic market of <b>securitisation</b> funds is related to the legal and tax aspects of <b>securitisation</b> in Poland and the efficient cooperation between entities in the <b>securitisation</b> process...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} <b>securitisation</b> {{technology as}} a source of capital. <b>Securitisation</b> can be defined as a process of converting cash flows arising from underlying assets due to the originator into a smooth repayment stream, thus enabling the originator to raise asset-backed financing (funds). Deals are normally structured by a transfer of receivables from the originator to a newly established company known as a special purpose vehicle, designed to separate the receivables from the insolvency risk of the originator, and referred to as a “true sale”. In the US, <b>securitisation</b> is stable and mature. In Europe, the <b>securitisation</b> market is growing rapidly, and in Poland it is still at an early stage of development, having to cope with number of obstacles including legal and tax issues that hamper <b>securitisation</b> of all asset classes. The rationale for <b>securitisation</b> varies widely from company to company. One of the most frequently cited reasons for undertaking <b>securitisation</b> is a lower cost of funds, which is possible first of all because of the segregation of receivables from the insolvency risk of the originator. Another objective of <b>securitisation</b> may be the freeing of regulatory capital, balance sheet management, funding diversification, transfer of risk or a strategic profile. Market mechanisms in financial markets increasingly displace administrative solutions of allocating scarce capital. <b>Securitisation</b> facilitates disintermediation in financial markets. The use of asset <b>securitisation</b> is propelling the use of market mechanisms to allocate capital...|$|R

5000|$|Upon review, it {{is evident}} that the credit risk {{assessment}} conducted by these forms of lending was far more inadequate than with the traditional lending done by deposit banks (although many large traditional Banks turned out to be over-exposed to mortgage risk both via loans and through their investments in <b>securitisations).</b> Some mortgage loans even turned up to be liar's loans with some borrowers essentially being NINJA (No Income, No Job or Assets). In traditional banking, when a downturn occurred, branch managers could individually review clients' financial condition, separate good borrowers from bad ones and provide individually tailored adjustments. SIVs, on the other hand, are staffed by investment managers, who assess the content of pools of securitized loans, but not the individual loans. The banks were exposed to first loss risks while the SIVs were only exposed to last loss risk. The ratings on the most shaky types of sub prime <b>securitisations</b> were exposed when it turned out that complicated mathematical models, which is used to rate securitized loan, made fundamental assumptions {{that turned out to be}} wrong. The most significant among these assumptions were the trends in U.S. housing prices which declined far faster, deeper and broader than statistical model predicted.|$|E

40|$|Current {{explanations}} for <b>securitisation</b> rely predominantly on empirical logistic regression models. Quantitative models predicting {{the likelihood of}} <b>securitisation</b> do not consider all {{of the factors that}} influence the <b>securitisation</b> decision. In combination with conflicting extant literature and a lack of industry evidence, the answer to why some firms securitise and others do not is incomplete. This study examines how New Zealand (NZ) non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) make the decision to adopt and use <b>securitisation</b> and how that compares to extant theory. The background theory of capital structure is alone unable to address the research question, therefore a multidisciplinary framework is used to determine what could contribute {{to an understanding of the}} decision to adopt and use <b>securitisation.</b> Four case studies are carried out in NZ NBFIs and the findings are compared to literature from Finance, Decision Research, Psychology, and their related sub-disciplines. This research highlights the usefulness of a multidisciplinary approach to examining corporate finance decisions and the complementary nature of quantitative and qualitative models. Firm and region-specific information improves understanding of the <b>securitisation</b> decision at the micro level in areas previously unexplained by macro level theory. While NZ NBFIs make the decision to adopt and use <b>securitisation</b> in a manner consistent with aspects of <b>securitisation</b> and capital structure literature, this study provides insights into problems surrounding information availability, the importance of information sources and the reliance firms place on such information, decision-making methods utilised, the factors and process involved in selecting <b>securitisation</b> over alternative financing, and why some characteristics of securitisers in NZ differ from what is expected by quantitative <b>securitisation</b> models.

40|$|<b>Securitisation</b> theory {{serves as}} a useful {{corrective}} to the ‘climate determinism’ evident in mainstream debates on the security effects of climate change, but there are divergences within this approach over what constitutes ‘successful’ <b>securitisation.</b> For the Copenhagen School, climate change has not been securitised because relevant state actors do not yet accept that emergency measures are necessary to tackle ‘dangerous’ climate risks. In contrast, ‘sociological’ proponents of <b>securitisation</b> theory identify ‘successful’ <b>securitisation</b> evident from climate policies that would not otherwise have been undertaken without the political mobilisation of crisis narratives concerning threats to human and ecosystem health. These marked differences over climate change reflect, I argue, divergent spatialities deployed within <b>securitisation</b> theory. The Copenhagen School posits state-bounded territoriality as the power container dominating global security dynamics, viewing climate change as a weaker, deterritorial source of <b>securitisation.</b> Sociological approaches admit a wider set of security effects arising from the political mobilisation of climate threats because <b>securitisation</b> is claimed to emerge from diverse performative spaces. A critical application of <b>securitisation</b> theory to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict reveals insights from both strands on the outcomes of attempts to portray climate change as a regional security threat.

Therefore, in SIV intermediation, there is the same incentive to assess credit risk of borrowers, as they expect to hold the asset to maturity. However, the loan originators', typically a Bank's, reward is structured so that as more loans are made and sold wholesale, more commission will be earned. So there is little need for bank originators to monitor their borrowers' credit risk. The monitoring was the responsibility of the end investor in the securitised tranches and, theoretically, the rating agencies.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolvderhampton for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe introduction, and evolution of <b>securitisation</b> over the years, has made a phenomenal contribution to the area of corporate finance. <b>Securitisation</b> is specialised area which has evolved to deliver considerable advantages to banks and their corporate and government clients, a sub-subjected explored in this thesis. <b>Securitisation</b> is using the cashflow, creditworthiness and collateral of receivables to raise finance from the capital markets. To date, research on the subject of <b>securitisation</b> has produced a few textbooks and numerous articles written by academics and practitioners. The ambit of these writings addresses three questions, namely, what is securitisation; how does it work in practice; and how can <b>securitisation</b> be developed so that it can continue delivering advantages in the evolving world of corporate finance. <b>Securitisation</b> is very much a practical subject, and given that the author had very little, if any, practical exposure to the subject prior to developing this thesis, the author, admittedly, felt challenged to ascertain significant issues that could be developed to the extent that such development represents an original contribution to knowledge. Case law in the US had already explored the most significant issue regarding <b>securitisation,</b> namely, true sale. Armed with a solid theoretical base of knowledge that author looked for inspiration, and discovered it during the initial days when the Enron scandal hit the headlines. In short, the Enron scandal involved using the concept of <b>securitisation</b> to facilitate financial crime. The masterminds (if its appropriate to use such description) of the scandal, as this thesis will unfold later, cleverly used thousands of <b>securitisation</b> and hedging transactions to raise funds in order to give financial creditability to a giant corporation which on the surface appeared prosperous but, in reality, was breathing to a large extent on borrowed funds. This scandal, in which <b>securitisation</b> was used, inspired the author to develop the originality of the thesis by focusing on the issue of <b>securitisation</b> and financial crime. Given that financial crime is a huge area to explore, the author narrowed the focus to look at money laundering, and address the question: can the practice of <b>securitisation</b> facilitate money laundering? To approach this question and answer it at doctorate level required a solid understanding of what <b>securitisation</b> is and how it works in practice. Using textbooks, articles and conversations with practitioners, the thesis documents under Part 1, what <b>securitisation</b> is and how it works in practice before moving on to Part 2 to look at if and how <b>securitisation</b> can facilitate money laundering...|$|R

The ambit of these writings addresses three questions, namely, what is securitisation; how does it work in practice; and how can <b>securitisation</b> be developed so that it can continue delivering advantages in the evolving world of corporate finance. <b>Securitisation</b> is very much a practical subject, and given that the author had very little, if any, practical exposure to the subject prior to developing this thesis, the author, admittedly, felt challenged to ascertain significant issues that could be developed to the extent that such development represents an original contribution to knowledge. Case law in the US had already explored the most significant issue regarding <b>securitisation,</b> namely, true sale. Armed with a solid theoretical base of knowledge that author looked for inspiration, and discovered it during the initial days when the Enron scandal hit the headlines. In short, the Enron scandal involved using the concept of <b>securitisation</b> to facilitate financial crime. The masterminds (if its appropriate to use such description) of the scandal, as this thesis will unfold later, cleverly used thousands of <b>securitisation</b> and hedging transactions to raise funds in order to give financial creditability to a giant corporation which on the surface appeared prosperous but, in reality, was breathing to a large extent on borrowed funds. This scandal, in which <b>securitisation</b> was used, inspired the author to develop the originality of the thesis by focusing on the issue of <b>securitisation</b> and financial crime. Given that financial crime is a huge area to explore, the author narrowed the focus to look at money laundering, and address the question: can the practice of <b>securitisation</b> facilitate money laundering? To approach this question and answer it at doctorate level required a solid understanding of what <b>securitisation</b> is and how it works in practice. Using textbooks, articles and conversations with practitioners, the thesis documents under Part 1, what <b>securitisation</b> is and how it works in practice before moving on to Part 2 to look at if and how <b>securitisation</b> can facilitate money laundering.

40|$|<b>Securitisation</b> in Asia and the Pacific: {{implications}} for liquidity and credit risks 1 A surge in structured finance in Asia and the Pacific {{has been driven}} by the <b>securitisation</b> of consumer loans and mortgages, a largely liquidity transforming activity. The <b>securitisation</b> of corporate debt in the region has so far seen relatively few deals but has a largely untapped potential to enhance the allocation of credit risks. JEL classification: G 150, G 180, G 210 and O 160. In recent years, financial markets in Asia and the Pacific have seen significant growth in the <b>securitisation</b> of domestic assets. 2 This growth has been based largely on the repackaging of residential mortgages and consumer finance assets rather than of corporate debt. In the countries hit by the 1997 Asian crisis, the new laws and regulations that allowed <b>securitisation</b> were in some cases spurred by a need to deal with the flood of non-performing loans that flowed from the crisis. While a few transactions based on corporate debt were undertaken for this purpose, the recovery from the crisis was accompanied by a rise of households as the dominant class of borrowers. Hence, the great bulk of <b>securitisation</b> deals in the region have been based on household debt. In general, there are two main advantages to <b>securitisation.</b> First, it can turn ordinarily illiquid assets into reasonably liquid instruments. Second, it can create instruments of high credit quality out of debt of low credit quality. Since <b>securitisation</b> in the Asia-Pacific region has been based largely on residential mortgages and consumer loans, in relative terms it has tended to enhance liquidity rather than reallocate credit risk. In the next section we explain the basic <b>securitisation</b> techniques. Following this, we provide a brief overview of the growth and composition of <b>securitisation</b> in the Asia-Pacific region. In the third section we consider th...|$|R
