I {{told him that}} {{politics}} down in that tropical atmosphere {{was bound to be}} different from the nineteenth district; but I might just as well have been a Congressman from North Dakota trying to get an appropriation for a lighthouse and a coast survey. Denver Galloway had ambitions in the manager line, and what I said didn't amount to as much as a fig-leaf at the National Dressmakers' Convention.

We like you, and we want to help you <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> married, but we can't be unfair to the others on the staff. If we start giving you bonuses, don't you see we're going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to Penniman and Laylock? Right's right, and discrimination is unfair, and there ain't going to be any of it in this office! Don't get the idea, Stan, that because during the war salesmen were hard to hire, now, when there's a lot of men out of work, there aren't a slew of bright young fellows that would be glad to step in and enjoy your opportunities, and not act as if Thompson and I were his enemies and not do any work except for bonuses.

50|$|Such a {{technology}} is time travel. Einstein’s equations do show that time travel is possible. However, {{this would not}} be developed for a time scale of centuries or even millennia from now. This would make it a Class II impossibility. The two major physical hurdles are energy and stability. Traveling through time would require the entire energy of a star or black hole. Questions of stability are: will the radiation from such a journey kill you and will the “aperture” remain open <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> back? According to Dr. Kaku in an interview, “the serious study of the impossible has frequently opened up rich and unexpected domains of science”.|$|E

Just start with the freshest ingredients you can find and then you've got two choices: long slow cooking over low indirect heat, or red hot and smokin' for fast grilling. If you cook low and slow then you can use all sorts of rubs and smoking agents to infuse the food with a depth of flavour you just can’t get out of an oven. As for high heat grilling, your barbecue puts out way more heat than your stovetop <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that wonderful charring and searing, just like in a restaurant." ...|$|E

[...] Kaindi said a blackboard left {{at the scene of the}} attack could indicate that the separatist Mombasa Republic Movement (MRC) was responsible. MRC denied any role in the attack, saying the government was using them as a scapegoat. Political tension in Kenya is high, and opposition leader Raila Odinga has used recent attacks as a chance to criticise the government.|$|E

In the Bagan dynasty, when King Popa Saw Rahan (also known as King Taungthugyi) governed the country, it was named [...] "San Tauk Village".
