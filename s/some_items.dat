5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While <b>some</b> <b>items</b> are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E

5|$|Items {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum {{in a new and}} enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items with sample items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>items</b> {{of sports}} equipment, which rely on {{high-performance}} materials, {{have been made}} with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats and bicycle frames and components.

The American firearm manufacturing company Smith & Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of the first floor {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. The first floor may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E

The restaurant has received mixed reviews from critics, but has been listed in The World's 50 Best Restaurants since 2010, and was named by Egon Ronay as the best restaurant in the UK in 2005. The Good Food Guide ranked Hibiscus as the eighth-best restaurant in the UK in the 2013 edition. It has also been awarded five AA Rosettes.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on the screen. The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that <b>some</b> <b>items</b> of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E

5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> {{were hard}} to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. <b>Some</b> <b>items,</b> including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E

It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of <b>some</b> <b>items</b> permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies {{have the right to}} refuse the carriage of certain items.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was originally}} published in 1723 as Hemingi chartularium ecclesiæ Wigorniensis, in two volumes edited by Thomas Hearne. This {{was part of the}} Chronica Anglia series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20volumes. Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary Richard Graves. This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as <b>some</b> <b>items</b> were omitted, and marginalia were not always transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Group D dates {{as far back}} as the Middle Preclassic period. Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included <b>some</b> <b>items</b> associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5000|$|The Bubuti system {{occurs when}} one {{is in need of}} <b>some</b> <b>item</b> and may borrow it from a friend, {{relative}} or neighbour. Culturally speaking, it is shameful to refuse such a request but situation and context does have a bearing on the outcome.|$|R

5|$|Andover {{competed in}} the first Hampshire Senior Cup in 1888, but became {{involved}} in controversy after they were knocked out of the competition by Woolston Works. During this match, a Glasgow–based player called J. Kesson played for Woolston in their victory. Andover protested that Kesson should be disqualified {{on the grounds of}} residency—although he had played for Woolston Works earlier that season, he had since moved back to Glasgow. Woolston's appeal rested on the fact that Kesson had left <b>some</b> <b>items</b> of clothing at his lodgings in Woolston, and this should be interpreted as his intention to return. The Hampshire FA upheld the appeal, allowing Woolston to progress through to the next round and eventually win the inaugural competition.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows <b>some</b> <b>items</b> to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. <b>Some</b> <b>items</b> also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E

50|$|A common {{variation}} of the above involves the vanishing hitchhiker departing as would a normal passenger, having left <b>some</b> <b>item</b> in the car, or having borrowed a garment for protection against alleged cold. The vanishing hitchhiker can also leave some form of information that allegedly encourages the motorist to make subsequent contact.|$|R
50|$|An implied {{warranty}} of fitness for a particular purpose is a warranty implied by law that if a seller knows or has reason to know of a particular purpose for which <b>some</b> <b>item</b> is being purchased by the buyer, the seller is guaranteeing that the item is fit for that particular purpose.|$|R
