50|$|Leading {{can be used}} {{to enhance}} the {{readability}} of a page or block of text. The standard leading used in printing is usually +2 points for mechanically set body text, or +20% in digital typesetting. In both cases, with a 10 pt font the usual leading is 12 pt, creating a 10/12 ratio, which is considered <b>single</b> <b>spacing.</b> Some type designers recommend a leading between 120% and 145% of the font size.Double spacing is an entrenched practice due to the era of typewriters and, in academic settings, to allow the addition of handwritten comments and proofreading. Typewriters had a limited number of options for leading, and double spacing was chosen as a default. Double spacing can increase the amount of unused white space on a page and lessen the number of lines on a page. Too much leading can cause continuity problems, as the eyes of the reader are required to travel a greater distance between lines of text.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} growth and physical environment of cultivation {{to determine the}} efficiency in which the sugarcane, cultivated in two row spacing configurations, converts solar radiation into biomass in Alagoas state - Northeastern of Brazil. For this purpose, the sugarcane variety RB 98710 was cultivated, in plot with a <b>single</b> <b>spacing</b> and other with combined spacing. Biometric and solarimetric measurements were performed to evaluate plant growth and net radiation inside the canopy. The extinction coefficient (k), radiation use efficiency (RUE), specific heat of combustion, energy stored in dry matter (DM) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) were determined for both row spacings. Plants of cultivated with <b>single</b> <b>spacing</b> had k value equal to 0. 48 (± 0. 03) and value of k with combined spacing was 0. 51 (± 0. 02). The RUE of sugarcane plants were 2. 73 (± 0. 09) and 2. 78 (± 0. 25) g MJ - 1 of intercepted photonsynthetically active radiation (R 2 = 0. 96 and 0. 83) in single and combined spacing, respectively. The average specific heat of combustion of the different sugarcane parts was equal to 16, 300 J g - 1 of DM, but the DM value of stalks was equal to 15, 600 J g - 1. Thus, the ECE values were 4. 4 and 4. 5 % respectively for crops with single and combined row spacings. </p...|$|E
