In 1998, the group was charged with creating a sustainable development scheme for the region (finally launched in 2005), whilst in 2003 it adopted a plan for safeguarding sensitive environments and landscapes. In 2007, it produced its position statement regarding the classification of Mont Blanc as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in 2009 a Transboundary Integrated Plan (PIT) was announced, with the implementation of six regional projects running until 2013. In 2014, the group launched [...] "Strategy for the Future", which is intended to be a <b>strategic</b> <b>tool</b> for ensuring that public policies are consistent across the different territories around the Mont Blanc massif.|$|E

Former President of Pakistan and the ex-chief of the Pakistan military Pervez Musharraf also stated in an interview that Pakistani government helped to form underground militant groups to fight against Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir and [...] "turned a blind eye" [...] towards their existence because it wanted to force India to enter negotiations. The British Government have formally accepted that there is a clear connection between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and three major militant outfits operating in Jammu and Kashmir, Lashkar-e-Tayiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that <b>strategic</b> {{management}} <b>tools</b> and techniques are important parts of the strategic management process. Their use in organizations should be observed in a practice-based context. This paper analyzes the empirical studies on the usage of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques. Hence, the main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and analyze which enterprises, according to their country development level, use more <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques and which of these are used the most. Also, this paper investigates which <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques are used globally according to the results of empirical studies. The study presents a summary of empirical studies for the period 1990 – 2015. The research results indicate that more <b>strategic</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques are used in developed countries, followed by developing countries and fewest in countries in transition. This study is likely to contribute to the ﬁeld of strategic management because it summarizes the most used <b>strategic</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques at the global level according to varying stages of countries’ economic development. Also, the ﬁndings from this study may be utilized to maximize the full potential of enterprises and reduce the cases of entrepreneurship failures, through creating awareness of the importance of using <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} one of the few studies to review the {{empirical}} literature on <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques usage. There are many techniques, tools and methods, models, frameworks, approaches and methodologies, available to support strategic managers in decision making. They are developed and designed to support managers in all stages of strategic management process to achieve better performance. Management schools provide knowledge of these tools. But their use in organizations should be seen in practice‑based context. Consequently, some questions arise: Do they use these <b>strategic</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques in their workplace? Which <b>strategic</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques are used more in organizations? To answer these questions we have made a review of empirical studies using textual narrative synthesis method. Initially, this study presents a tabulation with a summary of empirical research for the period 1990 – 2015. The included studies are organized clustering them by enterprise size and sector and by country level development. A synopsis of the ten most used <b>strategic</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques worldwide resulted as follows: SWOT analysis, benchmarking, PEST analysis, “what if” analysis, vision and mission statements, Porter’s five forces analysis, business financial analysis, key success factors analysis, cost‑benefit analysis and customer satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{investigation}} of <b>strategic</b> managmene <b>tools</b> and techniques used by Czech companies. The quantitative approach {{was used for the}} analysis of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques. The aim of the quantitative approach was to collect and analyse data about the awareness, satisfaction and utilization of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques. The empirical research was conducted via a questionnaire survey of Czech companies. Empirical data were collected from 74 companies in Czech Republic. For the data entry and processing data were used the Statictical package for the Social Science (SPSS). The study presents four groups of tools and techniques based on the perceived results of manager’s utilization and satisfaction. The most of the examined tools and techniques concentrated on the two groups: (1) power tools, this group include the tools and techniques with high level of utilization and high level of satisfaction; (2) rudimentary tools, which includes the tools and techniques with low satisfaction and low utilization. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between utilization of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques and managerial awareness. The results provide essential information on the application of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques, and indicate the level of managerial awareness of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques. In addition the findings indicate a positive relationship between the utilization of <b>strategic</b> management <b>tools</b> and techniques and managerial awareness...|$|R

The course serves {{as a means of}} preparing students to capitalize on opportunities afforded by a case-based capstone course and to better meet the needs and expectations of prospective employers. The course format utilizes active and deep learning to provide students with the ability to identify a marketing problem, select and use a <b>strategic</b> marketing <b>tool</b> or set of tools appropriate to its solution, collect and analyze relevant data, and make concrete data-based recommendations. Knowledge of the problem identification-to-recommendation process is enhanced via a “learning spiral, ” which requires students to apply additional tools in different contexts, thus increasing their breadth and depth of understanding.
