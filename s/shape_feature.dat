Two hundred sixty-five HRCT images from 82 subjects were selected. On each image, two experienced radiologists selected regions of interest (ROIs) representing area of severe centrilobular emphysema, mild centrilobular emphysema, bronchiolitis obliterans, or normal lung. Besides 13 textural <b>features,</b> additional 11 <b>shape</b> <b>features</b> were employed to evaluate the contribution of <b>shape</b> <b>features.</b> To optimize the system, various ROI size (16 [*]×[*] 16, 32 [*]×[*] 32, and 64 [*]×[*] 64 pixels) and other classifier parameters were tested. For automated classification, the Bayesian classifier and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented. To assess cross-validation of the system, a five-folding method was used. In the comparison of methods employing only the textural <b>features,</b> adding <b>shape</b> <b>features</b> yielded the significant improvement of overall sensitivity (7. 3 %, 6. 1 %, and 4. 1 % in the Bayesian and 9. 1 %, 7. 5 %, and 6. 4 % in the SVM, in the ROI size 16 [*]×[*] 16, 32 [*]×[*] 32, 64 [*]×[*] 64 pixels, respectively; t test, P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

5000|$|A popular {{explanation}} for the different reaction times of feature and conjunction searches is the feature integration theory (FIT), introduced by Treisman and Gelade in 1980. This theory proposes that certain visual features are registered early, automatically, and are coded rapidly in parallel across the visual field using preattentive processes.Experiments show that these features include luminance, colour, orientation, motion direction, and velocity, {{as well as some}} simple aspects of form. For example, a red X can be quickly found among any number of black Xs and Os because the red X has the discriminative feature of colour and will [...] "pop out." [...] In contrast, this theory also suggests that in order to integrate two or more visual features belonging to the same object, a later process involving integration of information from different brain areas is needed and is coded serially using focal attention. For example, when locating an orange square among blue squares and orange triangles, neither the colour feature [...] "orange" [...] nor the <b>shape</b> <b>feature</b> [...] "square" [...] is sufficient to locate the search target. Instead, one must integrate information of both colour and shape to locate the target.|$|E

In general the prediction of bacterial genes is significantly simpler and more accurate than the prediction of genes in eukaryotic species that usually have complex intron/exon patterns.Identifying genes in long sequences remains a problem, especially when the number of genes is unknown. Hidden markov model can be part of the solutions. Machine learning has played a significant role in predicting the sequence of transcription factors. Traditional sequencing analyzing used focused on the statistical parameters of nucleotide sequence itself (The most common programs used are listed in Table 4.1).
