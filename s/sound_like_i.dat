[...] He later worked in similar capacity for various other singers, including Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where he accompanied singers such as Joel Grey.|$|E

As described in the lyrics, Tunstall was inspired to a career in music through looking at a black and white picture of a woman. Admiring her strength and accomplishments, she suddenly realised {{what she wanted to do}} with her life. Tunstall explained in an interview that the song was [...] "about the photograph of Patti Smith on the cover of Horses", Commenting on the song's later use in The Devil Wears Prada, Tunstall said: [...] "I didn't realize the lyrics could perfectly fit a chick flick, and it could <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was singing about wanting to be a fucking model!"

I knew I had {{to get away from the}} slick sound I had with the Peter Asher record...I was a little stung by the lack of response to The Glow. And I was disappointed by not being able to make a record that sounded the way I wanted it to sound. Moving to Shangri-la, I wanted to get back to the roots and to the funkiness I had on earlier records, even though I'm not crazy about how they sound.

[...] Andre praised the album, when he said [...] "for me, Lindsay has the whole package. A songwriter and singer {{that reminds me of}} Nichole Nordeman and Christy Nockels; Lindsay has an honest heart, inspirational lyrics, litters these songs with truth from the Bible, and is not afraid to push musical boundaries. If this is what her debut <b>sound</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> can’t wait for album #2! Jason has also hits the nail on the hammer once again, and I am praying for an increase is God’s blessing for the both of them. All 11 songs are beautifully sung and written.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World in 2011 Fredrik states [...] "My dad always listened to jazz, and I guess that influenced me to learn about improvisation. An improvised solo sounds {{so much better than}} a written one. For me, there's not much thinking going on at all, only a reaction to what I'm being told from the inside. And no, I have not had any formal training. When I record my leads, they are usually based on feel and totally ignorant to all laws of music theory. This, of course, is because I just play whatever comes out. There are no rules. But on certain songs, I do {{have to figure out what}} scales I need to use to follow chord changes. Since I'm not very good with all the scales, I sometimes have to write parts down and plan things ahead. I usually improvise the first part, then insert the written part and continue to improvise until the end of the solo. It's a very confusing way to do it, but I do whatever it takes to make it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> know what I'm doing".|$|E
5000|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company Regal Recordings thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> ... <b>I</b> didn't have the confidence {{to say no to}} some of the things Hillier suggested".

5000|$|In The County Of Kings is {{the fifth}} album (fourth {{full-length}} album) from the Eric Stuart Band, in which Eric Stuart is the songwriter and lead singer. This album was released in 2007 under Stuart's own independent label, Widow's Peak Records. The title of the album comes from Kings County, Brooklyn, where Stuart was born and raised. In addition, the front cover art depicts the Brooklyn Bridge and New York City in juxtaposition with the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx of Giza, and the Valley of the Kings, which are in Egypt. The musical style of In The County Of Kings is more country-sounding than any previous Eric Stuart Band album, and is described by Eric Stuart as [...] "Concrete Country." [...] With regard to this, Stuart writes,I was {{trying to come up}} with a way to explain the type of music I play. Americana was too rootsy, Folk-Rock only touched on a part of my sound and County/Rock made it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wore a cowboy hat. I am born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but I play music with a strong lyrical, melodic, story based approach. There are many country elements as well. I thought the combination of [...] "Concrete" [...] to connect with the sidewalks and buildings I grew up around as well as the rock connotations that word brings plus the [...] "Country" [...] would show I was touching on string songwriting and storytelling that went with country music.|$|E

In November 2016, during an interview with Las Vegas Blog, Spears confirmed she had already begun work on her next album, stating: [...] "I’m not sure what I want the next album to <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> ... <b>I</b> just know that I’m excited to get into the studio again and actually have already been back recording." [...] In January 2017, Spears received four wins out of four nominations at the 43rd People's Choice Awards, including Favorite Pop Artist, Female Artist, Social Media celebrity as well as Comedic Collaboration for a skit with Ellen DeGeneres for The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In March 2017, Spears announced that her residency show would be performed abroad as a world tour, Britney: Live in Concert. The tour is scheduled to visit Japan, Israel and the Philippines, with more dates expected to be announced in the future. This will be Spears's first time visiting Japan since her Dream Within a Dream Tour in 2002, and also her 1st time performing in the latter two countries. In April 2017, the Israeli Labor Party announced that it would reschedule its July primary election to avoid conflict with Spears' sold-out Tel Aviv concert, citing traffic and security concerns. She later announced her debut performances in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand.

[...] The performance itself consists of some live music elements combined with pre recorded instruments and sequences generated exclusively at HDC's own Champion Nation Studios. HDC prides itself in incorporating originally recorded material only and uses over 50 instruments when laying foundation for album and live material. They have stated that the intention is to bring people into a trance-like state that resembles a [...] "de-zombification process that will, according to Resurrector, 'create a space for a new sort of psychology that will welcome helpful spirits that will, if you call them, come to assist you'". They have titled some of their live performances Operation Raise The Dead. [...] "It's more about raising the walking dead than raising specifically dead people from their graves," [...] says Resurrector. Described by Festival Preview Magazine, Heavyweight Dub Champion [...] "blend dub, dancehall, hip hop and throbbing electronics together into an intense dancefloor beast." [...] In a recent show with Tricky, 944 magazine described HDC's performance as [...] "a dark, throbbing, harmonic geniusly live mixed set consisting of a wide range of instruments and equipment generating an eclectic electronic <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have never heard.

5000|$|The {{material}} on Diamonds in the Rough strike a musical balance between infectious up-tempo hootenannies and stark, allegorical compositions with recitations that recall Hank Williams' recordings as Luke the Drifter. In {{an interview with}} Paul Zollo for Bluerailroad magazine, Prine stated that [...] "Sour Grapes" [...] and [...] "The Frying Pan" [...] were two of his earliest songwriting efforts, explaining that he [...] "had a girlfriend whose father was a janitor. And the reason I’m telling you that is because he had access to a tape recorder, and nobody else I knew had one. They were really rare. A reel-to-reel. He got it from the language department. It was broken and he fixed it and had it at home. And I sat down and taped three songs for this girl and her sister. And the three songs were 'Frying Pan', 'Sour Grapes', and 'Twist & Shout'...Years later, I ended up marrying that girl. She was my first wife. She found the tape. It was after I had made the first album, so I put two of those songs on Diamonds in the Rough. And those were the first songs I remember writing." [...] Prine also added that he wrote [...] "Souvenirs" [...] in his car, [...] "a 65 Chevelle. Driving to the Fifth Peg. Like the 5th or 6th time playing there. I used to play there just Thursdays after they hired me. They hired me from that open stage {{the very first time}} I sang for the crowd. They invited me back a week later, and I did it again for an open stage...So about the fifth time I was driving down there I thought, God, the same people are gonna be sitting there. I better have a new song. So I wrote 'Souvenirs' in the car on the way down. And then I thought I’d come up with a melody. And I thought I had come up with a pretty sophisticated melody in my head, and I was surprised to find out it had the same three chords that all my other songs have. Really surprised. I thought I had written a jazz melody." [...] Prine often performed [...] "Souvenirs" [...] with his friend and fellow songwriter Steve Goodman, who played on the original recording, and in the same interview the singer confessed, [...] "Yeah, I can still hear him playing it. He played a back melody, so that you could barely hear the difference of who was playing. On tape or when we did it live. And I realized a large part of what he was doing was making it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was playing the good part. And that’s basically the kind of guy he was." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, Fogerty told Pop Chronicles, [...] "Born on the Bayou was vaguely like Porterville, about {{a mythical}} {{childhood}} and a heat-filled time, the Fourth of July. I {{put it in}} the swamp where, of course, I had never lived...Chasing down a hoodoo. Hoodoo is a magical, mystical, spiritual, non-defined apparition, like a ghost or a shadow, not necessarily evil, but certainly other-worldly. I was getting some of that imagery from Howlin Wolf and Muddy Waters." [...] In an interview with Jeb Wright on the Classic Rock Revisited website, Clifford cited [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] as his favorite Creedence song, stating, [...] "The favorite song that we ever did, for me, was Born on the Bayou. Still, when I hear that song I go, That’s me playing on that. It is a weird thing. It was greasy and we were right out of the clubs. That song had so much soul in it." [...] Although not a concept album, Fogerty did acknowledge to Rolling Stone in 1993 that [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] "is almost the Gordian knot or the key to what happened later. As I was writing it, {{it occurred to me that}} there was more power than just this one song. If there was a way to tie it all together on one album, kind of cross-fertilize, cross-relate the songs, you would have a much more interesting and maybe more powerful image. So thats what happened. Born on the Bayou sort of relates to Proud Mary. It certainly relates to Keep on Chooglin and Graveyard Train." [...] Some of the other Creedence members have taken exception to the notion that Fogerty was the sole creative force in the band, with Doug Clifford telling Gary James of classicbands.com, [...] "We all jammed every day when we werent on the road and actually when we were on the road. Wed play acoustically at night. Three to four hours every night we would work the songs out or songs would come out of that song pool. The rest of us didnt get any credit for anything that came out of it. Thats okay. Im not crying over spilled milk, but when you really look at how prolific John was in the 3½ years that we had our success and the major drought hes had as a solo artist, I think it adds a little more credence...to what we contributed to the band." [...] The atmosphere behind the scenes was indeed worsening; in a 2012 article with Uncuts Tom Pinnock, Fogerty recalled, [...] "We went into RCA in Hollywood, Studio A, to record Bayou Country in October. We had the music for “Proud Mary” recorded, and I knew what I wanted the backgrounds to <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> showed the other guys how to sing the backgrounds, having remembered what we’d sounded like on “Porterville”, which was very ragged, not melodious...And I heard our tape back, and I just went, “Nahhh, that’s not gonna work.” So we had a big fight over that...We literally coulda broke up right there." ...|$|E

[...] "It {{was hard to}} listen to, but I mimicked the bands I loved; Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, and The Damned were all English bands.
