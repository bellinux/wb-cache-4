5|$|To {{commemorate the}} 70th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, the Los Angeles Dodgers {{unveiled}} a bronze statue of Robinson at Dodger Stadium. The statue, {{located in the}} stadium's left-field plaza, depicts Robinson <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> home plate as a rookie.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E

5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

25|$|A general {{election}} {{had to be}} held within the next eighteen months and the UK economy was <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> recession, but 1991 was a year of electoral uncertainty as the Conservatives and Labour regularly swapped places {{at the top of}} the opinion polls, and Major resisted Neil Kinnock's numerous calls for an immediate election.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1880s, the Italian economy had been <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> a deep recession. New tariffs had been {{introduced}} in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods and a trade war with France followed, which badly damaged Italian commerce. Many farmers, especially in southern Italy, suffered severely, which {{eventually led to the}} uprising of the Fasci Siciliani. Additionally the collapse of a speculative boom based on a substantial urban rebuilding programme gravely damaged Italian banks.|$|E
25|$|In November 1990 {{following}} a contested leadership election, Margaret Thatcher resigned {{as leader of}} the Conservative Party and was succeeded as leader and Prime Minister by John Major. Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories {{for more than a year}} before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular poll tax, combined with the fact that the economy was <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> recession at the time.|$|E

On April 15, 2017, to mark the 70th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, the Dodgers unveiled a bronze statue of the player in the stadium's left-field plaza.

25|$|According to Mulcahy, “ {{scientists}} and underwater archaeologists {{now believe that}} the earthquake was a powerful one and {{that much of the}} damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.” Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that is loose, sandy, and water-saturated, increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> the water, but it is likely some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} is {{the edge}} of the playing field, or the physical object marking {{the edge of}} the field, such as a rope or fence. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are often used. Since the early 2000s the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded cushions carrying sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is moved during play (such as by a fielder <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{became more}} {{volatile}} in summer 2007 with the accession of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, although polls gave the Conservatives a lead after October {{of that year}} and, by May 2008, with the UK's economy <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> its first recession since 1992, and a week after local council elections, a YouGov poll commissioned by The Sun newspaper was published giving the Conservative Party a 26-point lead over Labour, its largest lead since 1968. The Conservatives gained control of the London mayoralty {{for the first time}} in May 2008 after Boris Johnson defeated the Labour incumbent, Ken Livingstone.|$|E
25|$|France and Germany both entered {{recession}} {{towards the}} end of 2001, but in May 2002 both countries declared that their recessions had ended after a mere six months each. Both economies suffered from global tech crash with the ruling German party introducing the then unpopular austerity, tax cuts and labor reforms nicknamed Hartz concept to boost the German economy in wake of an economic slump that would persist until the mid-2000s with unemployment peaking in Early 2005 of 12.7%. However, some European Union countries – including the United Kingdom – managed to avoid <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> recession during this period.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, an OCHA report {{highlighted}} {{that food}} security {{had continued to}} worsen, with 19 out of 22 governorates now classified 'crisis' or 'emergency'. Half the population was 'food insecure' and nearly a quarter 'severely food insecure. A joint analysis of household food security by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) WFP and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation in Yemen (MoPIC) found that Yemen was <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> catastrophe. More than six million Yemenis were then in a Phase 4 Emergency, and nearly 6.9 million people are in a Phase 3 Crisis: These figures indicate that Yemen was approaching a complete breakdown in food security and health.|$|E
