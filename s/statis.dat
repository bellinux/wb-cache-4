60|$|And {{as to the}} Second, The same Spring may be fed and supplyed by divers Caverns, {{coming from}} very far distant parts of the Sea, so as that it may in one place be high, in another low water; and so by that means the Spring may be equally supply'd at all times. Or else the Cavern may be so {{straight}} and narrow, that the water not having so ready and free passage through it, cannot upon so short and quick mutations of pressure, {{be able to produce}} any sensible effect at such a distance. Besides that, to confirm this hypothesis, there are many Examples found in Natural Historians, of Springs that do ebb and flow like the Sea: As particularly, those recorded by the Learned Camden, and after him by Speed, to be found in this Island: One of which, they relate to be on the Top of a Mountain, by the small Village Kilken in Flintshire, Maris æmulus qui <b>statis</b> temporibus suos evomit & resorbet Aquas; Which at certain times riseth and falleth after the manner of the Sea. A Second in Caermardenshire, near Caermarden, at a place called Cantred Bichan; Qui (ut scribit Giraldus) naturali die bis undis deficiens, & toties exuberans, marinas imitatur instabilitates; That twice in four and twenty hours ebbing and flowing; resembleth the unstable motions of the Sea. The Phænomena of which two may be easily made out, by supposing the Cavern, by which they are fed, to arise {{from the bottom of the}} next Sea. A Third, is a Well upon the River Ogmore in Glamorganshire, and near unto Newton, of which Camden relates himself to be certified, by a Letter from a Learned Friend of his that observed it, Fons abest hinc, &c. The Letter is a little too long to be inserted, but the substance is this; That this Well ebbs and flows quite contrary to the flowing and ebbing of the Sea in those parts: for 'tis almost empty at Full Sea, but full at Low water. This may happen from the Channel by which it is supplied, which may come from the bottom of a Sea very remote from those parts, and where the Tides are much differing from those of the approximate shores. A Fourth, lies in Westmorland, near the River Leder; Qui instar Euripi sæpius in die reciprocantibus undis fluit & refluit, which ebbs and flows many times a day. This may proceed from its being supplyed from many Channels, coming from several parts of the Sea, lying sufficiently distant asunder to have the times of High-water differing enough one from the other; so as that whensoever it shall be High water over any of those places, where these Channels begin, it shall likewise be so in the Well; but this is but a supposition.|$|E

[...] But struggling within this like leaven, falling to it like light, is everything that is free or open, that grows or is willing to change: here is the generosity or openness or willingness that is itself salvation, of the Grace that has replaced the law, of the perfect liberator whom the poet calls Christ.|$|E

5000|$|Tinkerer is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2, voiced by Philip Proctor. He has been supplying Lucia von Bardas and other supervillains with technology. When encountered by the heroes, Tinkerer unleashes some robotic soldiers on them. In the reactor room, Tinkerer attacks the heroes in his Tank-Bot. Tinkerer escapes when his Tank-Bot is destroyed. Tinkerer later pops up in Nick Fury's secret base stating that he might know who is the one responsible for pulling the strings on the supervillains that Iron Man had under control of his control nanites. While Fury and the heroes infiltrated Prison 42, Tinkerer had already left. He is later revealed {{to be the one}} behind the nanite hive mind called The Fold. The heroes later encounter him in a Repeater Tower in Reykjavík, Iceland where he attacks the heroes alongside two Fold soldiers (which is when Tinkerer is invulnerable in his personal forcefield until they are destroyed). He managed to escape {{to the top of the}} Repeater Tower to jam the Nanite <b>Statis</b> Signal. The heroes make it to the top and knock him out. In the game's n-space version of Wii/PS2/PSP, Tinkerer is referenced to be supplying advanced equipment from von Bardas to supervillains, but he is nowhere to be found in Latveria. Eventually, Tinkerer comes to Fury's secret base to explain to the heroes that he did the research behind the nanites, and says the nanites have become unresponsive to all signals, and that he needs a pure sample of uninjected nanites. After retrieving the nanites by infiltrating Ryker's Island while Captain America attacks and enters the Negative Zone, Tinkerer is nowhere to be found. Eventually on the tower in Iceland, Tinkerer is fought. He is defeated by destroying supervillain-shaped toys with powers matching their specific villain which causes his control panel to explode in his face.|$|E
5000|$|Wakfu {{features}} a turn-based combat system similar to Dofus, it also contains elements inspired by tactical RPG. Players {{walk around with}} the screen scrolling while they move, as opposed to Dofus where the camera is static and characters {{move to a new}} area by walking {{to the edge of the}} current screen. Some parts of the game are player-managed: Governmental affairs such as organising militias or elections for positions like governor are performed by players themselves. Another similar addition is environmental management by players. Players can maintain resource levels by planting seeds as they harvest crops and hunt wildlife or simply take what they want, decreasing availability for other players, If players manage to maintain this they will earn various Nation bonuses. Since 2014 a new feature came to the World of twelve, The Riktus Clan. The Riktus Clan nation was meant to be a criminal Nation, getting Nation bonuses by destroying the ecosystems of other nations. There are 18 classes, each one featuring 25 abilities (and 3 abilities which can be obtained by doing a quest). Each class has three types of elemental spells (out of four possible elements) with 5 spells per type, one category of 5 special actions specific to the class, and one category of 5 abilities that passively improve the character's other capabilities, since a short period, new elements were released but only for specific classes, such as <b>Statis</b> or the Light element. Contrary to typical RPGs which present characters with new, more powerful abilities throughout the course of the game, Wakfu grants characters all their spells by the early stages and thereafter allows players to strengthen them. Wakfu features the same classes as Dofus, although many have different appearances or roles. As in Dofus, Wakfu features professions which characters may learn. Harvesting professions let characters [...] "collect resources or basic materials from the fauna and flora". Crafting professions [...] "allow you to transform these basic ingredients into ... equipment, accessories or even potions." [...] The most famous monsters from Dofus, such as Tofus, Moskitos and Gobballs are present in Wakfu, although they have been redesigned with the addition of subclasses. The graphic designers at Ankama Games have also developed new creatures, like Phorreurs and Grave-diggers; Smares (monsters that look like a samara (fruit)) have been included.|$|E

Data arising from such processes may present special characteristics; there is therefore a growing interest in the development of customized multivariate control charts for their monitoring. Here we investigate a recent approach that uses control charts based on the <b>Statis</b> method. <b>Statis</b> is an exploratory technique for measuring similarities between data matrices. However, the technique only assesses similarities in a linear context, i. e. investigating structures of linear correlation in the data. In this paper we propose control charts based on the <b>Statis</b> method in conjunction with a kernel for monitoring processes in the presence of nonlinearities. Through kernels we define nonlinear functions of data giving better representation of the structure to be characterized by the <b>Statis</b> method. The new approach is illustrated using simulated data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{data sets}} are often multidimensional and {{consequently}} display complex structure. This article shows {{the limitations of}} principal component analysis (PCA) {{for the study of}} such three-dimensional (3 D) data sets. These limitations can be resolved by the use of the statistical tool <b>STATIS.</b> The inlet (a swallow hole) and the outlet (a spring) of a karst system of the Western Paris basin were sampled during three rain events of various intensities. These 3 D geochemical data sets (variables 3 sites 3 dates) for a karst system were analyzed by <b>STATIS</b> method to identify hydrological processes. <b>STATIS</b> proceeds in three steps (interstructure, compromise, and intrastructure), which allows us to focus the analysis of hydrologic systems at different temporal and spatial scales. Compromise plane shows that suspended matter and flood are not simultaneous and highlights a rapid flow, characterized by turbidity and phosphate, which represents a point source contamination, and a ground water flow contaminated by nitrate. Intrastructure plane allows us to compare hydrochemical variations between the swallow hole and the spring lead. By this way, hydrological processes such as direct transfer and resuspension of intrakarstic sediments before and after the flood were identified what cannot be realized by comparison of inlet and outlet breakthrough curves. Finally, results obtained from the same data set by <b>STATIS</b> and a coupled study using PCA and normalized hysteresis curves were compared. This comparison shows the efficiency of <b>STATIS</b> at the identification of transport processes and vulnerability of karst system and its potential for hydrological applications...|$|E
