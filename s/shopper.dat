5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield <b>Shopper</b> reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} {{strands of}} research have investigated <b>shopper</b> behaviour. One strand is {{primarily concerned with}} <b>shopper</b> motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into <b>shopper</b> behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} <b>shopper</b> profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation {{analyses for}} each unique outlet. However, {{it is possible}} to identify a number of broad <b>shopper</b> profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited <b>shopper</b> typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s. Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology {{has been shown to be}} relatively consistent across time and across cultures. Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions.|$|E

25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into <b>shopper</b> motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the <b>shopper</b> with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The <b>shopper</b> with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.|$|E

Notable features included price comparison, store policy information, cross-border shipping, duties and fees estimation, price history charts, reviews and color search ability. As of October 2012 the Comparison <b>Shopper</b> service is no longer available.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{business}} introduced a 'Mystery Shopper' programme to score its branches {{on the service}} they provide. The mystery <b>shopper</b> grades the branch on its presentation and on the service the branch provides at its service counters, checkouts, wine department and shop floor. In more recent times however, the unpopular mystery <b>shopper</b> programme is being phased out in favour of a customer feedback system called 'Measuring the Magic'. Customers are given a card which directs them to the Waitrose Experience website. In return for grading various areas of their shopping experience, customers are entered into a monthly Â£500 prize draw. The new system hopes to give feedback tailored to each instance of customer-partner contact, instead of being based on strict criteria.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the <b>shopper</b> requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the <b>shopper.</b> Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the <b>shopper</b> and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

40|$|Although {{interest}} in smart shopping carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups {{have concerns about}} how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained ("budget" <b>shoppers)</b> or not ("nonbudget" <b>shoppers).</b> Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget <b>shoppers</b> to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget <b>shoppers</b> to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget <b>shoppers</b> while keeping them stable for nonbudget <b>shoppers.</b> These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget <b>shoppers.</b> Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers...|$|R

30|$|As it is {{possible}} to observe in Fig.Â  10, there is not always a growth of the number of iterations when the configuration increases the number of offerings and <b>shoppers.</b> This is due to the specific distribution of <b>shoppers</b> against offerings. In fact, if you observe configurations n. 3 and n. 4 you can note that the first one terminates in 42 iterations and the second one terminates in 18 iterations {{despite the fact that the}} first one includes a lesser number of offerings and a lesser number of <b>shoppers.</b> Such different performances are due to the new (shorter) distances, among offerings and <b>shoppers,</b> introduced in the configuration n. 4. Thus, new <b>shoppers</b> (those introduced in configuration n. 4) gather first some offerings that, in configuration n. 3, require a greater number of iterations because are more distant from the active <b>shoppers.</b>|$|R

25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of these coins, cash transactions were normally rounded to the nearest 5 cents, {{a process known as}} Swedish rounding. Some larger retailers (notably one supermarket chain), in the interests of public relations, elected to round the total price down (so that $4.99 became $4.95 instead of $5.00). Alternatively, many retailers rounded all their prices to the nearest 5 cents to avoid the issue entirelyâso a New Zealand <b>shopper</b> often encountered products for sale at prices like $4.95.|$|E

Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed. Fading daylight through glass panels was supplemented by gradually increased electric lighting, making it seem like the afternoon was lasting longer, which encouraged shoppers to linger.|$|E

40|$|Research {{testifies to}} the {{influence}} of environmental factors in shopping environments. However, few studies examine effects of store design in interaction with shoppers' motivations. The authors propose that task-oriented <b>shoppers</b> prefer stores that are spacious, whereas recreational <b>shoppers</b> enjoy and prefer the arousing properties of color. To provide controlled tests of these hypotheses, we created visual simulations of stores that varied by color (arousing red vs. less arousing blue) and layout (spacious vs. cluttered), and induced either task-oriented or recreational shopping motivations. Customers at a clothing store responded to one of these four store video displays. Results showed that motivations interact with environmental factors. Task-oriented <b>shoppers</b> preferred shopping in spacious stores, whereas recreational <b>shoppers</b> preferred high-arousing store environments. These findings suggest that store managers could increase arousal levels using ambient design elements, such as colored lights, when <b>shoppers</b> are likely recreationally oriented and provide spacious environments to appeal to task-oriented <b>shoppers...</b>|$|R
