Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A <b>side</b> <b>barrier</b> rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the <b>side</b> <b>barrier</b> rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|R

50|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1971 for the Gosport Ferry service by James and Stone of Brightlingsea, {{primarily}} for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent. Originally called Gay Enterprise, the name was changed {{in the winter of}} 1979, during her standby ferry duties, to Solent Enterprise. It had a similar design to the company's two 1966 Queens (Portsmouth Queen and Gosport Queen) but the interior was more comfortable because of its different duty. It was painted in later years in a blue livery with a large Solent Enterprise banner on its <b>side</b> <b>barriers.</b> In its later years of service, it was regularly used on ferry duties between Gosport and Portsmouth when either of the Queens were out of service. In 2001, Gosport Ferry Company purchased a new ferry, the Spirit of Gosport, but the company also wanted to replace the Solent Enterprise in its cruising role. Both Queens therefore stayed on, and the Spirit of Gosport only had a few ferry duties in its first few months. In 2005, another new vessel was purchased, Spirit of Portsmouth. This was fitted out with a covered top deck and a bar and to suit its cruise duties. This meant that Solent Enterprise was no longer required by the Gosport Ferry service and she was sold to Capital Pleasure Boats in 2005. Her new owners renamed her Sundance and she operated on the River Thames in London as a charter vessel catering for parties, corporate entertainment, weddings and other functions. She is now in Copenhagen being used as a floating cafe. In {{the early hours of the}} morning of the 11th February 2016, a fire broke out on board, which completely engulfed the top deck and left her badly damaged.|$|E

The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in the LMP1 category because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's front wheels. G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with a two-minute stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the grass at Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second full course caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 class leader Tor Gravesin the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex for a long period before rejoining the event.Graves, who fell to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, causing him to retire.

40|$|Background: Despite {{increase}} in accessibility and utilization of maternal health {{services in the}} state of Telangana, penetration of these services in vulnerable communities is inadequate. Aims & Objectives: To understand the determinants of utilization of reproductive health services by migrant population living in non-notified slums of Hyderabad city in the Indian state of Telangana. Material & Methods: It is a community based cross sectional study of 761 rural to urban internal migrant mothers with a child of less than 2 years of age residing for a period minimum of 30 days and not more than 10 years. Information was collected for socio demographic details, antenatal care and child delivery. Results: Mothers receiving at least 4 antenatal care visits and institutional deliveries in migrants was 69. 6 % and 69 % respectively, compared to 85. 8 % and 97 % in general population of Hyderabad city. The likelihood of mothers receiving adequate care is 6. 7 times higher in mothers with secondary education compared to formal education. The likelihood of institutional delivery is 7. 8 times higher in mothers availing adequate antenatal care versus inadequate care and 2. 2 times higher in mothers with secondary education versus formal education. Conclusion: Utilization of antenatal care services and promotion of institutional deliveries can be improved by acting on the supply <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> such as health care infrastructure and demand <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> such as indirect consumer costs, financial constraints and community engagemen...|$|E

40|$|Maternal health can {{be defined}} as the health of women during pregnancy, {{childbirth}} and the postpartum period. Of all the maternal deaths in the world, 99 % occurs in developing countries. The highest maternal mortality ratios can be witnessed in India where approximately 20 % of all maternal deaths take place. The majority of these deaths occur due to preventable causes. Unfortunately, many women are excluded from the health care system that is present in their country. This problem is strongly prevalent amongst Indian women from low socioeconomic groups, resulting in low or incomplete uptake of maternal health care. The barriers that woman come across when wanting to access and utilize health care can be categorized under five dimensions namely, Availability, Accessibility, Affordability, Adequacy and Acceptability. These dimensions consist out of barriers that can be described as supply <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> and demand <b>side</b> <b>barriers.</b> This baseline study aims to provide an insight to the accessibility and utilization of maternal health care in a North-Indian city. The main goal of this thesis is the present and discuss the degree in which maternal health care is utilized in medical facilities, the barriers that women come across when accessing this type of care and how women’s experiences with accessing and utilizing maternal health care can influence their expected future behavior. In order to get a better understanding of these topics, research has been conducted in Lucknow, the capital city of the Northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh.

40|$|Low-income {{countries}} are plagued {{by a high}} burden of preventable and curable disease as well as unmet need for healthcare, but detailed microeconomic evidence {{on the relationship between}} supply-side factors and service use is limited. Causality has rarely been assessed due to the challenges posed by the endogeneity of health service supply. In this study, using data from Mozambique, we investigate the effect of healthcare service availability, measured as the type of health facilities and their level of staffing and equipment, on the individual decision to seek care. We apply an instrumental variable approach to test for causality in the effect of staff and equipment availability on the decision to seek care and we explore heterogeneous effects based on the distance of households to the closest health facility. We find that living in the proximity of a health facility increases the probability of seeking care. A greater availability of referral health services in the locality has no significant effect on decision to seek care, while greater availability of staff and equipment increases the probability of seeking care when ill. Demand <b>side</b> <b>barriers</b> to health care use exist, but have a smaller impact when health care services are available within one hour walking distance...|$|E
