500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> we should make it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E
500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Eileen {{said that}} her agency {{received}} 10,000 letters per year and 7,000 personal visits to her office. Of these, she <b>said,</b> <b>maybe</b> only four or five are [...] "really good ones [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the band was named Force and came together in 1979, in Upplands Väsby, Stockholm, and was integrated by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. [...] "I remember when we started the band Force we were playing covers in the rehearsal room, because {{we just wanted to}} learn our instruments, like all bands," [...] Tempest said, [...] "Then one day I <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> we should do our own stuff. Nobody had any ideas, so I brought mine into the rehearsal room, and that is when we started writing our own stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, The Ike and Tina Turner Revue {{traveled}} by plane to Dallas {{where they were}} to perform at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While on the airplane, the two became embroiled in an altercation, {{which led to a}} physical fight in their limousine. The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine use. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing Ike to slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two [...] "went around like prizefighters for awhile". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa. Once Ike had fallen asleep, Tina grabbed a few toiletries, covered herself and escaped {{from the back of the}} hotel, running across an active freeway before stopping at a local Ramada Inn hotel. She claimed that she later hid at several friends' homes for a time. [...] Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas. He reveals that three weeks after they split, they met for a meal at Ship's Restaurant in Los Angeles. Ike says Tina <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> they'd get back together after eight or nine years. On July 27, 1976, Tina Turner filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.|$|E

60|$|He almost {{decided to}} draw upon Dryfoos for some money; {{he did not need}} any, but, he <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> the demand would act as a hint upon him. One day, about a week after Alma's final {{rejection}} of Beaton, Dryfoos came into March's office. Fulkerson was out, but the old man seemed not to have tried to see him.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} him the most {{wonderful}} thing that anybody had ever <b>said.</b> <b>Maybe</b> he shed a tear or two, thinking of all the good he was doing, and later on went suddenly to sleep. In the morning he had forgotten all about it, and by accident it got mixed up {{with the rest of}} the book. That is the only explanation that seems to me possible, and it comforts me.|$|E

60|$|Bewilderment gave {{place to}} indignation. Now and again Joey would creep, a mental {{shadow of his}} former self, into the Club where once every member would have risen with a smile to greet him. They gave him curt answers and turned away from him. Peter Hope one {{afternoon}} found him there alone, standing {{with his hands in}} his pockets looking out of window. Peter was fifty, so he <b>said,</b> <b>maybe</b> a little older; men of forty were to him mere boys. So Peter, who hated mysteries, stepped forward with a determined air and clapped Joey on the shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{afternoon}} {{he took out}} a piece of bread-and-butter with meat between and hid it in the hay, and Jim Leonard brought some eggs. He said he had no chance to boil them without his mother seeing, but he asked Pony if he did not know that raw eggs were first-rate, and when Pony said no, he said, [...] "Well, they are." [...] They broke one of the eggs when they were hiding them, and it ran over the bread-and-butter, but they wiped it off with hay as well as they could, and Jim Leonard <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> it would help to keep it, anyway.|$|E
60|$|Besides his marksmanship the Kid {{had another}} {{attribute}} {{for which he}} admired himself greatly. He was /muy caballero/, as the Mexicans express it, where the ladies were concerned. For them he had always gentle words and consideration. He could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman. He might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers, {{but he could not}} have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman. Wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about Mr. Kid. One shouldn't believe everything one heard, they said. When confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the /caballero's/ deeds of infamy, they <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> he had been driven to it, and that he knew how to treat a lady, anyhow.|$|E

50|$|In {{the week}} after his {{resignation}} from office, he was interviewed about {{the increased use of}} heavy firearms by criminals.

In reality he had quietly disbanded the task force on heavy weapons two months earlier.|$|R
60|$|We went {{drifting}} {{down into}} a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it {{when we got to}} it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I <b>said</b> <b>maybe</b> we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim {{thought it was a good}} idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.|$|E

50|$|He was, of course, {{no longer}} the fabled Willie Mays, the {{greatest}} player since Joe DiMaggio, and some <b>said,</b> <b>maybe</b> the greatest ever, which gave him value as a drawing card. He was 41 years old, slowed down considerably {{in the field and}} at the plate, no longer possessing that cannon of an arm. He was, in truth, something of a liability now in center and it was more prudent to play him at first base.|$|E

5000|$|Owens {{was devastated}} by Rich's death {{and did not}} discuss it in {{interviews}} for years. In a late 1990s interview, Owens said, [...] "He was like a brother, a son, and a best friend.

Oh yeah, I carried on and I existed, but the real joy and love, the real lightning and thunder is gone forever." ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard was autistic, {{the sisters}} explained. Or, they added, {{he had a}} mixture of {{problems}} that might be indefinable. He {{grew up in the}} 1950s, before anyone knew much about such disorders. They hadn’t even heard about autism until Richard was in his 20s. He was intellectually normal, Janis <b>said,</b> <b>maybe</b> even above average, but emotionally he functioned like a 10-year-old. He was much better at communicating through writing than through conversation. He liked numbers and making up words. He was, she said simply, odd. Sarah Aswell ...|$|E
