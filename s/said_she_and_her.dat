25|$|There {{were some}} {{questions}} about whether Sky had even been in the car that morning to begin with. Motorists who had passed the parked Acura did not report seeing anything unusual, not even a child in it. At Biryukova's apartment complex in Redmond, neighbors <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> children rarely went out, {{and none of them}} had seen Sky for at least two weeks. Solomon was not aware of anyone having seen his son other than his ex-wife since an April doctor visit. However, Maile told the police that Sky had indeed been in the car that morning.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband believe [...] "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

2500|$|Family {{members of}} both Betty Binnicker and Mary Thames {{expressed}} disappointment at the ruling. They said that, although they acknowledge his execution {{at the age of}} 14 is controversial, they never doubted his guilt. The niece of Betty Binnicker has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> family have extensively researched the case, and argues that [...] "people who [...] read these articles in the newspaper don't know the truth." [...] Binnicker's niece said that, in the early 1990s, a police officer who had arrested Stinney had contacted her and said: [...] "Don't you ever believe that boy didn't kill your aunt." [...] These family members said that the claims of a deathbed confession from an individual confessing to the girls' murders have never been substantiated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evening of}} Saturday, May 25, 1991, during the Memorial Day weekend, Michelle Lodzinski <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> son visited the South Amboy Elks Club {{carnival}} in Sayreville's Kennedy Park. Lodzinski {{told police that}} her son went missing when she left him waiting in a carnival ride line as she went to buy a soda. Police officers, firefighters, volunteers, and trained dogs immediately launched an exhaustive search of the carnival grounds and the surrounding area, to no avail. Timmy's father, George Wiltsey, was at home in Iowa, uninvolved in the boy's life, and eliminated as a suspect. The case was televised twice on America's Most Wanted, and Timmy's photograph was circulated on thousands of missing-child flyers and milk cartons. In a [...] "bitter irony", May 25 was National Missing Children's Day, an annual observance inspired by a previous high-profile disappearance.|$|E
