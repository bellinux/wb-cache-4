Hollingworth Lake lies beyond Milnrow, by Littleborough and {{is part of a}} local country park. It was built in 1801 as a feeder reservoir for the Rochdale Canal, but it soon became a tourist destination for local people during their leisure time. The lake covers an area of 130 acre and the path around it originally measured 2.5 mi.|$|E
50|$|Historically, boilers were {{a source}} of many serious {{injuries}} and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles. Thin and brittle metal shells can rupture, while poorly welded or riveted seams could open up, leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam. When water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over 100 kilometres per hour. Because of this, steam {{is a great way}} of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed, but without the right boiler feed water treatment, a <b>steam-raising</b> <b>plant</b> will suffer from scale formation and corrosion. At best, this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam, reduced efficiency, shorter plant life and unreliable operation. At worst, it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute, injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber. Extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problems in {{pulverized}} fuel combustion in <b>steam-raising</b> <b>plant</b> {{that can be}} attributed to the nature of the coal being fired include excessive slagging and fouling, poor char burnout, NOx emissions and flame stability. Coal performance in these areas can, to some extent, be related to the results from existing coal characterization tests but, particularly for coals from unfamiliar areas, these correlations may be unreliable and misleading. For example, attempts to relate slagging propensity to the chemical composition of the coal ash have met with only limited success. It now seems clear that empirical indices and viscosity measurements do not reflect the complex mineral interactions that occur during combustion. However, new microanalysis techniques, capable of characterizing the distribution of mineral matter in a {{pulverized fuel}} (PF), now appear likely to provide an improved assessment of the slagging propensity of a coal. Other factors, such as coal volatile yield and nitrogen release, are quite sensitive to the heating conditions. Laboratory tests which match PF combustion conditions much more closely than existing standard methods are now being developed. New approaches to predicting char burnout, by better identification of the small subset of the coal which is actually causing the problem, are also under investigation. While not a general panacea, the appropriate use of new tests is likely to offer engineers involved in coal procurement, who face an increasingly complex market, improved methods for evaluating coals before embarking on expensive pilot- or full-scale trials...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presented}} here comprises the work undertaken for research into novel NDE techniques {{in the power}} generation industry. This has been undertaken {{as part of the}} Engineering Doctorate Scheme run by the Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE), which aims to bridge the technological gap between university research and industrial application. In this case, the scheme consisted of two projects completed in conjunction with RWE npower looking at current NDE problems in steam turbine and <b>steam-raising</b> <b>plant.</b> The first project was concerned with detecting microstructural transformation in steam turbine blades, which can act as a precursor to failure by environmentally assisted cracking. This project, and indeed, this entire thesis is principally based on electromagnetic testing methods. An eddy current technique for mapping the microstructural phases was produced and validated as far as was achievable; this offered a significant time-saving advantage over the previous method, by reducing inspection time from 5 man days to just 1. 5. The technique has novelty in producing a 2 -dimensional map of the blade surface which highlights areas where microstructural phases differ. The second project focuses on the detection of microstructural damage associated with material creep life expiry. This forms a review of the current state of technology and highlights potentially useful paths for future research in both established and emerging NDE technologies, including Magnetic Barkhausen Noise testing and laser-generated ultrasound. Both projects have provided tangible benefit to the sponsoring company and have pushed forward research in a number of technological applications.
