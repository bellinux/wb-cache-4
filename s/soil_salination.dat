5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and <b>soil</b> <b>salination.</b> Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E

50|$|The aim of soil {{salinity}} control {{is to prevent}} <b>soil</b> degradation by <b>salination</b> and reclaim already salty (saline) soils. Soil reclamation is also called soil improvement, rehabilitation, remediation, recuperation, or amelioration.|$|R
50|$|Soil {{salinity}} is {{the salt}} {{content in the}} soil; the process of increasing the salt content is known as salinization. Salts occur naturally within <b>soils</b> and water. <b>Salination</b> {{can be caused by}} natural processes such as mineral weathering or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as irrigation.|$|R
25|$|According to the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme), {{two small}} {{uninhabited}} Kiribati islets, Tebua Tarawa and Abanuea, disappeared underwater in 1999. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50cm (20in) by 2100 {{due to global}} warming and a further rise would be inevitable. It is thus likely that within a century the nation's arable land will become subject to increased <b>soil</b> <b>salination</b> and will be largely submerged.|$|E
25|$|Salinity {{occurs on}} {{drylands}} from overirrigation and {{in areas with}} shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow saline water table capillary action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to <b>soil</b> <b>salination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the young}} {{geological}} age of the islands and atolls and high level of <b>soil</b> <b>salination</b> the flora of Kiribati is relatively poor. It contains about 83 indigenous and 306 introduced plants on Gilbert Islands, whereas the corresponding numbers for Line and Phoenix Islands are 67 and 283. None of these species are endemic, and {{about half of the}} indigenous ones have a limited distribution and became endangered or nearly extinct due to human activities such as phosphate mining. Coconut and pandanus palms and breadfruit trees are most common wild plants, whereas the five most cultivated crops are Chinese cabbage, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon and cucumber. Over eighty percent of the population participates in either farming or fishing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of coastal plains {{affected}} by <b>soil</b> and water <b>salination,</b> a knowledge of several geological aspects, such as structural features, depth to basement, stratigraphy of sedimentary cover, relationships between the phreatic aquifer and underlying aquifers, and the latter's structure, is basic to gaining an adequate understanding of both the causes and possible evolution of salination. In this framework, geophysical techniques can play a very important role. To improve the available geophysical information about the Muravera coastal plain, Sardinia, Italy, which is affected by severe <b>soil</b> and water <b>salination,</b> previously acquired electrical resistivity, reflection seismic and gravity data have been reprocessed, and a new seismic reflection survey has been conducted. Moreover, {{in order to give}} better support to the geological and hydrogeological interpretation of geophysical data, three boreholes were drilled. Reprocessed electrical data indicate the presence of a wide, electrically homogeneous low-resistivity zone associated with salination phenomena. Reprocessed reflection data provide useful information on the near-surface stratigraphy. The combined interpretation of resistivity and seismic results, supported by one calibration borehole, elucidates the relationships between the phreatic aquifer and the underlying confined aquifer. A new seismic reflection survey gives information on the depth to, and structure of, the Paleozoic basement, as well as on stratigraphic conditions of Pleistocene-Holocene sediments. Finally, the combined interpretation of seismic, gravity, and well data results in a geological section containing most of the information considered essential, such as the interface between Holocene alluvium and Pleistocene alluvium, the thickness of the latter, and the structure and composition of the Paleozoic basement. The work as a whole shows how the combined application of geophysical techniques can in this specific situation provide wide-ranging and high-quality information that is essential for the realistic mathematical modeling of aquifer contamination, and can enable the rational planning of exploratory drilling...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{aquifers}} and soil salinity is {{addressed in the}} coastal area of Muravera (SE Sardinia, Italy) with the combined use of electrical resistivity and induced polarization measurements along three lines, and with 41 Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) soundings distributed in the study area. The resistivity and chargeability sections provide a detailed information on the hydrogeological conditions in the first 20 - 60 m depth, clarifying the role of both clay and salt water and eventually confirming the local near-surface hydrogeological model. The resistivity maps obtained for different depth ranges by TEM data inversion, give a clear and effective representation of the saline contamination both laterally and down {{to a depth of}} about 70 m, over the whole investigated area.

40|$|Psychology and {{the natural}} {{environment}} This statement addresses the ongoing commitment of Australian psychologists to achieve a more adequate and useful understanding of the reciprocal impacts of people {{and the natural}} environment, and strongly advocates for a more substantive involvement by psychologists in addressing current and envisioned threats to the sustainability of the natural environment and its ecosystems, in Australia, and globally. Environmental degradation is in large part caused by human behaviours and directly affects human health and well being. Because of this psychologists have an integral and indispensable {{role to play in}} analysing and addressing linkages between people and environmental problems and finding achievable and effective solutions (e. g., Oskamp, 2000 a,b; Stern, 2000 a,b; Winter, 2000). Australia is faced with many environmental conservation, restoration, and management issues.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} has caught {{the imagination and}} action {{of the world for}} more than a decade. Sustainable agriculture is necessary to attain the goal of sustainable development. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sustainable agriculture is the successful management of resources to satisfy the changing human needs while maintaining or enhancing the quality of environment and conserving natural resources. All definitions of sustainable agriculture lay great emphasis on maintaining an agricultural growth rate, which can meet the demand for food of all living beings without draining the basic resources towards crop improvement. Organic farming is one of the several approaches found to meet the objectives of sustainable agriculture. Most of the techniques used in organic farming like inter-cropping, mulching and integration of crops and livestock are not alien to agriculture systems including the traditional agricultural practices. However, organic farming is based on various laws and certification programmes, which prohibit the use of almost all synthetic inputs and the central theme of this method is the health of soil. The adverse effects of modern agricultural practices on the farm and also on the health of living beings and thus on the environment has been well documented all over the world. Application of technology, particularly the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides all around us has persuaded people to think aloud. As a result of global climatic changes, their negative effects on the environment are manifested through soil erosion, water shortages, <b>salination,</b> <b>soil</b> contamination, genetic erosion, Organic farming is one of the widely used methods, which is thought as the best alternative to avoid the ill effects of chemical farming. It also has far more advantages over the conventional and other modern agricultural practices that are available today...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Water {{shortage}} in arid and semiarid {{regions of}} the world is a cause of serious concerns. The severe water scarcity urges the reuse of treated wastewater effluent and marginal water as a resource for irrigation. Mobarake Steel Complex has been using treated industrial wastewater for drip-irrigation of trees in about 1350 ha of its green space. However, wastewater may contain some amounts of toxic heavy metals, which create problems. Excessive accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils through wastewater irrigation may not only result in soil contamination, but also affect food quality and safety. Improper irrigation management, however, can lead to the loss of soil quality through such processes as contamination and <b>salination.</b> <b>Soil</b> quality implies its capacity to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and enhance plants, human and animal health. Soil quality assessment is a tool that helps managers to evaluate short-term soil problems and appropriate management strategies for maintaining soil quality in the long time. Mobarakeh Steel Complex has been using treated wastewater for irrigation of green space to combat water shortage and prevent environmental pollution. This study was performed {{to assess the impact of}} short- middle, and long-term wastewater irrigation on soil heavy metal concentration in green space of Mobarake Steel complex. Materials and Methods: The impacts of wastewater irrigation on bioavailable and total heavy metal concentrations in the soils irrigated with treated wastewater for 2, 6 and 18 years as compared to those in soils irrigated with groundwater and un-irrigated soils. Soils were sampled from the wet bulb produced by under-tree sprinklers in three depths (0 - 20, 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 cm). Soil samples were air-dried, and crushed to pass through a 2 -mm sieve. Plant-available metal concentrations were extracted from the soil with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-CaCl 2 -triethanolamine (DTPA-TEA). To determine the total concentration of heavy metals, the soil samples were digested in 6 M HNO 3. Concentrations of heavy metals in the extracts were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Finally, available metal micronutrient levels in the soil were compared with the critical deficiency ranges suggested for calcareous soils. Also, total concentrations of the metals in the soils were compared with the standards of the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency to assess possible contamination of soils with heavy metals in the studied area. Results and discussion: The results of this study showed significant increases of plant-available Fe in the soils irrigated with wastewater for 6 and 18 years as compared to the unplanted control. Regardless of the type of irrigation water used, available Mn and Ni were significantly increased in all forested areas as compared to the unplanted soils. Available Zn fraction was significantly higher in the soils with history of 6 and 18 years of wastewater irrigation. Increase in available Cu concentration was statistically significant only in the soils irrigated with wastewater for 18 years. As the metal concentration in the wastewater used for irrigation was very low, it seems that the major source of metal accumulation in the soils is particulate fallout or emissions directly from the dump sites and metal plating operation. Furthermore, irrigation and forestation practices might have improved bioavailability of micronutrient metals in the soils of green space of Mobarakeh Steel complex through increasing organic matter content of the soils which enhances metal chelation reactions. Total concentrations of the metals in the forested soils also increased as compared to those of the control. Total Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations were notably higher in all soils of the green space area as compared to those in the unplanted control sites. Wind-driven particle transport from dumping site to nearby soils may be the main reason for metal build-up in the green space soils. Total concentration of Cu showed no significant difference among the soils of the treatments and the control. Although metal accumulation has been occurring in the soils of the Mobarakeh Steel complex green space, total concentrations in the soils were still considerably lower than the allowable levels recommended by the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that metal accumulation has been occurring in the green space soils of the Mobarakeh Steel complex. Considering the short distance of the dumping and metal smelting sites with the green space and very low concentrations of metals in wastewater, in may be concluded that fall out of metallic particles on the soil surfaces from the dumping and smelting sites is the main route for metals accumulation in the soils of the green space areas...|$|R
