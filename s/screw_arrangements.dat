40|$|The {{advantages}} of using cold-formed steel are high strength-to-weight ratio, flexibility in fabricating different cross-section shapes, easy for construction and so on. Cold-formed steel sheets are usually manufactured into open sectional profiles by cold-rolling and brake-pressing methods. Doubly symmetric built-up sections, with {{the advantage of}} having larger torsional rigidity compared to traditional singly symmetric open sections, have great potential to extend the application of cold-formed steel to structural members with larger scale. The doubly symmetric built-up open and closed sections {{can be made by}} connecting two channel sections using self-tapping screws, which are also convenient for industrialized production. In this study, the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up section beams with intermediate stiffeners and built-up section beams with web perforations was examined through experimental and numerical investigations. The impact of different <b>screw</b> <b>arrangements</b> on the moment capacities of built-up section beams was also studied. A total of 113 beam tests that include simply supported beam tests of 16 pairs of channel sections with stiffened webs, 19 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 43 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 35 built-up sections with different <b>screw</b> <b>arrangements</b> was conducted. The material properties of the test specimens were also obtained by tensile coupon tests. The main objective of the experimental investigation is to obtain the section moment capacities and understand the structural behaviour of the built-up sections under bending. Finite element (FE) models of the beam specimens were also developed and numerical analysis that includes material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity (for built-up section beams only) was performed and the results were verified against the test results. The validated FE models were employed for extensive parametric studies of 382 numerical simulations that include 101 channel sections with stiffened webs, 113 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 80 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 88 built-up sections having different <b>screw</b> <b>arrangements.</b> A wide range of section slenderness was considered in the built-up sections and different failure modes of beams were investigated. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the influence of stiffener features, different sizes of web holes, and various <b>screw</b> <b>arrangements</b> on the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up section beams was carried out. The results obtained from the experimental and numerical studies were employed for evaluating the design rules of cold-formed steel built-up section beams. It should be mentioned that the existing direct strength method (DSM) for cold-formed steel members does not cover the design of built-up section beams. Hence, suitable design rules based on DSM have been proposed for cold-formed steel built-up section beams with intermediate stiffeners and built-up section beams with web perforations under bending. The design equations for considering the screw spacings of built-up closed section beams have also proposed. Furthermore, the suitability of the modified design rules, as well as the existing DSM for cold-formed steel built-up section beams was also evaluated through a reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

30|$|Two major nailing approaches, i.e., face nailing and toe nailing, using {{self-tapping}} screws {{to assemble the}} glulam beam–girder connections were compared. The toe-nailing approach had two <b>screw</b> <b>arrangements</b> (TU and TB) on the connection during the assembly. The maximum load capacities of the connections fastened using TU and TB toe-nailing approaches were 41.3 and 98.8  %, respectively, higher than those the using face-nailing approach. In {{the case of the}} face-nailing approach, {{self-tapping screws}} sustained a shearing force, and wood members resisted with both the compressive force and tensile force perpendicular to the grain at the interface of connections. Consequently, the shear force caused the dowel-type fastener to bend. Moreover, both the compressive force and tensile force perpendicular to the grain are weak strength properties of wood, which cause a split or cleavage failure on the glulam member [16, 17]. In the case of the toe-nailing approach, self-tapping screws strained axially in tension, and the withdrawal strength might contribute to the load-bearing capacity of a connection. Further, the withdrawal strength can be the same when the penetration angles between the screw axis and wood grain range from 30 ° to 90 °, as suggested by Hübner et al. [2]. They proposed a bilinear model which is constant withdrawal strength between 30 ° and 90 ° and then decreases from 30 ° to 0 ° to 70  % of 5  %-percentile at 30 °. This might explain the higher loading capacity achieved for connections fastened using the toe-nailing approach.|$|E

50|$|The {{train was}} screw-coupled; each {{carriage}} was first coupled by a loose chain and hook coupling to the next; the slack on this was then {{taken up by}} a turnbuckle <b>screw</b> <b>arrangement,</b> until the buffers of the two carriages were touching.

To assist uncoupling the front van guard therefore scotched one of {{the wheels of the}} sixth vehicle, that is, the front vehicle of the rear portion being detached. Loosening the turnbuckle thus transferred the weight of the rear portion to the scotch on the sixth vehicle, rather than to the rear van brakes.

Appropriate application of the plate is the difficult task that a doctor needs to deal with in the operating room.

The aim was mainly to understand the joint structural response under cyclic loads, simulating the effects of seismic action. The test results indicate that the joint can initially develop a high dissipative capacity, but after a few cycles, the energy dissipation is considerably reduced by the occurrence of longitudinal splitting in the timber edge of the joining bars leading to lateral instability of the rods...|$|R

Complementary arrays of surface structures, such as 1 D ridges or fibrils arranged in a 2 D lattice, can inter-digitate to achieve adhesion enhancement controlled by shape recognition. It has been shown that relative misorientation is accommodated by defects that are meso-scale <b>screw</b> dislocations. The <b>arrangement</b> of such dislocations plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties of the interface. Here we study the geometric properties of one-dimensional (ridge/channel) and two-dimensional (arrays of pillars) shape-complementary interfaces in the presence of relative misorientation (twist) and difference in lattice spacing. Relative misorientation without difference in lattice spacing is accommodated by arrays of screw dislocations. Difference in lattice spacing without misorientation is accommodated by arrays of edge dislocations. In general, we observe arrays of dislocations with mixed screw and edge character. The spacing and orientation of these arrays can be predicted accurately using the geometry of Moiré patterns. More broadly, we show that soft materials with shape-complementary patterns {{can be used to}} generate meso-scale dislocations of arbitrary edge and screw character at the length scale of tens of microns.
