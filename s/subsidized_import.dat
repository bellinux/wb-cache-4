40|$|In poor countries, most governments {{implement}} policies {{aiming to}} stabilize the prices of staple foods, which often include storage and trade measures insulating their domestic market from the world market. It is of crucial importance to understand the precise motivations and efficiency of those interventions, because they can have consequences worldwide. This paper addresses those issues by analyzing {{the case of a}} small, open developing country confronted by shocks to both the crop yield and foreign price. In this model, government interventions may be justified by the lack of an insurance market for food prices. Considering this market imperfection, the authors design optimal public interventions through trade and storage policies. They show that an optimal trade policy largely consists of <b>subsidizing</b> <b>imports</b> and taxing exports, which benefits consumers at the expense of producers. Import subsidies alleviate the non-negativity of food storage. In other words, when stocks are exhausted, <b>subsidizing</b> <b>imports</b> prevents domestic price spikes. One striking result: an optimal storage policy on its own is detrimental to consumers, since its stabilizing benefits leak into the world market and it raises the average domestic price. By contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilizing effect for domestic food prices.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} examine the {{question}} of optimal tariffs when producers and sellers are different entities. A number of alternative market structures are considered. It is found that {{the sign of the}} optimal tariff may depend {{on the nature of the}} producer-seller relationship, viz., who the leader is. In particular, the authors find that the optimal tariff is negative when the only seller is the leader and there is only one foreign producer. There is also a case where it is optimal for the government of the home country to <b>subsidize</b> <b>imports</b> no matter who the leader is. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{most popular}} {{methodology}} {{used by the}} US International Trade Commission (USITC) commissioners to determine whether dumped and/or <b>subsidized</b> <b>imports</b> injure competing domestic industries has been rejected by reviewing bodies {{because it does not}} distinguish injury caused by unfairly traded imports from other demand or supply changes. We estimate injury to the domestic industry due to changes in unfairly traded import price and to other causes for 44 USITC dumping and/or subsidy investigations. Change in unfairly traded import price was typically not the most important cause of injury to the domestic industry. (JEL F 13) Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Canada inaugurated {{its first}} system for pricing oil, with three objectives: to {{regulate}} prices of domestic crude oil through federal-provincial agreements, to <b>subsidize</b> <b>imported</b> oil so that consumers in eastern Canada would enjoy lower prices, and to control prices and quantities {{of crude oil}} and products in the export market. Synthetic crude oil (upgraded petroleum from oil sands) was exempted from this policy and sold at the world price.

It is assumed that household consumption of goods is linearly related to prices. An equilibrium of the model economy is then computed by solving a quadratic program. It is shown that the price control policy is equivalent to <b>subsidizing</b> <b>imported</b> oil with revenues from a tax on domestic crude production. Equilibria are computed under this policy and in its absence.

In a seminal paper, Grossman and Helpman [11] showed that, {{in the presence of}} political pressure, it is optimal for the government not only to grant protection to organized industries but also to <b>subsidize</b> <b>imports</b> in unorganized sectors. I argue that it is possible even for an industry that is not organized to enjoy protection. I employ two data sets that have not yet been used in the existing trade literature to show that the threat of unemployment and the adjustment costs associated with the relocation of displaced skilled workers could incite the incumbent to grant protection to an unorganized industry even in the presence of political pressure by organized sectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present article is to {{consider}} optimal trade policies for biofuels, taking into account the potential for carbon leakage and the complex set of policies used or discussed for biofuels. First, the authors consider the case of optimal trade policies and find that the combination of an import standard and a border carbon adjustment welfare dominates using only a border carbon adjustment (BCA). The import standard should be set such that the emissions per unit of output is as if the foreign biofuels industry were subject to the globally optimal green house gas (GHG) emission tax. Second, the authors study the same trade policies {{in the context of a}} blending mandate, which significantly alters the way the market works. Given the suboptimal implementation of a blending mandate, the optimal BCA depends on the domestic subsidy to biofuels production. High levels of subsidies may in fact imply a negative BCA; that is, the optimal policy would be to <b>subsidize</b> <b>imports...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the appropriate time}} path of the tariff rate for a small open economy that has decided to move from protection of import competing industries to free trade. Adjustment costs for moving resources to alternative uses do not provide a rationale for gradual adjustment of the tariff rate because {{in the absence of}} distortions, rational optimizing agents will make socially appropriate investment decisions with respect to adjustment when they are qiven correct price signals. Some distortions of the adjustment process imply the desirability of gradual adjustment of the tariff rate to slow adjustment, but other distortions imply the desirability of <b>subsidizing</b> <b>imports</b> in the short run in order to speed movement of resources out of previously protected industries. Concern with the income redistribution effects of reductions in the tariff rate (which usually injure owners of factors in previously protected industries) does provide a general rationale for a gradual move to free trade. The influence of the unemployment consequences of tariff reduction on the appropriate path of commercial policy depends on the nature and shape of the resoone of the rate of resource reallocation to the level of unemployment in previously protected industries...|$|R

5000|$|Agriculture {{remained}} in ruin, and Austria relied on food imports from the West. In 1948-1949 substantial share of Marshall Plan funds allocated to Austria {{was used to}} <b>subsidize</b> <b>imports</b> of food. American money, effectively, raised real wages of Austrian workers: grain price in Austria was at {{about one-third of the}} world price. Farmers were depressed by artificially low prices; the Americans were not happy about it too and planned to cut off food subsidies by the end of 1950. Austrian coalition government chaired by Leopold Figl was facing an impending social and economic crisis. They had to manage it alone, without allied support and without financial reserves to smooth the transition. Austrian finances were ruined by post-war hyperinflation. In 1947-1949 the government and organized labor maintained real wages through annual adjustment of wages to prices.

Braceros were to work under contracts that specified their transportation, wages, health care, housing, and food and the number of hours to be worked. The contracts were initially between the U.S. and Mexican governments but they were switched to private contractors who ignored the terms. It is estimated that over 4.5 million contracts were issued.

The final section summarizes the results which find that, all things being equal, the elimination of price controls for both autos and televisions had the effect of decreasing imports, as more domestic autos were produced and sold. The implication is that [...] contrary to the Polish government's intention [...] price controls were a trade distortion that increased imports: that is, they implicitly <b>subsidized</b> <b>imports.</b> The author also shows that import liberalization produces greater benefits when there are domestic price controls with rent dissipation, because import liberalization reduces the rent.
