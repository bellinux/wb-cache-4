40|$|AbstractStirling {{engines are}} a {{promising}} candidate for micro-cogeneration in residential and small-scale tertiary applications. Due to {{the variability of}} energy demand profiles and electricity tariffs, real applications often require to operate the cogeneration unit with multiple daily starts and stops, especially during summer and intermediate seasons. This work focuses on the experimental analysis of a commercial 1  kWel Stirling unit, burning natural gas and generating 8  kWth of useful heat through hot water and up to 12  kWth with an auxiliary burner, when subjected to cyclic on-off operation. The scope is collecting useful data about energy balances and emissions during on-off transients, which can be later used to optimize {{the management of the}} cogeneration unit when coupled with real users. Different cyclic tests are experimented (with intermediate stops and operation of either one or two burners), keeping the temperature of the cogeneration water at the unit inlet at 50 °C and its mass flow rate at the nominal value of 0. 194  kg/s. The Stirling unit has shown an electrical efficiency of 8. 9 %, based on Lower Heating Value (LHV), in the most favorable cyclic test and 8. 2 % in the worst case, while thermal efficiency ranges between 91. 0 and 92. 6 %. For comparison, the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> electrical <b>efficiency</b> is 10. 8 % (LHV) while the thermal is 90. 1 % with only one burner running in full cogeneration mode. <b>Steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiencies</b> become 7. 2 % and 92. 0 % (LHV), respectively, with the auxiliary burner running. The significant reduction of average electrical efficiency suggests the necessity to limit the frequency of starts and stops in real operation.

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} control {{problems}} require the control action and/or {{state to be}} positive. Typical applications include situations where the operating point maximizes (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> <b>efficiency</b> so that the steady state control and/or the steady state itself lie on the boundaries of their respective constraint sets. Any deviation of the control and/or state from its steady state value must therefore be directed to the interior of its constraint set. To address these problems, we characterize a novel family of the robust control invariant sets for linear systems under positivity constraints. The existence of a constraint admissible member of this family can be checked by solving a single linear or quadratic programming problem. The solution of this optimization problem yields the corresponding controller. These results are then used to devise a robust time–optimal control scheme for regulation of uncertain linear systems under positivity constraints. Robust finite–time attractivity of an appropriately chosen member of this family is also established. Copyright c© 2005 IFAC...|$|E

In addition to the pros of the technology significantly increasing <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiencies</b> - up to 5 % in absolute values and much more in relative values - these papers also mentioned the cons of the technology, increased backpressures, increased weight, more complex packaging, more complex control, troublesome transient operation, and finally the cold start issues that prevent the uptake of the technology. This paper further explores the option to use Rankine cycle systems to improve the fuel economy of vehicles under normal driving conditions. A single Rankine cycle system is integrated here with the engine design. A latest turbocharged 1. 6 L direct injection engine has the coolant circuit modified to serve as pre-heater for the Rankine cycle fluid. This fluid is then vaporised and superheated in the boiler/superheater coaxial to the exhaust pipe located downstream of the turbocharger turbine and the closed coupled catalytic converter. The exhaust ports are insulated to reduce the heat losses. The pump of the Rankine cycle system is electrically operated. The expander of the Rankine cycle system drives a generator to recharge the traction battery pack. The thermal engine {{is connected to the}} transmission through an electric clutch and a motor/generator that permits to supplement/replace the thermal engine energy supply, recover the braking energy and start/stop the thermal engine.

40|$|For {{maximum power}} point (MPP) application, the {{transient}} evolution of capacitor can be exploited to examine the power-voltage (P-V) characteristics of a photovoltaic (PV) array. This method is simple and inexpensive. In addition, it can be implemented on any array size whether un-shaded or partially shaded. This paper presents a new MPPT technique that scans the P-V curve of PV array with a series capacitor (Cscan) through a unique H-bridge architecture. The proposed technique employs a simple algorithm, which controls the H-bridge to scan the P-V curve in two sequences: (1) during charging of capacitor, and (2) during discharging of capacitor. The proposed MPPT neither requires the isolation of PV array from load nor executes power loss during checking of P-V curve. The effects of input capacitor (Cin) of converter during scanning of P-V curve are comprehensively discussed, and then the correct sizing of Cscan according to array size is explained with a design example. A comparative analysis of different MPPTs {{in the context of}} tracking ability, dynamic, and <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiencies</b> is presented.

40|$|Scale model {{tests were}} used to {{determine}} the efficiency relationships for a hydrodynamic separator (Storm King(TM)) and a high-side weir overflow. With the help of these relationships optimal dimensions of an improved high-side weir overflow chamber could be found. The <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> for this improved overflow chamber seems to be comparable to mat of a hydrodynamic separator, when both devices are subjected to the same surface load. On the other hand, during real storm events, the storage inside the overflow structure can play an important role. This role is investigated by calculating the removal efficiencies for both structures when 4 monitored storm events are used as input. When higher removal efficiencies are wanted, the storage effect gets more and more important and as a consequence the hydrodynamic separator can technically as well as economically compete with simpler structures like e. g, a high-side weir overflow. These findings are confirmed by a simple construction cost estimation. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Direct Torque Control (DTC) {{appears as}} an {{effective}} and practical control scheme for AC motor drives. The DTC of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) Drives attracted great attention, due to many features like high efficiency, quick dynamic performance and provide excellent steady state response. The adjustable speed drives are rapidly introduced {{in the area of}} electric vehicle and motion control devices and these devices are often powered by a battery source. Due to the restriction in energy supply, the improvement of motor efficiency is the most important priority, and hence the DTC technique is used to measure the losses in PMSM. In order to measure the losses, the offline and online calculation methods are proposed. In this work, the mechanical losses is depends on rotor speed and friction torque, and it is often uncontrollable but the electrical losses are controllable and hence the electrical losses can be measured certainly.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to study the {{thermodynamic}} behaviour of small systems beyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation, which is different in spirit from conventional approaches. The idea is to redefine the system and environment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly to Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent thermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve this goal we {{make use of the}} reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general method {{in the sense that it}} can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. We demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can significantly enhance the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a three-level-maser heat engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling.

The Mutual Production Model developed in Gravelle and Kotlikoff (1989) can be used to study the efficiency gains from the reduction in corporate tax wedges within industries. Unlike the Harberger Model, the Mutual Production Model permits both corporate and noncorporate firms to produce the same goods and, therefore, to coexist within a given industry. This paper develops an 11 industry - 55 year dynamic life cycle version of the Mutual Production Model. We use this model to study the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> gains associated with the new law. While we do not simulate the economy's transition path, our steady state welfare changes are those that arise from compensating transitional generations for the first order redistribution of income associated with the Tax Reform.

This efficiency gain reflects the Tax Reform's reduction in corporate non-corporate tax wedges, particularly in those industries with significant non-corporate production.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on control-oriented {{analysis}} of integrated fuel cell systems that incorporate energy recuperation mechanisms. The high complexity of such fuel cell systems calls for precise control and regulation of multiple inputs. The need for robust and efficient steady state and transient operation imposes the need for intelligent control schemes. The models of two fuel cell systems are developed in this work and used {{for the design of}} feedback controllers. It is shown, through simulation, that the proposed controllers enhance the performance and meet the operating constraints. The two plants considered in this dissertation are (i) a catalytic partial oxidation fuel processor system (FPS) coupled with a proton exchange fuel cell and a catalytic burner (CB) and (ii) a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) system. Both systems rely on energy recuperation devices (ERDs), such as a catalytic burner or a gas turbine, for achieving high fuel efficiency. Through model-based open loop analysis the FPS is shown to exhibit fuel cell H 2 starvation and reactor overheating while the SOFC/GT system is prone to shutdown during load transitions without proper feedback in place. It is identified that the transient issues can be resolved through reactant ratio control and load filtering for the FPS and the SOFC/GT systems, respectively. Using the insights from the open loop analysis, feedback control schemes are designed to address the transient issues. For the FPS, an observer-based linear controller, that utilizes temperature measurements to control the air and fuel flows into the reformer and maintain proper reactant ratios, is proposed. For the SOFC/GT system, a reference governor control scheme is developed to filter the application of the load in order to avoid GT shutdown. For both systems, the designed control schemes utilize measurements from the ERDs, such as shaft speed or catalytic burner temperature and manage to mitigate the transient operating difficulties. Thus, the ERDs, besides increasing the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the system by reducing the energy losses, also provide vital measurements for feedback control...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{research}} has suggested supramaximal training {{can be an}} effective means of improving endurance performance; however ultra high intensity training (UHIT) has not been examined as a replacement of training volume in a well-trained endurance population. Overuse-related injuries, recurring illness, feelings of staleness, and overtraining that are often associated with high volume training may be avoided with low volume, UHIT training. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of two weeks of low volume UHIT with two weeks of traditional HV endurance training on lactate threshold (LT), VO 2 max, <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency,</b> substrate utilization rates, and 25 K time trial performance in well-trained endurance athletes. Method: Twenty (VO 2 max ≥ 55 ml/kg/min or 4. 5 L/min and minimum training volume of 150 km/week) male cyclists were match-paired into two groups. Four two-day testing sessions were performed at 0, 2, 4, and 6 wks. Day one of testing measured VO 2 max and lactate threshold. Day two involved a 10 -min steady state ride followed by a 25 K time trial. All participants were tested, then continued two weeks of their endurance training. Following a retest, the controls (CON) continued with their endurance training while the other half (INT) replaced their endurance training with UHIT, consisting of a 10 -min warm-up followed by 8 - 10 x 30 sec sprints at a workload of 0. 075 kg/kg body weight and 4. 5 min recovery. Participants completed 6 training sessions over two weeks with two optional low intensity endurance days. Following the second phase all participants re-tested then either continued with (CON) or returned to (INT) their individual endurance-training regimen. A final testing session was conducted two wks later. Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in VO 2 max or LT (% of VO 2 max). In addition, cycling efficiency, steady state VO 2 and heart rate, and 25 K time trial performance were not different. Discussion: A short-term reduction in training volume replaced by relatively short sessions of supramaximal training can affectively maintain endurance cycling performance for well-trained cyclists. This type of training may be useful as a means of decreasing the occurrence of negative consequences of long-term, high volume training...|$|E

Activator concentrations ranged from {approximately} 0. 25 to 10 %. The CL decay curves are always non-linear on a log(CL) -linear(time) plot [...] i. e. they deviate from first order decay kinetics. These deviations are always more pronounced at short times and larger activator concentrations and are largest at low beam energies where the decay rates are noticeably faster. PL decay is always slower than that seen for CL, but these differences disappear after most of the excited species have decayed. They have also measured the dependence of <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> CL <b>efficiency</b> on beam energy. They find that larger activator concentrations accelerate the drop in CL efficiency seen at low beam energies. These effects are largest for the activators which interact more strongly with the host lattice. While activator-activator interactions are known to limit PL and CL efficiency in most phosphors, the present data suggest that a more insidious version of this mechanism is partly responsible for poor CL efficiency at low beam energies. This enhanced concentration quenching is due to the interaction of nearby excited activators. These interactions can lead to non-radiative activator decay, hence lower <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> CL <b>efficiency.</b> Excited <b>state</b> clustering, which may be caused by the large energy loss rate of low energy primary electrons, appears to enhance these interactions. In support of this idea, they find that PL decays obtained at high laser pulse energies resemble the non-linear decays seen in the CL data...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{measured}} the emissions {{from a wide}} range of heating equipment burning different fuels including several liquid fuel options, utility supplied natural gas and wood pellet resources. The major effort was placed on generating a database for the mass emission rate of fine particulates (PM 2. 5) for the various fuel types studied. The fine particulates or PM 2. 5 (less than 2. 5 microns in size) were measured using a dilution tunnel technique following the method described in US EPA CTM- 039. The PM 2. 5 emission results are expressed in several units for the benefit of scientists, engineers and administrators. The measurements of gaseous emissions of O{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, CO, NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } were made using a combustion analyzer based on electrochemical cells These measurements are presented for each of the residential heating systems tested. This analyzer also provides a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on stack gas and temperature measurements and these values are included in the report. The gaseous results are within the ranges expected from prior emission studies with the enhancement of expanding these measurements to fuels not available to earlier researchers. Based on measured excess air levels and ultimate analysis of the fuel's chemical composition the gaseous emission results are as expected and fall within the range provided for emission factors contained in the US-EPA AP 42, Emission Factors Volume I, Fifth Edition. Since there were no unexpected findings in these gaseous measurements, the bulk of the report is centered on the emissions of fine particulates, or PM 2. 5. The fine particulate (PM 2. 5) results for the liquid fuel fired heating systems indicate a very strong linear relationship between the fine particulate emissions and the sulfur content of the liquid fuels being studied. This is illustrated by the plot contained in the first figure on the next page which clearly illustrates the linear relationship between the measured mass of fine particulate per unit of energy, expressed as milligrams per Mega-Joule (mg/MJ) versus the different sulfur contents of four different heating fuels. These were tested in a conventional cast iron boiler equipped with a flame retention head burner. The fuels included a typical ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur below 0. 5 percent (1520 average ppm S), an ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with very high sulfur content (5780 ppm S), low sulfur heating oil (322 ppm S) and an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (11 ppm S). Three additional oil-fired heating system types were also tested with normal heating fuel, low sulfur and ultralow sulfur fuel. They included an oil-fired warm air furnace of conventional design, a high efficiency condensing warm air furnace, a condensing hydronic boiler and the conventional hydronic boiler as discussed above. The linearity in the results was observed with all of the different oil-fired equipment types (as shown in the second figure on the next page). A linear regression of the data resulted in an Rsquared value of 0. 99 indicating that a very good linear relationship exits. This means that as sulfur decreases the PM 2. 5 emissions are reduced in a linear manner within the sulfur content range tested. At the ultra low sulfur level (15 ppm S) the amount of PM 2. 5 had been reduced dramatically to an average of 0. 043 mg/MJ. Three different gas-fired heating systems were tested. These included a conventional in-shot induced draft warm air furnace, an atmospheric fired hydronic boiler and a high efficiency hydronic boiler. The particulate (PM 2. 5) measured ranged from 0. 011 to 0. 036 mg/MJ. depending on the raw material source used in their manufacture. All three stoves tested were fueled with premium (low ash) wood pellets obtained in a single batch to provide for uniformity in the test fuel. Unlike the oil and gas fired systems, the wood pellet stoves had measurable amounts of particulates sized above the 2. 5 -micron size that defines fine particulates (less than 2. 5 microns). The fine particulate emissions rates ranged from 22 to 30 mg/ MJ with an average value of 25 mg/MJ for the three stoves tested...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{inorganic-organic}} thin-film {{solar cells}}, such as {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSCs), can be assembled with low-cost materials and manufactured with cost-effective methods, and are considered promising photovoltaic technologies. A typical DSC is composed of a layer of mesostructured wide-band gap metal oxide semiconductor on which is adsorbed a light-absorbing sensitizer. Upon illumination, the adsorbed sensitizer is photoexcited and injects an excited electron into the conduction band of the semiconducting oxide. The oxidized dye is then regenerated by electron donation from a redox couple present in the electrolyte. The redox couple is regenerated at the counter electrode with electrons that have migrated through an external circuit. Despite over 20 years of development, the performance and long-term stability of these solar cells are still lagging behind major photovoltaic technologies, such as silicon-based solar cells. This is partly {{because some of the}} factors limiting device performance are not fully understood. Moreover, novel photoactive materials that have both high light absorption capability and fast carrier mobility are highly desired. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to {{contribute to the development of}} high-performance hybrid thin-film solar cells by designing novel device architectures and exploiting hybrid perovskite materials as novel light absorbers along with providing a deeper understanding of device operation mechanisms. In order to enhance the charge transport in DSCs, a nanostructured collector–shell electrode was developed. A collector–shell electrode consists of a porous scaffold material having high electronic conductivity and a thin metal oxide shell. The shell provides sites for dye adsorption and photoelectron injection while the conductive backbone allows fast electron transport. DSCs fabricated using the collector–shell electrodes along with a cobalt redox couple and an organic sensitizer, MK- 2, exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3. 3 % and a charge transport rate that was 2. 6 times faster than observed for devices utilizing P 25 -based TiO 2 electrodes. In the quest to explore novel efficient light absorber materials, an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite material, viz., CH₃NH₃PbI₃, was utilized in planar structured thin film solar cells. The CH₃NH₃PbI₃ perovskites have been shown to exhibit excellent light harvesting, high carrier mobility and facile solution processability. A one-step, solvent-induced fast crystallization method was developed which produced high quality CH₃NH₃bI₃ perovskite thin films. These thin films exhibit full surface coverage and are composed of micron-sized grains. The application of these films in solar cell construction led to highly efficient devices with an average PCE of 13. 9 ± 0. 7 % and a <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 13 %. The champion device fabricated using this deposition method achieved a PCE of 16. 2 %. In an attempt to further understand the perovskite-based device working mechanism, inverted structure perovskite-based solar cells with single or double selective contacts were fabricated which employed CH₃NH₃PbI₃ as light absorber and different inorganic metal oxides as interlayers. Solar cells fabricated on metal oxide layer coated substrates exhibit promising PCEs of over 10 %. In addition, solar cells fabricated on ITO substrate without any metal oxide layer also exhibit a high PCE of 11. 5 %. This result indicates that perovskite solar cells can also perform well with single selective contact. The inverted structure perovskite solar cells, with or without the metal oxide interlayers, all exhibit very weak hysteresis in J–V measurements. This finding suggests that the hysteresis effect is not an intrinsic characteristic of the CH₃NH₃PbI₃ perovskite material and can be alleviated by optimization of the cell structure and judicious selection of the contact material. To understand the perovskite crystallization process and hence obtain a better control of film morphology for device fabrication, a series of perovskite materials including FAPbI₃, MAPbBr₃, MASnI₃ and mixed perovskites were investigated. Tuning of the relative rates of nucleation and crystal growth is crucial to achieve control over the final film morphology. For the FAPbI₃ system, smooth and uniform perovskite films were obtained over a large area by simultaneously applying a gas-assisted deposition method and adding HI solution in the perovskite precursor solution. Optimization of fabrication process resulted in a solar cell with a best performance of 12. 0 %. For MAPbBr₃ system, planar structure photovoltaic devices using these MAPbBr 3 films achieved a PCE of 0. 5 %. The device performance is further increased to 2. 2 % by deposition of a mesoporous TiO₂ layer on top of the dense TiO 2 blocking layer. For MASnI₃ system, application of a precursor solution combining MASnI₃ with MAPbI 3 in a molar ratio of 1 : 1, and using the gas-assisted deposition method, smooth MASn₀. ₅Pb₀. ₅I₃ films over large area were obtained. In summary, high performance hybrid thin film solar cells have been developed by engineering the device architecture and employing an alkylammonium metal halide perovskite material as light absorber. The studies presented herein highlight the potential of hybrid mesoscopic thin film solar cells to become a promising photovoltaic technology...|$|E

Here, we describe a sensitive method for measuring translational regulation in defined cell populations from heterogeneous tissue in vivo. We adapted the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methodology to measure the relative occupancy of individual mRNA transcripts in translating ribosomes in the Olig 2 -positive tumor cell population in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEM) of glioma. Global measurement of paired ribosome-bound and total cellular mRNA populations from tumor cells in vivo identified a broad distribution of relative ribosome occupancies amongst mRNA species that was highly reproducible across biological samples. Comparison of the translation state of glioma cells to non-transformed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in normal brain identified global alteration of translation in tumor, and specifically of genes involved in cell division and synthetic metabolism.

The oxidation of Ag (I) {{was performed in}} an electrochemical cell under various conditions, including varying the temperature and the concentrations of nitric acid and mediator ions in a batch-type electrochemical reactor in recirculation mode. The formation of Ag (II) increased upon increasing the concentration of nitric acid, but it decreased at higher temperatures. The percentage of conversion decreased upon increaseing the concentration of Ag (I). The destruction of phenol was performed in batch and continuous organic feeding modes. A maximum destruction efficiency of 88. 8 % (based on CO 2) was achieved in the batch process. The destruction efficiency during the continuous organic feeding increased upon increasing the temperature and in-itial concentration of Ag (I) up to 0. 5 M. The destruction was also tested {{in the long run}} for 2 h; the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> destruction <b>efficiency</b> was 75 %, based on CO 2 production...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the paper {{is to develop a}} simple and {{practical}} control strategy for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) system. Based on a dynamic model and the control demand, a cascade control strategy is designed. The master controller imposes a change of cell current representing a change in power demand and sets the amount of fuel gas, the steam-to-carbon ratio, the air number and the cathode gas recycle ratio to their corresponding conditions for optimal <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> electric <b>efficiency.</b> Two feedback PID controllers are in the inner loop, one guarantees the solid temperature not to exceed a maximum temperature by changing the air number around the default set by the master controller; the other controls the maximum temperature difference by adjusting the steam-to-carbon ratio. Step response tests show that this control strategy works well when the cell current changes. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. [accessed 2014 January 9 th...|$|R

Optimal solu-tions consist in a sequence of grid repairs and corresponding <b>steady</b> <b>states.</b> However, such approaches lack formal guar-antees on the transient stability of restoration actions, a key property to avoid additional grid damage and cascading fail-ures. In this paper, we show how to integrate transient stabil-ity in the optimization procedure by capturing the rotor dy-namics of power generators. Our approach reasons about the differential equations describing the dynamics and their un-derlying transient states. The key contribution lies in mod-eling and solving optimization problems that return stable generators dispatch minimizing the difference with respect to <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> solutions.

For each new sample, the filter automatically selects an optimal window length that maximizes measurement accuracy. Large window length is selected if the frequency is slow varying or <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> to increase <b>efficiency</b> in filtering noise and harmonics. For fast-varying frequency, the window length is automatically reduced {{in order to make}} frequency tracking more accurate, sacrificing filtering efficiency. Automatic selection of the optimal window length that balances between tracking and filtering performance is the unique feature of this technique.

We anaerobically digested swine waste and achieved <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> COD-removal <b>efficiency</b> of around 52 % with no fatty-acid or H 2 accumulation. As the anaerobic microbial community adapted to the gradual increase of total ammonia-N (NH 3 -N) from 890 ± 295 to 2040 ± 30 [*]mg/L, the Bacterial and Archaeal communities became less diverse. Phylotypes most closely related to hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus (36. 4 %) and Methanobrevibacter (11. 6 %), along with acetoclastic Methanosaeta (29. 3 %), became the most abundant Archaeal sequences during acclimation. This {{was accompanied by a}} sharp increase in the relative abundances of phylotypes most closely related to acetogens and fatty-acid producers (Clostridium, Coprococcus, and Sphaerochaeta) and syntrophic fatty-acid Bacteria (Syntrophomonas, Clostridium, Clostridiaceae species, and Cloacamonaceae species) that have metabolic capabilities for butyrate and propionate fermentation, as well as for reverse acetogenesis. Our results provide evidence countering a prevailing theory that acetoclastic methanogens are selectively inhibited when the total ammonia-N concentration is greater than ~ 1000 [*]mgN/L. Instead, acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens coexisted in the presence of total ammonia-N of ~ 2000 [*]mgN/L by establishing syntrophic relationships with fatty-acid fermenters, as well as homoacetogens able to carry out forward and reverse acetogenesis...|$|R

Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is design for in {{field oriented control}} (FOC) based structure associated with an induction motor (IM). FLC has ability to confront the uncertainties existing in the IFOC determined through model of IM. The type of FLC that using is Segeno fuzzy logic. The inputs of FLC are the error (e) and derivative error (de) between actual speed and reference speed. The output of FLC is the daxesstator current (ids). Membership functions are chosen based to parameter of the motor model. The speed control of IM is importance to achieve maximum torque efficiency. FLC applied in this paper to control speed of induction motor to achieve maximum torque to minimum loss. Motor state variable be identified using indirect by using IM model. High performance for speed of IM drives needs proper control of motor speed and produce electromagnetic torque.

Based on the postulate that turnover in this enzyme {{is controlled by}} conformational dynamics associated with a highly conserved active site loop, we constructed a variant library by targeting imperfectly conserved noncatalytic loop residues and examined the effects on product and porphyrin production. Functional loop variants of the enzyme were isolated via genetic complementation in Escherichia coli strain HU 227. Colony porphyrin fluorescence varied widely when bacterial cells harboring the loop variants were grown on inductive media; this facilitated identification of clones encoding unusually active enzyme variants. Nine loop variants leading to high in vivo porphyrin production were purified and characterized kinetically. <b>Steady</b> <b>state</b> catalytic <b>efficiencies</b> for the two substrates were increased by up to 100 -fold. Presteady state single turnover reaction data indicated that the second step of quinonoid intermediate decay, previously assigned as reaction rate-limiting, was specifically accelerated such that in three of the variants this step was no longer kinetically significant. Overall, our data support the postulate that the active site loop controls the rate of product and porphyrin production in vivo and suggest the possibility of an as yet undiscovered means of allosteric regulation...|$|R
