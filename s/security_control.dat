The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. There is a single gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of <b>security</b> <b>control</b> was 17steps from the entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} <b>security</b> <b>control.</b> He selected a seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05.|$|E
5|$|A hangar {{was built}} at Bergen Airport in 2003, {{and at the}} same time the airline was {{certified}} as a mechanical aviation workshop. The following year, the Cessna 421 was replaced with a Cessna 441 Conquest II. In 2006, two Beechcraft King Air were bought, and the last Cessna sold. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all scheduled traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a lack of safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, which owns the airport, scheduled services commenced again. From 1 October 2004, NOK 250,000 was invested at Notodden Airport. Starting in October 2004, the airline also introduced <b>security</b> <b>control</b> of all passengers at Notodden Airport. In 2005, the company had a revenue of NOK 10.3 million; this increased to NOK 20.1 million in 2006, giving a profit of NOK 2.8 million, when the airline transported 2,841 passengers.|$|E
40|$|Subject of {{the thesis}} {{is to create}} {{extended}} model {{for the evaluation of}} information <b>security</b> <b>controls.</b> Evaluation of <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> is one from many processes of risk management which is part of information security management system ISMS. Thesis contains the outline of issue of information security and introduce various publications of information security management. Two of these publications were chosen and are used in this thesis. It is ČSN ISO/IEC 27001 : 2014 and NIST 800 _ 53. These two standards are used for creation of introduced model. Model itself is introduced in second part of the thesis. Model is connecting <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> from these two standards. If organization implements <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> from NIST 800 _ 53, meet requirements defined in ČSN ISO/IEC 27001 : 2014; Apendix A.

40|$|Abstract—Mission {{critical}} information systems must be certified against {{a set of}} <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> to mitigate potential security incidents. Cloud service providers must in turn employ adequate security measures that conform to <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> expected by the organizational information systems they host. Since service implementation details are abstracted away by the cloud, organizations can only rely on service level agreements (SLAs) to assess the compliance of cloud security properties and processes. Various representation schema allow SLAs to embed service security terms, but are disconnected from documents regulating <b>security</b> <b>controls.</b> This paper demonstrates an extensible solution for building a compliance vocabulary that associates SLA terms with <b>security</b> <b>controls.</b> The terms allow services to express which <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> they comply with and enable at-a-glance comparison of security service offerings so organizations can distinguish among cloud service providers that best comply with security expectations. To exemplify the approach, we build a sample vocabulary of terms based on audit <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> from a standard set of governing documents and apply them to an SLA for an example cloud storage service. We assess the compatibility with existing SLAs and calculate the computational overhead {{associated with the use}} of our approach in service matchmaking.

25|$|When the European Union {{introduced}} {{new security}} rules for airports from 1 January 2005, Brekstad Airport was exempt, {{because of the}} small size of the aircraft. By April, the airport had received notice that 100% <b>security</b> <b>control</b> would still have to be introduced, costing the municipality NOK465,000 per year. At the same time, Air Norway was still losing money, and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport. On 3 September 2007, the terminal was renovated for NOK1.8 million. It received a segregation of arriving and departing passengers, 100% <b>security</b> <b>control</b> and a general renovation of the building, although the capacity was not increased. In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 passengers after the Norwegian Air Force decided to not permit their employees to travel from Brekstad, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about two hours drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone in relation to the Norwegian, caused Air Norway to have lost NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a public service obligation.|$|E

40|$|Security {{certification}} {{assesses the}} security posture of a software system to verify its compliance with diverse, pre-specified <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> identified by guidelines from NIST and the US Department of Defense. Service-oriented architectures (SOA) {{are difficult to}} certify because they require compliance verification over a mix of local, global, and interaction criteria dictated by {{the policies of the}} participating services and SOA governance. Web services further contribute to this difficulty because they lack direct methods to express <b>security</b> <b>controls.</b> Besides being understandable, the method of expression should indicate potential problems complying with chosen services. This paper presents a method for configuring of web service standards to enforce security requirements on service interaction specification documents within a SOA. The outcome serves as a mechanism to direct the population of constraints derived from <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> within standards specification documents, such as WS-Policy. We focus on <b>security</b> <b>controls</b> for auditing and how these can be enforced in an SOA.
