5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} (air shock with adjustable damping control) and frame (square-section steel tube type) were direct carryovers from the [...] "F" [...] model, but the front suspension featured Honda's anti-dive system named [...] "TRAC" [...] which stood for [...] "Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control". This system utilized the left brake hangar being {{pinned to the}} fork on the bottom mount and allowed to pivot in an anti-clockwise direction, thereby closing a valve in the left fork leg, forcing the damping fluid through a smaller passageway, and increasing the damping rate under hard braking. The left fork leg had a <b>screw-type</b> <b>adjuster</b> with four positions of adjustment which would change the amount of influence this system had under braking. The fork also featured a Schrader-type air valve which allowed air assistance from 0-6 psi to increase the spring rate in the fork. The right fork leg featured a 3 position hand adjustable dial which would increase damping rates. The fork also featured quick-release, swing-away axle clamps for faster tire changes in endurance racing. Many of these features were seen as very exotic for the time, and modern adjustable sportbike suspension can trace design roots to these features.|$|E
