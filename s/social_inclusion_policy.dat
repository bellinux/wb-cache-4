It responds to the current strategy of OECD nations to expand higher education and increase graduate numbers, as a way of securing a competitive advantage in the global knowledge economy. The Australian higher education system provides the case for analysis. Three dilemmas for <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policy</b> in this context are identified: questions of sustainability, aspiration and opportunity. The paper argues that while <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policy</b> has ‘first-order’ effects in higher education, a just imaginary is required for more inclusive ‘second-order’ effects to be realized. It concludes that transformation of the current imaginary will require a more robust theorization of relations between social inclusion and higher education, to give new and unifying meaning to existing practices and to generate new ones. Short of this, social inclusion may be little more than just imaginary...|$|E

40|$|Social {{inclusion}} {{has been}} conceptualised as having two key aspects: distributional aspects relating to {{access to resources}} including employment, and relational aspects which concern the connections between people and the wider society. While both are important, the emphasis in Australian <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policy</b> has been on distributional aspects. This paper focuses on the relational aspects of social inclusion, and argues that it is critically important to include relational considerations in <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policy.</b> Central to the relational aspects of social inclusion is achieving a sense of belonging, particularly at the everyday, local level. Belonging in this everyday sense {{can be thought of}} as an ongoing project achieved through everyday practices, rather than solely in terms of membership of a group. While many such practices, for example regularly engaging in team sports, are accepted ways of establishing and maintaining belonging, for others in a community practices of belonging may necessitate disrupting or at least broadening the established norms of how one belongs. To ground this discussion of inclusion and belonging, this paper draws on practices of belonging in a regional community. Established norms of belonging are examined through the idea of ‘being a local’, a way of belonging that appears to be based on membership. The paper then turns to two local projects which disrupt the exclusive bounds of local membership and establish new and inclusive practices of belonging. To conclude, parallels are drawn between the boundaries which define ‘the social’ in social inclusion and ‘the local community’ in being a local, to argue for the importance of including relational aspects of social inclusion within <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policy</b> debates and program formulation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interconnecting}} themes of knowledge, culture and change {{by examining the}} impact of the knowledge economy on the organization of welfare. It adopts as its specific focus the role of the welfare–expert' in the social services. This is contextualised within the New Labour government's <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policies,</b> the global knowledge economy and concepts of cultural capital within knowledge production. This issue is important because of the contemporary debates about new classes of knowledge producers and claims made about the increased democratisation of knowledge (Giddens 1996). In making an evaluation it considers the impact of cultural capital and the knowledge economy on the organisational culture of the public social services. It then asks whether these developments enhance <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policies</b> and if not what barriers exist to reduce effective service provision for socially excluded service users by examining the situation of gypsy welfare recipients...|$|R
40|$|The <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policies</b> are {{implemented}} in the higher education sector to provide access and opportunity for all groups of people irrespective of their social class to participate in higher education. Such policies ensure that every citizen has access to elite education which enables them to succeed and improve their life chances. The renewal of quality assurance in Australian higher education with focus on academic standards and government’s aspiration to increase the proportion of disadvantaged students by 2020 in tertiary education raises the question {{on the extent to}} which <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policies</b> could lower academic standards. This paper argues that contemporary trends such as increased student diversity; changing pattern of student participation in higher education; preparedness of many students for tertiary education; and new modes of learning will continue to grow and it is not necessary that such changes will lower academic standards.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> {{generally}} is discussed {{as an ideal}} to {{which there is no}} opposition, and to which policy and practices in society necessarily must be directed. This article discusses how current notions of <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> in <b>policy,</b> academic and media discourses are related to historical representations of social disadvantage. It also discusses how <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>policies</b> and ideas in Australia accord with cultural values and ideals of egalitarianism, but conflict with the values of non-conformity and anti-authoritarianism celebrated in the national identity. It examines how the media framing of <b>social</b> <b>inclusion</b> is influenced by the received understanding and historic representation of <b>social</b> <b>inclusion,</b> as well as how media representations of non-conformity in Australia are framed by a mythology of Australian journalists and journalism as larrikins and non-conformist.

This study was commissioned by IPTS to feed into a forthcoming 2 -year research project: Measuring the impact of eInclusion actors on Digital Literacy, Skills and Inclusion goals (MIREIA). The literature review presented in this report was designed to capture the theories and explanations represented in the existing body of research in order to: 1) Provide a comprehensive and multidisciplinary landscape on theories and analytical frameworks; analyze the value of these theories and analytical frameworks based on predefined criteria and; 2) Develop recommendations on the most promising theoretical pillars that could inform the future research mentioned above. A two-phase research approach was designed: 1) An extended mapping of the literature from the last ten years in which over 100 articles, reports and books were reviewed, coded and identified the most dominant and/or common explanations in relation to the work of e-Inclusion actors; and 2) a selection, categorization, and in-depth coding of these explanations vis-à-vis different impact areas, as well as in relation to institutional capacity. As a conclusion it has been noted that although a lot of the research on eInclusion is set out to measure impacts, in reality studies often end up with some measures of usage and analysis of why expected impacts were not achieved. In addition, there is a large proportion of available literature on telecenters and other such eInclusion actors which is based more on perceived potential than on demonstrated fact and highly contextualized studies, making it difficult to identify valid or reliable trends.
