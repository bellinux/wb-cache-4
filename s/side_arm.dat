25|$|The railway {{came under}} a Light Railway Order once the Appledore section was opened and this {{simplified}} {{the requirements for}} the signaling, especially as five of the crossings were controlled by 'Gatemen' {{and did not have}} crossing gates. The signaling was installed by the company Saxby and Farmer. There were no ordinary 'starters' or 'distants', but what might be termed 'homes' of ordinary semaphore type, used at a number of places on the line. Commencing from the Bideford end, signals in both directions marked {{the point at which the}} line passed from open 'street' sections onto the British Electric Traction Company property. A further signal with a <b>side</b> <b>arm</b> controlled entry to the 'yard' and the road crossing beyond. Causeway and its Level Crossing were guarded by signals on both approaches. From The Causeway, guarded by Mr. Blackmore, the line ran onwards to the station and passing loop at Abbotsham Road, which had a miniature semaphore watching over the roadway and the level crossing north of the station, with a full-size semaphore controlling the passing loop and train entry. Appledore had a small arm on the semaphore signal covering the siding points. For a time a man with a red flag rode on the front of the locomotive whilst it passed through the streets of Bideford. Signal boxes were located at The Causeway Crossing, operated by Mr. Furzy and Westward Ho! operated by Mr. Spry, with signal box 'huts' at The Strand, Abbotsham Road and Appledore.|$|E

Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol. After consulting Oberst Nicolaus von Below, Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant, Hartmann was allowed to keep his <b>side</b> <b>arm</b> and accepted the Diamonds. During Hartmann's meeting with Hitler, Hartmann discussed at length the shortcomings of fighter pilot training.

40|$|Abstract: Chironomid assemblages of {{the lower}} Hron River and eight <b>side</b> <b>arms</b> were studied. The aim was to {{investigate}} if potamon types could be recognized and distinguished by chironomid assemblages. Therefore, 10 sampling sites were classified into 4 potamon types: eupotamon, parapotamon, plesiopotamon and paleopotamon. Within the eupotamon type, the main channel and the dammed channel section were compared. In total, 66 chi-ronomid taxa were recorded in 2000 – 2002. In the main channel, rheophilic and rheobiontic taxa predominated, especially the subfamilies Tanypodinae and Orthocladiinae. The most frequent taxa recorded in the dammed sec-tion of the Hron River belonged to the tribe Chironomini. A characteristic feature of the studied <b>side</b> <b>arms</b> was the absence of rheophilic chironomids. The highest taxa richness was found in parapotamon type arms {{in comparison with the}} plesiopotamon and paleopotamon. Cluster analysis based on presence/absence data of chironomids sep-arated the sites of the main channel (eupotamon) and <b>side</b> <b>arms</b> directly influenced by the main channel (para-potamon, plesiopotamon), from the <b>side</b> <b>arms</b> without direct influence of main channel (paleopotamon). Further-more, eupotamon sites were well separated form the parapotamon and plesiopotamon type arms...|$|R

500|$|After {{the end of}} the siege, PC Trevor Lock {{was widely}} {{considered}} a hero. He was awarded the George Medal, the United Kingdom's second-highest civil honour, for his conduct during the siege and for tackling Oan during the SAS raid, the only time during the siege that he drew his concealed <b>side</b> <b>arm.</b> In addition, he was honoured with the Freedom of the City of London and in a motion in the House of Commons. Police historian Michael J. Waldren, referring to the television series Dixon of Dock Green, suggested that Lock's restraint in the use of his revolver was [...] "a defining example {{of the power of the}} Dixon image", and Maurice Punch noted the contrast between Lock's actions and the highly aggressive tactics of the SAS. [...] Sergeant Tommy Palmer was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his part in the assault, in which he shot dead a terrorist who was apparently about to throw a grenade amongst the hostages. After the operation concluded, the staff sergeant who was caught in his abseil rope was treated at St Stephen's Hospital in Fulham. He suffered serious burns to his legs, but went on to make a full recovery.|$|E
