With the 2012 York Region Transit <b>Service</b> <b>Plan,</b> the two routes were merged, {{and the frequency of}} direct buses to the hospital YRT transit hub was reduced. In February 2014, a new Route 15 was introduced, connecting Stouffville to Yonge Street in Richmond Hill and to a future GO-Station in Gormley. GO Transit operates bus services in Stouffville, with buses traveling south into Markham and to Union Station, Toronto, as well as services north to the Town of Uxbridge.|$|E

The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Tiangong-1 was {{launched}} September 2011 with an intended two year service span. After the last crew departed the module in June 2013 {{it was put}} into sleep mode and it was intended that it would remain in orbit for some time, allowing China {{to collect data on}} the longevity of key components before being commanded to gradually re-enter the atmosphere. On 21 March 2016 the Manned Space Engineering Office announced that they had disabled data service, since the space station had operated two and half years longer than its intended two-year <b>service</b> <b>plan.</b> According to the office, the space laboratory is under continued and close monitoring until it finally burns up in the earth atmosphere. Its orbit will descend gradually in the coming months, and the space laboratory will eventually be destroyed by heat in Earth's atmosphere between the October 2017 and April 2018 Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, among others, told The Guardian that parts of the craft such as the rocket engines are probably too dense and tough to be burnt up upon re-entry and may result in chunks of debris up 100kg in weight falling to the Earth's surface, with little possibility of predicting where they may crash.|$|E

500|$|When the {{connector}} to the IND 63rd Street Line {{from the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line {{was completed in}} December 2001, it not only introduced the new V service, but also allowed up to nine additional trains to and from Manhattan on the Queens Boulevard Line during peak hours. However, {{to make room for}} the V train on Queens Boulevard, the G had to terminate at Court Square on weekdays. The reroute of the G was part of the original plans of the 63rd Street tunnel and connector, going back to the late 1960s. The <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> was designed to redistribute Queens-bound passenger loads on the crowded IND Queens Boulevard Line, which ran under 53rd Street while in Manhattan. In turn, this plan was intended to bring better service and transfer opportunities as the V train allowed direct access to 53rd Street and the IND Sixth Avenue Line for Queens Boulevard Local customers. The New York Times prematurely described the <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> as [...] "complex and heavily criticized" [...] because it put more crowding on the E train.|$|E

This plan was intended to clear congestion at Rosslyn Station, where the Blue and Orange lines meet and ultimately prepare the tracks to accommodate the Silver Line. Under the plan, Blue Line trains continued on the usual route but some Yellow Line trains originated at Franconia–Springfield and were routed over the Fenwick Bridge to Greenbelt. During rush hour there were fewer Blue Line trains on the tracks which could mean potentially increased wait times for regular Blue Line customers. Furthermore, some Orange Line trains were routed to Largo Town Center until the Silver Line opened in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The new <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> was {{designed}} to redistribute Queens-bound passenger loads along the heavily used IND Sixth Avenue Line by encouraging use of the additional local trains provided for shorter trips, and to improve service and transfer opportunities for passengers using local stations along Queens Boulevard. The New York Times described the <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> as [...] "complex and heavily criticized." [...] New York Times columnist Randy Kennedy wrote that four months after it opened, the service was operating at only 49% of capacity.

V trains, while by no means consistently full, have taken some load off the [...] train; however, some riders have complained that the passenger load on the [...] train has worsened, while others said it has gotten better, due to its becoming the only express train that runs along 53rd Street.

R trains would become the Broadway express under this plan, using the BMT 63rd Street Line to access the Second Avenue line and continuing to 125th Street. The service would have operated 25 trains per hour (tph) between 125th Street and City Hall, 20 tph between City Hall and Whitehall Street, and 10 tph between Whitehall Street and Bay Ridge–95th Street via the Montague Street Tunnel. A reconstruction of a junction near Canal Street, called the [...] "Canal Flip," [...] would have provided a direct connection between the express tracks of the Broadway Line and Lower Manhattan, allowing the route to operate. To allow R trains to short-turn at City Hall, the station's unused lower level would have been reactivated, requiring upgrades for the platforms and tracks, including their lengthening, {{in addition to the}} installation of tail tracks. During construction, the station's upper level would have had to been underpinned. To replace the R on Queens Boulevard, a Broadway Local T route (distinct from the currently proposed Second Avenue Local T route) would have been created, running between Continental Avenue and Bay Parkway via Broadway local and the Manhattan Bridge.

2500|$|South of 14th Street, {{there were}} two {{possible}} options to decide between. Option A would continue the subway beneath Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan. Option B would connect the new subway to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street {{to provide access to}} Lower Manhattan. This option has been proposed as part of plans for the Second Avenue Subway from the 1940s and 1950s. Cross-platform transfers would be available at Canal Street and Chambers Street to the Nassau Street Line routes. It would allow Second Avenue trains to have access to Brooklyn using the underutilized Montague Street Tunnel. This option would have a lower cost than the Water Street option as less tunnel would need to be constructed. The Nassau option would attract more riders to the subway system because of additional service to Brooklyn, but the Water Street option would provide greater coverage in Manhattan and would be better at relieving congestion on the Lexington Avenue Line. Because the platforms on the BMT Eastern Division are shorter than those {{on the rest of the}} B Division, those on the Nassau Street Line south of Chambers Street would have to be lengthened by about , to a total of [...] The tracks would have to be reconfigured, the passenger circulation capacity would have to be increased, and the <b>service</b> <b>plan</b> south of Chambers Street would have to be modified, to provide sufficient capacity to accommodate the additional trains that Second Avenue Subway service would require.
