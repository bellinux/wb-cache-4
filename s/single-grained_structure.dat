40|$|Nowadays, an {{interior}} water inundation is increasing {{due to a}} localized torrential downpour. Because the localized torrential downpour increases the load of the rain water inflow into a river, {{it is important to}} reduce the amount of surface flow of the ground. Although sand which has a high permeability can make the rainfall permeate into the ground and can decrease a surface flow during a heavy rainfall, it is lacking in a water retentivity. But it is hard for soil which has high retentivity to make the rainfall permeate into the ground because of the low permeability and the occurrence of clogging. High retentive soil is generally a low permeability; however, aggregated material can have high permeability keeping high water retentivity. This paper first presents evaluations of properties of an aggregated soil from point of a particle and a pore size distribution and evaporation rate. Moreover, this aggregated structure was applied to a permeable pavement in order to improve permeability and water retentivity of base course. As a result, it was clarified that permeability and water retentivity are higher than the subgrade of <b>single-grained</b> <b>structure</b> at the time of non-rain and rain...|$|E
