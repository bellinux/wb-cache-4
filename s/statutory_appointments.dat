5|$|Unable {{to afford}} college tuition, Combs {{worked at a}} local drug store and did small jobs for various {{residents}} of his community. In 1929, his mother arranged for him {{to work at a}} coal company in Williamsburg and attend Cumberland College (then a junior college). The coal company job did not materialize, but Combs was able to afford three semesters at Cumberland by sweeping floors and firing furnaces in campus buildings. In mid-1930, he began working as a clerk for the state highway department. This was one of several patronage jobs that were usually awarded by the governor, but the Democratically-controlled state legislature had stripped Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson of his <b>statutory</b> <b>appointment</b> powers, giving them instead to a three-man highway commission composed of Democratic Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Democratic Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson, and Dan Talbott.

40|$|In this ethnography, {{writing as}} both {{practitioner}} and researcher, I represent and analyse the opinions and reflections of Anglican chaplains in English and Welsh prisons {{in order to}} locate their self - perception of role and identity. The Anglican chaplain has been a <b>statutory</b> <b>appointment</b> in every prison since 1779 and was a central figure in penal practice throughout {{the first half of}} the 19 th century. Several chaplains wrote at length about their ministry and its significance; this conscious utterance in the public domain dwindled sharply from the 1860 s onwards. My research presents current chaplains’ perspectives on their role and identity, configured by a social context which is perceived to be secular and in which other world faiths have a strong presence. Four main areas of focus emerge from the data: working with prisoners, working with staff, the apparently contradictory, ritual nature of secular and religious engagement, and issues of gendered interaction. These data are contextualised by respondents’ perceptions of prisons as parishes, the construction of Anglican chaplains’ identity by events within and outwith prisons and churches, and perceived relations with the Church of England and the Church in Wales. Having recognised other models of prison ministry, the thesis ends by identifying modes of potential, structured cooperation between church and chaplaincy. The epistemological con text derives from Goffman’s theory of total institutions but recognises subsequent reinterpretations of his work. The methodological reference points are Turner’s theory of liminality, Bell’s theory of ritual - like activities and Foucault’s heterotopia of deviance. The thesis offers a perspective on a traditional public form of ministry, that of the chaplains themselves, unexplored and not analysed for over a century. It is submitted as a further development in the growing discourse around practical theology and religious ministry in prisons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a critical overview {{of a recent}} attempt to create an independent statutory "voice" for small enterprises within the formal government bureaucracy in one Australian jurisdiction. It discusses the creation and eighteen months of activity of the Small Business Commissioner of the Australian Capital Territory. In 2003 the ACT government foreshadowed that, {{as part of its}} strategy to create the most small-business-friendly location in Australia, it would establish a Small Business Commissioner as a <b>statutory</b> <b>appointment.</b> The Legislative Assembly passed the Small Business Commissioner Act in 2004 and activity began in March 2005. The key activities of the Commissioner have been to examine small business complaints about ACT government agencies; to promote the use of mediation and/or other alternative dispute resolution tools for the settlement of disputes between small enterprises and other businesses; to provide independent advice to the Territory government about laws, regulations and policies that may affect small firms; to oversee the introduction of small business service charters within government agencies; and to establish a more "business friendly" service culture within ACT government agencies. On one hand, it is clear that a Commissioner role has a potentially significant strategic importance for small and medium-sized enterprises, principally through the provision of independent commentary, pushing for red tape and regulatory reduction, and by providing mediation services and investigative functions. However, there are also some current problems with the role. These include potential overlap with other regulatory and investigative bodies; lack of formal compulsive powers; its dependence on political support for its effectiveness; insufficient resources; {{and the nature of the}} relationship it has with other government entities.

This is a specialist postgraduate qualification by examination that verifies knowledge and understanding of food and its potential defects, interpretation of food law, and the application and interpretation of chemical analysis for food law enforcement.|$|R
