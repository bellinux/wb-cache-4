She participated in the Battle of Antivari in late August 1914, and spent {{the majority of the}} war based on the coast of Greece, in Corfu and Mudros, to keep the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman navies bottled up in port, though she saw no further action. After the end of the war, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea to assist in the enforcement of the terms of the Armistice with Germany.

Without revealing her identity, Natasha meets Emilia at a fashion shoot. Emilia works out Natasha is her niece and comes to Erinsborough to talk to her. Natasha learns her mother drowned and she demands the truth about her death. Michael reveals that Helena was not a strong swimmer, but <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea to save Natasha. When {{he became aware of}} what was happening, he could only save one of them. Michael reassures Natasha that Helena's death was not her fault. Michael collapses and undergoes surgery for a perforated stomach ulcer, causing Natasha to blame herself for his condition.

There, she {{defeated}} 14th seed Petrova in the quarterfinals, {{and in her}} first Grand Slam semifinal, defeated fifth seed and former champion Davenport, ending the American's 22-match winning streak. In the final, Kuznetsova defeated sixth seed Dementieva. Kuznetsova was the first female Russian to win the US Open and the third to win a Grand Slam singles title, following the successes of Myskina and Maria Sharapova earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Kuznetsova teamed with Likhovtseva to reach {{the final of the}} doubles tournament before losing there to Suarez and Ruano Pascual, marking Kuznetsova's fourth consecutive defeat by the pair in Grand Slams. Kuznetsova, however, climbed again to No. 3 on 13 September, after her loss in Los Angeles in early July.|$|E

5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{then went}} to Maine and the Virginia Capes for battle practice, after which <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, Connecticut emerged on 15 January 1915 and steamed south to Cuba, where she {{conducted}} training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the shaft and forcing her return to Philadelphia for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the United States Marine Corps for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August {{as part of the}} US occupation of Haiti. Connecticut delivered supplies to amphibious troops in Cap-Haïtien on 5 September and remained near Haiti for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from Connecticut under the command of Major Smedley Butler. After departing Haiti, Connecticut arrived in Philadelphia on 15 December and was placed into the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Virginia then {{proceeded}} to Norfolk, where she coaled before continuing on to Tompkinsville, Staten Island. She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have the bottom of her hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire control device was installed between 19 February and 23 March. Virginia then returned to Cuba, arriving in Guantanamo Bay on 28 March. She conducted gunnery training off Cuba until 10 April, when she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she remained from 15 April to 15 May. During this period, she participated in the Jamestown Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event. In mid-May, when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, which lasted into early June. From 7 to 13 June, she took part in a naval review for Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. Target practice followed off Cape Cod Bay from mid-June to mid-July. Virginia and the rest of her division then cruised the east coast, stopping in Newport, New York City, and Provincetown, followed by night battle training in Cape Cod Bay.|$|E

5|$|Regensburg {{completed}} her trials on 10 March 1915, and was then {{assigned to the}} II Scouting Group. Eleven days later, she bombarded Russian positions near Polangen and Papensee; the operation lasted until the 24th. Captain Hans Zenker proposed that Regensburg and the liner Cap Polonio—which was to be armed with 15cm guns—should be sent out into the Atlantic to replace the commerce raiding cruisers that had been destroyed {{in the early months}} of the war. The fleet commander, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, argued the ships would eventually be sunk as well, and that any possible successes for the raiders would not equal the loss of a modern light cruiser or a large passenger liner. The suggested plan was therefore abandoned. On 1718 May, Regensburg took part in a mine-laying operation {{in the area of the}} Dogger Bank. On 25 August, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Baltic to bombard Russian positions again, this time on the island of Dagö, including the lighthouse in St. Andreasberg and the signal station on Cap Ristna. On 1112 May, Regensburg participated in another mine-laying operation, this time off Texel. In September, she took part in anti-shipping sweeps in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. In early 1916, she continued supporting mine-laying operations and reconnaissance sweeps into the North Sea. On 2324 April, she participated in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, conducted by the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group.|$|E

25|$|After that {{excellent}} build-up, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as favourite {{to win the}} 400 m gold medal. After {{finishing a}} comfortable second in her 400 m heat (53.00), she won her semi-final in a personal best 52.56. In the final itself on 16 October, she only took the lead about 100 m from the finish and maintained her advantage well down the home straight. She looked certain to win but was caught just before the line by Colette Besson of France and beaten into second place by a mere 0.09 seconds. Setting a new UK record of 52.12 had not quite been enough to win gold. Nevertheless, it was an excellent effort by a 19-year-old competing in her first Olympics.|$|E

In the semifinals, she defeated Li Na in straight sets. In the gold medal match, Safina lost to Dementieva in three sets while serving 23 double faults. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> US Open as one of five women who could have taken the world No. 1 ranking, depending on their results in this tournament.
