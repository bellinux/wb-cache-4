25|$|The short dance merges the set {{pattern of}} a {{compulsory}} dance (renamed {{at the same}} time of this ruling to the pattern dance), and the previous rules of the original dance, i.e. requiring a set rhythm but allowing choreographic freedom within the constraints of required elements. In addition to skating two patterns, dancers also must include a <b>step</b> <b>sequence,</b> a set of twizzles, and a lift. Competitors are allowed to choose their own music, so long as it fits the required rhythm/theme.|$|E
25|$|At the 2010 U.S. Championships, Rippon {{finished}} 5th {{overall after}} ranking 4th in both segments. He had a fall on his <b>step</b> <b>sequence</b> {{in the short}} program. Following the event, he was named as a second alternate for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 World Championships, and assigned to the 2010 Four Continents Championships. At Four Continents, he placed 7th in the short program and first in the free skate, winning the gold medal. He {{was included in the}} U.S. team to Worlds after other skaters withdrew; he placed 7th in the short program, 5th in the free skate, and 6th overall.|$|E
25|$|Asada {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season at the}} 2011 NHK Trophy. She placed third in the short program with 58.32 points and first in the free skating, garnering a total of 184.45 points and the silver medal, 1.79 behind Akiko Suzuki. At the 2011 Cup of Russia, Asada placed first in the short program with 64.29 points. She earned a level four on her {{straight}} line <b>step</b> <b>sequence</b> with +1.30 GOE. She won the event and qualified for the 2011–12 Grand Prix Final. She withdrew from the Final due to her mother's serious illness. Her mother died of liver cirrhosis in Nagoya Hospital while Asada was flying back to Japan.|$|E

25|$|At the 2015 Skate Canada International, {{he placed}} {{sixth in the}} short program with the score of 73.25 points after invalidating his popped quadruple toe loop into a double and {{breaking}} the Zayak Rule by executing a triple lutz-double toe loop instead of a planned triple lutz-triple toe loop. He also received a level three for his <b>step</b> <b>sequence.</b> In the free skating, he pulled up to second with a score of 186.29, about 4 points behind Patrick Chan, after executing three quadruple jumps including the quadruple Salchow and toe loop in the first half, and the quadruple toe loop-double toe loop. He finished second overall behind Patrick Chan and above Daisuke Murakami with a total score of 259.54.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{personal}} best (PB) scores, i.e. the highest scores a skater or couple has achieved over their entire career, {{in terms of}} combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU modifies requirements and rules between seasons. In different seasons, there may be different requirements to achieve a certain level or different elements may be required. New elements may become allowed (for example, two quads in the short program were permitted starting in the 2010–11 season). There may be a change in point values. For example, the values of quads were increased after the 2010 Olympics and a second <b>step</b> <b>sequence</b> in men is no longer assigned a level. As a result, the ISU now places more weight on SB.|$|E

5000|$|A twizzle is a multirotational one-foot turn {{in figure}} skating.

Pairs do 4 lifts, 4 jumps, 3 spins(including 1 death spiral), 1 <b>step</b> <b>sequence,</b> and 1 spiral sequence. Men do 8 jumps, 3 spins, 1 <b>step</b> <b>sequence,</b> and 1 choreographic <b>step</b> <b>sequence.</b> Ladies do 7 jumps, 3 spins, 1 <b>step</b> <b>sequence</b> and 1 spiral sequence.
