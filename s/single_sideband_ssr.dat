5000|$|An {{input signal}} causes the first disc to {{mechanically}} resonate {{at a very}} precise and stable frequency, which passes an induced electrical oscillation to the next disc, and in turn sequentially through the device. By filtering out unnecessary portions of the radio signal, the mechanical filter (a kind of [...] "bandpass filter") allows {{the use of a}} very stable, precise <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> frequency. (Previously, <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> operation required a large, complex piece of equipment.) The mechanical filter was the heart of Collins <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> (SSB) technology, and made SSB practical for the first time. SSB offered clear, efficient radio communications, even during conditions that would disrupt and distort conventional radio signals.|$|R

Three transmitter designs of varying electrical and optical complexity {{are used for}} optical <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> (OSSB) transmission and the theory behind each design is discussed.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} demonstration of op-tical <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> (SSB) modulation using a directly modulated semiconductor laser under strong optical injection-locking. Mod-ulation sidebands with 15 -dB power ratio between the lower and upper sidebands have been achieved. The longer wavelength side-band is resonantly amplified by the injection-locked laser cavity mode. The radio-frequency performance of the optical SSB after 80 -km fiber transmission is significantly improved compared with a typical symmetric sideband modulation of a free-running laser. A 622 -Mb/s data transmission on a 20 -GHz subcarrier is demon-strated over an 80 -km fiber link.
