There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to <b>shop</b> <b>or</b> use the small shopping area at the junction of Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents.
