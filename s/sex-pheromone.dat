50|$|M. histrionica males contain 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol, a {{pheromone}} {{more commonly}} known as murgantinol. The stereoisomers of male harlequin bug pheromones consists of two compounds: tridecane and murgantinol. These substances, found specifically in male pheromones, are responsible for aggregation of the insects to aid in sexual reproduction and {{can also be used}} in warning predators. A study conducted by Zahn et al. (2008) found that mature male insects produced pheromones that recruited females, other males and young insects based on attractiveness. For females, the pheromone is used as a <b>sex-pheromone</b> to attract mates. Other males use a different version of this pheromone to aggregate more males to a given area to signal the availability of food and it serves a similar purpose with nymphs. Nymphs use the pheromone to guide themselves to the food source in starving conditions.|$|E
40|$|In the <b>sex-pheromone</b> {{communication}} systems of moths, odorant receptor (Or) specificity {{as well as}} higher olfactory information processing in males should be finely tuned to the pheromone of conspecific females. Accordingly, male <b>sex-pheromone</b> preference should have diversified along with the diversification of female sex pheromones; however, the genetic mechanisms that facilitated the diversification of male preference are not well understood. Here, we explored the mechanisms involved in a drastic shift in <b>sex-pheromone</b> preference in the silkmoth Bombyx mori using spli mutants in which the genomic structure of the gene Bmacj 6, which encodes a class IV POU domain transcription factor, is disrupted or its expression is repressed. B. mori females secrete an ∼ 11 : 1 mixture of bombykol and bombykal. Bombykol alone elicits full male courtship behavior, whereas bombykal alone shows no apparent activity. In the spli mutants, the behavioral responsiveness of males to bombykol was markedly reduced, whereas bombykal alone evoked full courtship behavior. The reduced response of spli males to bombykol was explained by the paucity of bombykol receptors on the male antennae. It was also found that, in the spli males, neurons projecting into the toroid, a compartment in the brain where bombykol receptor neurons normally project, responded strongly to bombykal. The present study highlights a POU domain transcription factor, Bmacj 6, which may have caused a shift of <b>sex-pheromone</b> preference in B. mori through Or gene choice and/or axon targeting...|$|E

Males initiate mating by creating leks, where they release sexual pheromones to attract females. The main goal of this diploma thesis was to determine the influence of host plants on the composition of male <b>sex-pheromones</b> C. capitata and to compare emanations of wild males with those originating from laboratory population. We studied the chemical composition of volatiles, released by calling males C. capitata from laboratory and two wild populations, using two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometric detection (GC×GC-TOFMS), gas chromatography with electroantennographic and flame ionization detection (GC-EAD-FID). All data were statistically analyzed by multivariate data analyses. Significant differences were observed in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the chemical emanations among males from the three populations.

40|$|Leaf-cutting ants are {{evolutionary}} derived social insects with elaborated {{division of}} labor and tremendous colony sizes with millions of workers. Their social organization is mainly based on olfactory communication using different pheromones and is promoted by a pronounced size-polymorphism of workers that perform different tasks within the colony. The size polymorphism and associated behaviors are correlated to distinct antennal lobe (AL) phenotypes. Two worker phenotypes differ in number of olfactory glomeruli in the AL and {{the presence or absence}} of an extremely large glomerulus (macroglomerulus), involved in trail-pheromone reception. The males ' AL contains three macroglomeruli which are presumably involved in detection of <b>sex-pheromone</b> components. We investigated the antennal transcriptome data of all major castes (males, queens and workers) and two worker subcastes (large and tiny workers). In order to identify putative odorant receptor genes involved in pheromone detection, we identified differentially expressed odorant receptor genes (OR-genes) using custom microarrays.

Using chemotaxis assays, we demonstrate that females secrete a potent sex pheromone that attracts males from a distance, whereas hermaphrodites do not. The female sex pheromone is not species-specific, with males of all four species attracted to both the C. remanei and Caenorhabditis sp. female sex pheromones.

In task 1, andro lengthened the time females took to classify voices as attractive or unattractive, and the time fertile females took to classify (especially male) faces as attractive or unattractive. In task 2, andro increased females’ attractiveness and sex-typicality ratings of faces, effects that were limited to fertile females for voices. These findings provide support for the sex-specificity of andro’s effects in a relevant social evaluation context, and highlight the role of menstrual cycle phase in regulating women’s responses to the steroid. The <b>sex-pheromone</b> property of the compound remains unclear, however, since andro-induced attractiveness enhancement was not specific to male stimuli.

40|$|A great {{diversity}} of pheromone structures {{are used by}} moth species (Insecta: Lepidoptera) for long-distance mating signals. The signal/response channel seems to be narrow for each species, and a major conundrum is how signal divergence {{has occurred in the}} face of strong selection pressures against small changes in the signal. Observations of various closely related and morphologically similar species that use pheromone components biosynthesized by different enzymes and biosynthetic routes underscore the question as to how major jumps in the biosynthetic routes could have evolved with a mate recognition system that is based on responses to a specific blend of chemicals. Research on the desaturases used in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway for various moth species has revealed that one way to make a major shift in the pheromone blend is by activation of a different desaturase from mRNA that already exists in the pheromone gland. Data will be presented to support the hypothesis that this process was used {{in the evolution of the}} Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis species. In that context, moth <b>sex-pheromone</b> desaturase genes seem to be evolving under a birth-and-death process.

40|$|Calling female moths attract {{their mates}} {{late at night}} with {{intermittent}} release of a species-specific <b>sex-pheromone</b> blend. Mean frequency of pheromone filaments encodes distance to the calling female. In their zig-zagging upwind search male moths encounter turbulent pheromone blend filaments at highly variable concentrations and frequencies. The male moth antennae are delicately designed to detect and distinguish even traces of these sex pheromones amongst the abundance of other odors. Its olfactory receptor neurons sense even single pheromone molecules and track intermittent pheromone filaments of highly variable frequencies up to about 30 [*]Hz over a wide concentration range. In the hawkmoth Manduca sexta brief, weak pheromone stimuli as encountered during flight are detected via a metabotropic PLCβ-dependent signal transduction cascade which leads to transient changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations. Strong or long pheromone stimuli, which are possibly perceived {{in direct contact with}} the female, activate receptor-guanylyl cyclases causing long-term adaptation. In addition, depending on endogenous rhythms of the moth's physiological state, hormones such as the stress hormone octopamine modulate second messenger levels in sensory neurons. High octopamine levels during the activity phase maximize temporal resolution cAMP-dependently as a prerequisite to mate location. Thus, I suggest that sliding adjustment of odor response threshold and kinetics is based upon relative concentration ratios of intracellular Ca 2 + and cyclic nucleotide levels which gate different ion channels synergistically. In addition, I propose a new hypothesis for the cyclic nucleotide-dependent ion channel formed by insect olfactory receptor/coreceptor complexes. Instead of being employed for an ionotropic mechanism of odor detection it is proposed to control subthreshold membrane potential oscillation of sensory neurons, as a basis for temporal encoding of odors...|$|E

40|$|In drug discovery, it {{is common}} to have {{measured}} activity data for a set of compounds acting upon a particular protein but not to have knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the protein active site. In the absence of such three-dimensional information, one can attempt to build a hypothetical model of the receptor site that can provide insight about receptor-site characteristics. Such an analysis is known as a molecular-field analysis (MFA), which provides compact and quantitative descriptors which capture three-dimensional information about a putative receptor site. Several compounds were tested for inhibitory specificity using a modified radiochemical bioassay to monitor de novo pheromone production in Plodia interpunctella. All computational experiments were conducted with Cerius 2 3. 8 quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) environment on a Silicon Graphics O 2, running under the IRIX 6. 5 operating system. Multiple conformations of each molecule were generated using the Boltzmann jump as a conformational search method. An MFA was generated from the 28 agonists for tyramine (TA) receptor which inhibited <b>sex-pheromone</b> production in P. interpunctella. 2 -(Substituted benzylthio) - 2 -oxazoline (SBO) 2 had the highest potency, followed by SBO derivative 6 and 3, substituted with 3 -CH 3, 4 -CH 3, and 3 -CF 3, respectively, in inhibition of de novo pheromone production. The predictive character of the QSAR was further assessed using 4 agonists for TA receptor as test molecules. The result may imply that the process of calculating an MFA treats the structures reasonably. The MFA could provide useful information in the characterization and differentiation of TA receptor. It may help to point the way towards developing extremely potent and relatively specific TA ligands, leading to potential insecticides, although further research on the comparison of the 3 D QSAR is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of Pandemis pyrusana (Kearfott) were studied in 60 contiguous orchard blocks (154 hectares) of mixed fruit production {{situated in the}} Yakima Valley, Washington, Grids of sex-pheromone-baited and liquid-food-baited traps were placed {{at a rate of}} one trap of each type per 2 hectares, Trees within 50 m of each trapping location were sampled for overwintering and summer generation larvae, and fruit injury prior to harvest. Larvae from both generations were found in a low proportion of apple (Malus domestica Borkh,), pear (Pyrus communis L.), and cherry (Prllnlls avium L.) orchards, but not in the peach/nectarine (Prunlls persica (L.)), apricot (Prllnlls armeniaca L,), or prune (Prunus domestica L.) orchards, Larval densities between generations increased 5 -fold in apple and la-fold in cherry and non-bearing apple, Parasitism of field-collected larvae by tachinid parasitoids averaged 37 % and 23 % for each generation, respectively. Low levels of fruit injury « 0, 5 %) by P. pyrusana were detected in only five apple and pear orchards. Cumulative moth catch was la-fold higher in <b>sex-pheromone</b> than food-baited traps. Moth catch in both types of traps varied significantly among crops, In general, moth catches were highest in apple and cherry, Cumulative moth catch in both trap types in apple and pear during the first flight was weakly correlated with levels of fruit injury, In contrast, moth catch during the second flight was not correlated with fruit injury, The observed low predictive ability oftraps was likely due to trap saturation and contamination with non-target moths and a general dispersal of moths among orchards throughout the region. The capture offemale moths versus the total of both sexes caught in food bait traps did not improve the prediction of fruit injury in apple or pear.

40|$|Sex pheromones {{produced}} by female moths of the Lasiocampidae family include conjugated 5, 7 -dodecadiene components with various oxygenated terminal groups. Here {{we describe the}} molecular cloning, heterologous expression and functional characterization of desaturases associated with the biosynthesis of these unusual chemicals. By homology-based PCR screening we characterized five cDNAs from the female moth pheromone gland that were related to other moth desaturases, and investigated {{their role in the}} production of the (Z) - 5 -dodecenol and (Z 5,E 7) -dodecadienol, major pheromone constituents of the pine caterpillar moth, Dendrolimus punctatus. Functional expression of two desaturase cDNAs belonging to the Delta 11 -subfamily, Dpu-Delta 11 (1) -APSQ and Dpu-Delta 11 (2) -LPAE, showed that they catalysed the formation of unsaturated fatty acyls (UFAs) that can be chain-shortened by beta-oxidation and subsequently reduced to the alcohol components. A first (Z) - 11 -desaturation step is performed by Dpu-Delta 11 (2) -LPAE on stearic acid that leads to (Z) - 11 -octadecenoic acyl, which is subsequently chain shortened to the (Z) - 5 -dodecenoic acyl precursor. The Dpu-Delta 11 (1) -APSQ desaturase had the unusual property of producing Delta 8 mono-UFA of various chain lengths, but not when transformed yeast were grown in presence of (Z) - 9 -hexadecenoic acyl, in which case the biosynthetic intermediate (Z 9,E 11) -hexadecadienoic UFA was produced. In addition to a typical Z 9 activity, a third transcript, Dpu-Delta 9 -KPSE produced E 9 mono-UFAs of various chain lengths. When provided with the (Z) - 7 -tetradecenoic acyl, it formed the (Z 7,E 9) -tetradecadienoic UFA, another biosynthetic intermediate that can be chain-shortened to (Z 5,E 7) -dodecadienoic acyl. Both Dpu-Delta 11 (1) -APSQ and Dpu-Delta 9 -KPSE thus exhibited desaturase activities consistent with the biosynthesis of the dienoic precursor. The combined action of three desaturases in generating a dienoic <b>sex-pheromone</b> component emphasizes the diversity and complexity of chemical reactions that can be catalysed by pheromone biosynthetic fatty-acyl-CoA desaturases in moths...|$|E
40|$|Pheromones are {{intraspecific}} chemical signals {{serving as}} a ubiquitous form of communication, particularly among insects. Female <b>sex-pheromone</b> signals act as the core constituent in the specialized odour-mediated moth mate-recognition system. Female moths typically release multicomponent mixtures of alcohols, aldehydes or acetates. The biosynthetic machinery controlling pheromone production comprises a handful of enzymes, yet the combination assortment generates a remarkable variety of compounds. Pheromone specificity is {{closely associated with the}} evolution of reproductive isolation and the divergence of moth species. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular, genetic and phylogenetic tools, I have attempted to discern how pheromone biosynthesis is achieved at the molecular level, how the chemical and structural variation arose and what the proximate genetic transitions that underlie phenotypic novelties are. A special regard was given to (i) characterizing fatty-acyl-CoA desaturase and reductase pheromone gland cDNA transcripts; (ii) setting up a yeast-based heterologous expression system capable of handling expression of both types of enzymes; (iii) determining the enzymes functions; (iv) reconstructing biosynthetic pathways; (v) inferring the genes’ evolutionary histories; and (vi) linking structural genetic changes to protein functionality. Insights from studies of a primitive Prodoxidae species uncovered that a gene duplication gave rise to a Lepidoptera-specific ∆ 11 -desaturase clade close to the time of divergence between basal and advanced moth families, an event which was certainly favourable to the establishment of the ditrysian pheromone chemistry. Strong empirical data showed that the functional properties of extant ∆ 11 -desaturase orthologues contribute extensively to the remarkable structural diversity found in advanced moth families. I also identified a rare instance of neofunctionalization in an ancestral desaturase lineage and the first ∆ 6 -desaturase functioning in mating communication in insects. I demonstrated that the reduction step in yponomeutids is accounted for by a single reductase (pgFAR), exhibiting a broad range of activity and belonging to a Lepidoptera-specific gene subfamily. pgFARs {{play an important role in}} adjusting the pheromone ratio and are emerging as a pivot of the diversification of moth sexual signals. Finally, a causal mutation responsible for a shift in substrate preference between two Ostrinia spp. pgFARs (Crambidae), was identified, which substantiate the theory that pheromone evolution proceeds through both gradual and abrupt mutational shifts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Moths {{have evolved}} highly {{successful}} mating systems, relying on species-specific mixtures of sex pheromone components for long-distance mate communication. Acyl-CoA desaturases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of these compounds {{and to a}} large extent they account for the great diversity of pheromone structures in Lepidoptera. A novel desaturase gene subfamily that displays Delta 11 catalytic activities has been highlighted to account for most of the unique pheromone signatures of the taxonomically advanced ditrysian species. To assess the mechanisms driving pheromone evolution, information is needed about the signalling machinery of primitive moths. The currant shoot borer, Lampronia capitella, is the sole reported primitive non-ditrysian moth known to use unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as <b>sex-pheromone.</b> By combining biochemical and molecular approaches we elucidated the biosynthesis paths of its main pheromone component, the (Z,Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadien- 1 -ol and bring new insights into the time point of the recruitment of the key Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily in moth pheromone biosynthesis. Results: The reconstructed evolutionary tree of desaturases evidenced two ditrysian-specific lineages (the Delta 11 and Delta 9 (18 C> 16 C)) to have orthologs in the primitive moth L. capitella despite being absent in Diptera and other insect genomes. Four acyl-CoA desaturase cDNAs were isolated from the pheromone gland, three of which are related to Delta 9 -desaturases whereas the fourth cDNA clusters with Delta 11 -desaturases. We demonstrated that this transcript (Lca-KPVQ) exclusively accounts for both steps of desaturation involved in pheromone biosynthesis. This enzyme possesses a Z 11 -desaturase activity that allows transforming the palmitate precursor (C 16 : 0) into (Z) - 11 -hexadecenoic acid and the (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoic acid into the conjugated intermediate (Z, Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienoic acid. Conclusion: The involvement of a single Z 11 -desaturase in pheromone biosynthesis of a non-ditrysian moth species, supports that the duplication event leading to the origin of the Lepidoptera-specific Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily took place before radiation of ditrysian moths and their divergence from other heteroneuran lineages. Our findings uncover that this novel class of enzymes affords complex combinations of unique unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties of variable chain-lengths, regio- and stereo-specificities since early in moth history and contributes a notable innovation in the early evolution of moth-pheromones...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of sex pheromone-mediated signals {{is essential for}} goldfish reproduction. However, the neural pathways underlying this reproductive signalling pathway in the goldfish brain is not well described. Lesioning experiments have shown previously that two brain areas, the preoptic area (POA) and the ventral telencephali pars ventralis (Vv) in particular, are important for reproduction. We used patch clamp electrophysiology to study the electrical activities of POA and Vv neurons. Based on the intrinsic properties of these neurons, we suggest there are five different functional classes of POA neurons and a single class of Vv neurons. In addition, by electrically stimulating the olfactory bulb (OB), {{we were able to}} show that this primary sensory structure makes monosynaptic glutamatergic connections with both POA and Vv neurons. While electrophysiology measures signalling events occurring at short time scales on the order of milliseconds to minutes, we were also interested in studying sex pheromone signalling in the goldfish brain over a long time scale. Thus, we describe changes in gene expression in male goldfish exposed to waterborne sex pheromones (17 alpha, 20 beta dihydroxy- 4 -pregene- 3 -one and Prostaglandin-F 2 alpha) over 6 hours. We perform cDNA microarrays on Prostaglandin-F 2 alpha-treated fish to study the rapid modulation of transcription and define the signalling pathways affected. Our microarrays showed that 71 genes were differentially regulated (67 up and 4 down). Through gene ontology enrichment analysis, we found that these genes were involved in various biological processes such as RNA processing, neurotransmission, neuronal development, apoptosis, cellular metabolism and sexual reproduction. RT-PCRs were performed to validate our microarrays and to facilitate direct comparisons {{of the effects of the}} two sex pheromones, 17 alpha, 20 beta dihydroxy- 4 -pregene- 3 -one and Prostaglandin-F 2 alpha. By combining electrophysiology and gene expression analyses, we were able to study <b>sex-pheromone</b> signalling on two different time scales. One short, occurring on the order of milliseconds to minutes, that involves electrical activities in the brain through the glutamatergic amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors; and the other long occurring several hours later that involves changes in the gene expression levels of calmodulin and ependymin among other genes underlying neuroplasticity. Reproductive neuroplasticity in the goldfish may therefore require the activation of glutamatergic receptors which then activate downstream signals like calmodulin and ependymin to transform the sex pheromones-mediate signal into gene expression...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), {{is a major}} pest of Brassica {{crops in}} many parts of the world. Because of its ability to develop {{resistance}} to virtually all major groups of insecticides, including Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt), much attention has therefore been given to biological control using parasitoids. South Africa has an abundance of parasitoids attacking this pest. Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is the most abundant larval parasitoid of P. xylostella in South Africa. In East Africa, its role in biological control of P. xylostella is insignificant, and the most abundant parasitoid there is Diadegma mollipla (Holmgren) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a larvalpupal parasitoid. In South Africa, however, D. mollipla is out-competed by C. plutellae. Total parasitism of P. xylostella in East Africa rarely exceeds 15 %, therefore there is a need to introduce more effective and heat-tolerant parasitoids of P. xylostella to that region. This study was therefore initiated to examine the potential of C. plutellae and D. mollipla as biological control agents by studying certain aspects of their biology in the laboratory, as well as the suitability of C. plutellae for introduction into East Africa. Biological aspects studied were: (i) host instar preference, fecundity, and searching efficiency of C. plutellae and D. mollipla at different host and parasitoid densities; (ii) effects of temperature on parasitism of P. xylostella by C. plutellae and D. mollipla, and on their rates of development and emergence. In addition, the role of parasitoids in controlling P. xylostella on unsprayed cabbage plots was investigated. Both C. plutellae and D. mollipla preferred to attack second and third instar hosts than fourth instars in choice and no-choice tests. However, D. mollipla attacked more fourth instar hosts than C. plutellae. Cotesia plutellae laid mainly female eggs in second and third instar hosts than in fourth instars, whereas D. mollipla laid more female eggs in fourth instar hosts than in second and third instar hosts. Diadegma mollipla was more fecund [82. 57 ± 32. 87, (mean ± s. d.) than C. plutellae (42. 13 ± 12. 2), and was long lived (7. 13 ± 3. 69 days) compared to the latter (5. 23 ± 2. 7 days). An increase in host density resulted in the reduction in the area of discovery (a) and the killing power (K) for both parasitoids. No significant differences were detected between the searching efficiency (t = - 1. 42 NS, d. f. = 48, P < 0. 001) of the two parasitoids. An increase in parasitoid density also resulted in a decline in searching efficiency, but not the killing power, of both parasitoids. Cotesia plutellae completed development at all temperatures tested (21 - 33 °C), whereas D. mollipla completed development at temperatures from 18 - 30 °C, and C. plutellae had a lower threshold for development (8. 14 °C) compared to D. mollipla (10. 23 °C). At all tested temperatures, the generation time for C. plutellae was shorter compared to D. mollipla. The possible reasons for the dominance of C. plutellae over D. mollipla in the field are: shorter generation time, high production of female progeny in younger hosts, low interference among searching females, and relatively wide thermal tolerance. The role of parasitoids in regulating diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), populations was studied for two years (February 2000 -January 2002) on unsprayed cabbage fields at Brits, North West Province, South Africa. Cabbage seedlings were transplanted in three consecutive times each year. Cabbage infestations by P. xylostella larvae and pupae, and their parasitoids, were monitored at weekly intervals. The flight activity of P. xylostella male moths was monitored using <b>sex-pheromone</b> traps. Trap catches indicated that the moths were active throughout the year. The flight activity of the moths corresponded with infestations on the crop. Trap catches and infestation levels were generally low from December to August and high from September to November. Eight hymenopteran parasitoids were reared: the larval parasitoids Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) (Braconidae) and Apanteles halfordi (Ullyett) (Braconidae); the larval-pupal parasitoids Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Eulophidae) and Diadegma mollipla (Holmgren) (Ichneumonidae); the pupal parasitoid Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Ichneumonidae); and the hyperparasitoids Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), Mesochorus sp. (Ichneumonidae), and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae). Cotesia plutellae was the most abundant parasitoid of P. xylostella followed by O. sokolowskii, D. collaris, A. halfordi and D. mollipla. Parasitism of P. xylostella larvae was high reaching 100 % on several occasions during late spring to end of autumn (November-May) each year. Parasitism was lower (< 50 %) in winter and early spring (June-September). Apanteles halfordi was absent in winter but re-appeared in spring. Parasitism of P. xylostella pupae by D. collaris was high only during spring (September-October). Hyperparasitism was generally low except when primary parasitoids were abundant in spring (September-November) and summer (December-February) when up to 25 % of P. xylostella larvae and C. plutellae cocoons yielded hyperparasitoids. The role of other biotic and abiotic mortality factors on the population dynamics of P. xylostella is discussed...|$|E
