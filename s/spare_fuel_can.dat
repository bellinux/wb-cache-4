50|$|It {{is always}} good to have <b>spare</b> <b>fuel</b> {{stations}} on hand. If a player runs out of fuel after landing on a planet that has no <b>fuel</b> station, he <b>can</b> force the sale of the property, build a fuel station, and replenish his fuel tank.|$|R

The second version of this robotic monster was destroyed by the Super Zeozords 1 and 2.|$|R
5000|$|Sheikh Ruslan-Al-Sulaah, {{played by}} Keith Stevenson, is an Arabian sheikh. He is an oil magnate and quite rich, and wears the white robe and typical sheikh headgear. He has many cars {{and he is}} so rich that even the {{jerrycan}} for keeping <b>spare</b> <b>fuel</b> in the car is made of gold. His Hindi is worst in the class, while his last name [...] "Sulaah" [...] was often heard as [...] "Salaa" [...] which is a derogatory remark in Hindi.|$|R
50|$|The outback is criss-crossed by {{historic}} tracks. Most of {{the major}} highways have an excellent bitumen surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads. Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and <b>spare</b> <b>fuel,</b> tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken. Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious - {{it is recommended that}} drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray onto roads. Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season (November to April), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so <b>spare</b> <b>fuel</b> must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. In addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as Road Trains) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by over 46 tyres.|$|R
25|$|Nadon is an aluminum, catamaran-hulled, {{high-speed}} patrol vessel. To {{make the}} voyage possible, she was escorted {{and supported by}} the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Simon Fraser. The Coast Guard vessel was chartered by the Voyage of Rediscovery and crewed by volunteers. Throughout the voyage, she provided a variety of necessary services, including provisions and <b>spares,</b> <b>fuel</b> and water, helicopter facilities, and ice escort; she also conducted oceanographic research during the voyage. The Voyage of Rediscovery was completed in five and a half months, with Nadon reaching Vancouver on December 16, 2000.|$|R
5000|$|Greater fuel {{efficiency}} (low cost of transportation) - It {{is estimated that}} 1 liter of <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> move 105 ton-km by inland water transport. Whereas {{the same amount of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> move only 85 ton-km by rail and 24 ton-km by road. By air, it is even less.|$|R

50|$|In the Verizon IndyCar Series, a {{pit stop}} {{is a more}} complex {{operation}} than in NASCAR, but far less so than in Formula One. Rules permit six mechanics over the pit wall during a stop. The pit rules and procedures have origins in USAC National Championship racing. The <b>spare</b> <b>fuel</b> for IndyCar competition is stored in large pitside fuel tanks. Each team's tank is filled to a specified volume of fuel, depending upon the race distance. Teams are also given a certain allotment of spare tires sets, likewise owing to the race distance. All of the spare tires are pre-mounted on wheels before the race.|$|R

It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.|$|R

25|$|Scott {{also had}} to fight with a {{shortage}} of fuel due to leakage from stored <b>fuel</b> <b>cans</b> which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his <b>fuel</b> <b>cans</b> soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the decisive}} victory by Commonwealth forces at El Alamein, the C.200 {{provided}} {{cover for the}} retreating Axis forces, strafing advancing Allied columns and light vehicles. However, operations of the type in the theatre were curtailed around this time by increasing shortages of <b>spares,</b> <b>fuel</b> and components; losses {{in the face of}} numerically superior Allied air power also {{played a role in the}} rapid decline of deployable C.200s. During January 1943, many Italian aerial units were withdrawn from North Africa, leaving only a single unit operating the type. Bomb-carrying C.200s were amongst those aircraft used during Axis attempts to resist the Allied occupation of the island of Pantelleria. However, early 1943 marked the end of the C.200's viability as an effective front-line fighter.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the appeal}} of the game lies in the control of these {{auxiliary}} vehicles. The player can, if desired, have all four Mantas and all four Walruses out of the carrier at once, and can pilot each personally, or program each to travel to a specific location (none of the vehicles can be programmed to perform attack or defence functions). Once arrived, a Walrus will simply wait. A Manta will adopt a circular holding pattern until it runs out of fuel, at which point it will crash into the ground or sea and be lost. Some islands have runways on which Mantas may be landed and refuelled. A Walrus which has run out of fuel may be refuelled by another Walrus carrying a <b>spare</b> <b>fuel</b> pod.|$|R
50|$|The nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> swell during use, this {{is because}} of effects such as fission gas {{formation}} in the fuel and the damage which occurs to the lattice of the solid. The fission gases accumulate in the void that forms {{in the center of a}} fuel pellet as burnup increases. As the void forms, the once-cylindrical pellet degrades into pieces. The swelling of the <b>fuel</b> pellet <b>can</b> cause pellet-cladding interaction when it thermally expands to the inside of the cladding tubing. The swollen fuel pellet imposes mechanical stresses upon the cladding. A document on the subject of the swelling of the <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> be downloaded from the NASA web site.|$|R

25|$|Water in <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> damage a <b>fuel</b> {{injection}} pump; some {{diesel fuel}} filters also trap water. Water contamination in diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>can</b> lead to freezing {{while in the}} fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling {{is more likely to}} occur. When the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state.|$|R
