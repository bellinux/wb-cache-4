5000|$|The second {{postulate}} of Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity {{states that the}} speed of light is invariant, regardless of the velocity of the source from which the light emanates. The extinction theorem (essentially) states that light passing through a transparent medium is simultaneously extinguished and re-emitted by the medium itself. This implies that information about the velocity of light from a moving source might be lost if the light passes through enough intervening transparent material before being measured. All measurements previous to the 1960s intending to verify the constancy of {{the speed of light}} from moving sources (primarily using moving mirrors, or extraterrestrial sources) were made only after the light had passed through such <b>stationary</b> <b>material</b> — that material being that of a glass lens, the terrestrial atmosphere, or even the incomplete vacuum of deep space. In 1961, Fox decided that there might not yet be any conclusive evidence for the second postulate: [...] "This is a surprising situation in which to find ourselves half a century after the inception of special relativity." [...] Regardless, he remained fully confident in special relativity, noting that this created only a [...] "small gap" [...] in the experimental record.|$|E

40|$|Aging in the {{sciatic nerve}} {{of the rat}} is {{characterized}} by various alterations, mainly cytoskeletal impairment, the presence of residual bodies and glycogen deposits, and axonal dystrophies. These alterations could form a mechanical blockade in the axoplasm and disturb the axoplasmic transports. However, morphometric studies on the fiber distribution indicate that the increase of the axoplasmic compartment during aging could obviate this mechanical blockade. Analysis of the axoplasmic transport, using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecular forms as markers, demonstrates {{a reduction in the}} total AChE flow rate, which is entirely accounted for by a significant bidirectional 40 - 60 % decrease in the rapid axonal transport of the G 4 molecular form. However, the slow axoplasmic flow of G 1 + G 2 forms, as well as the rapid transport of the A 12 form of AChE, remain unchanged.

More recently, enthusiasm for polymer high internal phase emulsions (polyHIPEs) in chromatographic separations has grown, primarily due to their large pore sizes (greater than 10 µm), which make polyHIPEs highly permeable and ideal for high flow rate separations. In this study, the applicability of polyHIPE <b>materials</b> as <b>stationary</b> phase <b>materials</b> was investigated and novel methods to increase their surface area explored. A range of different polyHIPEs were prepared using monomers such as Sty, GMA and VBC to impart varying surface functionalities. The first instance of an OTCEC polyHIPE column was demonstrated and applied in a modest separation of alkylbenzenes. Upon development of various polyHIPE materials, {{it was found that}} styrenic polyHIPEs gave an ideal morphology and were most appropriate for HPLC separations compared with VBC and GMA polyHIPEs.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{a number of}} issues associated with the problem of calculating contributions from the electromagnetic quantum induced energy and stress in a <b>stationary</b> <b>material</b> with an inhomogeneous polarizability. After briefly reviewing the conventional approaches developed by Lifshitz el al and more recent attempts by others, we emphasize the need to accommodate the effects due to the classical constitutive properties of the material in any experimental attempt to detect such contributions. Attention is then concentrated on a particular system composed of an ENZ-type (epsilon-near-zero) meta-material, chosen to have an anisotropic and inhomogeneous permittivity confined in an infinitely long perfectly conducting open waveguide. This permits us to deduce from the source-free Maxwell's equations a complete set of harmonic electromagnetic evanescent eigen-modes and eigen-frequencies. Since these solutions prohibit the existence of asymptotic scattering states in the guide an alternative regularization scheme, based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula, enables us to prescribe precise criteria for the extraction of finite quantum expectation values from regularized mode sums together with error bounds on these values. This scheme is used to derive analytic results for regularized energy densities in the guide. The criteria are exploited to construct a numerical scheme that is bench-marked by comparing its output with the analytic results derived from the special properties of the inhomogeneous ENZ medium.

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are large-scale {{natural phenomena}} that consist of suspended sed- iment travelling over an impermeable underlying boundary. We employ a shallow- layer approach to model their dynamics, {{taking advantage of}} the fact that their streamwise length is much larger than their vertical height. We frequently consider flows initiated by the instantaneous release of a finite volume of <b>stationary</b> <b>material,</b> known as a 'dam break' configuration. New complete analytical solutions of dam-break flows into a layer of quiescent fluid, or 'tailwater', are found. The tailwater's presence introduces new phenomena: after sufficient time the front of the flow decelerates and an internal bore develops. A model of polydisperse turbidity current motion is developed in which we con- serve interstitial fluid, momentum and particulate. To integrate our model we con- struct a new numerical scheme that is second-order accurate, simple to apply, shock- capturing and non-oscillatory. The scheme is validated by comparison with existing analytical results and employed in three ways. First, the effect that entrainment of ambient fluid and the gradient of the un- derlying boundary have on particle-driven gravity currents is derived through new scaling relationships. These highlight the role that these processes may have in large- scale geophysical flows and indicate why laboratory investigations at much smaller scales may not have needed to include these effects. The turbidity current formed by a lava dome collapse on the Soufriere Hills volcano, Montserrat in July 2003 is modelled next using no fitting parameters. We employ field data to inform our model and validate the output. Agreement is found for the predicted deposit thickness and aspects of the grain size distribution, thus our model effectively captures the key dynamical processes. Finally, new analytical self-similar solutions to entraining gravity currents on inclined planes are presented. We demonstrate that these are attractive solutions of the governing equations after sufficient time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|An {{environmentally}} sustainable {{production of}} electrical power {{is important for}} preserving the earth’s natural resources.  In order to utilize this power as efficiently as possible, it is of great importance to minimize the losses, for example in sliding electrical contacts. A sliding electrical contact is where current is transferred from one rotating to one stationary component and power is lost due to friction and contact resistance. Also in some signal applications, high performance sliding contacts are crucial to ensure stable signal transfer with low noise. Although sliding electrical contacts are primarily designed for good electrical performance, the system will benefit also from optimization of the tribological properties. The aim of this thesis {{is to increase the}} fundamental knowledge of the tribological and electrical performance of metal-graphite composite materials for sliding electrical contacts. The influence of mechanical and electrical load was investigated. Different stationary materials, from pure copper to nanocomposite coatings, were tested against copper- and silver-graphites. Two complementary test setups were used, one with reciprocating and one with unidirectional sliding. Surface analysis was essential to gain deepened understanding of the influence of the interaction on the surfaces. Especially my novel imaging of cross-sections has advanced the level on knowledge in this research field. On the <b>stationary</b> <b>material</b> surface, a tribofilm forms with constituents from the metal-graphite and the surrounding atmosphere. Cross-sectioning reveals a material flow that indicates turbulence. Furthermore, the presence of oxides in the tribofilm is not necessarily detrimental for the contact resistance {{as long as there is}} also pure metal available. The presence of graphite is vital for low friction and wear. It is shown that the tribological and electrical behaviour of this system is only marginally influenced by the material selection of the stationary contact. Increasing the metal content in the composite, on the other hand, greatly reduces the contact resistance while there is no significant impact on friction and wear. The mechanical load has to be optimized to compromise between low wear (achieved with low load) and low contact resistance (achieved with high load). Pure mechanical tests show a lower friction and higher wear rate in comparison to tests with a five ampere current...|$|E

The filling factor of the ejecta is 1 % or less, and the nova ejecta mass must be less than 10 ⁻⁴ M ☉. A modest fraction of the emission nebulosities vary in brightness by up to a factor of two on timescales of one year. Finally, we present the deepest images yet obtained of a jet-like feature outside the main body of GK Per nebulosity, and the first spectrum of that feature. Dominated by strong, narrow emission lines of [N II], [O II], [O III], and [S II], this feature is probably a shock due to ejected material running into stationary interstellar matter, slowly moving ejecta from a previous nova episode, or circumbinary matter present before 1901. An upper limit to the mass of the jet is of order a few times 10 ⁻⁶ M ☉. If the jet mass is close to this limit then the jet might be an important, or even dominant mass sink from the binary system.
