40|$|Imperfect Personality in Commercial Law Robert Pelikán Abstract In {{the theory}} of law, <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> (the terms "legal person" and "legal personality" are used in this text in their {{continental}} sense, i. e. describing both non-human and human entities and their legal capacity) is usually seen as a simple quality having only values, true or false. The existing theories of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> were, therefore, trying to find such characteristics of <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> which will fully describe all legal persons existing in practice. Such an effort had to fail or, more precisely, the process of search for such a common denominator had to result in the disappearance of all the key characteristics necessary for understanding of the phenomenon of <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The exploration of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> must hence begin with the finding that <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is not a quality having only values - true or false - but rather a full scale of values from nil to a (rarely seen) full <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> moreover appearing in many dimensions. In order to duly explain the phenomenon, the theory must not search for a common denominator of existing persons, but describe the concept of full <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and explain the consequences of imperfection of existing legal persons in any of such qualities.

It discusses the implications of the EU’s <b>single</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and the institutional innovations to enhance the coherence of the EU’s external action in light of the division of EU external powers and competences. It is argued that the ill-defined nature of CFSP competences and the abolition of the hierarchical delimitation rule of former Article 47 (now as amended Art. 40) TEU places the Court of Justice for a nearly impossible task to delineate the boundaries between the different components of EU external action. The potential for inter-institutional conflicts is illustrated with the new rules for the adoption of restrictive measures against individuals.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{qualitative}} analysis of the Lisbon Treaty and its institutional and political implications for the international political identity of the European Union as a global actor. The Lisbon Treaty makes an institutional-political effort for integration of the European foreign policy capacities, followed by installation of the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy institutions. This Treaty also constitutes the <b>single</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of the EU which differs for the EU on the international political scene in relation to others. With {{the integration of the}} EU’s foreign policy capacities and the fusion of the (former) three pillars, the Lisbon Treaty makes some sort of rationalization of the institutions in terms of providing efficient and simplified decision-making, suitable for implementing a coherent foreign policy. Thus, considering the prerogatives and credentials of aforementioned institutions, regarding their contribution to the international political identity of the EU and its decision-making, we conclude that the Lisbon Treaty does not represent a finalité politique of the EU integration process, but just a step towards its achievement...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{simplification}} {{offered by}} the Lisbon Treaty in establishing a single European Union with a <b>single</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and a single set of principles and objectives for the EU’s external action, the structural complexity inherent in the Union system will largely survive. In the process of treaty reform that started with the Laeken Declaration in December 2001 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon, signed in October 2007, the coherence of the Union’s foreign policy {{has been one of}} the recurrent themes. The Laeken Declaration already asked, "how should a more coherent common foreign policy and defence policy be developed?" and raised the issue of foreign policy coherence expressly twice, first in the context of the organisation of Union competence and its relation to that of the Member States and second in the context of institutional and decision-making efficiency. It could be argued from the analysis undertaken here that the innovations the Lisbon Treaty introduces, both structural and institutional, give prominence to rules of delimitation and to the principle of complementarity in both vertical and horizontal dimensions of coherence. Despite the prominence given to the new institutional mechanisms, it could be that the most important element of the Treaty of Lisbon from the perspective of foreign policy coherence is the clear external mandate given to the Union as a whole in both substantive and instrumental terms.

40|$|From the introduction]. Arguing, {{understood}} as reason-giving, is all pervasive in international politics: Negotiating actors give {{reasons for their}} demands at almost any time, regardless of whether talks are con-ducted in public or behind closed doors. And yet, since negotiations have most often been conceived of as processes of bargaining in which actors seek to adjust their behavior through the exchange of threats and incentives, arguments have primarily been treated as rather epiphenomenal to strategic interaction. In this paper we argue that under certain circum-stances arguments affect negotiating actors’ preferences, and subsequently lead to outcomes that are not easily explained in pure bargaining terms. Arguing and bargaining as different modes of interaction, however, are not contending but rather complementing explanations. As a result, {{we have to ask}} which scope conditions are particularly conducive to enabling arguing to prevail in decentralized negotiations and, thus, to affect both process and outcome. In a structured-focused comparison of Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) with the European Convention we aim to unveil institutional factors that induce actors to take validity claims into account and change their preferences accordingly. At the example of negotiations on sim-plification and the <b>single</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of the European Union we seek to demonstrate that the transparency of the debate in conjunction with a higher degree of uncertainty about appro-priate behavior made arguing in the Convention particularly effective...|$|E
40|$|The legal {{personality}} (or capacity) is an attribute that can {{belong to the}} participators in international relations. It divides {{all the members of}} international society into two groups. First of them consists of entities, that enjoy the {{legal personality}} - we describe them as subjects of international law. In this group belong states, intergovernmental organisations (so called IGOs) and a group of various other units, e. g. The Holy See or the Sovereign Order of Malta. The second group is composed from the entities without legal personality under international law. Here we could find wide group of non-governmental organisations and strong supranational corporations. They may possess significant political power and heavily influence deciding of the states and intergovernmental organisations, they may have legal personality under municipal law but they do not enjoy the legal personality under the international public law. The legal personality is defined as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. It means, that the subject under international law can conclude agreements, can enter into diplomatic relations (enjoys so called right of legation), can submit claims and act before international court or judge, has right to enjoy immunities for itself and for its representatives, can become a member of international organisation or become a party of international convention and also has to hold the responsibility for own unlawful actions. International organisations, as a subject of international law, enjoy the legal personality different from the personality of member states. There is no doubt about the legal personality of European Communities. Every of the three charters founding the European Coal and Steal Community, European Community and Euroatom includes explicit provision, that the founded organisation enjoys legal personality. Looking at the Maastricht and as well at the Amsterdam treaty, we cannot find any smilar provision concerning the legal personality of European Union. The issue of whether the Union has legal personality is disputed. The prevailing view is been that it was not the will of the member states to give the Union legal personality. Expert opinion generally maintains that an international organisation such as the European Union doesn't have the legal personality unless its founders confer such personality on it expressly. In contradistinction to the original treaties about Communities the member states in Maastricht treaty did not acknowledged the personality of Union. Article 24 and 38 of the Treaty of the European Union (added by the Treaty of Amsterdam) give the Council of the European Union the capacity to conclude international agreements. But this competence is strictly limited only on areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters and only when it is necessary to implement those titles. The legal effects of such agreement apply only on member states individually and according to the terms and conditions laid down by national law. Regarding this provision the European Union must be seen as a Union of States without legal personality of its own under international public or domestic law, which, when it takes action at international level, does so on the behalf of the member states on not on his own account. The question of legal personality was comprehensively researched by the European Convention. There was created a working group on legal personality. The group examined the matter closely and for the purpose heard the views of a number of experts. In the final report that was brought into open in October 2002 the working group recommended conferring explicit legal personality on the Union. The <b>single</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> according to the opinion of working group, should replace the existing legal personalities. The question of legal personality was one of the "simple" issues discussed by Convention. The working group on legal personality has finished its search quite early (comparing with other working groups) and the final report was established on broad consensus. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>personality</b> is {{generally}} {{understood as the}} capability to be - in traditional anthropomorphic terms - ‘the bearer of legal rights and obligations’. <b>Legal</b> <b>personality</b> is a structuring tool in legal systems, not least that of international law, as it indicates who are the participants. This paper considers the concept of ‘legal personality’ in two different roles, which are mutually constitutive. The concept works as an epistemic tool in theoretical reflections on the workings of international law, {{while at the same}} time it denotes a doctrinal category within the system of international law. Both functions are taken into account, with a concomitant shifting between levels of analysis, and a look also at the actual candidates for international <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> which over time have emerged in different political contexts. The paper discusses a sequence of moments in the development of the form and use of the concept that seem especially significant. These are, with a loose indication of time periods: <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> as a sign for legal existence (17 th century) (part 2); the external aspect of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and its structuring effect (18 th century) (part 3); <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> as the flipside of the reified state (19 th century) (part 4); contestation of anthropomorphic conceptualisation of <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> and challenge of the closed doctrinal category of international legal persons (Interbellum) (part 5); <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> turning from a constitutive to a declaratory legal statement (UN era) (part 6); and the potential impact on the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> concept of post-subject and post-human lines of thought (from the 1990 s) (part 7). While the paper thus gives a diachronical account of the concept of ILP, the identified moments in its development are also continuing and co-existing aspects of the concept. For example, while it is true that an intense concern for the state as the sole legal person in international law came to the fore in the second half of the 19 th century, the central position of the state is also an important element in the contemporary discourse on international <b>legal</b> <b>personality...</b>|$|R
