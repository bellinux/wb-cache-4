This new technology has proved successful in hundreds of pumping applications {{in a wide range of}} services and duties. The reliability and lifetime of mechanical seals are improved by using diamond-coated faces. One such application involved the sealing of large boiler feed and steam generator pumps in power plants. The duty conditions for the pump?s seals can be as high as pressures up to 580 psig (40 bar), <b>shaft</b> <b>RPMs</b> up to 6, 500 and temperatures up to 400 ?F (200 ?C). Consequently, the mechanical seal faces are highly loaded in a fluid with far less than ideal lubricating qualities. It is evident, therefore, that these applications are technologically challenging for mechanical seal manufacturers not only from a tribological perspective, but also from a corrosion viewpoint when the feed water has a low electrical conductivity or is free of impurities.

5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing <b>shaft</b> <b>rpm</b> to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|E

For the surface piercing case I compare my scaling predictions with official APBA OPC kilo records, using a single class record in each case as a baseline for my predictions. One scaling law allows propeller diameter to be predicted from an established baseline where shaft hp and <b>shaft</b> <b>RPM</b> are the variables. The second scaling law accurately predicts the speed loss when the gear ratio is lowered. The third scale-free prediction is inferred from Froude nr. scaling and allows boat speed to be predicted based on shaft hp and weight, given a known baseline in the same class of drag coefficient and submerged depth of boat.

An investigation in full scale and model scale of a ship including propeller and rudder, regarding the effect of changing rudder position on variation of propeller characteristics has been carried out. SHIPFLOW software was utilized to apply Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques in order to compute the flow around the ship hull, propeller and rudder. Lifting line method which is coupled with RANS solver module of SHIPFLOW is used to simulate and also compute the propeller characteristics. Five different longitudinal rudder positions were investigated and compared {{to each other in}} order to determine the optimum longitudinal position of rudder. Furthermore, in model scale, for optimum longitudinal rudder position, one different transverse position of rudder was also evaluated. For computing propeller characteristics, SELFPROPULSION command was applied into computations in order to achieve balance between drag and thrust by adjusting the <b>shaft</b> <b>RPM.</b> In order to evaluate the accuracy of results for these two different scales, computed results for original rudder position in model scale and full scale were compared with test results and predicted results by ITTC 1978 method, respectively.

Consequently, optimum rudder position was determined based on model scale results which are reasonably accurate compared to full scale computed results. The reason which made full scale computation results over predicted can be described regarding to grid resolution at the aft part of ship hull which is not compatible with propeller grids.

40|$|Introduction: In {{conventional}} farming, {{the soil}} and crop are considered uniform in different locations of the farm and the fertilizers are applied according to the average of soil needs with an additional percentage for safety (Loghavi, 2003). Non-essential chemical fertilizers in the field have harmful effects and social, economic and environmental concerns will increase. Many fertilizers go into the surface waters and ground waters and cause poisoning and environmental pollution without being absorbed by the plants. In variable rate technology, the soil fertilizer needs a map of {{all parts of the}} farm which is prepared with the GIS system. This map is uploaded on the computer before variable rate fertilizer machine starts. The computer continually controls the fertilizing rate for each part of the farm using a fertilizing map and global positioning system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to construct and evaluate a map-based variable rate fertilizer system that can be installed on a common fertilizer in Iran to be used as a variable rate system. Materials and methods: In common variable rate fertilizers, the rotational speed change of the distributor shaft is used to apply fertilizers. In this way, a DC motor is assembled on the main shaft of all distributors, which reduces the fertilizing accuracy. The reason for this is that there is no separation for units along the width of the fertilizer. Therefore, we used one DC motor for each distributor and another motor to rotate the agitator in the tank. System Set up: To design and select a suitable engine, the required torque for the rotation distributor shaft was measured by a torque meter and the amount of 2. 1 Nm was acquired for that. With regard to the maximum rate of nitrogen fertilizer for land and tractor speed at the time of fertilizing, the order of 350 kg per hectare and 8 km per hour, the maximum distributor shaft speed and power required to rotate distributor shaft were calculated to be 55 rpm and 6. 9 watts, respectively. The selected motor was rated 27. 5 watts, 24 volts and 7. 5 amperes (Since there were no 6. 9 watts motors in the market, a more powerful motor was selected). According to the gear ratio and motor speed, the speed of the distributor shaft was adjustable in the range of 0 to 65 rpm. To determine the speed and position with respect to the direction, a central encoder (E 50 S 8 - 600 - 6 -L- 5 model manufactured by Autonix Korea) was used on the ground wheel. The encoder had 600 pulses per revolution of the axis. Performance evaluation of the system: Performance evaluation of the system consists of two parts; static and moving tests. In static tests, the purpose was the determination of the fertilizer loss (in grams), due to changes in distributor speed as well as the accuracy of the electromechanical control system according to the command values sent to the device. Results of this part were used for the calibration of the device. In motion tests: In motion tests, the assessment of fertilizer loss was due to values set in a given situation and the accuracy of planted fertilizer in place (delay and acceleration) is reviewed. The delay is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer was placed after the desired location on the ground and the acceleration is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer is placed before the desired location on the ground. Results and discussion: The distributor flow rate on F 0 valve position was measured for different rotation speeds. The correlation (linear regression) between the planted fertilizer and rotation speed of distributor <b>shaft</b> (<b>rpm)</b> were 0. 99 for y= 71. 636 x+ 75. 182. So, it can be deduced that these two parameters have a good linear correlation. The results achieved from diagrams and regression model were used in the programming of the system control unit. Thus, by reading the distributors motor speed, the amount of fertilizer can be calculated and the amount of used fertilizer according to the need of the farm in each part is controlled.

The rotor natural mode frequency of 355 Hz was discerned from the plot of acceleration versus frequency. For nonrotating blades, a blade-tip excitation amplitude of approximately 100 g/A was achieved at the first-bending critical (approximately 144 Hz) and at the first-torsional and second-bending blade modes. A blade-tip displacement of 70 mils was achieved at the first-bending critical by exciting the blades at a forced-excitation phase angle of 908 relative to the vertical plane containing the blades while simultaneously rotating the <b>shaft</b> at 3000 <b>rpm...</b>|$|R
40|$|Performance of a {{two-stroke}} engine is largely dependant on scavenging and trapping efficiency of a designed cylinder and port geometry. A motored test rig built specifically for high speed application {{is designed for}} 2 -stroke spark ignition engine to allow further study and have better understanding of flow mechanism of the engine at high speed condition which will influence trapping and scavenging efficiency. A new concept and design is developed. Current available test rig in University Malaysia Pahang {{is limited to a}} low speed range of maximum of 1480 rpm which is the main constraint to further experiment and understanding. A rigid designed test rig to allow assembly of small {{two-stroke engine}}, gearbox and induction motor and amplify induction motor rotating speed to provide wide RPM output using gearbox to provide a predetermined condition of operating two-stroke cycle engine to allow data acquisition on condition boundary for CFD simulation and experimental data. This new design of motored test rig will have the capability of testing engine at high speed by assembling a gearbox to multiply the speed of driving electric motor <b>shaft</b> of 1480 <b>rpm</b> into transmission input shaft to a maximum speed over 6000 rpm at the transmission output shaft. Under motored condition, pressure transducer is applied and flush mounted at inlet port, scavenge port and cylinder. A crank encoder is used to define the condition to each crank angle of a rotation. As a result, data can be collected over a broader engine speed from data acquisition computer...|$|R
40|$|A proof-of-feasibility {{demonstration}} {{showed that}} high temperature superconductor (HTS) coils {{can be used}} in a high-load, active magnetic bearing in liquid nitrogen. A homopolar radial bearing with commercially wound HTS (Bi 2223) bias and control coils produced over 200 lb (890 N) radial load capacity (measured non-rotating) and supported a <b>shaft</b> to 14000 <b>rpm.</b> The goal was to show that HTS coils can operate stably with ferromagnetic cores in a feedback controlled system at a current density similar to that in Cu in liquid nitrogen. Design compromises permitted use of circular coils with rectangular cross section. Conductor improvements will eventually permit coil shape optimization, higher current density and higher bearing load capacity. The bias coil, wound with non-twisted, multifilament HTS conductor, required negligible power to carry its direct current. The control coils were wound with monofilament HTS sheathed in Ag. These dissipated negligible power for direct current (i. e. for steady radial load components). When an alternating current (AC) was added, the AC component dissipated power which increased rapidly with frequency and quadratically with AC amplitude. In fact at frequencies above about 2 hz, the effective resistance of the control coil conductor actually exceeds that of the silver which is in electrical parallel with the oxide superconductor. This is at least qualitatively understandable in the context of a Bean-type model of flux and current penetration into a Type II superconductor. Fortunately the dynamic currents required for bearing stability are of small amplitude. These results show that while twisted multifilament conductor is not needed for stable levitation, twisted multifilaments will be required to reduce control power for sizable dynamic loads, such as those due to unbalance...|$|R
30|$|Figure  12 {{shows the}} raw data {{collected}} from 30 % watercut test. The plot {{can be divided into}} four zones. The first zone (Zone I) is pre-hydrate formation and mainly involves cooldown and pressure maintenance. The second zone (Zone II) is the hydrate formation and gas addition zone which starts from hydrate formation onset (HFO) and ends when gas is cutoff. The third zone (Zone III) is the stabilization zone during which no gas is added but hydrate formation continues until pressure stabilizes or decreases by less than 25 psi in an hour. The last zone (Zone IV) is speed ramping zone during which rheological data is collected. Data on this plot starts 0.25  h before hydrate formation onset. Data recorded includes pressure (psia), <b>shaft</b> speed (<b>rpm),</b> gas flow rates (ml/min), vessel temperature (°F) and shaft torque (N cm). Data collected from Zone I may be used to correlate the carrier fluid viscosity to parameters such as watercut, gas oil ratio (GOR), temperature and oil API. This work is ongoing at The University of Tulsa. HFO marks the start Zone II. HFO was observed at 42  °F and was accompanied by pressure decrease, temperature increase due to exothermic nature of hydrate formation, and torque increase capturing changes in viscosity. HFO leads to gas consumption from the flow mixtures which results in “dead” oil–water mixture momentarily triggering spikes in torque. This is a transient mass transfer phenomenon and should not be interpreted as viscosity change. The gas flow meter was set to provide gas to the system at a rate up to 1000 ml/min to maintain pressure at 1100 psi. So during cooling gas was added at a low flow rates to compensate for volume shrinkage due to temperature decrease. However, at HFO gas flow rate jumped to the maximum allowable flow rate of 1000 ml/min. This meant that if the gas consumption due hydrate formation was higher that gas flow rate then system pressure would decrease. And when hydrate formation slowed down, system pressure would be maintained at 1100 psi. Data collected in Zone II is useful when modeling the transient behavior or system response during hydrate formation. During zone III, the vessel temperature approached the jacket temperature, vessel pressure decreased to a new value close to 850 psi, and torque stabilized. During this zone, hydrate formation continues. Generally, torque increases due to formation of more hydrates and gas consumption both of which lead to increase in slurry viscosity. Shaft speed ramps are performed in Zone IV. It should be noted that torque responded proportionally to shaft speed changes confirming that the slurry generated in this test were mostly dispersed. Also, the torque observed at 600  rpm at the end of Zone IV was close to the value observed {{at the start of the}} zone suggesting little to no yield stress.|$|R
