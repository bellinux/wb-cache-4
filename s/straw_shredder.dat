40|$|Exposure to {{microbial}} components {{can cause}} respiratory problems. The exposure levels to microbial components at biofuel plants are not known. Therefore, exposure to inhalable air-borne fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, endotoxin and NAGase {{was measured using}} personal and stationary samplers at five Danish biofuel plants in autumn and spring. The personal exposure levels to endotoxin (median = 55 EU m 3), thermophilic actinomycetes (median = 1. 3 · 104 colony forming units (cfu) m 3), total bacteria (median = 48 · 104 cells m 3) and total fungi (median = 21 · 104 spores m 3) were, in general, high at the five biofuel plants. At straw reception areas, higher exposure to most microbial components was found in spring than in autumn. Endotoxin was found in higher concentrations at straw plants than at wood-chip plants, while the opposite was measured for Aspergillus fumigatus. Some tasks were associated with exposures to microorganisms and endotoxins at much higher levels than the suggested occupational exposure limits. For example, people working with a <b>straw</b> <b>shredder</b> for at least 30 min during a working day were exposed to a median endotoxin exposure of 23 775 endotoxin units (EU) m 3. People working with estimating the water content in wood chips and repairing the chips cranes for at least 30 min during a working day were exposed to a median value of A. fumigatus of 6. 7 · 104 cfu m 3 and a median value of fungi of 70 · 104 spores m 3. Con-sequently, this working environment may cause respiratory disorders in the people working at the plant. Differences in exposure levels were seen between the plants and this may partly be due to differences of the process equipment, tasks and the biofuel handled...|$|E
40|$|This {{activity}} {{will introduce}} students to water-induced topsoil erosion and {{different ways to}} control it. Using a stream table (prepared by the teacher), they will vary {{the surface of the}} 'soil', and the height of the table, pour in water, and observe sheet, rill, and gully erosion. They can also investigate the effects of check dams (by plugging gullies with pebbles), observe the results of contour plowing, and test the effectiveness of different types of mulch (<b>straw,</b> <b>shredded</b> paper, pine needles, etc.) in preventing erosion. Instructions for constructing a stream table, a student worksheet, and discussion questions are provided. Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R

30|$|Pure {{substrates}} [cellulose (insoluble fibers of 40  µm in particle size) and xylan (insoluble powder from birchwood)] [Sigma Aldrich (Canada)] {{were used}} in this study. Bedding-uncontaminated fresh manure from dairy cows was collected, transferred into a plastic container, and stored at 4  °C until it was fed to the bioreactors. The wheat <b>straw</b> was <b>shredded</b> (<[*] 0.25  mm) and stored at 20  °C in plastic drum until its use. The substrate’s TS, VS, and COD are given in Table  1.

By the time that Thimble and Thumb in their red jackets were scampering on all fours, helter-skelter, downhill out of the forest, a numberless horde of the Forest-mulgars were frisking and howling round the blaze, and the flames were floating half as high as Glint's great Ukka-tree. They squealed, [...] "Walla, walla!" [...] (water), grinning and gibbering one to another as they came tumbling along; but they {{might just as well}} have called [...] "Moonshine!" [...] for every drop was frozen. Nor would twenty flowing springs and all Assasimmon's slaves have quenched that fire now. And when the Forest-mulgars saw that the Mulla-mulgars had given up hope of putting the fire out, they pelted it with snowballs, and scampered about, gathering up every stick and <b>straw</b> and <b>shred</b> they could find, and did their utmost to keep it in.

40|$|Abstracts: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} find out the possibilities of utilizing Empty fruit bunches (EFB) of palm oil industry solid waste for mushroom cultivation. Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus florida) was grown on paddy straw and Empty fruit bunch with different ratios. Among the different treatments, Empty fruit bunch alone at 100 per cent gave maximum mycelial cover on 7 th day, first yield on 22 nd day and recorded a maximum total yield of 1. 40 kg bag- 1. The protein, moisture and ash contents of the mushroom ranged from 23. 1, 93. 8 and 93. 3 per cent, respectively in different treatments. The total yield of mushroom grown on EFB was higher than the yield on paddy <b>straw.</b> Hence the <b>shredded</b> EFB could be a best alternative substrate for mushroom cultivation...|$|R

The dried shredded mushroom which was used as P. ostreatus spawn source {{is a product of}} mushroom production at the same unit. The dried mushroom fruit was placed in shredding machine before soaking in clean water to 50 % moisture content for the field trial. The wheat straw substrate was hammer-milled and soaked in clean water that was mixed with formalin (2 parts water: 1 part formalin) for 24  h to eliminate wild fungus spores and bacteria. The substrate was then squeezed of its excess water to achieve 50 % residual moisture content. The wheat <b>straw</b> substrate and <b>shredded</b> mushroom were then placed in separately sterilized 50 litre plastic containers and transported to the four mine dump sites for the field experiments.|$|R
5000|$|An {{image of}} Narasiṃha {{supposedly}} dating to second-third century AD sculpted at Mathura {{was acquired by}} the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art's Indian curator, as [...] "perhaps the earliest image of Narasiṃha as yet known". This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue similar to later images of Narasiṃha, but the idol's robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasiṃha's chest under his upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Visnu's cognizance, the Kauṣtubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasiṃha's body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The demon's hair streams behind him, cushioning {{his head against the}} man-lion's right knee. He wears a simple single strand of beads. His body seems relaxed, even pliant. His face is calm, with a slight suggestion of a smile. His eyes stare adoringly up at the face of Viṣṇu. There is little tension in this figure's legs or feet, even as Narasiṃha gently disembowels him. His innards spill along his right side. As the Matsya purana describes it, Narasiṃha ripped [...] "apart the mighty Daitya chief as a plaiter of <b>straw</b> mats <b>shreds</b> his reeds". Based on the Gandhara-style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century AD.|$|R
40|$|Many {{alternative}} swine {{production systems}} rely on bedding {{as a key}} component in housing swine. Niche pork market protocols also often require that the pigs are reared in outdoor or bedded housing systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the absorbency of some new or alternative bedding sources compared with common Iowa agricultural bedding sources. Two shredded or ground lumber bedding sources were evaluated. These sources are made from demolition of buildings. One was lumber only and one had drywall or plaster added (8 : 1 ratio). Other bedding sources evaluated were cornstalks, recycled newspaper, oat straw, and triticale straw. Average absorbency was high for cornstalks and oat <b>straw,</b> medium for <b>shredded</b> paper and triticale straw, and low for the two shredded lumber products. Cornstalks or oat straw absorbed about three times their weight in water, shredded paper and triticale straw absorbed about twice their weight in water. The shredded lumber sources absorbed about equal their weight in water...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural straw {{mulching}} is {{a commonly}} used post-fire hillslope erosion control treatment that is aerially applied by helicopter. While widely used and reasonably effective at reducing erosion, agricultural straw is not {{native to the}} forest environment. There is a growing consensus among Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams that mulch made from native forest material would be preferable to agricultural <b>straw.</b> Wood <b>shred</b> mulch made from post-fire road hazard trees is an alternative to agricultural straw. An optimized blend of sizes of wood shreds was effective in reducing sediment yields in both indoor rainfall simulation and outdoor field experiments. Several post-wildfire field experiments showed that wood <b>shreds</b> and agricultural <b>straw</b> were effective in reducing sediment yields {{as compared to the}} controls but neither treatment had an effect on runoff. Erosion reductions from wood shred treatments ranged from 50 - 96 % in these experiments, and the presence and effectiveness of wood shreds appears to outlast both agricultural straw and hydromulch. Wood shreds are denser than agricultural straw and, as a consequence, about 4 times more wood shreds (by weight) than straw are needed to provide the same ground cover in a designated area. As a result, a helicopter with cargo nets required about four to five times as many round trips to treat an acre with wood shreds as with agricultural straw. This made wood shred application take longer and cost more than agricultural straw ($ 1, 500 to $ 2, 000 per acre [$ 3, 750 to $ 5, 000 per ha] and $ 500 per acre [$ 1, 250 per ha], respectively). Field tests using a Heli-Claw, an alternative to a cargo net for heli-mulching, suggest that the Heli-Claw is a viable option for the aerial application of wood shreds. Results from these studies were disseminated through publications and a wide range of presentations, such as webinars, national meetings, and regional specialists meetings; thus, research findings have been directly conveyed to BAER teams and land managers.

6000|$|I {{think it}} will be often well to admit the license of using a {{substantive}} for epithet, (as one says rock-bird or sea-bird, and not 'rocky,' or 'marine,') in Latin as well as in English. We thus greatly increase our power, and assist the brevity of nomenclature; and we gain the convenience of using the second term by itself, when we wish to do so, more naturally. Thus, one may shortly speak of 'The Sagitta' (when one is on a scientific point where 'Swift' would be indecorous!) more easily than one could speak of 'The Stridula,' or 'The Velox,' if we gave the bird either of those epithets. I think this of Sagitta is the most descriptive one could well find; only the reader is always to recollect that arrow-birds must be more heavy in the head or shaft than arrow-weapons, and fly more in the manner of rifle-shot than bow-shot. See Lecture II., §§ 46, 67, 71, in which last paragraph, however, I have to correct the careless statement, that in the sailing flight, without stroke, of the larger falcons, their weight ever acts like the string of a kite. Their weight acts simply as the weight of a kite acts, and no otherwise. (Compare § 65.) The impulsive force in sailing can be given only by the tail feathers, like that of a darting trout by the tail fin. I do not think any excuse necessary for my rejection of the name which seems most to have established itself lately, 'Cypselus Apus,' 'Footless Capsule.' It is not footless, and there is no sense in calling a bird a capsule because it lives in a hole, (which the Swift does not.) The Greeks had a double idea in the word, which it is not the least necessary to keep; and Aristotle's cypselus is not the swift, but the bank-martlet--"they bring up their young in cells made out of clay, long in the entrance." [...] The swift being precisely the one of the Hirundines which does not make its nest of clay, but of miscellaneous <b>straws,</b> threads, and <b>shreds</b> of any adaptable rubbish, which it can snatch from the ground as it stoops on the wing,[26] or pilfer from any half-ruined nests of other birds.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare aktivity and grade work combine {{harvester}} with different threshing system at harvesting a grain and oilseed rape {{in the business of}} agricultural production. Work was focuse on the size harvesting losses, grade grind and spreading crop residues, influence on the moisture of harvested crops on the size losses grade grind and spreading crop residues, throughput combine harvester, analysis of performance and consumption fuel. Work is complete about principal parametr agricultural operations, principal parametr owner machines and simply analysis of operating and investment costs. Although combine harvester didn't work at same land, measurement was done in the most consistent as possible in harvested condition regarding the weather, terrain, etc. From results are clearly that almost all the results achieved best results with a conventional combine harvester threshing mechanism Claas Lexion 580. Exception was only throughput at harvest of winter oilseed rape, which had machine John Deere S 690 with axial threshing of 1. 23 kg ha- 1 higher than Claas Lexion 580. Consumption fuel was lower at harvest of winter wheat with procrastination straw on the line by machine Claas Lwxion 670 with value 11, 0 l. ha- 1.. When <b>shredding</b> <b>straw</b> was reached average values for all combine.

40|$|<b>Shredded</b> <b>straw</b> of Miscanthus was {{composted}} in 800 -L {{boxes with}} different amounts of pig slurry added as nitrogen source. The {{impact of the}} different initial CIN ratios (11, 35, 47, 50, and 54) on the composting process and the end product was evaluated by examining chemical and microbiological parameters during 12 months of composting. Low initial C/N ratios caused a fast degradation of fibers {{during the first three}} months of composting (hemicellulose: 50 - 80 %, cellulose: 40 - 60 %), while high initial C/N ratios resulted in 10 - 20 % degradation of both hemicellulose and cellulose. These differences were reflected in the microbial biomass and respiration, which initially were higher in low C/N treatments than in high C/N treatments. After 12 months of composting, this situation was reversed. Composts with high initial CIN ratios had high microbial biomass (15 - 20 mug ATP g(- 1) OM) and respiration rates (200 mug CO, h(- 1) g(- 1) OM) compared to treatments with low initial C/N ratios (less than 10 mug ATP g(- 1) OM and 25 mug CO 2 h(- 1) g(- 1) OM). This could be explained by the microorganisms being nitrogen limited in the high C/N ratio treatments. In the low C/N ratio treatments, without nitrogen limitation, the high activity in the beginning decreased with time because of exhaustion of easily available carbon. Different nitrogen availability was also seen in the nitrification patterns, since nitrate was only measured in significant amounts in the treatments with initial C/N ratios of 11 and 35. The microbial community structure (measured as phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA, profile) was also affected by the initial C/N ratios, with lower fungal/bacterial ratios in the low compared to the high C/N treatments after 12 months of composting. However, in the low C/N treatments higher levels of PLFAs indicative of thermophilic gram-positive bacteria were found compared to the high C/N treatments. This was caused by the initial heating phase being longer in the low than in the high C/N treatments. The different fungal/bacterial ratios could also be explained by the initial heating phase, since a significant correlation between this ratio and heat generated during the initial composting phase was found...|$|R
