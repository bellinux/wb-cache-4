25|$|Topical {{ivermectin}} preparations {{have been}} shown to be effective for scabies in adults, though only one such formulation is available in the United States at present, and it is not FDA-approved as a scabies treatment. It has also been useful for <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> (the veterinary analog of human scabies).|$|E
25|$|Moxidectin {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as a treatment}} for scabies. It is established in veterinary medicine to treat a range of parasites, including <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange.</b> Its advantage over ivermectin is its longer half life in humans and, thus, potential duration of action. Tea tree oil appears to be effective in a Petri dish.|$|E

40|$|Mites {{constitute}} an old cosmopolitan group, abundant in various terrestrial and aquatic habitats of considerable environmental variations. The majority of mites are free-living, whereas some have evolved parasitic relationships {{with a variety}} of animals either as endo- or ectoparasites. The ectoparasitic and skin burrowing  Sarcoptes scabiei  and  Notoedres cati, cause <b>sarcoptic</b> and notoedric <b>mange</b> among a variety of mammalian species, including humans. In a non-adequate host these mites lead to pseudo-scabies which is often self-curable. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent knowledge on the taxonomy, life cycles and pathology of these two mites, which are of relevance to Fennoscandian wildlife, by considering knowledge on transmission vectors, host immunology, and some documented outbreaks. These mites affect the health and survival of mammals in four ways; 1) skin tissue damages, 2) loss of body fluids, 3) allergic reactions and 4) secondary bacterial infections. A short-term effect of outbreaks is usually high mortality, and long-term effects vary from extinction to biased population structure to no effect at all. Red foxes are generalist predators that are important end-hosts for mites that develop disease depending on their immunity status, and transmit mites to other hosts. Outbreaks of mange may possibly have ecological consequences on a wider scale. In an endangered species, like the arctic fox or Eurasian lynx, loss of only a few individuals can be critical. It might be wise for management authorities to develop emergency plans to minimize consequences of outbreaks of <b>sarcoptic</b> or notoedric <b>mange</b> in threatened species such as the arctic fox and the lynx...|$|R
5000|$|Dermatomyositis {{may occur}} {{at the age of}} 4 to 6 months, and is {{frequently}} misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as <b>sarcoptic</b> or demodectic <b>mange.</b> The disease manifests itself as alopecia {{on the top of the}} head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail. If the disease progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised. This disease is generation-skipping and genetically transmitted, with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records. Deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose dermatomyositis. [...] Lay assessment of end-stage dermatomyositis is observed difficulty or inability to swallow, even water. At this point, the dog must be euthanised.|$|R
25|$|Surveys {{taken in}} the High Adriatic Hinterland {{indicate}} that the totality of people with first hand experience of jackals (hunters, game keepers and local people) regularly mistook red foxes affected by <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> (or in a problematic state of moult) for golden jackals. The sighting of a true golden jackal however, was always {{referred to as a}} wolf, or a little wolf. This was verified both with photo-trapping sessions and with track studies, confirming previous observations on this matter. This erroneous and controversial perception of the golden jackal {{may be due to the}} fact that its presence is still not traditional, neither in Italian and Slovenian human culture, nor in hunting and game keeping traditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{dromedary}} {{is prone}} to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel. Brucellosis is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. Brucellosis is caused by different biotypes of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis. Other internal parasites include Fasciola gigantica (trematode), two types of [...] cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms). Among external parasites, Sarcoptes species cause <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange.</b> In a 2000 study in Jordan, 83% of the 32 camels studied tested positive for <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange.</b> In another study, dromedaries {{were found to have}} natural antibodies against the rinderpest and ovine rinderpest viruses.|$|E
500|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{susceptible to}} [...] foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> and hoof gangrene. The herpesvirus was first isolated from the blue wildebeest in 1960 by veterinary scientist Walter Plowright. Although the causes of death will vary from year to year, in one drought in Botswana, young calves and aged females were {{the most likely to}} die. On another occasion it was estimated that 47% of deaths were caused by disease, 37% were due to predation and the remainder were the result of accidents.|$|E

40|$|At the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (HOVET) in FMVZ/USP, <b>sarcoptic</b> and notoedric <b>mange</b> are {{the second}} and the third most {{commonly}} diagnosed parasitic skin diseases, respectively. Between 1984 and 2002, 2907 cases of canine and feline scabies were diagnosed at HOVET. Canine scabies (2283) and feline scabies (624) represented 6. 4 % and 15. 7 %, respectively, of the cases seen. Feline scabies was more frequent than canine scabies (p< 0. 05). Canine scabies was more prevalent in pure breeds dogs (58. 0 %) with long hair (74. 2 %) and the most commonly affected dog breeds were: Poodle, Cocker Spaniel and German Shepherds. Canine and feline scabies were more frequent in males. Dogs (54. 7 %) and cats (63. 5 %) < 12 months old were the most affected. For notoedric mange stray cats, short-haired (74. 2 %) were most commonly affected. Feline scabies was most common in Siamese, Persian and Burmese cat breed. There was no seasonal difference in the occurence of scabies in either cats or dogs when results were analysed...|$|R
500|$|Coyotes can be {{infected}} by both demodectic and <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange,</b> {{the latter being}} the most common. Mite infestations are rare and incidental in coyotes, while tick infestations are more common, with seasonal peaks depending on locality (May–August in the Northwest, March–November in Arkansas). Coyotes are only rarely infested with lice, while fleas infest coyotes from puphood, {{though they may be}} more a source of irritation than serious illness. Pulex simulans is the most common species to infest coyotes, while Ctenocephalides canis tends to occur only in areas where coyotes and dogs (its primary host) inhabit the same area. Although coyotes are rarely host to flukes, they can nevertheless have serious effects on coyotes, particularly Nanophyetus salmincola, which can infect them with salmon poisoning disease, a disease with a 90% mortality rate. Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect coyotes. Tapeworms have been recorded to infest 60–95% of all coyotes examined. The most common species to infest coyotes is Taenia pisiformis and T. crassiceps, which uses cottontail rabbits as intermediate hosts. The largest species known in coyotes is T. hydatigena, which enters coyotes through infected ungulates, and can grow to lengths of [...] Though once largely limited to wolves, Echinococcus granulosus has expanded to coyotes since the latter began colonizing former wolf ranges. The most frequent ascaroid roundworm in coyotes is Toxascaris leonina, which dwells in the coyote's small intestine and has no ill effects, except for causing the host to eat more frequently. Hookworms of the genus Ancylostoma infest coyotes throughout their range, being particularly prevalent in humid areas. In areas of high moisture, such as coastal Texas, coyotes can carry up to 250 hookworms each. The blood-drinking A. caninum is particularly dangerous, as it damages the coyote through blood loss and lung congestion. A 10-day-old pup can die from being host to as few as 25 A. caninum worms.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{frequently}} diagnosed form of scabies in domestic animals is <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange,</b> {{caused by the}} subspecies Sarcoptes scabiei canis, most commonly in dogs and cats. <b>Sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> is transmissible to humans who come into prolonged contact with infested animals, and is distinguished from human scabies by its distribution on skin surfaces covered by clothing. [...] Scabies-infected domestic fowl suffer {{what is known as}} [...] "scaly leg". Domestic animals that have gone feral and have no veterinary care are frequently afflicted with scabies {{and a host of other}} ailments. Nondomestic animals have also been observed to suffer from scabies. Gorillas, for instance, are known to be susceptible to infection by contact with items used by humans.|$|E
2500|$|Scabies {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common skin {{disorders}} in children, along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. As of 2015, it affects about 204million people (2.8% of the world population). It is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates. The word scabies is from , [...] "to scratch". Other animals do not spread human scabies. Infection in other animals is typically caused by slightly different but related mites and is known as <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombat {{was listed}} as Near Threatened by the IUCN in 2016, because [...] "many subpopulations are now isolated and may be non-viable". It was previously listed as Least Concern because [...] "While there are sporadic outbreaks of <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange,</b> competition with introduced herbivores, susceptibility to drought, and severe fragmentation in parts of its range, the species has a wide distribution, large population, occurs {{in a number of}} protected areas, and it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category". Wombats were hunted by aboriginal people for their meat. However, capturing a wombat takes considerable time and energy, so they were not hunted too frequently. The indigenous people of Australia value the wombat culturally and keep their local wombat populations healthy by hunting wombats in other areas.|$|E

5000|$|Lime sulfur is {{effective}} against <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange.</b> It {{is made by}} mixing hydrated lime, sulfur, and water, and boiling for about 1 hour. Hydrated lime can bond with about 1.7 its weight of sulfur. (Quicklime can bond with as much as 2.2 times its weight of sulfur). The strongest concentrate is diluted 1:32 before saturating the skin (avoiding the eyes), applied at six-day intervals.|$|E
50|$|Ringworm in pets {{may often}} be asymptomatic, {{resulting}} in a carrier condition which infects other pets. In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from allergies, <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange,</b> and other conditions. Three species of fungi cause 95% of dermatophytosis in pets: these are Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.|$|E

It has been suggested that the hybrid animal was afflicted with <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange,</b> which would explain its hairless and blueish appearance.|$|E
50|$|Selamectin (trade names Revolution, Stronghold) is {{a topical}} {{parasiticide}} and anthelminthic used on dogs and cats, distributed by Zoetis, a former Pfizer subsidiary. It treats and prevents infections of heartworms, fleas, ear mites, <b>sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> (scabies), and {{certain types of}} ticks in dogs, and prevents heartworms, fleas, ear mites, hookworms, and roundworms in cats. It also removes 2 types of lungworm in cats (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Eucoleus aerophilus) and one type of lungworm in dogs (Eucoleus aerophilus). It is structurally related to ivermectin and milbemycin. Selamectin is not approved for human use.|$|E
50|$|Dingoes are {{susceptible}} to the same diseases as domestic dogs. At present, 38 species of parasites and pathogens have been detected in Australian dingoes. The bulk of these diseases have a minimal influence on their survival. The exceptions include canine distemper, hookworms and heart worms in North Australia and southeastern Queensland. Dingo pups can also be killed by lungworms, whipworms, hepatitis, coccidiosis, lice and ticks. <b>Sarcoptic</b> <b>mange</b> is a widespread parasitic disease among the dingoes of Australia, but is seldom debilitating. Free-roaming dogs are the primary host of Echinococcosis (tapeworms) and have an infection rate of 70 to 90%.|$|E
