Ischemia was induced by right femoral artery ligation in C 57 Bl 6 mice (n= 7 per group) treated with or without 6 -hydroxydopamin (6 -OHDA, 100 mg/kg, i. p., 2 days), clenbuterol (2 mg/kg, i. p., 5 days), dopamine (DA, 50 mg/kg, i. p., 5 days), NA (2. 5 mg/kg, i. p., 5 days) and eticlopride (10 mg/kg, i. p., 5 days). Sympathectomy induced by 6 -OHDA led to a decrease in foot perfusion, angiographic score and capillary density by 41. 4 % (p< 0. 001), 20. 2 % (p< 0. 01) and 21. 6 % (p< 0. 05) respectively, compared to controls, 21 days after ischemia. In contrast, administration of DA and NA increased angiographic score by 57. 4 % (p= 0. 05) and 80. 3 % (p< 0. 05), respectively and raised capillary density by around 15 % (p< 0. 01). Treatment with the β 2 -receptor agonist, clenbuterol, increased vessel and capillary densities by 30 % and 13 %, respectively (p< 0. 01 versus untreated control). Injection of eticlopride, a specific DA D 2 receptor antagonist, also raised vessel density compared to controls. We next assessed the <b>mobilization</b> of stem/progenitor <b>cells</b> from bone marrow and their recruitment to ischemic tissue using chimeric mice lethally irradiated and transplanted with BM mononuclear cells isolated from GFP mice.

Bone marrow harvests were without complications and did not affect disease activity. A combination of cyclophosphamide and G-CSF was more likely to ameliorate disease activity than G-CSF alone (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a complex}} systemic disease characterized by severe morbidity and excess mortality. The burden of its multiorgan complications relies on an imbalance between hyperglycemic cell damage and defective endogenous reparative mechanisms. Inflammation and abnormalities in several hematopoietic components are typically found in diabetes. The discovery that diabetes reduces circulating stem/progenitor cells and impairs their function has opened an entire new field of study where diabetology comes into contact with hematology and regenerative medicine. It is being progressively recognized that such rare circulating cell populations mirror finely regulated processes involved in hematopoiesis, immunosurveillance, and peripheral tissue homeostasis. From a clinical perspective, pauperization of circulating <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> predicts adverse outcomes and death. Furthermore, studies in murine models and humans have identified the bone marrow (BM) as a previously neglected site of diabetic end-organ damage, characterized by microangiopathy, neuropathy, fat deposition, and inflammation.

In conclusion, all poor mobilizers were able to obtain adequate <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> transplant dose and had similar transplant course and long-term outcome to that of the control good mobilizers group...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{cardiovascular}} {{medicine is}} the frontline of 21 st-century health care. Cell therapy trials using bone marrow progenitor cells documented that {{the approach is}} feasible, safe and potentially beneficial in patients with ischemic disease. However, cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation strategies should aim to conserve the pristine healing capacity of a healthy organism as well as reactivate it under disease conditions. This requires an increased understanding of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> microenvironment and trafficking mechanisms. Engagement and disengagement of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> of the osteoblastic niche is a dynamic process, finely tuned to allow low amounts of cells {{move out of the}} bone marrow and into the circulation on a regular basis. The balance is altered under stress situations, like tissue injury or ischemia, leading to remarkably increased cell egression. Individual populations of circulating progenitor cells could give rise to mature tissue cells (e. g. endothelial cells or cardiomyocytes), while the majority may differentiate to leukocytes, affecting the environment of homing sites in a paracrine way, e. g. promoting endothelial survival, proliferation and function, as well as attenuating or enhancing inflammation. This review focuses on the dynamics of the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche in healthy and disease conditions and on therapeutic means to direct <b>stem</b> cell/progenitor <b>cell</b> <b>mobilization</b> and recruitment into improved tissue repair...|$|R
40|$|Adequate hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (HSC) <b>mobilization</b> and {{collection}} is required prior to proceeding with high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplant. Cytokines such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, and peg-filgrastim, {{alone or in}} combination with plerixafor, and after chemotherapy {{have been used to}} mobilize HSCs. Studies have shown that the efficiency of HSC mobilization {{and collection}} may vary when different methods of mobilization are used. No studies have shown that survival is significantly affected by the method of mobilization, but some studies have suggested that cost and resource utilization may be different between different mobilization techniques. After the FDA approval of plerixafor with G-CSF to mobilize HSCs many transplant centers became concerned about the cost of HSC mobilization. A panel of experts was convened ant this paper reviews the current literature on the pharmacoeconomics of HSC mobilization. (C) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. ...|$|R
40|$|Lenalidomide is {{an agent}} that has shown great {{activity}} {{in patients with}} multiple myeloma (MM). However, {{studies have suggested that}} this drug negatively affects subsequent stem cell collection. To investigate whether lenalidomide impairs <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilization</b> and collection, we reviewed data for patients with MM who underwent mobilization with filgrastim. Predictors of mobilization failure were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. In 26 (9 %) of 302 myeloma patients, <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilization</b> failed. Mobilization failed in 25 % of patients who had previously received lenalidomide, compared with 4 % of patients who had not received lenalidomide (P <. 001). In a multivariate analysis, prior lenalidomide use (odds ratio: 5. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 4 - 14. 3) and mobilization more than 1 year after diagnosis (odds ratio: 4. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 11. 1) were significantly associated with failed mobilization. Twenty-one of 26 patients in whom mobilization with filgrastim failed underwent remobilization with chemotherapy and filgrastim; in 18 (86 %) of these 21 patients, stem cells were successfully mobilized and collected. In patients with multiple myeloma, prior lenalidomide therapy is associated with failure of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilization</b> with filgrastim. Remobilization with chemotherapy and filgrastim is usually successful in these patients...|$|E

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{explain the}} role of adult progenitor cells in myocardial regeneration. <b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> plasticity which involves <b>mobilization</b> of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from the bone marrow and other niches, homing {{to the area of}} tissue injury and transdifferentiation into functional cardiomyocytes. Alternative hypothesis is based on the observations that bone marrow harbors a heterogenous population of cells positive for CXCR 4 - receptor for chemokine SDF- 1. This population of non-hematopoietic cells expresses genes specific for early muscle, myocardial and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). These tissue-committed <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> circulate in the peripheral blood at low numbers and can be mobilized by hematopoietic cytokines in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Endothelial precursors capable of transforming into mature, functional endothelial cells are present in the pool of peripheral mononuclear cells in circulation. Their number significantly increases in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with subsequent decrease after 1 month, as well as in patients with unstable angina in comparison to stable coronary heart disease (CHD). There are numerous physiological and pathological stimuli which influence the number of circulating EPC such as regular physical activity, medications (statins, PPAR-gamma agonists, estrogens), as well as numerous inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines. <b>Mobilization</b> of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in AMI involves not only the endothelial progenitors but also hematopoietic, non-hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and most probably the mesenchymal cells. In healthy subjects and patients with stable CHD, small number of circulating CD 34 +, CXCR 4 +, CD 117 +, c-met+ and CD 34 /CD 117 + <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can be detected. In patients with AMI, a significant increase in CD 34 +/CXCR 4 +, CD 117 +, c-met+ and CD 34 /CD 117 + <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> number the in peripheral blood was demonstrated with parallel increase in mRNA expression for early cardiac, muscle and endothelial markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The maximum number of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was found early in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (< 12 hours) with subsequent decrease through the 7 -day follow-up and with concomitant changes in the levels of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment. Moreover, peak expression of cardiac muscle and endothelial markers occurred {{at the same time as}} the most significant increase in CD 34 /CXCR 4 + <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> number. The SDF- 1 /CXCR- 4 axis seems particularly important in stem/muscle progenitor cell homing, chemotaxis, engraftment and retention in ischaemic myocardium. The significance of autologous <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>mobilization</b> in terms of cardiac salvage and regeneration needs to be proved in humans but it seems to be a reparative mechanism triggered early in the course of acute coronary syndromes...|$|R
40|$|Hematopoietic <b>stem</b> and {{progenitor}} <b>cells</b> (HSPCs) {{are located}} in the bone marrow in close association with a highly organized 3 -dimensional structure formed by stroma cells, referred to as the niche. Mobilization of HSPCs from bone marrow to peripheral blood in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) requires de-adhesion of HSPCs from the niche. The influence of aging of HSPCs on cell-stroma interactions has not been determined in detail. Using a mouse model of G-CSF–induced mobilization, we demonstrated that the ability to mobilize hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is approximately 5 -fold greater in aged mice. Competitive mobilization experiments confirmed that enhanced mobilization ability was intrinsic to the <b>stem</b> <b>cell.</b> Enhanced <b>mobilization</b> efficiency of primitive hematopoietic cells from aged mice correlated with reduced adhesion of hematopoietic progenitor cells to stroma and with elevated levels of GTP-bound Cdc 42. These results might indicate that stroma–stem cell interactions are dynamic over a lifetime and result in physiologically relevant changes in the biology of primitive hematopoietic cells with age...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlerixafor with {{granulocyte}} colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) {{is effective}} for hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (HSC) <b>mobilization</b> in patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and myeloma; however, labeling requires dosing 11  hours before apheresis. Pharmacodynamic studies show peak blood CD 34 + cell counts at 10 to 14  hours; limited data are available for later time points. To address the effect of afternoon plerixafor dosing on CD 34 + cell yields, we conducted a prospective clinical trial in myeloma patients undergoing <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> collection. Thirty-one patients received plerixafor 17  hours before apheresis; blood CD 34 + cells were measured before the first plerixafor dose and 1, 3, and 17  ±  1  hours after treatment. The target HSC number (≥ 10  × 106 CD 34 + cells/kg) was collected from 22 subjects (73 %) in 1  day and from all subjects within 3  days. Hematopoietic engraftment after transplantation and adverse events were similar to previous studies.
