50|$|In New Jersey, the posting of a bond is not {{required}} to appeal a decision. However, if the party wishes to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> during the appeal, a motion must be made with the Superior Court, and the Court can require the posting of a bond or cash deposit under R.2:9-5 and R.2:9-6. The same rule applies in Delaware under the State Constitution as well as the court rules.|$|E

Tahoe Resources Inc.) against Tahoe Resources in June 2014, alleging that Rotondo ordered the {{shooting}} and that Tahoe Resources was legally responsible for the shooting. The suit alleged assault, aggravated assault, and obstruction of justice, and that the shooting was premeditated. On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of British Columbia <b>stayed</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> in favor of Tahoe Resources.|$|R

50|$|The {{defendant}} {{in the original}} case <b>stayed</b> <b>a</b> damage <b>judgment</b> {{and went on to}} lose on appeal. According to an Alabama statute, the defendant would be required to pay a ten percent penalty. Under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38, the penalty was discretionary. Holding the federal rule to be on point and constitutional, the court applied federal rule and gave no penalty.|$|R
5000|$|On Tuesday, June 9, 2009, the Supreme Court {{declined}} {{to hear the}} case. It issued a per curiam denial of the applications for <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> of the sale from the three Indiana funds, allowing the sale of assets to [...] "New Chrysler" [...] to proceed. It did not discuss the underlying issues raised, and its opinion cautioned that its denial of the <b>stay</b> was not <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> on the underlying merits.According to the two-page decision and order, the Indiana funds “have not carried the burden” of demonstrating that the Supreme Court was required. [...] The U.S. Department of the Treasury then issued a statement saying: “We are gratified that not a single court that reviewed this matter, including the U.S. Supreme Court, found any fault whatsoever with the handling of this matter by either Chrysler or the U.S. government.” ...|$|R

Santai-Gaffney v. Whitewood, No. 14A19 (July 7, 2014). In her application, the clerk {{attempted}} to overcome {{not only the}} questions of her interest in intervening and standing to appeal, but that she, as a public official, is suffering irreparable harm. Supreme Court rules also require it probable that four Justices grant certiorari on any question presented in order for <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> to be granted. The counsel of record in clerk Santai-Gaffney's litigation, as listed in court filings, is the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit organization. On July 9, Justice Alito denied the clerk's application for <b>a</b> <b>stay,</b> referencing National Organization for Marriage v. Geiger.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> {{creditor}} is <b>a</b> {{party to}} which a debt is owed that has proved the debt in a legal proceeding and that is entitled to use judicial process to collect the debt.

Following <b>a</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> debtor may satisfy the debt voluntarily or the judgment creditor may need to take additional steps to enforce the judgment.|$|R
25|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is <b>a</b> {{combination}} or {{separation of}} two or more concepts. If <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. Truth is the reference of <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. <b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If <b>a</b> <b>judgment,</b> of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth.|$|R

But just now her heart was so sore over the Quarrel that there was no room for other regrets. [...] "Well, well, crying won't mend it.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> {{must address}} {{all of the}} issues raised with respect to the rights and {{liabilities}} of the parties.

5000|$|James {{believed}} that the origins of a religion shed little light upon its value.

5000|$|... § 20. <b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> of {{perception}} {{is a connection}} {{of perception}}s in a subject's mind. For example, [...] "When the sun shines on a stone, the stone becomes warm." [...] <b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> of perception has no necessary universality and therefore no objective validity. <b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> of perception can become <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of experience, as in [...] "The sun warms the stone." [...] This occurs when the subject's perceptions are connected according to {{the form of a}} pure concept of the understanding. These pure concepts of the understanding are the general forms that any object must assume in order to be experienced.|$|R

50|$|The {{decision}} not to appeal the ruling became primarily a financial one. Having won the initial court battle, the directors and studios were {{in a position to}} collect significant damages for copyright infringement from the editing companies. Although the companies would almost certainly receive <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> of <b>judgment</b> pending appeals, the risk was much higher now. Since the inventory of edited movies had no value to the studios, a deal was offered whereby the companies would be allowed to sell off all of their inventory and keep the profits if they agreed not to appeal the ruling and the studios would not pursue damage claims. Thus, the companies, and their investors, would collect further revenue and be protected from damages and the studios would have a significant court ruling stand and the legal precedent would be set. After discussions with their legal teams and investors, {{the decision was made to}} accept the offer. The companies were then given additional time to clear out their inventory but no more films could be edited during that time. All unsold inventory was then sent to the studios as defined by the ruling.|$|R

50|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> or assertion may {{be thought}} of as a statement or enunciation in the meta-language. For example, typical judgments in first-order logic would be that a string is a well-formed formula, or that a proposition is true. Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> may assert the occurrence of a free variable in an expression of the object language, or the provability of a proposition. In general, <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> may be any inductively definable assertion in the metatheory.|$|R

Rescission of <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is in issue not only in cases in which default judgment has been granted, but also in cases in which application is made for the rescission of <b>a</b> summary <b>judgment,</b> {{as well as in}} cases in which judgment has been granted {{in the absence of a}} defendant in terms of rule 60(3), where the defendant has not supplied further particulars requested of him.|$|R

5000|$|Bankruptcy {{prevents}} a person's creditors from obtaining <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> against them. With <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>a</b> creditor can {{attempt to}} garnish wages or seize {{certain types of}} property. However, if a debtor has no wages (because they are unemployed or retired) and has no property, they are [...] "judgment proof", meaning <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> would have no impact on their financial situation. Creditors typically do not initiate legal action against a debtor with no assets, because it is unlikely they could collect the judgment.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> is not final, {{there is}} a problem of {{registering}} that judgment in another court, because normally <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> must be final before it can be registered. The Second Restatement states, under the topic of Defenses to Recognition and Enforcement, that <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> rendered in one state need not be recognized or enforced in a sister state insofar as the judgment remains subject to modification in the state of rendition either as to sums that have accrued and are unpaid or as to sums that will accrue in the future. A court is free to recognize or enforce <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> that remains subject to modification under the local law of the state of rendition. Child support orders are considered judgments of this sort.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in California, <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> {{creditor}} must file an [...] "Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment" [...] {{where it}} has been paid in full by the judgment debtor within 15 days of the judgment debtor's request. This document has the effect of formally closing the case and terminating any ongoing garnishment arrangements or liens. In Saskatchewan, upon either the satisfaction or withdrawal of <b>a</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> debtor can seek <b>a</b> discharge of <b>judgment.</b> If successful, the judgment is removed from the Judgment Registry and detached from any property registered on the Personal Property registry, titles, or interests in land.|$|R
5000|$|Per incuriam, {{literally}} {{translated as}} [...] "through lack of care", refers to <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of <b>a</b> court {{which has been}} decided without reference to a statutory provision or earlier judgment {{which would have been}} relevant.

Ordinarily, in the common law, the rationes of <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> must be followed thereafter by lower courts hearing similar cases.
