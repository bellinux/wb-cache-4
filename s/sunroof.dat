25|$|Dual-way power sunroofs were {{available}} on this car. They were designed and installed by American <b>Sunroof</b> (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed <b>sunroof</b> eliminated {{most of the}} front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., 100 {{cars were}} fitted with an {{electric}} sliding steel <b>sunroof</b> built by ASC.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between the three versions of the Williams were largely a reflection of phase changes across the Clio range, e.g. the gradual addition of enhanced safety features and cosmetic variations. Other than this, the Williams 1 and 2 had no <b>sunroof</b> and were painted in 449 Sports Blue. The final Williams 3 was painted in a slightly brighter shade of blue (432 Monaco Blue) and finally gained a <b>sunroof</b> which had long been standard on virtually all previous Clios. The original Williams was the lightest of the three, lacking the electrics necessary for the <b>sunroof</b> or the mirrors, and {{was the only one}} to sport a metal plaque stating the build number.|$|E

25|$|For 2009, Ford {{introduced}} a new option called the glass roof. This option ($1,995 at introduction) was in effect a full roof <b>sunroof</b> that splits the difference in price and purpose of the coupe and convertible models.|$|E
25|$|The Supra in Australia {{was sold}} from 1983 to 1986 had a digital dash, fender flares, 14x7-inch wheels, 84 style lights, single piece spoiler, LSD and {{optional}} <b>sunroof.</b> This {{was the only}} variant and no L Types were offered.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the power}} tops on these did not {{necessarily}} need extensive maintenance, they could be operated manually if necessary. All M30 coupes had power tilting/sliding <b>sunroofs</b> standard, with [...] "auto-cut" [...] while sliding to the closed position to prevent anything from getting caught by the glass.|$|R
50|$|Automobile flex when {{going over}} bumps, and {{vibrations}} cause relative motions between the relatively fixed body and movable parts like doors, windows, and <b>sunroofs.</b> This movement could allow {{water in the}} vehicle so the weatherstrip must compensate by filling the gap. Furthermore, this relative movement can cause noises such as squeaks, rattles, and creaks to be heard within the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Top-mount sliding <b>sunroofs</b> (rail mount topslider) {{have been}} a popular factory option in Europe for many years. A large glass panel slides open in tracks {{on top of the}} roof, with no loss of headroom. Most feature an {{integral}} wind deflector to eliminate wind noise. Examples include Donmar's original Skyroof topslider (aftermarket system), the London Taxi and Renault 5 cars.|$|R

50|$|A window {{deflector}} {{is mounted}} above {{the doors of}} some automobiles, to protect {{the inside of the}} car from rain or other precipitation in case of slightly opened windows. Additionally, it may help to prevent precipitation entering the interior in case of an opened door, e.g. dropping from the roof or directly from the air. Deflectors are also fitted to <b>sunroofs</b> to deviate wind.|$|R
50|$|The U.S./Canadian {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with larger impact bumpers with built-in shock absorbers, {{like the rest}} of the 4000/Coupé models. They did not have anti-lock braking system (ABS), but included air conditioning and leather upholstery in most of the cars. Most of the 1984 and 1985 Canadian models came without <b>sunroofs.</b> The remainder of the electric, suspension, and cosmetic updates took place at the same time as the European cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE) {{was thus}} {{established}} as {{a joint venture between}} Ford Australia. TVE was involved {{in the creation of the}} Falcon XR range that emerged in 1992 with the EB series and the return of the legendary Falcon GT. In addition, TVE was also responsible for other higher-specification Fords such as the Capri Clubsprint, and for the fitment of optional equipment such as LPG systems and <b>sunroofs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Photovoltaic modules {{are used}} commercially as {{auxiliary}} power units on passenger cars {{in order to}} ventilate the car, reducing {{the temperature of the}} passenger compartment while it is parked in the sun. Vehicles such as the 2010 Prius, Aptera 2, Audi A8, and Mazda 929 have had solar <b>sunroof</b> options for ventilation purposes.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the 85kWh {{and later}} 90kWh battery was {{discontinued}} from all markets. A glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the B-pillars {{was introduced in}} late 2016. Before adding an all-glass roof option for the Model S, possible roof options was: body colored roof, a black painted roof, or the panoramic <b>sunroof.</b>|$|E
25|$|ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), {{a method}} of {{controlling}} air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was {{also a part of}} the 7M-GE's technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double wishbone suspension front and rear. A targa top was offered in all years along with a metal power sliding <b>sunroof</b> (added in '91).|$|E
5000|$|Pop-up <b>sunroofs</b> {{are simply}} a {{manually}} operated tilting panel. These panels are usually removable, and like T-roofs, must be stored when removed. The tilting action provides a vent in the roof, or a full opening when {{the panel is}} removed. Pop-ups can be installed in most vehicles, and are relatively inexpensive. Examples include metal panels in Porsche 944, early Mazda RX-7 and many glass panel factory and aftermarket installations.|$|R
5000|$|All but hand-built as {{the company}} flagship, the 300d is often {{identified}} as an Adenauer after Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, who employed six custom cabriolet, hardtop saloon, and landaulet versions of the W189 and its precursor W186 series during his 1949-1963 tenure. Among the custom features in these [...] "parade cars" [...] were writing desks, sirens, curtains, dividing partitions, <b>sunroofs,</b> and half-roof [...] "landaulet" [...] configurations.|$|R
5000|$|Few special {{models were}} {{released}} throughout the Saxo's life, {{most notably the}} [...] "Open Scandal", a Saxo with a full length sliding canvas roof. Other special editions added certain extras to the lower end model, such as <b>sunroofs</b> or PAS. Notable models are the Westcoast up to 1999 and the Furio to 2003, as they incorporated the standard Saxo bodykit found on the VTR and VTS with a more insurance friendly 1.4L engine.|$|R
