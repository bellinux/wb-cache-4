50|$|In {{combination}} with two skins applied on the honeycomb, the structure offers a sandwich panel with excellent rigidity at minimal weight. The {{behavior of the}} honeycomb structures is orthotropic, meaning the panels react differently depending on {{the orientation of the}} structure. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the directions of symmetry, the so-called L and W-direction. The L-direction is the strongest and the stiffest direction. The weakest direction is at 60° from the L-direction (in the case of a regular hexagon) and the most compliant direction is the W-direction.Another important property of honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> is its compression strength. Due to the efficient hexagonal configuration, where walls support each other, compression strength of honeycomb cores is typically higher (at same weight) compared to other <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> structures such as, for instance, foam cores or corrugated cores.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic out-of-plane {{compressive}} {{response of}} stainless steel corrugated and Y-frame <b>sandwich</b> <b>cores</b> have been investigated for impact velocities ranging from quasi-static to 200 ms− 1. Laboratory-scale <b>sandwich</b> <b>cores</b> of relative density 2. 5 % were manufactured and the stresses {{on the front and}} rear faces of the dynamically compressed <b>sandwich</b> <b>cores</b> were measured using a direct impact Kolsky bar. Direct observational evidence is provided for micro-inertial stabilisation of both topologies against elastic buckling at impact velocities below 30 ms− 1. At higher impact velocities, plastic waves within the core members result in the front face stresses increasing with increasing velocity while the rear face stresses remain approximately constant. While the finite element calculations predict the rear face stresses and dynamic deformation modes to reasonable accuracy, the relatively slow response time of the measurement apparatus results in poor agreement between the measured and predicted front face stresses. The finite element calculations also demonstrate that material strain-rate effects have a negligible effect upon the dynamic compressive response of laboratory-scale and full-scale <b>sandwich</b> <b>cores...</b>|$|R

50|$|Triflin is a cysteine-rich {{secretory}} protein, {{which means}} {{it belongs to the}} CRISP family. This is a group of single chain polypeptides found in various organisms.Triflin weighs 25 kDa and consists of 221 amino-acid residues. The first 163 residues of the N-terminal domain forms an α-β-α <b>sandwich</b> <b>core.</b> This domain is comparable with group 1 plant pathogenesis-related protein (PR-1).The C-terminal domain, has five disulfide bridges. This domain is responsible for the selectivity of the protein and consists of two subdomains: N-terminal subdomain (Cys 167 to Cys 179) and C-terminal subdomain (42 amino-acids residues).The N-terminal subdomain is connected with N-terminal domain through two main-chain hydrogen bonds between β11 and β2 and is thereby part of the PR-1 domain. The C-terminal subdomain is stabilized by three disulfide bridges and it is remarkable that this domain does not interact with either the PR-1 domain or the N-terminal sub-domain. The C-terminal subdomain consists of particles, including some hydrophobic residues that are exposed to the solvent. These hydrophobic residues might mediate the interaction with the target proteins and therefore receptor recognition.|$|E

30|$|These {{disadvantages}} {{mentioned above}} are among others the vulnerability to impact loads which may cause debonding {{of the face}} sheet from the core {{and the problem of}} humidity accumulation in closed-cell sandwich cores. Novel folded <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> materials—fold-core—can solve the problem of humidity accumulation by featuring an open cellular design which enables ventilation of the foldcore (Miura 1972; Miura 1975; Zakirov et al. 2005; Zakirov et al. 2006; Kolax 2004; Kehrle & Kolax 2006; Hachenberg et al. 2003). So, the foldcore is an interesting alternative <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> material to foam cores and honeycomb. To unlock the potential of mechanical properties and help designing the foldcore’s unit cell to specific needs, simulation methods have to be used.

In the previous study of a sandwiched hollow sphere structure by the authors, a novel unit cell was created as a basic building unit of the structure, the tumbling effect was observed for significant impact energy absorption, and the existence of an optimal yield stress or hardness was proved for maximizing the impact energy absorption. However, the impact energy absorption ability of the sandwiched hollow sphere structure may also relate to many other factors. In this study, the diameter relation between the incoming projectile and the spheres in the <b>sandwich</b> <b>core,</b> the projectile initial impact velocity, and the sphere arrangement in the <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> are examined. It is revealed that the first layer sphere diameter should be comparable to the diameter of the incoming projectile, the diameter of spheres in different layers in one <b>sandwich</b> <b>core</b> should either decrease or increase monotonically, and there exists a critical impacting speed, at which the sandwiched sphere structure is most effective for impact energy absorption, etc. All these findings make the sandwiched hollow sphere structure a promising new member to the passive armor family...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLightweight {{metallic}} sandwich plates comprising periodic truss cores {{and solid}} facesheets are optimally designed against minimum weights. Constitutive {{models of the}} truss core are developed using homogenization techniques which, together with effective single-layer sandwich approaches, {{form the basis of}} a two-dimensional (2 D) single-layer sandwich model. The 2 D model is employed to simulate the mechanical behaviors of truss-cored sandwich panels having a variety of core topologies. The types of loading considered include bending, transverse shear and in-plane compression. The validities of the 2 D model predictions are checked against direct FE simulations on three-dimensional (3 D) truss <b>core</b> <b>sandwich</b> structures. Optimizations using the 2 D sandwich model are subsequently performed to determine the minimum weights of truss-cored sandwiches subjected to various failure constraints: overall and local buckling, yielding and facesheet wrinkling. The performances of the optimized truss <b>core</b> <b>sandwiches</b> with 4 -rod unit cell and solid truss members and pyramidal unit cell with hollow truss members are compared with benchmark lightweight structures such as honeycomb-cored <b>sandwiches,</b> tetrahedral <b>core</b> <b>sandwiches</b> and hat-stiffened single layer plates...|$|R

Sandwich constructions, consisting of two thin, stiff faces separated by a thick lightweight core, are generally known for their great efficiency in providing stiffness at low weight. Core materials are traditionally cellular solids [...] honeycombs or foams. With the recent development of processes to manufacture foams from molten metals, metallic foams have been proposed as a candidate for <b>sandwich</b> <b>cores.</b> Metallic foams are attractive candidate core materials due to the ease with which they may be formed into complex shapes, as well as their qualities of impact resistance, acoustical damping, thermal insulation, and fire resistance. In this study, the failure behavior of metallic foam <b>core</b> <b>sandwich</b> beams is examined. Several different modes of failure are analyzed: face yielding, face wrinkling, core yielding, and indentation. For the latter two modes, a multiaxial stress state in the core must be considered. Consequently, a yield surface for metallic foams is necessary. Three yield criteria have been proposed. The first is derived from an analysis of the failure o...|$|R

These materials provide {{a new type of}} sandwich structure with a high skin-core debonding resistance and the potential for cost-effective sandwich construction.

There is a large variety in possible core layouts and thus mechanical performance for sandwich-fabric panels. Acceptable mechanical properties for cores of higher thickness (higher than 10 mm) can be obtained by weaving part of the pile fibres in the core under angles of +/- 45 degrees, by creating networks of piles at lower degrees of stretching and sufficient pile density, or by filling the core with foam.
