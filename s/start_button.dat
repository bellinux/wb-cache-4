5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the <b>START</b> <b>button</b> or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|Released {{as part of}} a shift by Microsoft towards regular yearly major updates for its {{software}} platforms and services, Windows 8.1 aims to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Visible enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11, a Bing-powered unified search system, restoration of a visible <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> on the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for such emerging technologies as high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file system.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{a simple}} forward-scrolling rail shooter, similar to the Star Fox series. Only the Game Boy Advance's {{directional}} pad, A, and <b>Start</b> <b>buttons</b> are used during gameplay. The ship remains locked at a set speed and cannot brake or speed up.|$|R
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and <b>start</b> <b>button</b> below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the <b>start</b> <b>button</b> is pressed.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Stardock added a {{new program}} Start8 to Object Desktop. Start8 adds a <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> and Start menu to Windows 8.|$|E
50|$|The {{handheld}} has an 8-way thumbstick for directional control, {{menu and}} <b>start</b> <b>buttons,</b> four face buttons and four shoulder buttons: L1, L2, R1, R2. The shoulder buttons {{are used for}} changing screen aspect ratio and pausing games. Buttons to adjust volume and brightness are located under the handheld.|$|R
50|$|Avalanche {{is housed}} in a custom cabinet that {{includes}} 2 large lit <b>start</b> <b>buttons</b> and a rotary controller. The side art and bezel feature groupings of rocks with extending lines meant to convey the motion of falling rocks. The screen is black and white with 2 colored strips to provide colored rows of graphics as in Breakout.|$|R
50|$|The cab had two control {{stands and}} since it was {{possible}} to start the six prime movers of three multiple-unit consisted locomotives from one engine cab, each control stand had six engine <b>start</b> <b>buttons</b> and six engine stop buttons. The electrical system was very complicated and unreliable, which eventually led to the locomotives being completely rewired in 1963.|$|R
25|$|In Common Building Block Keyboard Specification, all CBB {{compliant}} keyboards were {{to comply}} with the Windows Vista Hardware <b>Start</b> <b>Button</b> specification beginning in 2007-06-01.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft also {{released}} a Zune theme for Windows XP that replaced {{the appearance of}} the operating system. This theme includes an orange <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> and black taskbar/Start menu.|$|E
25|$|A {{vertical}} toolbar {{known as}} the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a <b>Start</b> <b>button.</b> The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has {{been converted into a}} hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 {{is similar to that of}} Windows 7.|$|E
2500|$|With 169 <b>starts,</b> <b>Button</b> {{made the}} second-highest number of race starts before {{becoming}} World Champion. Only Nigel Mansell (with 176 starts, at the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix) had competed in more races than Button before winning the World Championship. Button {{wrote a book}} about his 2009 season, entitled [...] "My Championship Year", which was published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson on 19 November 2009.|$|R

25|$|The first {{commercial}} compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of Claudio Arrau performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau {{was invited to}} the Langenhagen plant to press the <b>start</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
25|$|Right-clicking on the <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> invokes {{a context}} menu. This menu in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 {{is called the}} Quick Link menu and grants access to several {{frequently}} used features of Windows, such as accessing desktop or File Explorer.|$|E
25|$|The {{only other}} {{feature of the}} new-look iPlayer {{discussed}} was a new embeddable video player, being rolled out across {{the whole of the}} BBC's online presence. On 19 June 2012 on the live TV channels it added a rewind to <b>start</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
5000|$|S.T.U.N. Runners {{elaborate}} cabinet {{was designed}} to resemble the craft that the player pilots in-game. The player straddles a red S.T.U.N. bike with the flight yoke-style controls immediately in front. Twin triggers fire laser cannons mounted atop the craft, and the <b>Start</b> <b>buttons</b> double as the triggers for the Shockwave [...] "smart bomb" [...] weapon. S.T.U.N. Runner was notable for its early use of high-speed 3D polygonal graphics, and {{was based on an}} evolution of Ataris pioneering Hard Drivin hardware.|$|R
50|$|If {{the user}} selects the Android or the iOS screen, {{he or she}} will see a list of apps {{available}} for that mobile operating system, all of which support Microsoft account sign-ins: Cortana, OneDrive, Groove, OneNote, Skype, “Office”, and Outlook. There is a Get <b>Started</b> <b>button</b> below each. Clicking on one will lead the user to a series of steps with a description of the app or bundle, spot for emailing a link to the app on the mobile device’s store, and button for marking that the app has been downloaded onto a mobile device.|$|R
60|$|Snider {{lay upon}} {{his back in}} the bottom of the boat alone. Even before I had clambered in and stooped above him I knew that he was dead. Without {{examining}} him further, I ran forward to the control board and pressed the <b>starting</b> <b>button.</b> To my relief, the mechanism responded--the launch was uninjured. Coming about, I picked up Delcarte. He was astounded at the sight that met his eyes, and immediately fell to examining Snider's body for signs of life or an explanation of the manner in which he met his death.|$|R
25|$|The NES {{dropped the}} {{hardwired}} controllers, instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports {{on the front}} of the console. Also in contrast to the Famicom, the controllers included with the NES were identical and swappable, and neither controller possessed the microphone that was present on the Famicom model. Both controllers included the START and SELECT buttons, allowing some NES localizations of games, such as The Legend of Zelda, to use the <b>START</b> <b>button</b> on the second controller to save the game without dying first. However, the NES controllers lacked the microphone, which was used on the Famicom version of Zelda to kill certain enemies.|$|E
25|$|Windows 8.1 {{addressed}} {{a number of}} criticisms faced by Windows 8 upon its release, with additional customization options for the Start screen, the restoration of a visible <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> on the desktop, the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display, {{and the ability to}} boot to the desktop instead of the Start screen. Windows 8's stock apps were also updated, a new Bing-based unified search system was added, SkyDrive was given deeper integration with the operating system, and a number of new stock apps, along with a tutorial, were added. Windows 8.1 also added support for 3D printing, Miracast media streaming, NFC printing, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
25|$|One major {{difference}} between Vista and earlier versions of Windows, Windows 95 and later, is that the original <b>start</b> <b>button</b> was replaced with the Windows icon in a circle (called the Start Orb). Vista also features new graphics features, the Windows Aero GUI, new applications (such as Windows Calendar, Windows DVD Maker and some new games including Chess, Mahjong, and Purble Place), Internet Explorer 7, Windows Media Player 11, {{and a large number}} of underlying architectural changes including Windows Powershell being shipped with the operating system, which many believed to have taken place in Windows 7's architecture and later. Windows Vista has the version number NT 6.0. Since its release, Windows Vista has had two service packs.|$|E

500|$|Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen {{stated that}} the {{restoration}} of the visible <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> was intended to be a [...] "warm blanket" [...] for users who had become confused by the removal of the button on 8; the <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> was originally removed to reflect Windows 8's treatment of the desktop as an [...] "app" [...] rather than the main interface.|$|E
500|$|To {{improve the}} {{usability}} of the desktop interface, a visible <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> was {{restored to the}} taskbar for opening the Start screen, and the Quick Links menu (accessed by right-clicking the <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> or pressing [...] ) now contains shutdown and sign-out options. Users can also modify certain user interface behaviors, such as disabling the upper hot corners for using the charms and recent apps list, going to the desktop instead of the Start screen on login or after closing all apps on a screen, automatically opening the [...] "All Apps" [...] view on the Start screen when opened, and prioritizing desktop programs on the [...] "Category" [...] sort mode on [...] "All Apps". To assist users in learning the Windows 8 user interface, an interactive tutorial is also offered, along with a new Help + Tips app for additional information. In contrast, Windows RT 8.1 downplays the desktop interface further by not displaying the Desktop tile on its default Start screen at all (however, it can still be manually added to the Start screen).|$|E
500|$|Peter Bright of Ars Technica praised {{many of the}} {{improvements}} on Windows 8.1, such as its more [...] "complete" [...] touch interface, the [...] "reasonable" [...] tutorial content, the new autocomplete tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the <b>Start</b> <b>button</b> made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E

50|$|The beatmania IIDX cabinet {{has many}} {{standard}} {{features that are}} found in traditional arcade cabinets such as a widescreen display, powerful speakers, and <b>start</b> <b>buttons.</b> Also, unique to IIDX cabinets are the effector buttons and sliders, a bass platform transducer, marquee, and DJ simulating controller. The effector buttons and sliders allow the player to control the volume levels within the game and manipulate the music by adding additional sound effects. The bass platform vibrates beneath the player's feet {{to the beat of}} the music being played. The marquee is a series of sixteen-segment display LEDs, used to display game information and scores during gameplay.|$|R
