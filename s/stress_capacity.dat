40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>stress</b> coping <b>capacity</b> in combination with mode of anaesthesia on postoperative recovery in fast-track abdominal hysterectomy. Design Prospective longitudinal study. Setting Five hospitals in the south-east of Sweden. Population A cohort of 162 women undergoing fast-track abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions. Methods Self-administered questionnaires, the Stress Coping Inventory (SCI) and the Swedish Postoperative Symptom Questionnaire (SPSQ), and clinical information were collected prospectively. <b>Stress</b> coping <b>capacity</b> was categorised as high or low according to the summed score of the SCI. Comparisons of effect variables were adjusted using a propensity score-matching model. Main outcome measures Associations between <b>stress</b> coping <b>capacity</b> and hospital stay, sick leave, use of analgesic and self-reported postoperative symptoms. Results Women with high <b>stress</b> coping <b>capacity</b> had a significantly shorter sick leave, experienced postoperative symptoms significantly less often, and with lower intensity, than women with low <b>stress</b> coping <b>capacity.</b> With the exception of symptom intensity, these findings were related to having had the operation under spinal anaesthesia as opposed to general anaesthesia. Hospital stay, use of analgesics and abdominal pain were not related to <b>stress</b> coping <b>capacity.</b> Conclusions In patients for whom spinal anaesthesia was applied, high stress coping {{seems to be a}} quality that helps patients manage the burden of surgery.

Such sizes can result in the FRP confinement relative to the concrete component to be significantly stiffer than practical retrofit applications. In addition, few investigations have confirmed the validity of extrapolating small-scale specimen results to large-scale specimen results.
