40|$|Energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> cyclic {{electron}} flow through photosystem I (PSI) {{was measured in}} vivo using the photoacoustic technique. A wide variety of photosynthetic organisms were considered and all showed measurable energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic {{electron flow}} except for higher plants using the C- 3 carbon fixation pathway. The capacity for energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic electron flow alone {{was found to be}} small in comparison to that of linear and cyclic electron flows combined but may be significant, nonetheless, under conditions when photosystem II is damaged, particularly in cyanobacteria. Light-induced dynamics of energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic electron flow were evident, demonstrating regulation under changing environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{kernel of}} scientific {{software is the}} multiplication of a sparse matrix by a vector. The efficiency of the algorithm on a vector computer depends on the storage scheme. With a <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> rows, performances are limited in general by the small vector length. Therefore a <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> so-called generalized colums has been designed, which provides long vectors and consequently good performances. However, it is not adapted to the symmetric case. A new type of <b>storage,</b> <b>by</b> sparse diagonals, has then been defined. It still exhibits long vectors, with performances as good as previously, {{but it is also}} well-suited to symmetric matrices. Results on a Cray 2, with various sparse matrices, compare the three algorithms, and show the efficiency of the <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> sparse diagonale...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{major problem}} is energy consumtion in {{portable}} devices {{which has a}} battery. In this job we have evaluated energy consumption for Pocket PC. We wanted to see memory and processor influence in battery energy consumption. We have created a program which can do matrix multiplication and sparse matrix „storage by columns“ multiplication. During multiplication program takes battery information and saves it into the file. After that I have investigated the result and saw, that sparse matrix <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> columns multiplication is much more effectived than normal matrix multiplication. Sparce matrix <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> columns multiplication take less memory and more processor commands then normal matrix multiplication. We suggest to use sparse matrix <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> columns model instead simple model, because you can save much more operation time, battery resources and memory...|$|R
