50|$|In trials, the {{vehicles}} confirmed their remarkable capability and running qualities. However the locomotives tended to derail in tight turnout curves. And, like the Class 45s, the boilers developed cracks, leaky tubes and popped <b>stay</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{so that the}} locomotives were unconvincing when hauling measurement vehicles or scheduled trains.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{fault of}} the S160 was use of a single water gauge of a Klinger design, {{unfamiliar}} to U.K. crews. If the valves were not fully open, the crews could be misled into thinking that the water level was adequate, {{even though it was}} becoming dangerously low. When a low water condition allowed the crown sheet to overheat, the <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> holding the crown sheet would fail with little warning, resulting in a boiler explosion. In a space of ten months, three UK S160s suffered a collapse of the firebox crown, with the first leading to the death of a GWR fireman on No. 2403 in November 1943. Although there are claims that the <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> or firebox design were less than for domestic locomotive boilers, the locomotives were equipped with a [...] "(b)oiler built to comply in all aspects with the A.S.M.E. Boiler Code, except that the shell shall have a factor safety of 4." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{proved to}} be powerful and capable, with reserves of power at speed and reasonable fuel economy. The turbine drive was easy on the track and allowed more power at the rail. While economical at speed, the locomotive was highly uneconomical at lower speed. The turbine used less steam than conventional locomotives above 30 mph, but below that the locomotive used too much steam and fuel. The boiler normally operated at , but at low speed the pressure could drop as low as [...] The increased fuel usage at low speeds caused the firebox to run hotter, which sometimes caused <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> to break.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{launch of}} the Naro-1 took place on [...] The rocket was {{launched}} from the Naro Space Center. The Khrunichev-built first stage reportedly performed nominally, and the second stage separation took place as expected, but the payload fairing separation system malfunctioned {{and half of the}} satellite protective cover <b>stayed</b> <b>bolted</b> to the second stage. The added weight of the remaining fairing caused the rocket to tumble upwards and to be thrown off its nominal course, soaring 20 km above the planned altitude before falling down. The payload (STSAT-2) reentered the atmosphere and disintegrated.|$|R
5000|$|Karl Willetts (born 21 September 1966) is a death metal vocalist from England. He {{joined the}} British death metal band Bolt Thrower in 1988. Before that {{he drove the}} backline of the band. He <b>stayed</b> with <b>Bolt</b> Thrower until 1994, after the {{recording}} of ...For Victory. He left the band mainly {{because he wanted to}} go back to university and finish his degree.|$|R
50|$|Willetts rejoined as {{a session}} vocalist for the {{recording}} of Mercenary and left shortly thereafter because of financial reasons and lack of commitment. In the meantime, {{he got a job}} as a salesman of insurances besides other jobs. He resides in Solihull. Rumours persisted he had returned in 2001, but he did not. However, in November 2004, he actually did re-join Bolt Thrower after the departure of Dave Ingram. Willetts now has a degree in Cultural Studies from the Birmingham University. Willetts <b>stayed</b> in <b>Bolt</b> Thrower until the band broke up in 2016, following the death of drummer Martin Kearns the year before.|$|R

40|$|A protein, Tm 1631 {{from the}} hyperthermophilic {{organism}} Thermotoga maritima {{belongs to a}} domain of unknown function protein family. It was predicted that Tm 1631 binds with the DNA and that the Tm 1631 –DNA complex is an endonuclease repair system with a DNA repair function (Konc et al. PLoS Comput Biol 9 (11) : e 1003341, 2013). We observed that the severely bent, strained DNA binds to the protein for the entire 90 ns of classical molecular dynamics (MD) performedwe could observe no {{significant changes in the}} most distorted region of the DNA, where the cleavage of phosphodiester bond occurs. In this article, we modeled the reaction mechanism at the interface between Tm 1631 and its proposed ligand, the DNA molecule, focusing on cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. After addition of two Mg 2 + ions to the reaction center and extension of classical MD by 50 ns (totaling 140 ns), the DNA ligand <b>stayed</b> <b>bolted</b> to the protein. Results from density functional theory quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations suggest that the reaction is analogous to known endonuclease mechanisms: an enzyme reaction mechanism with two Mg 2 + ions in the reaction center and a pentacovalent intermediate. The minimum energy pathway profile shows that the phosphodiester bond cleavage step of the reaction is kinetically controlled and not thermodynamically {{because of a lack of}} any energy barrier above the accuracy of the energy profile calculation. The role of ions is shown by comparing the results with the reaction mechanisms in the absence of the Mg 2 + ions where there is a significantly higher reaction barrier than in the presence of the Mg 2 + ions...|$|R

5000|$|The MG 15 fires {{from an open}} bolt, {{meaning that}} the <b>bolt</b> <b>stays</b> back when the gun is ready to fire, and also making it nearly {{impossible}} for [...] "through the propeller" [...] synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the lockring rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the trip lever releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the barrel, lock and bolt backwards until the lockring hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until {{the base of the}} fired case hits the ejector flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is released the bolt will remain in the rearward position.|$|R
50|$|A single {{push button}} on {{the rear of the}} frame allows the marker to switch the marker off and on, safe and fire modes respectively. The stock factory circuit board of the Matrix has only a {{semi-automatic}} firing function, ready for tournament play. The core of the circuit board is a PIC16C54C microcontroller. This microprocessor is programmable in several programming languages including C and Assembly. The PIC that the Matrix utilizes has a socket form factor which allows different ‘chips’ containing different software to be swapped in and out rather quickly. These chips can contain new software for more features that the Matrix can utilize such as: alternate firing modes, timers, and infrared ball detection systems. The PIC uses four dip switches mounted on the circuit board to select timing values for the duration the <b>bolt</b> <b>stays</b> forward and the amount of delay between shots fired. The first two switches control how long the bolt remains in the firing position. The second two switches control the length of delay between shots in order to allow a ball to fall into the breech and be fired. The combination of these two settings determines the maximum rate of fire for the Matrix.|$|R
40|$|The European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) {{utilizes}} pine as {{its host}} during larval development. Females drill through pine bark to deposit eggs, a symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum, and phytotoxic mucus into the tree. In their native range, these insects are not viewed as primary pests because they attack dead or dying trees. Over the last century, this woodwasp has been accidentally introduced into several {{countries in the}} southern hemisphere. Some regions have incurred {{millions of dollars in}} damage to large plantations of the widely planted pine species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Sirex noctilio was discovered in northeastern United States and Canada in 2004. Prior studies have focused on damage done to pine stands in the southern hemisphere and, because those pines are not native, these studies may not be applicable to native pines in the U. S. The southeastern U. S. contains millions of hectares of possibly susceptible pine trees and, thus it is advisable to study the native Arkansas woodwasp, S. nigricornis F., (as a species with similar biology) in preparation for a possible invasion by its exotic counterpart. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine how shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) logs (bolts) in moderate drought conditions of Arkansas lose moisture over time, and 2) determine oviposition preferences of Sirex nigricornis females in aging pine bolts. To complete these objectives, shortleaf pines were felled and moisture content was measured over a period of 45 days. Moisture content results were used to create parameters for oviposition choice experiments. After a cross-sectional cut was made, the most moisture loss occurs within 3 - 4 cm of bolt ends while the center of the <b>bolt</b> <b>stays</b> consistent during this time period. Females prefer to oviposit in recently cut bolts. Using these results, trap tree methods can be altered to create more efficient methods of siricid capture and laboratory rearing...|$|R
