5|$|While {{driving through}} {{a rural area}} in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more {{offended}} by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out one of their headlights and then planting a bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where {{they are forced to}} perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay in the jail supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay has been extended an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides {{to break out of the}} prison when the prison guards's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and <b>shackle</b> keys.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and <b>shackle</b> bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E

Additionally, it was argued that the <b>shackles</b> contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|R
40|$|Detained {{children}} routinely {{appear before}} Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s juvenile courts <b>shackled</b> with handcuffs, leg irons, and belly chains. Once security officers bring {{a child to}} court in these <b>shackles,</b> the child usually remains in them for her hearing or trial. In Michigan, {{as in many other}} states, no statute or court rule requires the judge to decide whether <b>shackles</b> are necessary. This Essay argues that Michigan should pass legislation or amend state court rules to create a presumption against <b>shackling</b> children. Unless a child poses a substantial risk of flight or physical danger and less restrictive alternatives to <b>shackling</b> will not adequately address those risks, the child should appear in court without <b>shackles.</b> There are many good reasons to adopt such a presumption. First, Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s current practice serves little purpose: judges can keep courtrooms safe without indiscriminate <b>shackling.</b> Second, <b>shackles</b> flout the rehabilitative goals of juvenile court by humiliating and traumatizing children. Third, <b>shackles</b> cause constitutional harm. They interfere with attorney-client communications, offend the dignity of the judicial process, and erode the presumption of innocence, thus undermining the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Finally, not a single state legislature or appellate court has endorsed indiscriminate child <b>shackling,</b> {{and a growing number of}} states reject the practice...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Shackles</b> are {{typically}} used for inmates, who demonstrate risk of elopement, harm to self, or harm to others. Historically, {{they have also}} been used with women attending prenatal care appointments, as well as during labor and delivery. When used during transit, the use of <b>shackles</b> on the ankles and wrists puts a mother at risk of falling, in which case she {{would be unable to}} reach out to soften the fall. In turn, this could put both the mother and the fetus at risk of injury. <b>Shackles</b> can also interfere with labor and delivery, prohibiting positions and range of motion for the mother, doctors, and nurses. [...] Following delivery, <b>shackles</b> interfere with a mother’s ability to hold and nurse her infant child. In addition, women feel ashamed and discriminated against when they are <b>shackled</b> in a community hospital. [...] Eighteen states in the US currently have laws either prohibiting or restricting <b>shackling</b> pregnant prisoners, and ten states prohibit use of <b>shackles</b> by law. [...] As a result, it is still common practice in some places.|$|R

Ultimately, the defense felt that the <b>shackling</b> of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning <b>shackling</b> made a difference in the decision that the jury made.

50|$|The use of <b>shackles</b> or {{restraints}} on pregnant women {{is still a}} common practice in prisons and jails in the United States. <b>Shackling</b> is defined as “using any physical restraint of mechanical device to control the movement of a prisoner’s body or limbs, including handcuffs, leg <b>shackles,</b> and belly chains.” For females, <b>shackles</b> or handcuffs are placed around the ankles, wrists or around the stomach. The <b>shackling</b> of pregnant women occurs while they are being moved around the facility, in transport to a hospital, and/or during and after childbirth. Outside of prisons and jails, {{there has also been}} attention generated around the use of <b>shackles</b> on detained pregnant women in immigration detention facilities.Pregnant women, girls, fetuses and newborns under correctional custody have unique healthcare needs. These needs are typically not addressed by most custody policies. This puts these women and girls at high-risk pregnancies because they are exposed to lack of obstetric care, lack of adequate nutrition, physical and emotional abuse, traumatic experiences, mental health issues, sexually transmitted infections, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} human rights community has repeatedly {{expressed concern about the}} <b>shackling</b> of pregnant women deprived of their liberty in the United States. The federal government has adopted an anti-shackling policy and some states have passed laws or policies restricting <b>shackling.</b> Despite these positive developments, <b>shackling</b> of women prisoners continues to occur in violation of U. S. and international law. <b>Shackling</b> pregnant women increases the substantial medical risks of childbirth. <b>Shackling</b> of pregnant women is a harmful, painful, and demeaning practice that is rarely necessary to preserve safety. Most female prisoners are non-violent offenders, and women who are pregnant, in labor, or in postpartum recovery are especially low flight and safety risks. Both international law and U. S. constitutional law prohibit <b>shackling</b> during certain stages of pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum recovery. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the "ICCPR") guarantees that persons deprived of their liberty be treated with dignity and respect. Article 7 prohibits torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The Eighth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibits cruel or unusual punishments, which some Federal courts have interpreted to prohibit the <b>shackling</b> of pregnant prisoners during childbirth. While the U. S. federal government has adopted an anti-shackling policy that applies to federal prisons and 24 states have adopted policies limiting (to varying degrees) <b>shackling</b> of pregnant prisoners, legislation enacted by state legislatures is preferable to the adoption of an administrative policy by the executive. Indeed, 18 state legislatures in the United States have in fact passed legislation restricting <b>shackling,</b> but many such laws contain broad exceptions or are not adequately implemented. We recommend that the UN Human Rights Committee (the "Committee") that monitors compliance with the ICCPR ask and encourage the United States to 1) enact a federal law banning the practice of <b>shackling</b> prisoners during pregnancy, covering, at a minimum, the third trimester, transport to medical facilities, labor, delivery and postpartum recovery, 2) take appropriate measures to ensure that those 32 states that do not have anti-shackling laws to enact comprehensive laws, including training of correctional officers, 3) to review existing state anti-shackling laws and policies to ensure that they are comprehensive and fully-implemented, and 4) to conduct an empirical study to determine the scope of <b>shackling</b> in U. S. prisons and to understand why the practice of <b>shackling</b> pregnant women persists...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure {{occurred}} on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire <b>shackle</b> at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, {{as well as all}} of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220kV line, the only major line supplying the region. Transpower spent $1.25billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220kV initially), and 220kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD. These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "No Man's Land" [...] {{was directed by}} long-time collaborator Ryuji Seki. The music video was shot with Koda {{in front of a}} green screen to immolate the chroma key functions. Koda, who was present at post-production for the music video, suggested the use of black and white colouring, which Seki then added. This is Koda's first music video to be in full black and white. The video opens with a distance shot of a wasteland, with decaying trees, floating black leaves, and hills. Koda is seen dragging herself through the valley, and an inter cut scene features a body shot of Koda in front of an abandoned city and abandoned merry-go-round; the merry-go-round references the lyric in the song. As the first hook stars in the song, it features two scenes; Koda singing the track in a distance, and close-ups of Koda wearing a <b>shackle.</b> The verse has Koda wondering through a valley and singing the song.|$|E
500|$|Salih {{was among}} those {{tortured}} by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her. Zakkar writes {{that it is not}} known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, [...] "an energetic and bold" [...] emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab. Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one <b>shackle</b> still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe {{for the remainder of the}} night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq.

500|$|A six-inch manilla rope {{was passed}} from the tanker's stern to the destroyer's midship oiling bollard, the idea being to take the stern to port, whilst the {{minesweeper}} [...] towed her; but Ledbury put on too much weight and the minesweeper's tow parted. Penn then asked Ledbury to take the tanker in tow from ahead, which was done, using the tanker's tow and a <b>shackle</b> of Ledburys towing hawser-cable. Rye took the destroyer in tow to keep the ship from falling off, whilst Penn went alongside the starboard side of the tanker {{to act as a}} drag to keep her straight. Ledburys gunner, {{who was in charge of}} the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain. In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crews brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour.|$|E
