40|$|Using {{a number}} of {{different}} homeostatic control mechanisms in the brain and peripheral physiological systems, metabolic activity is continuously regulated at rest and during exercise to prevent catastrophic system failure. Essential for the function of these regulatory processes are baseline “setpoint” levels of metabolic function, which can be used to calculate the level of response required for the maintenance of system homeostasis after system perturbation, and to which the perturbed metabolic activity levels are returned to {{at the end of the}} regulatory process. How these setpoint levels of all the different metabolic variables in the different peripheral physiological systems are created and maintained, and why they are similar in different individuals, has not been well explained. In this article, putative system regulators of metabolic setpoint levels are described. These include that: (i) innate <b>setpoint</b> <b>values</b> are stored in a certain region of the central nervous system, such as the hypothalamus; (ii) <b>setpoint</b> <b>values</b> are created and maintained as a response to continuous external perturbations, such as gravity or “zeitgebers”, (iii) <b>setpoint</b> <b>values</b> are created and maintained by complex system dynamical activity in the different peripheral systems, where setpoint levels are regulated by the ongoing feedback control activity between different peripheral variables; (iv) human anatomical and biomechanical constraints contribute to the creation and maintenance of metabolic setpoints values; or (v) a combination of all these four different mechanisms occurs. Exercise training and disease processes can affect these metabolic <b>setpoint</b> <b>values,</b> but the <b>setpoint</b> <b>values</b> are returned to pre-training or pre-disease levels if the training stimulus is removed or if the disease process is cured.

5000|$|A {{system can}} either be {{described}} as a MIMO system, having multiple inputs and outputs, therefore requiring more than one controller; or a SISO system, consisting of a single input and single output, hence having only a single controller. Depending on the set-up of the physical (or non-physical) system, adjusting the system's input variable (assuming it is SISO) will affect the operating parameter, otherwise known as the controlled output variable. Upon receiving the error signal that marks the disparity between the desired value (setpoint) and the actual output value, the controller will then attempt to regulate controlled output behaviour. The controller achieves this by either attenuating or amplifying the input signal to the plant so that the output is returned to the setpoint. For example, a simple feedback control system, such as the one shown on the right, will generate an error signal that's mathematically depicted as the difference between the <b>setpoint</b> <b>value</b> and the output value, r-y. [...] This signal describes the magnitude by which the output value deviates from the setpoint.

Instead of the conventional scenario of noise amplitude ({{in the case of}} SR) or chaotic signal amplitude (in the case of DR) variation, a tunable system parameter ("a" in the case of FitzHugh-Nagumo model and the damping coefficient "j" in the bistable model) is regulated. The operating values of these parameters are defined as the "setpoint" of the system throughout the present work. Our results indicate that there exists an optimal <b>value</b> of the <b>setpoint</b> for which maximum information transfer between the input and the output signals takes place. This information transfer from the input subthreshold signal to the output dynamics is quantified by the normalised cross-correlation coefficient (vertical bar CCC vertical bar). vertical bar CCC vertical bar {{as a function of the}} setpoint exhibits a unimodal variation which is characteristic of SR (or DR). Furthermore, vertical bar CCC vertical bar is computed for a grid of noise (or chaotic signal) amplitude and <b>setpoint</b> <b>values.</b> The heat map of vertical bar CCC vertical bar over this grid yields the presence of a resonance region in the noise-setpoint plane for which the maximum enhancement of the input sub-threshold signal is observed.
