40|$|Concerns {{about social}} status are {{ubiquitous}} during adolescence, {{with information about}} social status often conveyed in text formats. Depressed adolescents may show alterations in the functioning of neural systems supporting processing of social status information. We examined whether depressed youth exhibited altered neural activation to social <b>status</b> <b>words</b> in temporal and prefrontal cortical regions thought {{to be involved in}} social cognitive processing, and whether this response was associated with development. Forty-nine adolescents (ages 10 â 18; 35 female), including 20 with major depressive disorder and 29 controls, were scanned while identifying the valence of words that connoted positive and negative social status. Results indicated that depressed youth showed reduced late activation to social <b>status</b> (vs neutral) <b>words</b> in the superior temporal cortex (STC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC); whereas healthy youth did not show any significant differences between word types. Depressed youth also showed reduced late activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and fusiform gyrus to negative (vs positive) social status words; whereas healthy youth showed the opposite pattern. Finally, age was positively associated with MPFC activation to social <b>status</b> <b>words.</b> Findings suggest that hypoactivation in the âsocial cognitive brain networkâ might be implicated in altered interpersonal functioning in adolescent depression.

Responses were faster on validly than on invalidly cued trials. In Experiment 3, the target was sometimes accompanied by irrelevant stimuli {{on the other side}} of fixation; in such cases, responses were slowed (a spatial filtering effect). Both cuing and filtering effects on response time were additive with effects of word frequency and lexical <b>status</b> (<b>words</b> vs. nonwords). These findings are difficult to reconcile with claims that spatial attention is less involved in processing familiar words than in unfamiliar words and nonwords. The results can be reconciled with a late-selection locus of spatial attention only with difficulty, but are easily explained by early-selection models...|$|R

40|$|System {{controllers}} must be fail-safe, low cost, flexible to software changes, able {{to output}} health and <b>status</b> <b>words,</b> and permit rapid retest qualification. The system controller designed and {{tested for the}} aerospike engine program {{was an attempt to}} meet these requirements. This paper describes (1) the aerospike controller design, (2) the automated simulation testing techniques, and (3) the real time monitoring data visualization structure. Controller cost was minimized by design of a single-string system that used an off-the-shelf 486 central processing unit (CPU). A linked-list architecture, with states (nodes) defined in a userfriendly state table, accomplished software changes to the controller. Proven to be fail-safe, this system reported the abort cause and automatically reverted to a safe condition for any first failure. A real time simulation and test system automated the software checkout and retest requirements. A program requirement to decode all abort causes in real time du [...] ...|$|R
