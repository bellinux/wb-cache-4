[...] Yahoo Music gave [...] saying: With 11 number ones <b>so</b> far, it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they all stand up next to each other. Sure, 'Flying Without Wings' is a talent show staple, 'My Love' is great in a-bit-like-'Chicago' kinda way, and even 'If I Let You Go' is eminently more memorable than their debut 'Swear It Again', 'Fool Again' or 'Bop Bop Baby'. In fact, take away the obvious can't-fail covers of 'I Have A Dream', 'Uptown Girl', and make the boys look {{slightly}} uglier, and Westlife would have been lucky to get anywhere near the top ten with some of these tunes. A special mention must go out to the sadism of 'Against All Odds' though: Westlife + Mariah Carey + A Phil Collins song = pure evil, anyone?You get a taster of their new direction with the six (Six!) bonus new tracks, including the title track and new smash 'Unbreakable' and a version of Sir Clifford's 'Miss You Nights', which is this year's Christmas single. Hurrah, eh? Of the rest, it's a case of if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Westlife have certainly found their niche in pop, and by statistics alone look like becoming one of the all-time greats. It's just a shame the actual musical legacy displayed here is so wet and uninspiring.|$|R

This episode, in particular, is a welcome return to a more old school Simpsons storytelling style, capable of being both comical, and, in its own bizarro way, touching. With the advent of South Park and other edgy animated sitcoms, it's easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how The Simpsons felt pressured to drop its sense of sentiment and go for more outlandish gags, <b>so</b> it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> occasionally <b>see</b> the softer side of Homer.
