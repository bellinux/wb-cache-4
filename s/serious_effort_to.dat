Dubourdieu {{was considered one of}} the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the Adriatic into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful watch on the French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos now {{undertook}} a <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> relieve Sicily: he assembled a large army {{and placed it}} {{under the command of}} his son-in-law, the Caesar Alexios Mousele. Mousele arrived in Sicily in spring 838, in time to relieve the fortress of Cefalù from a Muslim attack. Mousele scored a number of successes against Muslim raiding parties but, back in Constantinople, his enemies launched accusations of contacts with the Arabs and designs on the throne. Furthermore, the death of his infant wife, Maria, cut his link to Theophilos, and the Emperor sent the archbishop of Syracuse, Theodore Krithinos, to recall the Caesar to Constantinople in 839.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E

25|$|Scotland (Caledonia), {{including}} England {{north of}} Hadrian's Wall, remained mostly outside {{the boundaries of}} Britannia province, as the Romans never succeeded in subjugating the entire island, despite a <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> do so by governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 82–84 AD. However, the Romans maintained a system of forts in the lowland region ca. 80–220 AD to control the indigenous population beyond Hadrian's Wall and annexed the Lowlands briefly {{with the construction of}} the Antonine Wall in 164.

25|$|Relations {{improved}} considerably {{under the}} governments of Ziaur Rahman and Hossain Mohammad Ershad in Bangladesh, which had grown more distant from its usual allies, like India and Russia. Five Pakistani heads of government have made official visits to Bangladesh since the 1980s and numerous trade and cultural agreements have been signed. Common concerns over terrorism have influenced strategic cooperation leading to a gift of several squadrons of F-6 fighter aircraft to the Bangladesh Air Force in the late 1980s {{although there was no}} <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> maintain them as they were later left to be destroyed by a cyclone. Trade between the two countries currently stands at $340 million which was described by the Deputy High Commissioner of Bangladesh, Ruhul Alam Siddique as 'negligible when taking into account the combined population' (of both countries). Areas he hoped would induce investment from Pakistan to Bangladesh included the textiles and energy sectors.|$|E
25|$|The first {{trademark}} {{application for}} UGG in the United States was filed by Brian Smith’s company in 1984.

By the early 2000s, demand for UGG boots was soaring with Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers selling sheepskin boots over the Internet. There was confusion among consumers between generic ugg boots made in Australia and Deckers' UGG brand boots. Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> halt the Australian companies' sales by sending cease and desist letters {{to a number of}} Australian and U.S. based manufacturers, preventing them from selling sheepskin boots using the UGG trademark on eBay or from using the word in their registered business names or domain names.

The French Navy had never recovered from defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and had made no <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> put to sea since the abortive attempt which ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809. British control of the Atlantic Ocean trade routes was at this stage only contested by the small United States Navy and the handful of French raiders capable of evading the Royal Navy's constant close blockade of French ports, which had operated effectively and almost continuously since {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary Wars in 1793.|$|E

By 30 November military units and royalist militia (the epistratoi, [...] "reservists") from surrounding areas had been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 men) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon. The Allied commanders failed in their assessment of the situation, disregarding Greek national pride and determination, causing them to conclude that the Greeks were bluffing.

Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of Jose Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that [...] "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.|$|E

500|$|As {{chair of}} the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that {{continue}} to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional {{changes taking place in}} both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s [...] "New Politics" [...] found its culmination in McGovern's nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, [...] "We made a <b>serious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon as we did, half the Democrats walked out." [...] SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had [...] "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire...

500|$|The second, more {{fundamental}} rift, concerned {{a discussion about}} whether NATO should form close relationships with countries far beyond NATO's borders, in particular Australia, Japan and South Korea. The United States and some other NATO members pressed for a closer relationship with these countries. R.

Australia, South Korea and Japan are in Afghanistan. They have all been in Iraq (...) [...] in the Balkans." [...] It was however not clear how far this plan would have gone in practice, but the US insisted they were not seeking to turn NATO into a global alliance: membership would not be offered to the prospective new partners. The idea of a [...] "global" [...] NATO however was strongly opposed by France, which considers NATO a regional defence alliance that should not spread its wings too far over the globe. The French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie summarized the position of France as follows: [...] "The development of a global partnership could... dilute the natural solidarity between Europeans and North Americans in a fuzzy entity [...] send a bad political message, that of a campaign launched by the West against those who don't share their ideas. What a pretext we would offer to those who promote the idea of a clash of civilisations."
