5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy <b>service</b> <b>record</b> in the Senate. Long {{went on to win the}} election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E
5|$|A minimum term {{of service}} of 25 years was established, {{at the end}} of which the {{retiring}} auxiliary soldier, and all his children, were awarded Roman citizenship. This is deduced from the fact that the first known Roman military diplomas date from the time of Claudius. This was a folding bronze tablet engraved with the details of the soldier's <b>service</b> <b>record,</b> which he could use to prove his citizenship. Claudius also decreed that prefects of auxiliary regiments must all be of equestrian rank, thus excluding centurions from such commands. The fact that auxiliary commanders were now all of the same social rank as most tribuni militum, (military tribunes, a legion's senior staff officers, all of whom only one, the tribunus laticlavius, was of the higher senatorial rank), probably indicates that auxilia now enjoyed greater prestige. Indigenous chiefs continued to command some auxiliary regiments, and were probably granted equestrian rank for the purpose. It is also likely that auxiliary pay was standardised at this time, but we only have estimates for the Julio-Claudian period.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, {{he claims to have}} been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his {{military}} <b>service</b> <b>record</b> has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (née Jeffery), both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This {{achievement}} earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht.
