The new monarch preferred his German and Italian courtiers and set aside the native lords, including Samuel. In 1041, discontented Hungarian noblemen expelled King Peter in a coup d'état and elected Samuel king.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion and {{the events}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>it</b> have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction.

Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E
