25|$|The {{week before}} the game, players, {{particularly}} on offense, had complained to reporters about the team's assistant coaches. Head coach John McVay was popular with them. He {{had taken over the}} team {{in the middle of the}} 1976 season after Bill Arnsparger was fired and improved morale while adding talented players to the team. However, the players were not so enthusiastic about many of the longtime friends he had hired as assistants. The players felt the assistant coaches were uninterested in helping younger players develop, at least compared to their counterparts on other teams. As an example, they pointed out that the season before, none of the team's three quarterbacks had had any previous NFL experience, yet no quarterback coach had been hired. They also noted that one of the few coaches who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> Jerry Wampfler, coached the offensive line, one of the Giants' most improved units that season.|$|E
500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E

The sisters probed further, and asked Police if they knew who Jack's male companion was, but Police did not know and were not looking into it. Jen described the Police's attitude as 'shocking' and she was taken aback at how little the Police <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about finding the man Jack was with.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955 Cradock {{recorded}} a pilot for what became {{a very successful}} BBC television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving {{a detailed account of}} every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, [...] "You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now." [...] Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about her audience. Her catchphrases included [...] "This won't break you", [...] "This is perfectly economical", and [...] "This won't stretch your purse". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying [...] "But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Chappell {{alleged that}} he was a victim of a [...] "racist attack" [...] at the Bhubaneshwar Airport in January 2007 when a fan [...] "whacked him" [...] behind his ear, and accused the BCCI of {{covering}} up the issue. He also went on to say, [...] "As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> The reply came back talking about my racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also provided us with support." [...] Chappell later downplayed the incident saying his comments came at [...] "an emotional time".|$|E

In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> even less for me. In writing the stuff it seemed that I had {{committed}} acts that were, to say the least, derogatory. 'Get a job,' everybody said." ...|$|E
