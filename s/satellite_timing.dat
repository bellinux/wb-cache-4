40|$|The {{technology}} of time transmission in many {{fields such as}} the scientific research, military and the economic development is widely used. With the development of science and technology, the demand of many fields to time accuracy {{is more and more}} high and the range demanding time synchronization is more and more wide. So the timing technology is also rapidly developed. By making use of a radio signal, time transferring and the service of comparing time is widely carried out and Loran-C system is a representative. With the development of space technology, the method of making use of a satellite to transfer and compare time is already commonly applied. Since the satellite time service system has so many advantages, it gradually replaces original time service system in many fields. During the process of <b>satellite</b> <b>timing</b> service, <b>satellite</b> <b>timing</b> receivers affect the timing accuracy. <b>Satellite</b> <b>timing</b> receivers have been improved by the digitization technology, but the high speed of processing signal and the requirement of crystal oscillators that have high performance make receivers expensive. The goal of dissertation is to improve receivers by using the digital signal processing algorithm on the receiver and receiver hardware demand is not raised. The main contents of work are submitted as follows: 1. The algorithms about processing signal in spread spectrum communication system, comparing the signal from satellite navigation system and the signal from the normal spread spectrum communication system, combining carrier recovery algorithms and symbol timing algorithms to select the algorithms of <b>satellite</b> <b>timing</b> receivers, analyzing the hardware structure and timing applying module on <b>satellite</b> <b>timing</b> receiver. 2. The theory base on digital signal processing is introduced in detail. The algorithms on FFT correlation method and matched filter method on searching algorithm, feed-forward tracking algorithm, the frequency locked loop, phase locked loop and non-coherent delay locked loop on the tracking algorithm and the performance about the loop filter are elaborated. The formulas and the simulation on algorithms are also given. 3. Extended research is performed {{on the basis of the}} existing algorithms. the feasible way on enhancing timing performance of timing receivers through the technical change of receivers is provided. The research includes that the estimation of the sampling frequency offset is completed by using the code tracking loop and the accuracy of the estimated carrier phase is also enhanced, the difference of many transforming ways from analog domain to digital domain, two running way on the tracking code loop, the method of non-integral sampling is used to enhance the accuracy of local code phase. 4. The actual satellite signal is also used to carry on the confirmation on the algorithms and the above-mentioned algorithms are also confirmed by using the DSP hardware platform. The contents that should simultaneously be paid attention to are described when the algorithms are transformed from Matlab language to C language in the DSP hardware platform. The above-mentioned results provide general theoretical references and a good deal of design examples for the enhancement on the performance of <b>satellite</b> <b>timing</b> receivers. 时间传递在科学研究、军事和经济建设等很多领域使用广泛。随着科技的发展，各个领域对时间精度的要求越来越高，要求时间同步的范围越来越广，授时技术也随之得到快速发展。利用无线电信号进行时间传递和比对是一种广泛应用的授时技术，典型代表是罗兰－C系统。随着空间技术的发展，利用卫星进行时间传递和比对的方法已经得到普遍应用，由于卫星授时技术极大扩展了时间同步的工作范围并提高了授时精度，因此卫星授时系统在多个领域逐渐替代原有的授时系统。 在卫星授时过程中，卫星定时接收机的性能影响着定时精度。随着数字化技术的快速发展，卫星定时接收机借助数字化技术极大的提高了性能。但是由于数字化技术对接收机中晶体振荡器以及数字器件处理速度的高要求，使得接收机的成本居高不下。本文旨在通过对接收机涉及的数字信号处理算法的创新使得接收机在提高性能的同时不提高对接收机硬件要求，表现在降低了晶体振荡器的准确度要求以及数字信号的处理速度，提高卫星定时接收机的性价比。本文研究的主要内容如下： 1. 扩频通信系统中信号处理算法的相关内容。分析导航卫星信号的特点，比较导航卫星信号与一般扩频信号的异同，结合通用的载波恢复算法和符号定时算法选择卫星定时接收机中相关算法，分析卫星定时接收机的硬件结构和系统中的定时应用单元； 2. 详细分析数字信号处理算法涉及的理论基础，对捕获算法中的FFT 相关法和匹配滤波器法、前向跟踪算法、反馈跟踪算法中的锁频环、锁相环、非相干延迟锁定环、多阶环路的性能及环路对应的算法公式等内容进行了理论分析和算法验证； 3. 在现有算法基础上做扩展性和补充性研究，为通过对接收机自身的技术改进来提高定时性能提供了可行途径。研究包括利用码跟踪环路完成采样频率偏差的估计以提高载波相位值的准确度、环路滤波器数字转换过程中不同等效方式之间的差异、码跟踪环两种运行方式之间的差异、利用非整数倍采样原理在不提高采样率的前提下提高码相位跟踪的准确度等； 4. 利用实际的卫星采样信号和DSP硬件平台对算法进行性能验证和硬件验证，分析在DSP硬件平台上进行算法移植时所应注意的相关内容。 上述方面的研究为提高卫星定时接收机的有关性能提供了丰富的理论依据和设计参考...|$|E

Epochs of phase zero for the 3. 9 day orbit were determined for 1987 May, 1988 August, and 1989 August with accuracies of 13, 0. 6, and 3 s, respectively. These epochs are combined with two previous determinations of the orbital epoch to yield the rate of change in the orbital period dot-P(orb) /P(orb) = (3. 36 +/- 0. 02) x 10 (exp - 6) yr(exp - 1). An interpretation of the orbital decay is made in the context of tidal evolution, with consideration of the influence of the increasing moment of inertia of the companion star due to its nuclear evolution. We find that, while the orbital decay is probably driven by tidal interactions, the asynchronism between the orbit and the rotation of the companion star is most likely maintained by the evolutionary expansion of the companion star (Sk 160) rather than via the Darwin instability. In this case Sk 160 is likely to be in the hydrogen shell burning phase of its evolution. Finally, a discussion is presented of the relation among the time scales for stellar evolution (less than 10 (exp 7) yr), orbital decay (3 x 10 (exp 5) yr), and neutron-star spin-up in the SMC X- 1 system (2000 yr). In particular, we present the result of a self-consistent calculation for the histories of the spin of the neutron star and the mass transfer in this system. A plausible case can be made for the spin-up time scale being directly related to the lifetime of the luminous X-ray phase which will end in a common-envelope phase within a time of less than approx. 10 (exp 4) yr...|$|E

To achieve this objective we designed and implemented a distributed system composed of two main modules which are interconnected: a distributed application responsible for the establishment of the data link over the Internet between the remote DGPS stations and the campus, and the campus-wide DGPS data server application. The DGPS data Internet link is provided by a two-tier client/server distributed application where the server-side is connected to the DGPS station and the client-side is located at the campus. The second unit, the campus DGPS data server application, diffuses DGPS data received at the campus via the Intranet and via a wireless data link. The wireless broadcast is intended for DGPS/GPS portable receivers equipped with an air interface and the Intranet link is provided for DGPS/GPS receivers with just a RS 232 DGPS data interface. While the DGPS data Internet link servers receive the DGPS data from the DGPS base stations and forward it to the DGPS data Internet link client, the DGPS data Internet link client outputs the received DGPS data to the campus DGPS data server application.

From archival Swift/X-ray telescope observations, we also show that the dynamic range from non-detection to highest level of measured X-ray activity is> 300. Our imager on board the lntegral <b>satellite</b> (IBIS) <b>timing</b> analysis strongly confirms the ∼ 8. 4 d orbital period previously detected with Swift/burst alert telescope (BAT); in addition we show that the shape of the orbital profile is rather smooth and appears to be dominated by low-level X-ray emission rather than by bright outbursts; the measured degree of outburst recurrence is ∼ 25 per cent. The spectral and temporal charac-teristics of IGR J 17354 − 3255 are highly indicative of a supergiant high-mass X-ray binary (SGXB) nature. However, our inferred dynamic ranges in both soft and hard X-rays are signif-icantly greater than those of classical SGXB systems, but instead are typical of intermediate supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs). Finally, we note {{for the first time that}} the observed fast flaring X-ray behaviour of IGR J 17354 − 3255 is very similar to that detected with AGILE from the spatially associated MeV source AGL J 1734 − 3310, suggesting a possible physical link between the two objects...|$|R
40|$|The {{sea breeze}} (SB) is a {{thermally}} induced boundary layer phenomenon that occurs at coastal locations throughout the world. Previous satellite remote sensing studies used low-level clouds formed over the sea-breeze convergence zones {{to identify the}} SB. In this study continuous thermal infrared data from a geostationary satellite (Meteosat Second Generation) and concurrent field measurements were used to detect and characterize the SB in clear sky conditions during the summer. Surface data (wind speed and direction) from 11 sites over Israel for ten summer days in July 2010 for three different synoptic circulation categories were selected. In order {{to assess the impact}} of the synoptic induced flow on the SB, we looked for the best agreement between surface and <b>satellite</b> SB <b>timing.</b> An independent classification of synoptic categories performed for the ten summer days revealed two distinct patterns of the SB. During weak horizontal pressure gradient (Weak Persian Trough and High to the West), which enables full development of the SB, the timing of the SB from satellite and field measurements were well correlated (R 2 = 0. 75), as compared to unfavorable atmospheric conditions (Deep Persian Trough) yielding lower value (R 2 = 0. 5). The SB was identified by surface measurements in an earlier time of the day, with respect to the satellite column integrated measurements. Visualizing timing of the SB retrieved from satellite data enabled distinction of SB behavior under different synoptic categories. Over desert regions the strong thermal contrast enables detection of the SB even under suppressing synoptic conditions (Deep Persian Trough). This method enables detection and timing of the SB over desert regions where clouds and field measurements are scarce, and is applicable worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Galileo, the European backed <b>satellite</b> {{positioning}} and <b>timing</b> system, broadcasts navigation {{messages in}} three bands, called E 1, E 5, E 6. The signal structure {{selected for the}} E 5 band is an AltBOC(15, 10) {{and this is the}} most promising signal in terms of performance in multipath environments but also the most challenging for a receiver because of its wide bandwidth (51. 150 MHz). In this paper the differences and the similarities will be shown between the conventional AltBOC signal structure and that proposed for Galileo E 5 signal. It is calculated the exact autocorrelation function of the unfiltered signal and proposed a method for the generation of the samples of that signal useful for simulations or for software receivers. It will be shown that it is possible the acquisition of the wide-band overall signal only with a complex pilot signal by means of an FFT-based technique. It will also be presented the code discriminator of the AltBOC(15, 10) signal, and a possible way for a joint demodulation of data signals. It is provided the bit error rate of the implemented system...|$|R
