40|$|We {{examine the}} in-roads {{commercial}} banks have made into equity underwriting over 1990 - 2002. While banks end the period handling upwards of 25 % <b>of</b> equity <b>underwriting,</b> this increase results almost exclusively from acquisitions of investment banks with an already established market <b>share</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>underwriting.</b> We find a significant {{decline in the}} market <b>share</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>underwriting</b> that banks acquired in the post-merger period, a decline that is larger than that experienced by independent investment banks of comparable reputation. Banks lose market share because they originate fewer IPOs and their IPOs have a lower incidence of follow-on SEOs compared to independent investment banks. Following the merger, banks experience a large fall off {{in their ability to}} retain follow-on SEOs and are less successful in winning SEO mandates when an issuer switches from its IPO underwriter. Overall, the findings suggest it has been difficult for banks to achieve scope economies in equity underwriting. Equity issuance Investment banking Scope expansion...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the records}} of several leading 19 th century issuing houses, this paper {{analyses}} the transformation <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> practices in London's primary sovereign bond market from 1870 to 1914. It shows how underwriting risk developed from being a liability, which market intermediaries sought to avoid, to becoming a valuable financial commodity. The impetus for this development was increased competition in the loan business from the 1880 s onwards, which weakened the negotiating position of issuing houses and forced them to shoulder an increasing <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the <b>underwriting</b> risk. Issuing houses had to find methods {{to deal with this}} risk, but they were initially hamstrung by public perception <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> as detrimental to the interests of ordinary investors. Firms began to adopt informal underwriting arrangements, with limited scope, but these only allowed for a relatively limited distribution <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> risk to third parties, the danger of which was exposed during the Baring crisis. Consequently formal underwriting syndicates were developed, allowing for a greater dissemination <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> risk. This meant that the risk associated with issuing loans could be broken down into sufficiently small tranches so that no underwriter had to shoulder a risk greater than what he desired. As a result underwriting risk came {{to be seen as a}} profitable investment opportunity, a financial commodity in its own right, and a means of patronage for issuing houses...|$|R
30|$|Panel B of Table 4 further {{presents}} the OLS results {{used to analyze}} the effects of entrepreneurs’ possession of foreign residency rights on post-IPO 3 -year BHAR. A main variable of interest in the regression models is an indicator variable, TREATED, which takes the value 1 if the sample firm has at least one leaving entrepreneur among its controlling persons and 0 otherwise. Market-adjusted underpricing, firm size, ROA, leverage and IPO offer size are also included in our regression model to control for firm fundamental characteristics. We include an indicator variable, LEADUNDERWRITER, to control for the effects of lead underwriter on BHAR, which equals 1 if the sample firm is <b>underwritten</b> by one <b>of</b> top 10 underwriters that are ranked according to the market <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>underwritten</b> new <b>share</b> issues in the previous year. We also include industry (classified by China Securities Regulatory Commission, CSRC) and year fixed effects. The coefficient on TREATED in Column (1), which uses full sample firms in the regression, is −[*] 17.6 % and is significant at the 1 % level, indicating that compared with firms controlled by staying entrepreneurs, those firms controlled by leaving entrepreneurs are more likely to perform worse in the long run. The above result is consistent with our univariate analysis. All other variables in the regression model are loaded with coefficients that are generally consistent with theoretical predictions. For example, firms with greater underpricing, larger firm size and higher IPO offer size are more likely to perform worse in the long run, but firms underwritten by lead underwriters tend to perform better in the long run, which corroborates the theory of lead underwriter certification (Carter et al. 1998).|$|R

This characteristic of combined ratios needs further analysis for its impact on underwriting cycles. Practical implications – Traditional concepts <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> cycles, such as predictable cycle lengths and trends, may have changed.

THE PRICING OF UNDERWRITING SERVICES IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL MARKET Recent media releases have placed enormous strains on the credibility <b>of</b> the <b>underwriting</b> industry.

In this study, we provide a first attempt to provide an economic analysis of the determinants <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> fees in the Australia.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} factors influencing the underwriting discount for US Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides new evidence on determinants <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> discounts with a comprehensive dataset of 783 US REIT SEOs from 1996 until June 2010. Ordinary least squares regressions are performed to estimate the effect of the level <b>of</b> representative <b>underwriting</b> along with other potential factors on underwriting discounts. Findings – The study complements the well-documented notion of the economies of scale in SEO underwriting discounts. The equally (value) weighted underwriting discounts averaged 4. 21 per cent (4. 10 per cent) with a declining trend over time. The findings of this study show the statistically and economically significant negative effect of the level <b>of</b> representative <b>underwriting</b> on the underwriting discounts, as well as the significance of the structure <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> syndicate in determining the underwriting discounts. The findings suggest that issuers can minimize the costs of raising secondary equity capital by optimally allocating the underwriting business among the underwriters. Originality/value – This paper adds to the international REIT SEO literature by exploring new evidence behind underwriting discounts. The study includes data before and after the REIT Modernization Act 1999 and during the recent global financial crisis period. <br /...|$|R

We also analyze the relationship between the direct costs (underwriting spreads) and indirect costs (underpricing) of new issues. Among our many results we find an apparent decline in spreads over time, an increased clustering in spreads for both IPOs and SEOs, the dominance of issuer- specific characteristics in explaining spreads, and a relatively weak linkage between the direct and indirect costs of issuance. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to develop the {{framework}} for an underwriting system for excess of loss reinsurance. A system is constructed and tested which builds on the strengths but avoids the most important practical limitations of existing judgemental or scientific methods. Key issues in the proposed method are the identification <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> decision criteria {{in the face of}} uncertainty and the important influence of the market in the decision process. The research involves the following stages. Firstly,. a conceptual framework is provided for tackling the problem effectively in a flexible but comprehensive manner. Secondly, a rigorous empirical examination <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> activities over a four year period is undertaken on data collected from an excess <b>of</b> loss <b>underwriting</b> agency operating in the London Market. Thirdly, from relationships established in the empirical investigation, an underwriting system is devised, subjected to sensitivity analysis, and tested in comparison with the performance of a professional excess of loss underwriter. From the research, the contribution to knowledge is as follows: 1) The first detailed study of excess of loss underwriters' actual decision­ making behaviour is provided; Z) Practical application of risk-theoretic techniques is demonstrated as being negligible among excess of loss un<;lerwriters; 3) Evidence is provided for the existence of a satisficing model for excess <b>of</b> loss <b>underwriting</b> decisions; · 4) An excess <b>of</b> loss. <b>underwriting</b> system based on market heuristics is constructed, tested and evaluated; 5) Wider implications of the fact that real units of trade may differ from how they are perceived by market operators are presented. and discussed.
