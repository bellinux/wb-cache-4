25|$|The {{beginning}} of his first term was marked by a left-wing economic policy based on the 110 Propositions for France and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Left Radical Party. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the SMIC (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, {{the creation of the}} <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth, an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the Auroux Act). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity (Keynesianism), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained monetary policy implemented by the Bank of France. However, unemployment continued to grow, and the franc was devalued three times.|$|E

40|$|A new {{institutional}} reform {{is one of}} the major stakes for the Belgian citizens and enterprises ahead of the regional election of June 2009. Since the general federal election of June 2007 Belgium has been facing new tensions between the two main Communities. On one side, the Flemish Community has been claiming a "great" {{institutional reform}} that would significantly enlarge the competences and fiscal capacity of Regions and Communities. On the other the French-speaking Community is reluctant, fearing that this could further dismantle the federal State and reduce solidarity. The Flemish position was first made official in the Resolutions of the Flemish Parliament of March 1999. They ask the transfer to Regions or Communities of employment policy, including unemployment benefits, health care and family benefits. These new policies would be funded, at decentralised level, by the transfer to Regions or Communities of the income tax, part of the VAT and of the corporation tax, and by the creation of two or three regional or community systems of social security contributions. In this paper the Flemish claims are evaluated in the frame of the so-called "magic square" :autonomy - responsibility - <b>solidarity</b> - <b>tax</b> competition. It is argued that the present-day institutional structure fits the theory of fiscal federalism rather well. Further decentralisation would increase autonomy and responsibility and could create, as the Flemish Community claims, more homogeneous sets of competencies. However it would also affect <b>solidarity</b> and <b>tax</b> competition, and increase drastically the complexity of tax and social legislations and thus increase the administrative burden for multiregional enterprise © De Boeck Université.

25|$|The {{second term}} {{was marked by}} the {{creation}} of the Insertion Minimum Revenue (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the Generalized social tax; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday; the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; the 1990 Gayssot Act on hate speech and Holocaust denial; the Besson law of 1990; the Mermaz Law of 1989;, the introduction of a private childcare allowance; the Urban Orientation Law of 1991; the Arpaillange Act on the financing of political parties; the reform of the penal code; the Matignon Agreements concerning New Caledonia; the Evin Act on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990; and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities. Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand with the building of the Louvre Pyramid, the Channel Tunnel, the Grande Arche at La Défense, the Bastille Opera, the Finance Ministry in Bercy, and the National Library of France.

2500|$|The {{signature}} {{proposal of}} Benoît Hamon was the implementation a {{universal basic income}} for all French citizens, rolled out in stages beginning in 2018, partially funded by a tax levied on property combining the existing property tax (taxe foncière) and the <b>solidarity</b> <b>tax</b> on wealth (ISF), {{in addition to a}} tax on robots to fund social protections in general. Like fellow Socialist dissidents, Hamon criticized the El Khomri labor law and promised to repeal it if elected, and suggested that it be replaced with legislation acknowledging the need for greater social protections, including the right to disconnect and recognizing burnout as an occupational disease. He also proposed to reduce the 35-hour workweek to 32 hours, saying {{that it was time to}} put an end to the [...] "myth" [...] of economic growth.

40|$|Increasing {{tax revenue}} is an {{important}} aspect of development policy as it is associated with sustainable economic development. In order to increase tax compliance, it is vital to understand its determinants. According to the fiscal contract theory, people assent to pay taxes because they value what they gain from it - public services. Tax paying is a horizontal relationship between the citizens and the state. However, focusing especially on income taxation, the vertical relationship between the citizens receives more and more attention. Because paying taxes implies giving up a part of your personal income for the benefit of your co-citizens, taxation becomes a classical collective action dilemma. Thus, the relationship between the citizens becomes an important determinant for tax compliance. The main argument put forward in this thesis is that a society that aims to increase tax compliance should be a socially cohesive society, which includes providing public services, but also values such as social capital, a common national identity and social solidarity. This is of immediate relevance to Sub-Saharan Africa, where there are huge variation in both public service provision and social cohesion, and where it is vital to understand the determinants of tax compliance in order to increase the tax to GDPratio in the region. Using data from the Afrobarometer survey Round 5 (2011 - 2013), this thesis performs a binary logistic cross-country analysis across 28 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The main finding in this thesis is that the traditional approach to the fiscal contract is what matters the most. Additionally, political legitimacy {{is an important}} determinant of tax compliance. However, social cohesion does provide some explanatory power in the sense that social <b>solidarity</b> also increases <b>tax</b> compliance. There is also reason to believe that there are huge differences between the countries, which paves the way for additional research on this topic...|$|R
