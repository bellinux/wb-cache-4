25|$|This deep {{alignment}} station required heavy pylons {{to support}} the vaults. In 1930s, architects were obsessed with relieving passengers' anxiety of being underground, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objectives was to make these pylons look slimmer.

25|$|The {{conception}} of symmetry is {{explained in the}} following way: One imagines a man sitting in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two knees are joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the forehead to the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; {{if they are not}} <b>so,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other 5 samsthanas results.

25|$|By 1901, the Australian colonies were federated and {{formally}} {{joined together}} {{to become the}} Commonwealth of Australia, {{and the federal government}} assumed all defensive responsibilities. The Federation of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 and as of that time the constitution of Australia stated that all defence responsibility was vested in the Commonwealth government. Co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean {{was one of the main}} reasons for federation, and <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first decisions made by the newly formed Commonwealth government was to create the Department of Defence which came into being on 1 March 1901.

500|$|English {{director}} Ken Loach {{has stated}} that the mixture of professional and non-professional actors in Loves of a Blonde had a significant influence on him and other international filmmakers, by creating an atmosphere in which non-professionals {{who live in the}} milieu depicted by the film bring an expertise and authenticity which serves as [...] "a touchstone for everyone else in the film", while professionals bring knowledge of film craft, which can be helpful to their inexperienced colleagues.

[...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|The word Vellarai means white rock. Owing to the {{presence}} of white rocks in the region, the place is historically referred as Thiru Vellara. As per Hindu legend, when Sibi Chakravarthi stayed there with his warriors, a white boar crossed his path. He chased it and the boar hid inside a hole. Markandeya, a sage, was doing penance there and the king narrated the incident to him. The sage asked the king to fill the hole with milk. While doing so, Hindu god Vishnu appeared before them. The sage asked the king to bring 3700 Vaishnavites from the north and build a temple on the site for Vishnu. As requested, the king took 3700 Vaishnavites and started building the temple. While doing <b>so,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vaishnavites was killed in transit and the king was concerned by the accident. Vishnu appeared incognito as Pundarikakshan, a Vaishnavite, and requested to be counted among the 3700. According to another legend Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, performed penance at the temple, and Vishnu appeared before her as Sengamalakannan. The presiding deity has since been called [...] "Thamarai Kannan", meaning the one who has eyes resembling lotus; his consort is called [...] "Pankacha Valli".

The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
