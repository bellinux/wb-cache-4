25|$|The {{pervasive}} noise also severely disrupted {{operations in}} the Edwards AFB control tower by risking vibration damage to <b>sensitive</b> <b>components</b> and forcing air traffic personnel {{to communicate with the}} XF-84H's crew on the flight line by light signals. After numerous complaints, the Air Force Flight Test Center directed Republic to tow the aircraft out on Rogers Dry Lake, far from the flight line, before running up its engine. The test program did not proceed further than the manufacturer's Phase I proving flights; consequently, no USAF test pilots flew the XF-84H. With the likelihood that the engine and equipment failures coupled with the inability to reach design speeds and subsequent instability experienced were insurmountable problems, the USAF cancelled the program in September 1956.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{is to provide a}} device for maintaining the alignment integrity of an alignment <b>sensitive</b> <b>component</b> over a wide range of temperatures. A thermal compensating mount is presented. A cylindrical extension is integrally formed to the alignment <b>sensitive</b> <b>component.</b> Both the extension and component share the same coefficient of thermal expansion. The cylindrical extension is placed into a mounting structure which has a diameter greater than that of the extension. An adhesive secures the cylindrical extension to the mount. The difference between the diameters of the cylindrical extension and the cylindrical receptacle is such that the differential thermal expansion across the extension and the receptacle edges is exactly compensated for by the thermal compensation of the adhesive between them. Accordingly, the alignment <b>sensitive</b> <b>component</b> does not change position when subjected to temperature variations. One application of this invention is laser optical-path folding prisms, which are fixed to the mounting surface by a small amount of epoxy adhesive...|$|R

2500|$|On March 28, 2014, the NHTSA {{announced}} that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S design was making the electric car prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its lithium-ion batteries. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, reduce the severity, frequency, and fire risk of underbody strikes. All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 have the [...] aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield {{designed to protect the}} battery and charging circuitry from being punctured even in very high speed impacts. The new shielding features a hollow aluminum tube to deflect impacting objects, a titanium shield to protect <b>sensitive</b> <b>components</b> from puncture damage, and an aluminum extrusion to absorb impact energy. The new shields, which decrease vehicle range by 0.1%, will be installed free-of-charge in existing Model S vehicles by request or during the next scheduled maintenance. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, [...] "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} a Ca-sensitive {{component of the}} transient outward current, we studied action potentials, isometric tension, and membrane currents (single sucrose gap voltage clamp) of rabbit ventricular heart muscle {{in the presence of}} Ryanodine that selectively blocks the intracellular Ca release. Ryanodine (1 microM) prolonged the post rest (10 s) action potential, abolished the "notch" preceding the plateau phase, and depressed the isometric tension. With the same protocol a diminished transient outward current was measured. Application of 1 mM 4 -aminopyridine in the presence of Ryanodine further prolonged the duration of the action potential, decreased the transient outward current but increased the maximal tension. It is concluded that in rabbit ventricular myocardium both a Ca-dependent component and a 4 -aminopyridine <b>sensitive</b> <b>component</b> compose the transient outward current; however, the 4 -aminopyridine <b>sensitive</b> <b>component</b> is dominating. status: publishe...|$|R
