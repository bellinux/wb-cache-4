5|$|The {{most common}} <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Twenty-six percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed contains this <b>soil</b> <b>series.</b> Much soil and bedrock {{in this series}} has been removed during mining operations. This <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> occurs {{in the southern part}} of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, near tributaries such as Black Creek and Stony Creek.

5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the <b>soil</b> <b>series.</b> Other areas where this <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 I {{studied the}} {{relationship}} of environmental variables to six plant associations on McDonald and Paul M. Dunn Forests. Indirect gradient {{analysis was used to}} determine relationships. The plant associations were developed in a companion study by C. J. Hubbard (1991). McDonald-Dunn Forests are located north and northwest of Corvallis, Oregon. The Forests comprise approximately 11, 000 acres. These lands are owned by Oregon State University and managed by a staff within the College of Forestry. This study, and the companion study by Hubbard (1991), was funded and supported by the Forest management team in order to provide information that would facilitate a more integrated-resource management process. Data for this study was collected on one hundred and fifteen plots stratified to represent the diversity of physiography, <b>soils</b> <b>series,</b> and timber types found within the Forest. Plots were located within as mature a stand condition as could be found, considering past disturbance. Data collected on each 5, 382 square foot plot (500 square meters) included physiography (e. g., elevation, slope, and aspect); vegetation cover (e. g., grass, forbs, shrubs, and trees); and soils (e. g., <b>soils</b> <b>series,</b> texture, and depth). Other variables used in this study were taken from the Forest's 1985 timber inventory. Inventory variables included total live basal area for conifers, periodic annual increment, and height and diameter for conifers. Environmental conditions vary within McDonald and Dunn Forests. Elevations increase generally toward the northwestern portion of McDonald Forest, especially toward McCulloch peak. Elevations decrease toward the southern portion of McDonald Forest. The Dunn Forest has lower elevations than McDonald Forest. Elevations decrease to the north within the Dunn Forest from Forest Peak to the lower Soap Creek drainage. Slope, rock percent, baregroud percent, and gravel percent also increase as elevations increase. There are relationships between environmental variables and plant associations within McDonald-Dunn Forest. The structure and composition of the vegetation occur in response to environmental conditions. Elevation, direction and angle of slope, quality of soil, and especially direct solar radiation share in explaining the variability of vegetative structive and composition within the McDonald-Dunn Forests. The underlying environmental gradient for McDonald-Dunn Forests is a light-influenced gradient. Elevation, slope, aspect, and amount of solar radiation have all interacted for eons to influence the soil development and vegetation gradient as it exists today...|$|R

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 <b>soil</b> <b>series</b> are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs.
