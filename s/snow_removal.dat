5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies.

The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E

Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and <b>snow</b> <b>removal</b> vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with <b>snow</b> <b>removal</b> on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of <b>snow</b> <b>removal.</b> Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E
5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of <b>snow</b> <b>removal</b> for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

40|$|Faghri, ArdeshirFor {{airports}} {{that regularly}} encounter storms with {{snow and ice}} in an average year, <b>removal</b> of this <b>snow</b> and ice is essential for maintaining safe operations. This <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> must not only ensure safe operations but also must be efficient because efficient removal is crucial to reducing airport delays and the resulting cost and impact that a snow storm has on an airport and its surrounding economy. The purpose of this thesis is to assist airports in determining whether they are appropriately managing their <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> resources and applying engineering best practices. Two airports in Europe and two airports in the U. S. that have approximately {{the same amount of}} annual snow fall and handle the same mix and volume array of aircraft have been identified for analysis of their <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> practices. These airports are Frankfurt, Germany and Vienna, Austria in Europe and Philadelphia and Boston in the United States. Data collection and categorization has been done by means of a Microsoft® Excel workbook, consisting of eight worksheets, to model the characteristics of the airport, the ground equipment, the storm, the aircraft and the time of day. This input information, in turn, generates the output consisting of delays and costs associated with a given scenario and allows for comparison with the other airports being studied. The excel workbook has been run on the four airports and on six snow storms. The analysis identifies which airports allocated their resources most efficiently and provides a basis for recommendations to the airports. The model may also be replicated for use by other airports. The thesis concludes that the airports in Europe are more prepared for and have a more efficient <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> strategy than the airports in the United States. Analysis was done for numerous parameters; the cost per passenger, the cost per metric ton of cargo, and the cost per hour that the pieces of equipment were in use. For most of the analysis parameters, Vienna International Airport was the most efficient. University of Delaware, Department of Civil EngineeringM. C. E...|$|R
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after <b>snow</b> <b>removal.</b> The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of concern by county {{engineers}} and supervisors over constrained budgets, lack of resources and a deteriorating infrastructure, as they affect the secondary road system in Iowa. In addition, public input and/or political pressure have been increasing over the years. This study was initiated to determine the most important issues facing counties and document the way in which various Iowa counties have been addressing those issues. The list of issues was developed through meetings of county engineers and supervisors in each of the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) regions around the state. Questionnaires were sent to all engineers and supervisors statewide asking them how the various issues (e. g. <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> policies, Level "B" roads, and so on) were handled in their respective counties. The responses were then compiled into this document. The subjects selected and used include: county policies, ordinances, resolutions; <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> policy; dust control; Level "B" roads; vacating roads; rural development; private entrance construction and maintenance; roadside management practices; right of way encroachments and easements; personnel matters, staff and organization; communicating information to citizens; supervisor/ engineer relations; and county leasing/purchasing practices...|$|R

50|$|<b>Snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> also {{decreases}} road slipperiness; snowploughs {{and snow}} blowers can remove the snow {{from the road}} surface while gritters drop road salt and sand, which both melts the snow and ice from the road surface, and provide a rougher surface to grip onto.

50|$|Snowstorms are storms {{where large}} amounts of snow fall. 2 in of snow is enough to create serious {{disruptions}} to traffic and school transport (because of the difficulty to drive and maneuver the school buses on slick roads).

In places where snowfall is typical, such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive, because of effective <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> by municipalities, increased use of four-wheel drive and snow tires, and drivers being more used to winter conditions. Snowfalls in excess of 6 in are usually universally disruptive.|$|R

40|$|Although {{important}} answers {{regarding the}} efficient <b>removal</b> of <b>snow</b> and ice {{reside in the}} domain of good planning and the behavioral sciences, the primary thesis of this paper is that cities can significantly improve their <b>snow</b> and ice <b>removal</b> operations by improving the routing of salt spreader trucks. A dynamic routing heuristic totally different from the static routing in general use was developed. The value of this heuristic was demonstrated to the satisfaction of city officials using a discrete simulation model of a large midwestern city. In addition, the simulator was used to answer questions of salt pile location and equipment configuration and location. Although applied to only one city, this routing heuristic, together with the simulation approach, is of potential value to all city governments that experience snow and ice emergencies. ...|$|R
