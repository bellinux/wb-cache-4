25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E
500|$|Brunner {{has spoken}} out against {{election}} officials taking voting machines {{home with them}} in the days before an election. [...] Such actions could allow hacking even though it makes transport and delivery to the eventual polling place simpler. [...] Some elections officials <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> the system is better if elections officials keep an eye on machines the days before the elections. [...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies. That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places, documented chain of custody, and now procedures to make secure voting machine delivery." [...] She has ordered bipartisan transport teams and proscribed storage conditions such as humidity. The federal government will subsidize the cost of her mandate.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{starting}} his speech, Aristophanes warns {{the group that}} his eulogy to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech is an explanation of why people in love <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "whole" [...] when they have found their love partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says, because in primal times people had double bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As [...] spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels (190a), these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: the all male, the all female, and the [...] "androgynous," [...] who was half male, half female. The males {{were said to have}} descended from the sun, the females from the earth and the androgynous couples from the moon. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods (190b-c). [...] Zeus thought about blasting them [...] with thunderbolts, but did not want to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half, in effect separating the two bodies.|$|E

50|$|The contestants {{are given}} {{an hour to}} {{deliberate}} together. They {{find it difficult to}} choose between Jerry and Dan, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> both really need to be at the Ranch. Ultimately they agree that Dan needs it more, as he is a young man who has had a serious problem all his life and has never been thin, while Jerry has the support of his wife at home, and was once at a healthy weight. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> Jerry has a better chance in the long run of losing weight and keeping it off than Dan will if he went home this early in the game. After deliberation, the contestants unanimously vote to send Jerry home, which eliminates both Jerry and Estella.|$|R

When you reproach me in your heart for sending you away from me, you mean that I ought to say I felt about you as other women <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> about their children. I did not feel that. I was glad to be freed from you. But I did well for you, and I gave you your father's fortune. Do I seem now to be revoking everything?--Well, there are reasons. I feel many things that I cannot understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year. I shall very likely not live another year. I will not deny anything I have done.

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{controversy}} over this practice, {{in terms of the}} recent movement for Afghan women's rights, is whether the practice of bacha posh empowers women and helps them succeed or if the practice is psychologically damaging.

5000|$|People often <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> their [...] "hair {{standing}} on end" [...] {{when they are}} frightened or in awe.

Then the sympathetic nervous system also causes the piloerection reflex, which makes the muscles attached to the base of each hair follicle contract and force the hair up.|$|E

40|$|In Bandura’s theory (1997, 2001), self-efficacy is the {{cognitive}} mechanism that mediates information on personal capacities to successfully execute necessary {{courses of action}} in a specific domain. It is theorized that self-efficacy belief influences motivation, affect and behaviour. Self-efficacy regarding motor activities has been widely investigated (Feltz, 1992) and represents a frame of reference to explain links between cognitive processes and physical performance (Colella & Morano, 2008). The {{purpose of the study}} was to verify the difference in physical self-efficacy (perceived) between gymnasts practicing sports at recreational level and gymnasts, however, which train at a competitive level. The Perceived Physical Ability Scale for Children by Colella (2008) was presented to a sample of 58 gymnasts, 29 practicing sports at recreational level and 29 practicing sports at competitive level in random selection, ranging in age from 8 to 10 years old. The items of the PPASC are: speed, ability, strength, rapidity, self-confidence and tiredness. They are structured in response scales having a 1 - to 4 -point format. Observing the results of the descriptive statistics in the whole sample it is obvious how the perceived physical abilities are very high in all items. The artistic gymnastic is a sport in which these aspects of physical abilities are trained specifically. The children <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> run fast (77 %), they are able to do difficult exercises (77 %), their muscles are strong (68 %) and move rapidly (71 %). Slightly lower values are those related to self-confidence, the 48 % <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> sure when <b>they</b> move but the 32 % <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> somewhat insure when they move, and the value of energy, 50 % say I don’t feel tired when I move, but the 25 % <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> tired. The difference between the values of the two levels of gymnastic report in the competitive groups is higher in physical self-efficacy in all items than in the recreational group. These data could suggest that the quantity of the trainings and, at the same time, the improvement of the quality of the performance increases the Perceived Physical Ability. The results of the test is particularly high and considering it globally, confirms that, in any case, the physical activities, even if only practiced as recreational activity, produces positive effects on the Perceived Physical Ability...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of baseball players, {{at any level}} of play, wear batting gloves. They are worn because they help increase {{the quality of the}} grip on the bat. Maintaining a tight and controlled grip is essential to successful hits. Even the slightest slip or variation in grip can cost the team greatly. They also act as a protector of the hand when one slides into a base. Batting gloves today are even worn by fielders because <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> better in their glove.Another prime use for batting gloves, especially in younger leagues that permit aluminum bats, is shock protection. On a cold day, a bad or loose swing can fracture fingers.|$|R
