The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semites, close to their North-Western Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, {{one of the oldest}} attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East-Semitic language which exhibits both West-Semitic and East-Semitic features.|$|E

Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet dissident, rejected Radosh's criticisms and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> attempt to portray West as a historically inept conspiracy-monger.

25|$|The Italian Grand Prix at the Monza Autodrome near Milan {{sealed the}} end of two things: Gerhard Berger's terrible season (he scored a second place on both the grid and in the race) and Prost's {{relationship}} with McLaren. Having become progressively distanced from the team due to his conflict with Senna, he announced his switch to Ferrari for 1990, and after inheriting the race win when Senna retired from the lead late on, he proceeded to give the trophy he had won to the tifosi. McLaren boss Ron Dennis' usual composure was shattered and he hurled his trophy at his driver's feet, storming off (Dennis was unhappy with Prost giving the trophy to the tifosi as contractually all trophies won were {{the property of the}} team). Prost later <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> unsatisfactory win and that he did not hold out much hope for the championship despite his points lead as he felt Honda were clearly favouring Senna. Boutsen inherited third for Williams. The final points went to Patrese, who finished fourth, followed by Brit Martin Brundle for Brabham and Jean Alesi in the Tyrrell.|$|E

[...] Johnson identified racial diversity {{as one of the}} show's biggest draws, but added that the African-American actors were not used to their full potential. Following the departures of Johnson, Kerr, and Cathy Jenéen Doe, the actress playing Simone Russell, in 2007, the only representatives of the Russells in the series finale were Tracey Ross and Phillip Jeanmarie (who portrayed Vincent Clarkson).|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly commented that Follow the Leader was Korn's [...] "gimmick", while saying the album had [...] "steely riffs" [...] and [...] "stomping beats". Tower Records said the album [...] "combines streamlined metal with ominous industrial touches and {{an undercurrent of}} hip-hop rhythm," [...] and also <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> [...] "urban nightmare". The album {{is considered to be}} nu metal, but also spans other genres such as alternative metal and heavy metal.|$|E

500|$|The Land of Gorch had a {{significant}} impact on later Muppet works, including both the 1982 feature film The Dark Crystal and the 1991 television show Dinosaurs. Commentators agreed the reception for The Land of Gorch was universally negative; The A.V. Club <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> in-joke that nobody wanted to keep the sketches on Saturday Night Live. San Francisco Chronicle called the characters the opposite of Kermit the Frog and compared them to trolls. DVD Talk called the feature the worst mistake in the first season of Saturday Night Live. Academic Michael J. Bernsten wrote in his essay [...] "The Muppetry of Nightmares" [...] that the idea failed because the characters were irredeemable and unfunny.|$|E

She again played a troubled 1950s housewife, prompting Kenneth Turan {{to write that}} she was [...] "essentially reprising her Far from Heaven role". Moore <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> [...] "unfortunate coincidence" [...] that the similar roles came at the same time, and claimed that the characters had differing personalities. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the performance [...] "wrenching", while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised a [...] "superbly controlled, humane performance". The Hours was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Moore also received BAFTA and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and was jointly awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress with Kidman and Streep at the Berlin Film Festival.|$|E

[...] Writing for Wired, Chris Kohler criticized the poor {{response}} of the controller's joystick {{and the lack of}} an RCA output. He said the release timing hurt its success; [...] "though its graphics were of better quality than most consoles on the market, it had the bad luck to be released in the same month as Nintendo’s world-changing Famicom, which had killer apps like Donkey Kong and could run circles around Sega’s hardware."

500|$|The game's storyline {{was written}} by Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton, who are all regular writers on The Simpsons. They wanted to create {{something}} that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, [...] "a great new game". Matt Groening and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its [...] "look and feel" [...] to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> amazing partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it The Simpsons Game and not add a subtitle was because they {{felt it was a}} restart of [...] "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} comic interplay between Smith and Corden. Dan Martin of The Guardian questioned {{the decision to}} air a standalone episode as the penultimate show of the series, calling [...] "Closing Time" [...] "something of a curiosity" [...] as well as writing positively about Smith and Corden's [...] "Laurel and Hardy act". However, {{he felt that the}} Cybermen had been deprived of their menace. Martin later rated it the eighth best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode three out of five stars, comparing Smith's performance favourably to that of Patrick Troughton. Neela Debnath of The Independent <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> [...] "intriguing change of pace" [...] and succeeded with [...] "great comedic moments" [...] and the [...] "brilliant chemistry between the Doctor and Craig". She praised Corden for excelling after his [...] "average" [...] performance in [...] "The Lodger".|$|E
500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern praised Corden and Smith, {{but said}} it did not [...] "quite tick [...] boxes".

In a review for IGN, Matt Wales rated it 7 out of 10 and {{referred to it as}} [...] "one of the fluffier episodes" [...] in terms of plot, but he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> [...] "enjoyable little duck-out-of-water adventure". He called Smith [...] "an absolute joy to watch" [...] and said that Corden and Haggard [...] " [...] themselves admirably". However, he criticised the [...] "more traditional Who elements", such as the alien threat that the directing left [...] "devoid of almost all tension", Amy's occasional appearances that did not seem to gel {{with the rest of the}} story, and the short resolution, where [...] "the whole thing collapsed into an incomprehensible muddle".|$|E
