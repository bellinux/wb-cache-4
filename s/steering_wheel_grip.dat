40|$|Many of {{the survey}} report about vehicle {{accident}} say that, accidents are happening due to driver’s drowsiness and over speed. Drunk and driving is another factor for accidents. If these mistakes are corrected accidents can be reduced, not hundred percent but up to the satisfied level. If accidents occurred, immediate first aid and treatment is necessary to save life. So once accident happened informing it immediately to nearby hospital and ambulance service is very important. But {{if there is no}} neighbor the case may be severe. Keeping all these in mind a new idea is proposed which can perform the necessary steps to prevent accident. It can prevent the accidents and incase if accident happened system will inform the owner and ambulance about this accident. The alcohol sensor available in the proposed system alerts the owner such that “Drunk and Driving” and it will not allow engine to start. In case alcohol consumption is sensed at the time of driving, engine will slowly OFF after giving pre-warning sound. <b>Steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>grip</b> sensor is used to detect driver’s drowsiness and alert the diver not to sleep. Finally when accidents occurred, the system will automatically send a text message to ambulance service via GSM network. The system also records the parameters like speed and engine temperature in permanent storage during the time of accident. It helps to identify the reason for accidents. Temperature sensor is used to detect the engine temperature and LCD screen displays the system’s status. MEMS accelerometer is used to detect the accident, and during this accident speed is recorded in permanent memory for later referenc...|$|E
5000|$|SVT {{worked with}} Garden State Tanning {{to produce the}} Mystichrome leather found on the car's seat inserts and the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The {{production}} process for the Mystichrome leather included tanning and dying the leather jet black, spraying the Mystichrome paint directly onto the leather, and sealing it with a clear layer to protect and prevent damage to the Mystichrome-painted leather. Like the 2003 10th Anniversary Cobra, the Mystichrome Cobra featured a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with <b>grip</b> humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The Mystichrome Cobra came standard with the five-spoke 17" [...] chrome wheels.|$|R
50|$|Sparco were {{commissioned}} to provide high-grip bucket seats for improved driver control in cornering situations. The blue Alcantara trim {{used on the}} seats and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> provided improved <b>grip</b> over other material types. The door cards, rear seats, and rear interior were also trimmed with the same material, and the front seats where embroidered with the Ford Racing emblem.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{trim level}} {{it has a}} 6.5-inch or 8.8-inch color display, {{optional}} Sport, Performance and Luxury Packs are also available. The Sport pack includes sports <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with added <b>grip,</b> aluminum inserts on the dashboard, center console and door panels, and Xenon headlights. The luxury package offers leather upholstery and wood trim. The performance pack includes mechanical limited-slip differential, electronic suspension and paddle shifters to streering wheel in automatic versions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{purposes}} an idea {{to develop}} a system to detect driver fatigue and issue a timely warning signal. The fatigue can be some medical ailments or a drowsy feeling in the night. A large number of accidents occur due to the driver’s fatigue and hence this system will be helpful in preventing many accidents. This system will monitor the driver’s eyes using a web camera and measure the pressure applied in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> using <b>grip</b> sensors around the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The system uses an algorithm in MATLAB to detect the driver fatigue and issue a beacon. If driver felt drowsy there is possibility of sudden acceleration or deacceleration and hence we can judge this by plotting a graph in time domain and when all the three input variables shows a possibility of fatigue at one moment then a signal is given in form of text in the display. Moreover, the driver might reduce the pressure applied in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> or take his hand out of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when he begins to sleep. The system will give a beacon {{in the form of}} sound. The deactivation of the warning signal is controlled by a deactivation switch which is present in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|R

5000|$|For 2003, SVT {{offered a}} limited-edition 10th Anniversary Cobra to {{celebrate}} ten {{years since the}} introduction of the first SVT Mustang Cobra in 1993. The car featured unique seven-spoke, dark argent-painted, 17" [...] alloy wheels; Dark Charcoal interior with Colorado Red leather inserts on the seats; red inserts in the door panels; red-painted brake calipers; and special 10th Anniversary badges on the decklid and floormats. Also included was special carbon fiber-patterned leather wrapped around the shifter; emergency brake handle; and on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The Anniversary model was the first Cobra to feature a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with <b>grip</b> humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. SVT produced 2,003 (same number as the model year) units of the Anniversary model {{at the end of the}} model year during June and July 2003, totaling 1,003 coupes and 1,000 convertibles. The 10th Anniversary models were only available in three exterior colors: Black (775 models), Torch Red (734 models), and Silver Metallic (494 models). The 10th Anniversary Edition package (order code 375A) was a $1,495 option.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{pertains to}} an ergonomic <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim {{designed to promote}} a neutral position to the forearm, reducing stress and fatigue by discouraging fixed wrist positions, i. e., flexion and ulnar deviation. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim of the invention provides a more comfortable driving position, reduces injury associated with airbag deployment, and reduces stress on hands and wrists. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim has one or more hand grip portions that deviate from the XY plane away from the driver.

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately.

50|$|The first button {{added to}} the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was a switch to {{activate}} the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> integrated the horn switch into the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim.|$|R
