5|$|Although {{beginning}} {{during the}} events of , the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, {{the events of}} Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 (as well as the latter title's two updates). The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change {{the aftermath of the}} events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat {{at the hands of the}} evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{shallower}} pits at Aberdare {{proved a}} bigger attraction for prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s the Rhondda saw a {{rapid growth in}} development. During the 1860s-1870s 20 collieries opened in the Rhondda Valleys with the leading coalowner in the Rhondda Fach being David Davis of Aberdare, and David Davies in the Rhondda Fawr. In 1865 the output of coal from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons, more than the Aberdare Valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by the massive excavation rates <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quarter of the 19th century up {{to the beginning of}} the First World War. In 1913 it was recorded that the Rhondda Valley's output was 9.6 million tons.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in As You Like It, and the fool in King Lear.|$|E

50|$|If {{we make a}} {{comparison}} of these four orders of the mass, A and B seem to have most in common.

25|$|The {{fourteen}} dorsal vertebrae are weakly amphicoelous, or concave on both ends, {{typical of}} basal sauropodomorphs. Also typical {{is the presence}} of blade-like keels on the undersides of the first to third dorsal vertebrae, which are not seen elsewhere; additionally, the dorsal vertebrae near the front have the typical low, short, and somewhat plate-like neural spines. Unusually, however, the same kinds of neural spines are also <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three dorsal vertebrae, which is only otherwise seen in basal saurischians like Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor. In the middle and back dorsal vertebrae, the top back corner of the neural spines project outward to produce a concave back edge, which is seen in some other basal sauropodomorphs but not Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, Yunnanosaurus, and Riojasaurus.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{development}} of the telescope, there have only been five supernovae <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> millennium. Compared to a star's entire history, the visual appearance of a galactic supernova is very brief, perhaps spanning several months, so that the chances of observing one is roughly once in a lifetime. Only {{a tiny fraction of the}} 100 billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova, restricted to either having sufficient large enough mass or under extraordinarily rare kinds of binary star in configurations containing [...] white dwarf stars.|$|E

500|$|The video used soft focus, gentle {{lighting}} and airbrushing looks on Madonna. It starts with Timbaland chanting the opening line {{in front of}} a giant timer screen that counts down from four minutes. As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the long lines of stalls and the people present there. As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a back arch as the timer reaches zero time. The last [...] "tick-tock, tick-tock" [...] sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> shot.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{scholarly}} {{debate as}} to the hymn's author. Leopold Zunz contends that {{it was written by}} Daniel ben Yehudah Dayan, who spent eight years in improving it, completing it <b>in</b> 1404. Some <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> line of [...] "Yigdal" [...] a signature, [...] "Yechiel b'Rav Baruch", though it is unclear whom this might be. Hartwig Hirschfeld argues that the famous poet Immanuel of Rome is the author. Immanuel made several attempts at putting the 13 Principles into verse, e.g. a 72-line version entitled “Poem Based on the 13 Articles”. [...] "Yigdal" [...] shares rhythm, rhyme and a number of phrases with this poem.|$|R
50|$|Flamengo {{at the end}} {{clinched}} 11 {{titles in}} that period against 8 from Vasco. This in particular stems from a three-in-a-row win (<b>see</b> below) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> years (1999-2001). Fluminense also clinched 8 titles, proving despite it much lower presence a greater efficiency (out of only 11 turno wins).|$|R

Barty Crouch Sr. is portrayed by Roger Lloyd-Pack.|$|E
2500|$|Even among Egyptologists who {{advocate}} Nefertiti as Neferneferuaten, {{the exact nature}} of her reign can vary. Reeves sees Nefertiti ruling independently for some time before Tutankhamun and has identified her as Dahamunzu of the Hittite letter-writing episode. In support, Reeves makes clear that Nefertiti did not disappear and is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> years of Akhenaten {{in the form of the}} various stelae.

2500|$|Equal in foulness to {{the third}} Baldrick, Private Baldrick also matches his {{immediate}} predecessor in terms of stupidity. His [...] "cunning plans", like those of his Elizabethan ancestor, have an insane, perverse logic to them. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, {{in relation to the}} old saying [...] "a bullet with your name on it", his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself ("shame", comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with [...] "Baldrick" [...] on them are [...] "very small indeed".

2500|$|The {{unveiling}} of LittleBigPlanet at GDC 2007 elicited numerous positive reactions. In his BBC News blog, technology editor Darren Waters wrote, [...] "LittleBigPlanet is {{perhaps one of}} the most dazzling demos I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 10 years". IGN described the game as [...] "beautiful" [...] and reported that [...] "even in the presence of Home, Sony's impressive new community software, LittleBigPlanet stole the show at Phil Harrison's Game 3.0 practice conference, and was the thing that everyone was talking about." [...] 1UP wrote that [...] "There are plenty of questions remaining about LittleBigPlanet… but it's clear from the reaction to the game so far that it has already won over many fans and that this could be something very special." [...] Slashdot Games editor Michael Zenke suggested the game could be the PlayStation 3's killer application. Even Reggie Fils-Aime, the president of Nintendo of America, praised the product, but was unsure how the game would fare on Sony's platform.|$|E

50|$|Compositionally, the {{painting}} is similar to De Morgan's Flora and Cassandra: Helena is standing upright and tall, in a peaceful posture that reminds to Boticcelli's representations of Greek and Roman goddesses (such as Athena or Venus) that are, at the same time, an evocation of classical art, a usual characteristic between Renaissance artists. Helena {{has been removed from}} the common artistic elements of the Trojan War: despite dealing with a typically bellic topic, De Morgan decides to paint, instead of weapons and battles, the wonderful pink clothes and the fascinated look that Helena puts on the mirror that is reflecting her beautiful face, elements that can be read as symbols of her inconscient vanity, which eventually brought a long and terrible war and destruction to the city of Troy, which we can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> term of <b>the</b> composition, on top of a hill.
