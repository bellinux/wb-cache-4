40|$|Frequency {{excursions}} on {{electrical power}} systems are traditionally controlled using governors on central, often steam driven, generators. However, if {{the proportion of}} steam driven plant is reduced, {{there is a need}} to provide frequency response by other means. Distributed frequency response is under-utilised; this is partly because it is difficult for system operators to schedule demand <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> response capability and verify its operation. Smart meters provide a means to overcome these difficulties, if the meters have an adequate hardware specification. A scheme to enable System Operators to specify demand <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> response, become aware of its availability and verify its operation is put forward. A model is developed in which demand <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> response operation is verified using `Frequency Response Verification Packets' (FRVPs) - data packets created by smart meters that quantify changes in demand following a detected frequency excursion. The model is used to simulate a situation where 20 % of all domestic washing machines in Britain can pause for 30 minutes following a frequency excursion. For a frequency deviation at 1830 hrs on a weekday in the month of March, 291778 FRVPs were created (corresponding to 135 MW total demand reduction within 2 seconds of the frequency excursion) ...|$|E
30|$|The {{transformation}} {{from the time}} domain to the frequency domain is accomplished using MATLAB software. This transformation gives the square root of the power spectra of grayscale values as it varies with frequency, {{also referred to as}} the grayscale spectral energy distribution. The filtered data is read into MATLAB from the spreadsheet using the “xlsread” function. This function’s inputs are the file path and the range of cells in the spreadsheet that contain the data. The function’s output is an array of the filtered data. The array of the filtered time sequence data undergoes a single sided discrete fast Fourier transform. This transform is done using the Fast Fourier Transform —“fft”— function in MATLAB software. The filtered time sequenced array of grayscale values is input into the Fast Fourier Transform function. The function gives the double <b>sided</b> <b>frequency</b> transform of that time sequenced array. Next, {{the second half of the}} frequency transform array is discarded. The resulting array is the single <b>sided</b> <b>frequency</b> transform.|$|R

The dynamic state estimation provides the estimated remote side voltages and currents since the circuit AQCF model is part of the dynamic estimation model. The remote <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> and the rate of frequency change are subsequently calculated from the remote side voltages and currents. Finally, a supplementary control scheme is utilized, where the estimated frequency information from the remote side is introduced as inputs.

This paper proposes a Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) based algorithm using high-fidelity dynamic models and sampled value measurements for dependable and secure {{protection and control}} of μGrid systems. For the protection application, the DSE based protection algorithm detects internal faults by checking any inconsistency between the measurements and the model. The advantages of the proposed protection scheme include: (a) detection of internal faults faster than legacy schemes; (b) improved sensitivity towards high impedance faults; (c) satisfactory performance in μGrid protection in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode; and (d) working correctly during non-ideal conditions such as measurements with added 1 % random error. For CIG control application, the DSE provides accurate estimation of the remote <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> {{as well as the}} rate of frequency change from local information only, which can then be used to provide supplementary feedback control to the converters of the CIG. The advantages of the proposed control scheme include: (a) no need for communication from remote sides; (b) accurate estimation of the remote <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> and rate of frequency change based on local information; and (c) minimizing the CIG output oscillation during system disturbances.|$|E

The integration of the demand <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> control and the BESS as types of DERs were considered.

The representation of a population of BESS and their applications such as aggregation of residential-based BESS, aggregation of a large-scale BESS, and aggregation of the EVs’ in either home-based or station-based smart charging were used. The Great Britain power system and the 14 -machine South-East Australian power system were employed to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new methods in controlling the frequency. Different study cases of DERs availability were modelled, and real disturbances were utilised. The frequency response was highly improved by integrating various DERs.

30|$|The {{modelling}} {{and control}} of water heater devices are widely covered in the literature to support the frequency in power systems [64, 71, 72]. Markov chain was used to represent the aggregated power for a various controllable population of water heaters for DSFC [33, 34, 35, 63]. A hierarchal control framework for the demand <b>side</b> <b>frequency</b> control with two decision layers was presented in [73, 74, 75]. The top layer is the supervisory control of the aggregator, while the local layer is for the devices population and a frequency controller. The dynamic behaviour of the controllable load was represented by using Markov-based states [73, 74, 75, 76]. The electric resistive water heater was represented by two states (ON and OFF) while the heat pump water heater was represented by four states ON, OFF-LOCKED, OFF, and ON-LOCKED [76]. Markov chain-based states are representing the dynamic behaviour of the switching in the end-user controllable water heater devices. Hence, it represents the population of those controllable devices. The controller changed the power consumption of controllable loads with an amount according to the gain value sent by the supervisory control Layer. The gain value was calculated according {{to the number of}} the system loads and the controllable loads (see further details in [73, 74, 75]).|$|E
