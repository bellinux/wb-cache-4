40|$|Liquid sealing is an {{effective}} method to convert a fiber-optic refractometer into a simple and highly sensitive temperature sensor. A refractometer based on the thin-core fiber modal interferometer is sealed in a capillary tube filled with Cargille oil. Due to the thermo-optic effect of the <b>sealing</b> <b>liquid,</b> the high refractive-index sensitivity refractometer is subsequently sensitive to the ambient temperature. It is found that the liquid-sealed sensor produces a highest sensitivity of − 2. 30 nm/°C, which is over 250 times higher than its intrinsic sensitivity before sealing and significantly {{higher than that of}} a grating-based fiber sensors. The sensing mechanisms, including the incidental temperature-induced strain effect, are analyzed in detail both theoretically and experimentally. The liquid sealing technique is easy and low cost, and makes the sensor robust and insensitive to the surrounding refractive index.

This design is capable of converting thermal energy into visual color signals. The mechanism of this distinct response is simulated and proven by band theory.

40|$|Nesse trabalho são descritas duas técnicas de pós-processamento em fibras de cristal fotônico (PCFs, do inglês Photonic Crystal Fibers) desenvolvidas para alterar suas propriedades de guiamento. A primeira {{consiste}} em fechar seletivamente buracos da microestrutura das PCF possibilitando assim, entre outras coisas, o preenchimento de alguns buracos com materiais como líquidos, polímeros e nanopartículas. A outra técnica consiste em se colapsar seletivamente buracos da seção transversal da microestrutura de uma PCF utilizando pressão diferencial e uma máquina de emendas para fibras ópticas, sendo baseada em técnicas previamente demonstradas para o afilamento (tapering) de PCFs. Com a utilização da primeira dessas técnicas é apresentada uma maneira simples e eficiente de se vedar fibras com núcleo líquido, evitando-se assim a evaporação. O estudo de PCFs com núcleos complexos, formados pelo núcleo original de uma fibra de núcleo sólido e um buraco adjacente ao núcleo preenchido por óleo foi também realizado com essa técnica, proporcionando uma grande interação da luz com o canal preenchido e uma alta sensibilidade a temperatura (deslocamento de 5, 35 nm/C nas estruturas espectrais observadas). Utilizado-se a segunda técnica, o colapso de um buraco adjacente ao núcleo sólido de uma PCF permitiu o desenvolvimento de um interferômetro modal de Mach-Zehnder totalmente a fibra, apresentando uma profundidade de modulação espectral de 9, 5 dB, semelhante à de outros interferômetros modais em PCFs reportados na literatura, e uma sensibilidade a temperatura de - 54 pm/C, cerca de 4 vezes maior do que a de redes de Bragg em fibras ópticas convencionais. A mesma técnica foi utilizada para se obter o acoplamento óptico entre 2 núcleos de uma fibra de cristal fotônico com 3 núcleos inicialmente desacoplados. In {{this work}} two techniques are described for post-processing photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), which {{were developed to}} change their guidance properties. The first technique consists of selectively closing holes of the PCF microstructure, thus allowing, among other things, to fill in some holes with materials such as liquids, polymers and nanoparticles. The other technique consists of selectively collapsing holes in the PCF cross-section using differential pressure and an optical fiber fusion splicer, {{and is based on}} techniques previously demonstrated for PCF tapering. With the first technique a simple and effective way of <b>sealing</b> <b>liquid</b> core fibers is demonstrated, which avoids evaporation. The study of PCFs with complex cores formed by the original core of a solid-core fiber and an oil-filled hole adjacent to the core was also undertaken with this technique and provided a strong interaction between light and the filled channel, as well as a high sensitivity to temperature (displacement of 5. 35 nm/C in the observed spectral structures). With the use of the second technique, the collapse of a hole adjacent to the solid core of a PCF allowed the development of a modal Mach-Zehnder allfiber interferometer, with a spectral modulation depth of 9. 5 dB, which {{is similar to that of}} other PCF modal interferometers reported in the literature, and a sensitivity to temperature of - 54 pm/C, which is about 4 times higher than that of Bragg gratings in conventional optical fibers.
