40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of {{innovation}} {{in the market for}} credit risk has given rise to a liquid market in <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligation</b> (CDO) tranches on standardised portfolios. To the extent that tranche spreads depend on default dependence between different obligors in the reference portfolio, quoted spreads can be seen as aggregating the market views on this dependence. In a manner reminiscent of the volatility smiles found in liquid option markets, practitioners speak of implied correlation “smiles” and “skews”. We explore how this analogy can be taken a step further to extract implied factor distributions from the market quotes for synthetic CDO tranches. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the pricing of synthetic credit risk securitisation. Securitisation is advantageous both for originating banks, who incur savings on bank capital costs and for investors, who acquire a stake in leveraged credit portfolio risk, an exposure type rarely accessible otherwise. Securitisation is cost-efficiently implemented by structured credit derivatives, issued securities are therefore referred to as <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDOs). We perform arbitrage-free pricing of synthetic CDOs referring to investment grade European corporate debt, such that a comparison with observed transactions can be drawn. CDO payout rules are formalised, taking both direct risk transfer structures and synthetic transactions using SPVs for excess spread trapping into account. Underlying losses are captured by a reduced-form affine multi-factor model, exploiting the strong observed comovement of corporate spreads for systematic factor estimation. Estimation is performed by Kalman filter-based QML, applied to implied spread structures of recent European corporate bond issues to which originating banks are exposed. Valuation results are obtained {{for a variety of}} structural variants. A comparison with transactions accommodating our modelling approach with regard to payout rules and reference debt quality supports the hypothesis that investors have a strong preference for CDO investments: Observed note issuance spreads provide no adequate compensation for the leveraged portfolio risk exposure.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically analyse synthetic securitisation schemes in South African law as <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> using primarily credit default swaps (CDSs). This transpires {{from the perspective of}} primarily company law, and secondarily securities law and the law of contract. It includes a contextualised study of these schemes with regards to their origins, their significance regarding the recent financial crisis, and their rationales micro-economic influence and Basel capital requirements. Not only are the participants, such as parties acting in a primary role and secondary role and special-purpose institutions, studied, but also the obligations between these parties, such as the CDS contract, and the meaning of commercial paper, the legal nature of credit-linked notes, the business of a bank, and the influence of recent case law. It also includes a consideration of synthetic securitisation schemes in terms of the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act 45 of 2002. Furthermore, the role of systemic risk and moral hazard is explained, as well as the interaction between synthetic securitisation schemes, credit rating agencies and the function of risk management. The CDS is compared with insurance contracts, and a discussion of the 2014 International Swaps and Derivatives Association Credit Derivative Definitions is incorporated. For legal comparison, the South African model is compared with Canadian law and its unfunded credit derivatives in the light of recent regulation, and compared to German law and its prevalence of funded credit derivatives. Finally, suggestions are made as to the future of synthetic securitisation schemes. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. Mercantile LawLLDUnrestricte...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{distributed}} computing systems, including Grids and Compute Utilities, and now Clouds, becomes a consideration for businesses hoping to manage start-up costs and times, {{as well as}} reduce the physical and environmental footprint of infrastructures. Instead of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software, organisations and individuals {{can take advantage of}} pay-per- use (utility) models that relate directly to their requirements of infrastructures, platforms and software. However, such metered services are not widely adopted yet {{due to the lack of}} assurance of Quality of Service (QoS). It is suggested that such systems will only attain greater acceptance by a larger audience of commercial consumers if binding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are provided that encompass service descriptions, costs of provision and, importantly, assurances on availability, performance, and liability. Prediction, quantification of risk, and consideration of liability in case of underperformance are considered essential for the future provision of Computer (Cloud) Economics - in particular, for the provision of SLAs through resource brokers, and generally to be more comparable to financial markets. The principal focus of this thesis is on building brokerage and related services for supporting growth of Cloud and contributing to future computational economics. A brokerage should provide negotiation mechanisms between consumers and providers, and perhaps manage available computer resources, to realise the goals of both parties. SLAs are key to this, where each SLA details price, risk, performance and QoS parameters, amongst others. This thesis presents a novel approach that supports the creation and management of Service Level Agreements, aimed towards improved uptake of cornmoditised computational infrastructures, platforms and software services. By analysing issues within current SLAs, it summarises necessary characteristics to be addressed in Cloud SLAs. Inspired by financial portfolio analysis and in particular by credit derivatives, this work demonstrates how the proposed Cloud Collateralised SLA Obligations (CSO), analogous to <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDO), can be used to mitigate risk of failure or underperformance through diversification of compute resource portfolios. The CSO prices risk integrates into service insurance, and builds in penalties, and in contrast to well-known Cloud price models, relates variable performance to variable price. This performance-price relationship would also be necessary for the appropriate use of other financial models. Through Value-at-Risk (VaR) style analysis, the probability of failure (risk of underperformance) can be related to a confidence level for each SLA offer - the confidence of meeting the SLA. The thesis further identifies how performance tranches support an autonomic aspect in attempting to ensure satisfaction of higher-value SLAs as a trade off against higher-risk, lower-value SLAs. The approach can readily integrate with any SLA framework that supports real- time dynamic characteristics. Outcomes are broadly relevant to Cloud Computing, and more specifically to Infrastructure as a Service Clouds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Rating <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDOs), {{which are}} based on tranched pools of credit risk exposures, does not only require {{attributing}} a probability of default to each obligor within the portfolio. It also involves assumptions concerning recovery rates and correlated defaults of pool assets, thus combining credit risk assessments of individual collateral assets with estimates about default correlations and other modelling assumptions. In this paper, we explain one of the most well-known models for rating CDOs, the so-called binomial expansion technique (BET). Comparing this approach with an alternative methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation, we then highlight the potential importance of correlation assumptions for the ratings of senior CDO tranches and explore what differences in methodologies across rating agencies may mean for senior tranche rating outcomes. The remainder of the paper talks about potential implications of certain model assumptions for ratings accuracy, that is the "model risk" taken by investors when acquiring CDO tranches, and whether and under what conditions methodological differences may generate incentives for issuers to strategically select rating agencies to get particular CDO structures rated. <b>Collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations,</b> credit risk modelling, rating agencies...|$|R

Previous explanations of this puzzle have assumed that investors can diversify away the risk that actual losses in a corporate bond portfolio will exceed expected losses.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of {{structure}} of dependency on the pricing of multi-name credit derivatives such as <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDO). The correlation between names defaulting has an effect on the value of the basket credit derivatives. We present a copula based simulation procedure for pricing CDO under different structure of dependency and assessing the influence of different price drivers (correlation, hazard rates and recovery rates) on modelling portfolio losses. Gaussian copulas and Monte Carlo simulation are widely used to measure the default risk in basket credit derivatives. Many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. We use distributions with fat tails such as the t-student distribution.

40|$|Why are spreads on {{corporate}} bonds so wide relative to expected losses from default? The spread on Baa-rated bonds, for example, {{has been about}} four times the expected loss. We suggest that the most commonly cited explanations – taxes, liquidity and systematic diffusive risk – are inadequate. We argue instead that idiosyncratic default risk, or the risk of unexpected losses due to single- name defaults in necessarily "small" credit portfolios, accounts for the major part of spreads. Because return distributions are highly skewed, diversification would require very large portfolios. Evidence from arbitrage CDOs suggests that such diversification is not readily achievable in practice, and idiosyncratic risk is therefore unavoidable. Taking a cue from CDO subordination structures, we propose value-at-risk at the Aaa-rated confidence level as a summary measure of risk in feasible credit portfolios. We find evidence of a positive linear relationship between this risk measure and spreads {{on corporate}} bonds across rating classes. credit spread puzzle, jump-at-default risk, Sharpe ratio, <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{subprime}} crisis was largely unanticipated as the efficient market hypothesis held sway and the Gaussian techniques used to rate <b>Collateralised</b> <b>Debt</b> <b>Obligations</b> were {{assumed to have}} diversified risk and reduced systemic risk. However, as this paper argues, many of the shortcomings stemming from these assumptions, together with the consequent economic policy of ‘light regulation’, were clearly revealed {{by the collapse of}} Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. This nearly brought about the collapse of the US banking system and gave a clear practical demonstration that the economy is non-ergodic. The paper discusses the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and shows how the lessons derived from that crisis were not learnt. It also highlights the dangers of assuming that uncertainty can simply be treated as risk, as the Post-Keynesians have long argued. Furthermore, it argues, following Akerlof (2007), that case studies can be just as, or indeed more revealing than, econometric testing...|$|R

30|$|Below, I {{summarise}} {{findings from}} {{an analysis of}} secondary sources regarding how two major financial innovations—automated teller machines (ATMs) and <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDOs)—were developed and governed, {{as well as the}} extent to which activities such as anticipation, reflection, deliberation, and responsiveness were adopted. The ATM is considered both a specific and general innovation used not only by financial institutions to dispense cash from an individual’s account but also as a facility for cash transfers between financial institutions. Similarly, the CDO is a general innovation used by all financial institutions across the industry. These two cases were selected because they are considered significant innovations in the financial services sector. They are representative of product innovations in the monetary financial intermediary segment of the financial services landscape. This subsector can be considered more risky, and potentially more disruptive, because of its involvement with, for example, structured finance products that help transfer risks using complex mechanisms on a global scale. Thus, understanding innovation and governance processes within that financial service sub-sector can help to discover ways to promote responsible financial innovation.|$|R

Over the past ten years or so, a similar securitisation process has been undertaken with corporate debt. The claims on the cash flowing from the corporate debt portfolio are called <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDO).

Overall, I find that pricing of CDX and iTraxx tranches differs although the specifications of the two contracts are very similar. Since July 2007, tranche investors appear to have repriced CDX contracts to a larger extent than iTraxx contracts. Credit risk and liquidity factors are priced in almost all tranches with liquidity risk playing a larger role since the start of the turmoil.

The house price return dynamics is modelled using an ARMA-GARCH process. The calculation of fair spreads of CRMO in different tranches is illustrated under the risk-neutral valuation framework.

CDO, the recent credit derivative instruments have been the most commonly used term used in financial market from the last two decades. While CDOs were recklessly issued by banks to make profits, investors were attracted towards it due to its high yield and low interest rate feature. Although it seemed a win-win game for every player, the complexity and hidden risk wasn’t understood by the market till the crisis engulfed the economy adversely in 2008. The fact that no higher profits can be made by sacrifice of more risk, applies equally to this case as well and were subject to same law of risk and return as the capital market. Hence assessing the risk exposure of CDOs is equally important to take into account while investing with the expectation of making higher profits at low rate. After the crisis, in which the world economy suffered badly it is now understood that due to the complex nature of CDOs, it should be dealt cautiously to be benefitted. Hence the regulators with their goal of investor and market protection should make sure that fair and full information is being provided to the investors prior investment.

Operational risk is classified as “the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events ” (see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2003 a,b). Possible operational risk categories are (van den Brink, 2002) : 1. human processing errors, for example, mishandling of software applications, reports containing incomplete information, or payments made to incorrect parties without recovery; 2. human decision errors, for example, unnecessary rejection of a profitable trade or wrong trading strategy due to incomplete information; 3. (software or hardware) system errors, for example, data delivery or data import is not executed and the software system performs calculations and generates reports based on incomplete data; *The views {{presented in this paper}} {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily represent models or policies of Dresdner Bank AG...|$|R
40|$|Local councils in New South Wales (NSW) {{have the}} {{authority}} to invest ratepayers 2 ̆ 7 money that is not currently required for any other purpose by the council. At the end of 2006 - 07 financial year local councils in New South Wales had invested 590 million dollars in structured financial products such as <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> (CDO). By the end of January 2008, six months later, the market value of these investments dropped 200 million to 390 million. Since then the financial investment market has further significantly reduced with the value of the councils 2 ̆ 7 investments losing many more millions of dollars. In NSW the state government commissioned a review of the financial exposures of NSW local councils to be undertaken by Mr Michael Cole. The Cole Report published in 2008 found that while acting within the parameters of the Local Government Act (1993), local councils had pursued high return high risk investment strategies. This paper reviews and evaluates how the local councils in NSW, identified by Cole as having a high level of exposure to these forms of investments, have disclosed their financial investments in their 2007 - 08 financial reports; the type of audit opinion expressed on these reports; and the impact of these investment related losses on the ability of NSW local councils to provide current and future services...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 1990 s, the {{surfacing}} of credit derivatives and <b>collateralised</b> <b>debt</b> <b>obligations</b> enlarged the range of instruments for transferring credit risk. Although the characteristics and purposes of the former are very similar to those of the latter, the tradability of the new instruments has resulted in the creation of true markets for credit risk transfer (CRT), which are very rapidly developing. CRT markets are of great interest as regards financial stability: while offering extended risk management opportunities for market participants, they also alter “traditional” relationships (between lenders and borrowers) as well as creating new types of relationships (lenders and credit protection sellers). The present review relies on existing theoretical and empirical work as well as on contacts with market practitioners to explore, from an analytical standpoint, the financial stability implications of all types of CRT instruments. In particular, it analyses the characteristics of differing CRT instruments in light of risk management and asymmetric information problems arising in financial markets. It also proposes possible avenues for further work. Four questions are successively raised: For what purposes are these products designed; why use one instrument rather than another? Who assesses credit risk: lenders, protection sellers or both? How are CRT instruments priced in practice: does pricing primarily reflect credit risk or does it also incorporate additional elements, such as counterparty, documentation or market risks? What are the potential macro-financial implications of CRT markets?...|$|R
