40|$|In {{many places}} the {{expansion}} of urban areas has brought recreationists into close proximity to nature conservation areas, sometimes leading to conflict where recreation and sensitive environmental or natural values are incompatible. An important first step in managing these conflicts is to assess the degree {{and nature of the}} problem. We describe the application, and methodological considerations, {{associated with the use of}} an innovative, low-cost, practical technique to monitor human intrusions into a wetland reserve which has been designated as ‘off-limits’ to the general public. The use of seven frequently monitored sand pads over 13 weeks enabled us to determine that intrusions occurred in every week (3 – 14 per sand pad), deep inside the reserve during most weeks, and also identified the key access points. Most intrusions occurred during holiday periods and were by walkers or cyclists. We also conducted a series of simple experiments to examine the utility of sand pads. Our sand pads maintained their shape well and held footprints for over 1 month, they were rarely avoided by people and provided reliable indices of the level of human activity. <b>Sand</b> <b>hardness</b> varied with rainfall, and hardened sand was frequent (53. 8 % of 26 days) and potentially prevented detection of people. We conclude that the sand pad technique is an effective and efficient tool to measure recreational use of off-limits areas and other conservation and recreation areas, provided human traffic is not too intense, and that checks are made reasonably frequently. <br /...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolar mirrors are exposed, {{during their}} {{operation}} in Concentrated Solar Power plants –CSP-, to climatic stress factors that cause their degradation {{and therefore a}} decrease in the global efficiency of the plant. Sandstorms are among parameters that cause a decrease of mirrors optical performances by generating surface erosion. The intensity and the gravity of this erosion phenomenon is function of climatic, geological parameters and mirrors surface nature. To evaluate the effect of these parameters on the optical performance degradation, two approaches were adopted, namely the natural aging tests in two different sites in Morocco, and the aging tests in controlled environment in a sandblasting chamber. The objectives are, by monitoring the stress factors in natural aging sites, to define aging tests under controlled environment that reproduce similar degradation phenomenon that those observed on mirrors exposed in natural aging sites. Degradations observed in both natural and controlled aging tests are compared and correlated to validate the methodologies and the hypotheses on the analysis of the degradation phenomenon. The aging tests in controlled environment permits the evaluation of the effect of each influencing parameter separately from the others on the mirrors surface erosion, and eventually accelerate the apparition of surface erosion on mirrors. Under controlled environment, tests show that glass mirrors present maximum surface erosion at normal impact angle and that the loss in specular reflectivity {{is directly related to the}} wind speed. Exposed mirrors in natural aging sites present low loss in reflectivity which doesn’t exceed 0. 4 % after 240 days of outdoor exposure. Concerning the effect of sand properties on erosion phenomenon, it was found that the <b>sand</b> <b>hardness</b> affect the roughness parameters, whilethe sharp forms influence on the impactsproperties(roughness parameters, impacts number, impacted area, impacts size diameter). By increasing the sand particle's size, the impacted area increase and the losses in relative specular reflectivity increase...|$|E

40|$|Sand {{casting process}} {{involves}} many parameters such as {{size of the}} sand grain, amount of clay, percentage of moisture, green compressive strength, permeability, number of ramming, shatter index, mold type, mold hardness, etc. to name a few. In this paper the effect of sand mold casting process parameters, especially composition of molding <b>sand,</b> on <b>hardness,</b> tensile strength and density of aluminium alloy castings are studied. While other parameters are kept constant, grain fineness number, amount of clay, amount of moisture and number of ramming are varied. Experiments are conducted based on Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array and cast specimens are tested to obtain their mechanical properties and density. The results obtained are evaluated to optimize process parameters at three different levels.. Optimum levels are found as Grain fineness number 55, two times ramming, 12 percent Clay and 13 percent Moisture. Based on optimum level of process parameters, confirmation test is conducted and results {{are found to be}} in confidence level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{the design of}} {{experiments}} and computer assisted casting simulation techniques are combined to analyze the sand related and methoding related defects in green sand casting. An attempt {{has been made to}} obtain the optimal settings of the moulding sand and mould related process parameters of green sand casting process of the selected ductile iron cast component. The green sand related process parameters considered are, moisture content, green compression strength, and permeability of moulding <b>sand</b> and mould <b>hardness</b> (in horizontal direction). In first part of this paper Taguchi based L 18 orthogonal array was used for the experimental purpose and analysis was carried out using Minitab software for analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of mean (AOM) plot. ANOVA results indicate that the selected process parameters significantly affect the casting defects and rejection percentage. In the second part, shrinkage porosity analysis is performed using casting simulation technique by introduction of a new gating system designed, solid model developed for four cavities mould. Number of iterations using casting simulation software was performed for mould filling and solidification analysis to reduce the level and intensities of shrinkage porosities in cast component. With new gating and feeding system design reduction in shrinkage porosity (about 15 %) and improvement in yield (about 5 %) is observed...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the erosion wear of the blades of pitched blade {{impellers}} in a suspension of waste gypsum from a thermal power station (vol. concentration C V = 18. 3 %, particle mean diameter d= 0. 1 mm, degree of hardness “ 2. 5 ”) and silicious sand (C V = 10 %, d= 0. 4 mm, degree of hardness “ 7. 5 ”) in water under a turbulent flow regime of agitated charge when complete homogeneity of the suspension was achieved. Experiments were carried out on pilot plant mixing equipment made of stainless steel (diameter of cylindrical vessel T= 390 mm, diameter of impeller D= 100 mm, impeller off-bottom clearance h= 100 mm) equipped with four wall radial baffles (width b= 39 mm) and an impeller with four inclined plane blades (pitch angle α = 20 °, 30 °, 45 °, relative blade width W/D= 0. 2) made either of rolled brass (Brinell hardness 40 – 50 BH) or of structural steel (Brinell hardness 100 – 120 BH) always pumping the liquid downwards towards the flat vessel bottom. Two erosion process mechanisms appear, depending on the hardness of the solid particles in the suspension: while the particles of gypsum (lower hardness) generate a uniform sheet erosion over the whole surface of the impeller blade, the particles of silicious <b>sand</b> (higher <b>hardness)</b> generate wear of {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blades, together with a reduction of the surface of the worn blade. The hardness of the impeller blade also affects the rate of the erosion process: the higher the hardness of the impeller blade, the lower the wear rate of the blade. This study consists of a description of the kinetics of the erosion process of both mechanisms in dependence on the pitch angle of the tested impellers. While the wear of the leading edge of the blade exhibits a monotonous dependence on the pitch angle, the sheet erosion exhibits the maximum rate within the interval of the pitch angles tested α ϵ . However, generally the pitch angle α = 45 ° seems to be the most convenient angle of blade inclination when both investigated mechanisms of the blade erosion process are considered at their minimum rate...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three parts: I. The Surface Impregnation of Wood; II. Use Characteristics of Impregnated wood; and III. Investigations of Resin Adhesives. The {{material}} presented in Part I is a continuation of previous experimentation that had established general methods for producing a hardened surface wood product. The methods involved parting of the wood fibers on the surface by a special serrating tool, followed by a surface impregnation and final curing. This section presents work carried on to determine the optimum conditions for serrating and subsequent impregnation. The effect of species on impregnation. and the impregnation of unfinished lumber were also investigated. In Part II are presented the results of investigations of the commercially important properties of the surface impregnated wood products. These include surface <b>hardness.</b> <b>sanding,</b> moisture resistance, and gluing characteristics. Techniques for veneering this product are also given. The investigations of resin adhesives described in Part III were of two types: (1) the effect of various conditions of precure and final cure upon the strength and bond characteristics obtained with wood; and (2) the degree of cure as indicated by per cent extractables. The former study was carried out {{to determine whether or not}} the temperature and time of precure are critical in their effect upon adhesive bonds. and also to find whether pressure is necessary for the final cure. The latter was made to obtain recommendations for curing conditions now used in commercial production...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} {{examine the effect of}} five different rootzone constructions (partially amended sand, silt soil, pure sand, fully amended sand and partially amended plus zeolite sand) and aeration methods (untreated control, HydroJect, Verti-drain and scarifying) on soil physical properties, root development and playing quality of golf greens. The five rootzone constructions were randomly arranged in three blocks. A split plot design was superimposed on the rootzone constructions using different aeration methods. Aeration treatments were carried out in the spring and autumn of 1998. Measurements of bulk density, total porosity, volumetric moisture content, air-filled porosity, infiltration rate, oxygen diffusion rate, saturated hydraulic conductivity, root mass, organic matter content, surface hardness and green speed were made to monitor differences between treatments. This study found there was no benefit of fully amended sand rootzone compared with partially amended sand rootzones (either plus or without zeolite). Although root development was greater in the pure sand rootzone, this occurred predominantly in the top 50 mm. Excessive accumulation near the surface of the profile can have detrimental impacts on turf growth. Rootzone construction had an important effect on surface hardness, i. e. pure sand rootzone produced the hardest surface, silt soil rootzone the softest and amended <b>sand</b> rootzones intermediate <b>hardness.</b> Rootzone construction had no effect on green speed in this study. Aeration treatment had no effect on any of the soil, plant or playing quality parameters measured in this study. This suggests either aeration treatments were very short lived or that long term effects of aeration treatments were not yet apparent...|$|R
40|$|Since March 1995 Amsterdam Water Supply {{has applied}} {{biological}} activated carbon filtration (BACF) {{in the treatment}} process of the Leiduin plant. In this plant (capacity 70 × 106 m 3 /y) pretreated River Rhine water is infiltrated in the dune area, west of Amsterdam, for artificial recharge. Post treatment comprises rapid <b>sand</b> filtration, ozonation, <b>hardness</b> removal, biological activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. At the start the carbon reactivation frequency was set at 18 months, based on removal efficiencies for AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), DOC, pesticides and micropollutants. After four years of operation of a pilot plant (10 m 3 /hour) in parallel with the full-scale plant, the remaining removal capacity and the break-through profile of the carbon filters was investigated. In contrast to the full-scale plant, no carbon reactivation was applied in the pilot plant during the operation of 4 years. Spiking experiments were carried out after ozonation, in the influent of the biological activated carbon filtration with a cocktail of different pesticides after 1. 5, 3 and 4 years. Influent concentrations varied between 2 to 10 μg/l. Without carbon reactivation the filter effluent still complies with the Dutch drinking water standards and guide lines, {{as well as with}} the Amsterdam Water Supply standards: DOC is less than 2 mg/l (actually 1. 2 mg/l) and AOX remains below 5 μg/l. After four years, with spiking concentrations of 2 μg/l still no pesticide break-through was observed in the two-stage biological activated carbon filtration process. It can be concluded that a running time of 3 years between two reactivations in the two stage biological active carbon filtration is achievable, without negatively affecting the finished water quality. Average DOC concentrations will increase up to 1. 2 mg/l, from 1 mg/l with running times of 2 years. After four years or 100, 000 bedvolumes the AOC content is equal to or lower than 10 μg/l after biological activated carbon filtration. With slow sand filtration at the end and as polishing step AOC will be less than 10 - 5 μg/l. With every extension of six months duration time a saving of ε 305, 000 on reactivation costs is possible. With every 6 month extension of the running time of the carbon filters a saving of ε 610, 000 is realised on the reactivation costs of the Leiduin treatment plant...|$|R
