25|$|One of {{the first}} was Cornelia Tuthill's 1840 novel Virginia Dare, or the Colony of Roanoke, in which Virginia marries a Jamestown settler. Virginia Dare met the Indian princess Pocahontas in E.A.B. Shackleford's 1892 novel Virginia Dare: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century. Virginia Dare was the main {{character}} in Sallie Southall Cotten's 1901 book in verse The White Doe: The Fate of Virginia Dare. In the book, she is turned into a white doe by an Indian witch doctor after she rejects his advances. When her true love, an Indian warrior, shoots her with a silver arrow, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> into a woman just before she dies in his arms. Cotten has asserted, however, that the tale of Dare as the White Doe had survived for some three centuries as part of colonial folklore. In the 1908 novel The Daughter of Virginia Dare, author Mary Virginia Wall made Pocahontas the daughter of Virginia Dare. In Herbert Bouldin Hawes' 1930 novel The Daughter of the Blood, Virginia Dare {{is involved in a}} romantic triangle with John Smith and Pocahontas.|$|E
500|$|One night, {{when the}} trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona shelters in a windmill. Donkey hears strange noises {{from within and}} investigates, finding Fiona {{transformed}} into an ogre. She explains that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, which is why she was locked away, and that only her true love's kiss will return her to her [...] "love's true form". Meanwhile Shrek, about to confess his feelings for Fiona, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation to an [...] "ugly beast" [...] as disgust with him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her curse, but dawn breaks before she can, and <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> into a human. She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill during the night. Fiona accepts Farquaad's proposal, requesting that they be married before night falls. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt and angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes outside into the TARDIS, we cut back into the kitchen, and there's a moment where Donna hears the TARDIS... there's a moment of realisation, and then <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, and since she didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|E

6000|$|... 'She turned about, half mindful to go in, but the liddle voices grieved that shrill an' sorrowful <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back,</b> an' she cries: [...] "If {{it is not}} a Trouble of Flesh an' Blood, {{what can}} I do?" ...|$|E
50|$|Accidentally one day Sagara {{comes on}} to {{land from the}} water and loses her mermaid body. She {{turns out to be}} a {{beautiful}} woman. Whenever water is spilled over her, however, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> into a mermaid.|$|E
60|$|At {{the fourth}} attempt to {{encounter}} him {{it began to}} rain in torrents, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|A suggestive gleam {{crept into}} Winifred's eyes, but it {{vanished}} and her manner became authoritative when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to Sproatly.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to her arranging, fixing, stitching, {{his nerves}} jumped with anger as the sewing-machine started and stuttered and buzzed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{painting}} by Mola Ram: Abhisarika nayika, [...] "the heroine {{going to meet}} her lover". <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> {{to look at a}} golden anklet, which has just fallen off. There are also snakes below and lightning above.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth now {{feels she}} has finally repaid Frail in full. Rune slips the noose off, and Elizabeth turns to walk away. Frail calls out her name. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back,</b> and {{steps to the}} end of the wagon. He kneels down, cups her chin with both hands, and they touch foreheads, while a ballad plays in the background.|$|E
50|$|A {{poor woman}} finds a {{pot on the}} road. She thinks it must have a hole {{for it to be}} discarded, but optimistically decides she might find a use for it as a flowerpot. Looking inside she discovers it is full of gold pieces, and decides to drag it home in her shawl. She drags it for a while, but when she looks back, the pot has become a lump of silver. She decides this is better than gold, as it is less likely to be stolen, and goes on. After a time <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> again, to find the silver has turned into a chunk of iron. She observes this will be easier to sell, and that the penny pieces it will bring would be safer than either gold or silver. She goes on again, and when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> a third time, the iron has become a rock. She exclaims how {{convenient}} this will be as a doorstop, and happily goes home.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} faltering and ill-assured in her manner, {{and in a}} moment <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> with 'Mr. Underwood, where are you stopping?' ...|$|R

5000|$|Mary's {{statement}} echoes {{her earlier}} words to Apostle Peter in John 20:2: [...] "They have taken away the Lord {{out of the}} tomb, and we know not where they have laid him", signifying that she {{was unaware of the}} resurrection. This is confirmed a third time immediately thereafter in John 20:14-15, when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> and sees Jesus without recognizing him, and assumes him to be the gardener.|$|E
50|$|Hanna: Born in 1910, she is {{a sickly}} girl {{who seems to be}} resented by her own mother. As a result, she tragically dies in the {{accident}} that held on the Little Baroness. She is the antagonist in the game wherein she is physically transformed as a creature with only a head and tentacles. After she is defeated, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> to her original form and is saved by Eric before she departs along with the Little Baroness in the good ending.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} bizarre {{mechanical}} problems causes {{the crew of}} the Tiger Shark to lose control of the submarine, and <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> towards the site of her sinking of the German ship, apparently of her own volition. Meanwhile, crewmen die in accidents at an alarming rate. The eerie phenomena seem related to the death of Winters, and the crew begins to suspect a supernatural influence is behind all of the Tiger Sharks mishaps and to question Brice's version of how and why Winters died.|$|E
6000|$|... "Splendid! Splendid!" [...] {{she muttered}} to herself. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> {{into the hall}} and exclaimed in a {{peremptory}} voice, [...] "Come outside and see, Wilfrid; it's wonderful." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young girl}} hesitated. The man's tone was surly, and yet {{indicated}} {{a certain kind}} of half-pathetic grievance. HER curiosity got the better of her prudence, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to the coffin. Suddenly {{she lost}} every vestige of self-control. She sank {{down on her}} knees beside the trestle. [...] "Why have you left me!" [...] she cried.|$|R
50|$|The heroine {{is turned}} into a worm (dragon), usually by her stepmother, who curses her to remain so until the king's son comes to kiss her three times. When he arrives, she offers him a belt, a ring, and a sword to kiss her, {{promising}} the things would magically protect him; the third time, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> into a woman. In some variants, he asks who enchanted her, a werewolf or mermaid; she says it was her stepmother and curses her into a monstrous creature, permanently.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one of the}} back-up issues, June Moone {{was called}} upon by Amanda Waller to help a {{military}} general whose house had been possessed by a demon. She turns into the Enchantress but the Enchantress ends up scheming with the demon to escape Amanda Waller and destroy the world. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> to June to have the demon remove the bomb device and set the Enchantress free. However, the demon attacks her and frightens her. June, in retaliation, unleashes magic and banishes the demon, without turning into the Enchantress.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrics {{tell the}} story of a man who sees a pretty woman walking by. He yearns for her and wonders if, as {{beautiful}} as she is, she might be lonely like he is. At the last minute, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> and joins him. The title was inspired by Orbison's wife, Claudette, interrupting a conversation to announce she was going out. When Orbison asked if she had enough cash, his co-writer Bill Dees interjected, [...] "A pretty woman never needs any money." [...] Orbison's recording of the song, which used four guitars, was produced by Fred Foster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I in time?" [...] {{were the}} first words that escaped her on {{entering}} the room. Reassured by the answer, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to the door, eager to hurry upstairs to Kitty's bedside.|$|R

50|$|Daphne sees {{no sign of}} Tiny when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> to the {{orchestra}} pit, but he is lifted into view on the organ {{that had been used}} to provide background music for Arnold's movies. It now glows white, being played by a spectral organist; Tiny climbs off, unhurt, but Arnold's spirit rises from his body and steps on at the organist's beckoning. The organ swiftly drops out of sight, carrying a terrified Arnold down to hell. As the theater begins to collapse, Daphne persuades Tiny to overcome his fear of rejection and leave with her. They and the dogs exit into the light of the outside world.|$|E

5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Back in Your Head" [...] {{features}} the duo performing {{the song in}} front of an audience of people wearing white clothing and white balaclavas. In the middle there is one person wearing black clothing, and Sara looks over to Tegan and when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> the person has gone. Some more people wearing the black clothing appear behind Tegan and Sara, and they run away as the audience suddenly turns from people wearing white clothing to black clothing and balaclavas. The duo eventually find themselves back where they started, except the audience starts going back to people in white clothing and the curtains behind them are closed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> {{toward the}} little gray stone building. [...] "If you will let me sleep in your sitting-room, then," [...] she said timidly. [...] "I will not turn {{you out of}} your room." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back,</b> remembering Link. He was lurching {{from the}} car, helmet and goggles thrust back, the gray shade gone from his face, the cool, bright gleam {{of his eyes}} disappearing for {{something}} warmer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've disarranged my hair, you silly boy!" [...] She went to {{the glass}} {{to put it in}} order, and when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> found that James had gone. [...] "What an odd creature!" [...] she muttered.|$|R
