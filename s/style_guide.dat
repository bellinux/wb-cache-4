5|$|Woodall and Susannah Constantine first collaborated in 1996 on Ready to Wear, {{a weekly}} <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> for The Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. The <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> {{highlighted}} affordable high-street fashion, with the pair using themselves to demonstrate clothing that suited different figures.

Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Conrad was {{to star in}} an MTV {{series that}} would have focused on her career endeavors, though the network chose not {{to pick up the}} program after Conrad {{preferred}} not to film her private life. In April 2011, Conrad launched The Beauty Department with her hairstylist, Kristin Ess, and her makeup artist, Amy Nadine; she later announced plans to expand the brand to include a line of cosmetics. Looking to target a more upscale audience, Conrad released her third fashion line Paper Crown that August; Conrad released her fourth novel The Fame Game as a spin-off to the L.A. Candy series in April 2012. she has since established an account with Nordstrom for the line. In July, she collaborated with BlueAvocado to launch XO(eco), an environmentally-friendly collection of bags. In October 2012, Conrad released The Fame Game continuation novel Starstruck and the <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> Lauren Conrad Beauty. The final novel of the trilogy, Infamous, was released in June 2013.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> for {{typesetting}} used a wider {{space between}} sentences than between words—"traditional spacing", {{as shown in}} the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer desktop publishing became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. The 1969 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style used em spaces between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's Hart's Rules (1983) had shifted to single sentence spacing. Other <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> followed suit in the 1990s. Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences.|$|R

5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{university}} re-branded itself as Sacramento State, or Sac State for short. The formal name is California State University, Sacramento. The terms CSUS, Cal State Sacramento, Sacramento State University, CSU Sacramento and CS Sacramento are inappropriate, per the Identity <b>Style</b> <b>Guide,</b> even though {{the university}}'s web address is csus.edu. The university also adopted a new logo and seal that replaced the previous design based on the Seal of California. In addition, the exact shades of Sacramento State's colors of green and gold were formalized in the 2005 <b>Style</b> <b>Guide.</b>|$|E
25|$|National {{languages}} {{not covered}} by an authoritative language academy typically have multiple style guides—which may not all discuss sentence spacing.

However, the Oxford Style Manual (2003) and the Modern Humanities Research Association's MHRA <b>Style</b> <b>Guide</b> (2002), state that only single spacing should be used.|$|E
50|$|More visible uses of Common Era {{notation}} {{have recently}} surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world.

25|$|Historical <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> {{before the}} 20th century {{typically}} indicated that wider spaces {{were to be}} used between sentences. Standard word spaces were about one-third of an em space, but sentences were to be divided by a full em-space. With {{the arrival of the}} typewriter in the late 19th century, <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> for writers began diverging from printer's manuals, indicating that writers should double-space between sentences. This held for most of the 20th century until the computer began replacing the typewriter as the primary means of creating text. In the 1990s, <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> reverted to recommending a single-space between sentences. However, instead of a slightly larger sentence space, <b>style</b> <b>guides</b> simply indicated a standard word space. This is now the convention for publishers.|$|R

25|$|Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine {{teamed up}} in 1994 to write Ready to Wear, a weekly <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> for the Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. They had {{previously}} {{met at a}} dinner party hosted by David, Viscount Linley but did not actually like each other at first.

25|$|MacKellar's The American Printer was the {{dominant}} language <b>style</b> <b>guide</b> in the US {{at the time}} and ran to at least 17 editions between 1866 and 1893, and De Vinne's The Practice of Typography was the undisputed global authority on English-language typesetting style from 1901 until well past Dowding's first formal alternative spacing suggestion in the mid-1950s. Both the American and the UK style guides also specified that spaces should be inserted between punctuation and text. The MacKellar guide described these as hairspaces but itself used a much wider space than was then commonly regarded as a hairspace. Spaces following words or punctuation were subject to line breaks, and spaces between words and closely associated punctuation were non-breaking. Additionally, spaces were (and still are today) varied proportionally in width when justifying lines, originally by hand, later by machine, now usually by software.|$|E
