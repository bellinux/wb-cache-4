6000|$|... "It is so seldom," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{lifted the}} lid of her desk, [...] "that things can be {{arranged}} so as to please everybody." ...|$|E
60|$|Bella {{was amazed}} by the flush in his face, and by his sudden turning away. 'What can it mean?' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{accompanied}} him up stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went away; [...] "but any fool {{could have}} told me that. This wise man is a fraud; even my husband is as wise as he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid it}} means no Christmas for the {{children}} tomorrow," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> sadly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> led Ned away to the stable. When {{she returned to the}} kitchen Mrs. Martin was sitting by the fire, her face in her chilled hand, sobbing convulsively.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{little brown}} boy--my little brown boy," [...] said Susan. [...] "I wonder," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> bitterly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at the}} doctor's sorrowful face, [...] "if you {{remember}} how you spanked him once {{when he was a}} baby. I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, if {{he gives}} me a chance to say {{anything}} at all," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> ruefully, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields, golden {{in the light of the}} dreamy August evening. [...] "I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution." ...|$|R
6000|$|Susan {{shook her}} head. She disapproved entirely of such ejaculations. [...] "I hope {{he will not}} let his mother hear him talking like that," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stacked the hoes and rake away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} won't notice my eyes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> hastily plumped a big ugly dark-green shade, with an almond-eyed oriental leering from it, over the lamp, before {{going out to}} let Margaret in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{him talking}} to my old friend Tommy Tit the Chickadee, and I just know that Tommy will {{tell me all about}} him," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> scampered along certain private little paths of her own.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Comparing ornaments! Worthy {{of such a}} friendship,' <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> held back, {{and made}} them go down before her, Emma glad to hold by Violet's arm for protection.|$|R
6000|$|No melancholy gaps here! <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{helped her}} uncle to the easy chair {{prepared}} {{for him at}} the dinner-table; no spiritless curiosity, no forced attempts to display what no one felt! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And my John can see 'im as far <b>as</b> Chelwood," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{to herself}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> finally {{closed the door}} on the {{stranger}} and made her way slowly down the creaking stairs.|$|R
60|$|She {{would like}} that, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> clambered {{up the steep}} paths; and perhaps she would meet these American girls again, or others like them, and make them her friends. She had never known a girl friend, as yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the best}} place for such {{inflammable}} nonsense. I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.|$|E
6000|$|They parted, Farfrae {{returning}} {{into the}} dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness {{of what she was}} doing she started running with all her might till she reached her father's door. [...] "O dear me--what am I at?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pulled up breathless.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{match is}} as good <b>as</b> made," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> triumphantly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> picked up chips to start the tea fire. [...] "If Judith {{suspects}} that Eben is here she is quite likely to stay in her room and refuse to come down. But if she does I'll march him upstairs to her door and make him ask her through the keyhole. You can't stump Theodora Whitney." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No more sea, no more anything,' <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> dazedly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat in {{the midst}} of this fierce welter of sunshine. It seemed to her as if all the {{lightness}} of her fancy and her hope were being burned away in this tremendous furnace, leaving her, Helena, like a heavy piece of slag seamed with metal. She tried to imagine herself resuming the old activities, the old manner of living.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will begin}} at once, and show them that I don't mean to shirk my duty, though I do want to be nice," [...] <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat at supper one night and looked about her, {{planning}} her first move.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will go now and {{see what}} I {{can get out of}} the pussies,' said Peppina, the elder girl, one morning, as she took Lizina's basket and {{fastened}} her pockets into her own skirt. 'I should like some of the cats' gold for myself,' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left her mother's house before the sun rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{goes well}} so far," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched their {{approach}} with a smile; for Sancho sat bolt upright {{in the chair}} which Ben pushed, while Thorny strolled beside him, leaning on a stout cane newly cut. Both boys were talking busily, and Thorny laughed from time to time, as if his comrade's chat was very amusing.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a gay {{and lively}} {{beginning}} for a hermit," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{made her way}} around the house, [...] "and I don't see how on earth I am {{ever going to get}} through that window again. There is nothing to stand on. I did not expect to go back until they were all up." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next few}} days seemed years for length: but she could wait. She was sure of him now. She needed no charms. [...] "Perhaps," [...] <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked in the glass, [...] "I was my own charm." [...] And, indeed, she had every fair right to say so.|$|R
6000|$|In {{half an hour}} {{more the}} mixture was ready. She carried it up to him, foaming and fragrant, in a large tumbler. [...] "He will sleep after this," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> to herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> opened the door; [...] "I have made it {{stronger}} than usual on purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never felt}} {{glad to see}} Gilbert go before," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> half-resentfully, half-sorrowfully, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walked alone up the lane. [...] "Our {{friendship}} will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense. It mustn't be spoiled--I won't let it. Oh, WHY can't boys be just sensible!" ...|$|R
60|$|This epistle Lizzie did send, {{believing that}} she could add nothing to its insolence, let her study it as she might. And, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> read it for the fifth time, that it sounded {{as though it had}} been written before her receipt of the final note from himself, and that it would, therefore, irritate him the more.|$|E
6000|$|The tone {{in which}} those words were spoken was an insult in itself. Mercy {{suddenly}} lifted her head; the angry answer was on her lips. She checked it, and submitted in silence. [...] "I will be worthy of Julian Gray's confidence in me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stood patiently by the chair. [...] "I will bear anything from the woman whom I have wronged." ...|$|E
6000|$|Descending the stairs, {{on her way}} to the house-keeper's room, {{she passed}} by the entrances to two long stone {{corridor}}s, with rows of doors opening on them; one corridor situated on the second, and one on the first floor of the house. [...] "Many rooms!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at the doors. [...] "Weary work searching here for what I have come to find!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{knew nothing}} of all this; <b>she</b> only <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched his quick, {{bounding}} run, that he, the least regarded, was the flower of the flock, with principles as good as Walter's, and so much more manly and active. For Marian, with all her respect for Walter, could not help wishing, like the boys, that he had more life and spirit, and less timidity. A little mental courage would, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> have brought him to expostulate with Caroline, instead of keeping out of the way, and leaving her to her fate. Edmund {{would not have done}} so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Write {{a note to}} the {{jewellers}} {{saying that}} you have got it." [...] She did write to the jeweller saying that she had got the ring,--"from a friend;" [...] and the ring with the other tribute went to Patagonia. He had certainly behaved very badly to her, but she was quite sure {{that he would never}} {{tell the story of the}} ring to any one. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had spared him in the great matter of eight thousand pounds, she was entitled to take this smaller contribution.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck her}} like a blow, the unexpectedness of it, and for the instant, in the sickly light, she was {{conscious}} only of the ring of white faces, each face set with eyes that burned. Innocent of what? <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at St. Vincent, arms still extended, she was aware, in a vague, troubled way, of something distasteful. Innocent of what? He might have had more reserve. He might have waited till he was charged. She {{did not know that}} he was charged with anything.|$|R
6000|$|Adela {{laughed at}} him for his kind wishes, but I could see she meant to plead for him. She had her chance, for Sir John Ormerod brought matters to a crisis at the next ball; and though <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said, [...] "she had settled him," [...] he {{followed}} it up with her guardian, and Adela was invited to a conference in the library.|$|E
60|$|Neither girl {{seemed to}} have eyes for the lovely blue of the sea in the spring sunshine, nor the {{striking}} forms of ruddy peaks of rock that enclosed it. Uneducated eyes, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> slowly manoeuvred the pony down the steep hill {{before coming to the}} Rockstone Cliff Road. The other two girls were following her direction across field and road, and making their observations.|$|E
60|$|It was up {{the great}} {{staircase}} {{on the story}} above. Here and there, the bare white walls were broken by an iron grate, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went along that the place was something like a prison. The arched door of the lady's room, or cell, was not quite shut. After knocking at it {{two or three times}} without receiving an answer, she pushed it gently open, and looked in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I'll {{rest and}} read for an hour, then I'll rake my garden, or run down town to see Molly {{and get some}} seeds," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> to herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> put away the spoons and glasses, which she liked to wash, that they might always be clear and bright.|$|R
6000|$|Half an hour more {{brought her}} to the limits of the time which she could venture to allow herself in the open air. In that {{interval}} she had searched the sheds from first to last, and had found five more keys. [...] "Five more chances!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> to herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> hid the keys, and hastily returned to the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} your behaviour!" [...] Mrs. Wix cried. [...] "Don't say such horrible things; they're false and they're wicked and I forbid you! It's to KEEP you decent that I'm {{here and that}} I've done {{everything}} I have done. It's to save you--I won't say from yourself, because in yourself you're beautiful and good! It's to save you from the worst person of all. I haven't, after all, come over to be afraid to speak of her! That's the person in whose place her ladyship wants such a person as even me; and if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>as</b> good as told me, not fit for Maisie's company, it's not, as you may well suppose, that she may make room for Mrs. Beale!" ...|$|R
