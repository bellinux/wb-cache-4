On most days she visited the British Museum in order to consult their library, and twice a week she taught adult education classes on Ancient Egyptian history and religion at the City Literary Institute; upon her retirement from this position she nominated her former pupil, Veronica Seton-Williams, to replace her.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School {{shortly before}} his ninth birthday, where he {{proceeded}} straight to the second form. In 1902 Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over {{as head of the}} London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the Yorkshire Daily Observer, and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December, <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908 they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented The National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Lansbury {{returned}} to London's West End {{to perform in}} the Royal Shakespeare Company's theatrical production of Edward Albee's All Over at the Aldwych Theatre. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised. This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of Mame, which was then touring the United States, after which she {{returned to}} the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical Gypsy. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of Ethel Merman, who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and rave reviews. <b>Settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour. Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 Gypsy went {{on a tour of the}} U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award. After several months' break, Gypsy then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} wedding, the McGrews left Chicago {{and moved to}} Beverly Hills. McGrew turned 21 {{two months after the}} {{marriage}} and received part of his large inheritance. The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1928, <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> home in Beverly Hills, where Harlean thrived as a wealthy socialite. McGrew hoped to distance Harlean from her mother with the move. Neither McGrew nor Harlean worked, and both, especially McGrew, were thought to drink heavily.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of renting {{furnished}} rooms, Fondane accepted an offer from Jean, brother of the deceased literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, and, employed as a librarian-concierge, moved into the Gourmonts' museum property on Rue des Saints-Pères, some distance away from to the celebrated literary café Les Deux Magots. In the six years before Pascal's 1929 death, Fondane left Gourmont's house and, with his sister and brother-in-law, moved into a succession of houses (on Rue Domat, Rue Jacob, Rue Monge), before <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> historical building once inhabited by author Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (Rue Rollin, 6). Complaining about eye trouble and exhaustion, and several times threatened with insolvency, Fondane often left Paris for the resort of Arcachon.|$|E

25|$|Johnson and Mostyn-Owen {{married in}} West Felton, Shropshire, in September 1987; a violin piece was {{specially}} commissioned {{for the wedding}} from Hans Werner Henze. The couple honeymooned in Egypt before <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> flat in West Kensington, West London. There, Johnson secured work for a management consultancy company, L.E.K. Consulting; finding it incredibly boring, he resigned after a week. Through family connections, in late 1987 he began work as a graduate trainee at The Times, shadowing one of its journalists. Scandal erupted when Johnson wrote {{an article on the}} archaeological discovery of Edward II's palace for the newspaper. Johnson invented a quote for the article that he falsely claimed came from the historian Colin Lucas, his own godfather. After The Times editor Charles Wilson learned of the deception, Johnson was sacked.|$|E
25|$|When the oryx is not {{wandering}} its habitat or eating, it digs shallow depressions in {{soft ground}} under shrubs or trees for resting. They {{are able to}} detect rainfall from a distance and follow {{in the direction of}} fresh plant growth. The number of individuals in herd can vary greatly (up to 100 have been reported occasionally), but the average is 10 or fewer individuals. Bachelor herds do not occur, and single territorial males are rare. Herds establish a straightforward hierarchy that involves all females and males above the age of about seven months. Arabian oryx tend to maintain visual contact with other herd members, subordinate males taking positions between {{the main body of the}} herd and the outlying females. If separated, males will search areas where the herd last visited, <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> solitary existence until the herd's return. Where water and grazing conditions permit, male oryx establish territories. Bachelor males are solitary. A dominance hierarchy is created within the herd by posturing displays which avoid the danger of serious injury their long, sharp horns could potentially inflict. Males and females use their horns to defend the sparse territorial resources against interlopers.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} United's {{last two games}} was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United {{got off to a}} great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a {{deflected}} shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were looking to be <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when he got back to his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball nestled in the bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to {{the last day of the}} season for the first time since 1999.|$|E

25|$|On 2 January 1 RAR was {{immediately}} redeployed on Operation Tiger Balm {{to conduct a}} cordon-and-search of Xom My Xuan and Lang Phuoc Hoa, along Highway 15. This operation was designed to support Goodwood, as {{it was believed that}} the Viet Cong infrastructure had moved into the villages along the highway after being forced out of the jungle during 1 ATFs operations there. The search was completed by 12:00 on 4 January and the operation concluded have only achieved modest results for the Australians. During this period South Vietnamese forces had continued to operate in AO Moose with minimal contact. Yet at 16:40 on 7 January B Company, 5 Airborne Battalion was contacted by a Viet Cong squad resulting in five South Vietnamese being wounded, two of whom later died of their wounds. The Viet Cong had then withdrawn and their casualties could not be determined. Meanwhile, 4 RAR/NZ began a sweep in their allocated area just inside the Phuoc Tuy border in AO Warrigul, <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> routine of movement by day and harbouring at night while covered by the guns of the 104th Battery at FSB Wattle. Ambushing on tracks continued to prove successful. On 1 January 4 Platoon B Company ambushed a track, killing one Viet Cong, while later 7 Platoon C Company found a cache of twenty 82mm mortar rounds, twenty 57mm recoilless rifle rounds and 40 grenades. On 3 January 9 Platoon C Company was forced to spring an ambush during set up, killing two Viet Cong soldiers and capturing their packs. Because of the frequency that the Viet Cong were continuing to use the tracks in the AO the ambush remained in location. Less than an hour later, while in a company defensive position, the 6 Platoon B Company sentry contacted three Viet Cong soldiers moving outside the perimeter, killing one before withdrawing back the defensive position under the covering fire of the section machine-gun. The two surviving Viet Cong then fled back along the track away from 6 Platoon, only to be killed by 5 Platoon who was also ambushing the track.|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo and {{his crew}} also {{utilized}} a hip hop production style, which often subordinates song structure to a stable foundation for a rapper's delivery and flow. This was familiar to D'Angelo, as his first original recordings were rap demos. Subsequently, most of the songs were performed without a definitive structure, <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mid-tempo groove with minimal verse-chorus-bridge progression. This also resulted in an emphasis on texture over both structure and hooks. New York writer Ethan Smith noted this occurrence, stating [...] "most of the songs aren't really songs at all -- at least, not in the traditional sense". While not predominant on the album, some tracks incorporate sampling. Most of its production was influenced by hip hop producer J Dilla's input. On J Dilla's influence, Questlove stated [...] "He's the zenith of hip-hop to us. Jay Dee helped {{to bring out the}} album's dirty sound and encouraged the false starts and the nonquantized sound of the record".|$|E
