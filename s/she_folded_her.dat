60|$|With which words <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> in {{a closer}} embrace, and a really fond one.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms tightly on her breast, {{and laughed}} {{in a tone}} that made the howl of the old woman musical.|$|E
6000|$|And {{they put}} Gerda to bed, and <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> hands, thinking, as she fell asleep, 'How good people and animals are to me!' ...|$|E
60|$|She hath no scorn {{of common}} things, And, though she seem of other birth, Round us her heart intwines and clings, And patiently <b>she</b> <b>folds</b> <b>her</b> wings To tread the humble paths of earth.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms again, {{and looked}} as if she were ready to face some {{impending}} attempt at mastery.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' <b>she</b> answered, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> {{arms about}} him. 'You must {{not go out}} to-night. There are ghosts and dreams abroad.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nasha {{stood in}} the control room, {{watching}} the planet fall away behind them. <b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms, sitting {{down on the edge}} of the table.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms, {{and stood}} silent; and the house, {{from floor to}} ceiling, rose and cheered her until {{there was no more}} breath left in its lungs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nineteen." [...] And a smile {{passed over}} Miss Muir's lips, as <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> hands {{with an air}} of resignation, for the {{catechism}} was evidently to be a long one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha, ha, ha!' <b>she</b> cried, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> {{arms and}} wagging her head; 'and so he wasn't married after all, wasn't he. Not married after all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m sure I don’t know,” she again made answer. <b>She</b> had <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> fan; <b>she</b> {{stretched}} out her arm mechanically and plucked a sprig of azalea.|$|R
60|$|Theodosia stood up. The sun {{was getting}} low, and the valley beneath them, {{ripening}} to harvest, {{was like a}} river of gold. <b>She</b> <b>folded</b> up <b>her</b> sewing with a steady hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's got to suit,'said Una, and laughed. 'We Can't magic back at you.' <b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> {{arms and}} leaned against the gate. 'Suppose, now, you wanted to magic me into something--an otter? Could you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Watcher-by-Night {{is pleased}} to say that I lie, so doubtless I do lie," [...] she answered, her fixed smile {{deepening}} a little. Then <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms across her breast and remained silent.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gordon held Bernard's {{intended}} {{for a moment}} at arm's length, with both her hands, looking at her with eyes of real excitement and wonder. Then <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> in a prolonged, an exaggerated, embrace.|$|E
60|$|When {{she came}} to her own lane <b>she</b> paused, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> hands {{on the top of}} the {{whitewashed}} gate, while she basked for a moment in the warmth that seemed cupped in the little grassy hollow hedged about with young fir-trees.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>folded</b> up <b>her</b> gloves for {{the twentieth}} time at least, and gave Amelius his {{opportunity}} of retiring by rising from her chair. He made a last effort {{to recover the}} ground that he had lost, without betraying Mrs. Farnaby's trust in him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> rose, <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> gloves into a {{ball and}} her veil over her hat, and once more faced her {{reflection}} in her mother's looking-glass. I had not the courage to tell her that the expression she wore on other occasions suited her best.|$|R
6000|$|Hush, {{beating heart}} of Christabel! [...] Jesu, Maria, shield her well! [...] <b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms beneath her cloak, [...] 55 [...] And stole {{to the other}} side of the oak. [...] What sees she there? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> {{hands at}} her waist, {{and stood up}} very straight, looking firmly at Mrs. Munger, who {{made a show of}} taking a new grip of her senses as she sank unbidden into a chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wheels," [...] Tasso said calmly. She {{straightened}} up. [...] "No wheels, no parts, no relays. Not a claw. Not the Second Variety." [...] <b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms. [...] "You're {{going to}} have to be able to explain this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Balthazar's child," [...] <b>she</b> said. Then <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> arms, <b>she</b> retired {{herself a}} step, an {{attentive}} observer of what passed.|$|R
60|$|She was keenly offended, but the Signs {{she made}} of this were such as only Lydgate {{was used to}} interpret. She became {{suddenly}} quiet and seated herself, untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her shawl. Her little hands which <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> before <b>her</b> were very cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "My child!" [...] exclaimed {{the noble}} lady, as <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> Winnifred to <b>her</b> heart. Then {{she turned to}} her son. [...] "Let her know all!" [...] she cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{the butcher}} do his work," [...] mocked Soa; [...] "it shall avail him little. Doubtless he is angry because I have spoken {{the truth about}} him," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms upon her breast, {{awaiting}} the bullet.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will both}} come, {{for they are}} as tired of city life and as fond of change as I am," [...] said the writer of the above, as <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> letter and went to get it posted without delay.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Yoop took {{ample time}} to finish her breakfast and the prisoners {{had no desire to}} hurry her, but finally the meal was {{concluded}} and <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> napkin and made the table disappear by clapping her hands together. Then she turned to her captives and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course Miss Lee {{was ready}} to spare Jessie for such a reason, and <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> up <b>her</b> work while Miss Manners had a little talk with Mrs. Cuthbert, on the mingled pain and {{sweetness}} of the giving up her only son {{to be one of}} those sent forth [...] "to sow beside all waters." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms back again--grasping each elbow she sat firm; {{she knew}} he could see, and had known well from the first, what {{she had wanted to}} say, difficult, monstrous though it might be. [...] "No more than at my own--but to do {{something}} with your money that you'd never do yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|A lover she had had, and whilst {{he lived}} she had {{resisted}} them, and stood out against this odious marriage that for convenience' sake they forced upon her. He {{was killed in}} Paris in a duel, and when the news of it came to <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> had <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> hands and let them wed her to whom they listed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> arms as {{she leaned}} back in her chair. “Look here, Mr. Littlemore; I’m about as sweet-tempered as I used to be in America, but I know a great deal more. Of course I ain’t {{travelling}} with that young man. He’s only a good friend.” ...|$|E
60|$|Catherine got up; she was suffocating. But <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> work, {{deliberately}} and correctly, bending her burning face upon it. Her father stood {{where he}} had planted himself; she hoped he would go, but he smoothed and buttoned his gloves, and then he rested his hands upon his hips.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{turned her}} look, {{which had been}} glowing with awakened feeling, on her pale and still {{motionless}} daughter. The expression of her softened, and <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> child to her bosom, as the dove shelters its young. All her aroused feelings appeared to dissolve in the sentiment of love.|$|E
6000|$|I am gazing round me, {{with the}} horror {{that the place}} inspires, when Goblin {{clutches}} me by the wrist, and lays, not her skinny finger, but the handle of a key, upon her lip. She invites me, with a jerk, to follow her. I do so. She leads me out into a room adjoining--a rugged room, with a funnel-shaped, contracting roof, open at the top, to the bright day. I ask her what it is. <b>She</b> <b>folds</b> <b>her</b> arms, leers hideously, and stares. I ask again. She glances round, to see that all the little company are there; sits down upon a mound of stones; throws up her arms, and yells out, like a fiend, 'La Salle de la Question!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} leave this house until I am paid every {{shilling}} of which I have been robbed," [...] hissed out Mrs. Mackenzie; and <b>she</b> sat down, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> arms across her chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so nice of Annie Moffat not {{to forget}} her promise. A whole {{fortnight}} of fun will be regularly splendid," [...] replied Jo, looking like a windmill as <b>she</b> <b>folded</b> skirts with <b>her</b> long arms.|$|R
