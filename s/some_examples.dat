5|$|Admitting {{that plants}} {{generally}} have less obvious evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds <b>some</b> <b>examples,</b> {{as of the}} parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|Hyperinflationary Zimbabwean {{banknotes}} (such as the $100 trillion denomination) {{have gained}} considerable interest from the numismatic community and buyers in general for its absurdity {{rather than the}} design. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> of such notes may be sold further in excess of their true face value.|$|E

5|$|Verbal {{derivation}} {{is extremely}} productive, and Greenlandic employs {{many hundreds of}} derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{features}} {{of general relativity}} and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts {{to arrive at a}} viable theory of quantum gravity, <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge Calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology.|$|E

5|$|Each of the 19 {{months is}} given a name which is an {{attribute}} of God; <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty). The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with {{each day of the}} week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries {{in the history of the}} religion.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|Level {{of effort}} defines {{particular}} goals or objectives the recipient must achieve {{with the assistance}} received, and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service, specified level of expenditures for designated activities, and federal funds to supplement and not supplant non-federal services. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> are programs that establish that a recipient must provide medical services to 1,000 patients daily and programs that require that a recipients spend over 50% of its annual budget on capital projects, among other.|$|E

5|$|Palaces {{are usually}} {{arranged}} around {{one or more}} courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> are adorned with sculpture. Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.|$|E
5|$|Philippine {{music has}} evolved rapidly {{due to the}} {{different}} influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao. This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> of such solar {{clusters}} are the Charanka Solar Park, {{where there}} are 17 different generation projects; Neuhardenberg, with eleven plants, and the Golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500MW. An extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the Gujarat state of India a single solar park, the Gujarat Solar Park.|$|E

5|$|Still, {{the centre}} hosts <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> of modern {{architecture}} {{dating back to}} the Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired a modernist style of architecture. Another example of modernist architectural art is Palatul Telefoanelor, situated in the vicinity of Mihai Viteazul Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{value of}} tilings {{has long been}} appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with some decorative patterns used in the Middle East has been noted; the physicists Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies <b>some</b> <b>examples</b> of medieval Islamic geometric patterns, such as the girih (strapwork) tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
