Richard Maunsell {{was given the}} newly created post of CME to the Southern Railway, and decided to revise the {{cylinder}} arrangement of the locomotive. In doing so, he delayed the construction of further locomotives until the modifications had been made. When the modifications were trialled in service, it became evident amongst locomotive crews that Maunsell had taken a sound design and made it better, achieving a consistent locomotive capable of undertaking all the tasks {{for which it was}} intended. With the <b>successful</b> <b>implementation</b> of the modifications, permission was given by the management of the Southern Railway for a second batch of locomotives to be constructed.|$|E

40|$|Simulation {{has been}} used for {{modeling}} healthcare systems for over forty years. In many respects it is the ideal approach for addressing healthcare issues, yet the relatively small number of <b>successful</b> <b>implementations</b> would suggest that (outside academia) it has been underused in the health sector, compared with manufacturing industry or defense. In this paper we present a review of applications of simulation in healthcare, focusing on <b>successful</b> <b>implementations,</b> and we discuss some possible reasons why simulation has arguably failed to fulfill its potential.

40|$|While many {{innovative}} {{teaching strategies}} exist, integration into undergraduate science teaching has been frustratingly slow. This study aims {{to understand the}} low uptake of research-based instructional innovations by studying 21 <b>successful</b> <b>implementations</b> of the Student Centered Active Learning with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) instructional reform. SCALE-UP significantly restructures the classroom environment and pedagogy to promote highly active and interactive instruction. Although originally designed for university introductory physics courses, SCALE-UP has spread to many other disciplines at hundreds of departments around the world. This study reports findings from in-depth, open-ended interviews with 21 key contact people involved with <b>successful</b> secondary <b>implementations</b> of SCALE-UP throughout the United States. We defined <b>successful</b> <b>implementations</b> as those who restructured their pedagogy and classroom and sustained and/or spread the change. Interviews were coded to identify the most common enabling and challenging factors during reform implementation and compared to the theoretical framework of Kotter’s 8 -step Change Model. The most common enabling influences that emerged are documenting and leveraging evidence of local success, administrative support, interaction with outside SCALE-UP user(s), and funding. Many challenges {{are linked to the}} lack of these enabling factors including difficulty finding funding, space, and administrative and/or faculty support for reform. Our focus on <b>successful</b> secondary <b>implementations</b> meant that most interviewees were able to overcome challenges. Presentation of results is illuminated with case studies, quotes, and examples that can help secondary implementers with SCALE-UP reform efforts specifically. We also discuss the implications for policy makers, researchers, and the higher education community concerned with initiating structural change...|$|R
