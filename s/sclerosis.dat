5|$|Other, unusual {{types of}} MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo {{concentric}} <b>sclerosis,</b> Schilder's diffuse <b>sclerosis,</b> and Marburg multiple <b>sclerosis.</b> There is debate {{on whether they}} are MS variants or different diseases. Multiple <b>sclerosis</b> behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous <b>sclerosis</b> complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous <b>sclerosis</b> must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ataxia – Ataxia is an {{impairment}} {{that consists}} {{of a lack of}} coordination of muscle movements (e.g. cerebral palsy, Friedreich’s ataxia, multiple <b>sclerosis).</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} drugs are {{approved}} only for Relapsing-Remitting multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (RRMS).|$|E
5|$|Sinclair was {{featured}} on the Canadian version of the EA Sports FIFA 16 video game. She {{was one of the}} first women to appear on the cover of an EA Sports game along with Portland Thorns FC teammates, Alex Morgan and Steph Catley. In July 2017, Sinclair partnered with A and the Multiple <b>Sclerosis</b> Society of Canada on a nationwide awareness campaign for multiple <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Against Krupskaya's protestations, Lenin's {{body was}} embalmed to {{preserve}} it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum. During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although dietary {{antioxidants}} {{have been}} investigated for potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis,</b> these studies have been inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Because {{tumor cells}} are inefficient in {{processing}} ketone bodies for energy, the ketogenic diet {{has also been}} suggested {{as a treatment for}} cancer, including glioma, as well as multiple <b>sclerosis</b> and other neurological disorders.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can also occur {{as a result of}} exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple <b>sclerosis</b> lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Rowling {{established}} the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its {{annual budget of}} £5.1million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and multiple <b>sclerosis</b> research.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (MS) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} demyelinating disease {{that affects the}} central nervous system (CNS). Several therapies for it exist, although there is no known cure.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> an {{inflammatory}} process that may produce {{a loss of}} the myelin sheathes which surround the cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple <b>sclerosis</b> in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple <b>Sclerosis</b> Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. <b>Sclerosis</b> of the esophagus, such as with systemic <b>sclerosis</b> or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Targeted {{monoclonal}} antibody therapy is employed to treat {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> psoriasis, and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|The French {{neurologist}} Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) was {{the first}} person to recognize multiple <b>sclerosis</b> as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease sclerose en plaques.|$|E
5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and tuberous <b>sclerosis</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. The {{same is true}} for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple <b>sclerosis</b> until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} <b>sclerosis,</b> several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple <b>sclerosis</b> as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous <b>sclerosis,</b> which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Campbell has two sons: Christian and Tyler. Christian played {{high school}} {{football}} with Drew Brees, nephew of his father's former Longhorns teammate Marty Akins, at Westlake High and ran track for the University of Houston. Tyler was a running back for Pasadena City College and San Diego State but was forced {{to give up the}} sport due to multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (MS). He returned to Texas after graduation and divides his time between the family business and raising awareness of MS with his father.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous <b>sclerosis).</b> Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous <b>sclerosis</b> who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple <b>sclerosis</b> progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease {{is associated with a}} variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.|$|E
5|$|Dyer died on September 21, 1917, aged 68, of {{coronary}} <b>sclerosis,</b> {{survived by his}} wife and one of three children. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, Boston, Massachusetts, in the GAR New Veterans lot on Webster Avenue, in an unmarked grave (no. 125). It was his own request to be interred without a monument, stating that his Compendium would serve as a memory to his life, long after any monument had crumbled away.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
5|$|Glatzer and Westmoreland were {{approached}} by Lex Lutzus and James Brown to adapt Genova's novel in 2011, when Glatzer {{had just been}} diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis</b> (ALS). Moore was their first choice for the lead role; she researched Alzheimer's disease for four months {{to prepare for the}} part. The film was shot in New York in March 2014, with a budget of $4 million.|$|E
5|$|Having just {{completed}} the tracks for his fourth album in 1996, Walker was playing basketball with a friend, {{when he began}} to experience numbness, facial spasms, and double vision. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that he had multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (MS). Walker subsequently began changing his diet and treating the disease with a daily injection of Copaxone, sending his MS into an arrested state.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis,</b> Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous <b>Sclerosis</b> Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, it was {{announced}} that Lynch would star in her first lead role as the titular character in the Irish-produced film My Name Is Emily, written and directed by a man battling amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis.</b> Filming began in Ireland that month and the film was released in 2015. In April 2017, it {{was announced}} she would star in a revival of Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs for the London stage.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling {{said that}} the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death, which was {{influenced}} by her mother's death in 1990, from multiple <b>sclerosis.</b> Lev Grossman of Time stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love {{in the face of}} death.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates {{posted a}} video of himself on Facebook {{in which he is}} seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg {{challenged}} him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis).</b>|$|E
