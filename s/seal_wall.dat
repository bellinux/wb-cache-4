Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. High performance turbomachines such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine Turbopumps (SSME-HPOTP and HPFTP) are prone to experience severe vibration problems due to high operating pressures and speeds. The stability and response characteristics of these pumps depend significantly on the rotordynamic features of hardware elements such as the seals and bearings. The focus of this research effort is to develop a comprehensive thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic analysis of turbulent liquid annular seals and to understand the effects of annular seals on the pump rotordynamics. Seal eccentricity has been included for rigid seals. The eccentric seal analysis is {{based on the work of}} Nelson and Nguyen (1988), but a much simpler and effective method, namely the cubic spline interpolation method, is adapted to obtain the circumferential derivatives of the primitive variables. The bulk flow continuity, axial and circumferential momentum and the energy transport equations are utilized to model the flow field while Moody's friction factor model is adapted to account for the wall shear stresses. Wall flexibility of the seal can significantly impact rotordynamic coefficients of the turbopumps due to high pressures and low clearances. Linings of interstage annular seals in the SSME-HPOTP are made up of soft Silver alloys which can deform easily under the high pressures that are usually encountered. This study analyzes the effects of flexibility on the dynamic characteristics of concentric seals. The wall deformations are obtained using an iso-parametric, axi-symmetric Finite Element formulation of the <b>seal</b> <b>wall.</b> Numerical solution obtained by the current analysis compares wen with those of earlier researchers for the rigid as well as the flexible cases...|$|E

40|$|Sound {{transmission}} loss of vehicle seals was studied in this thesis. Reverberation room test and semi-anechoic chamber test were respectively studied. By comparing the sound pressure level, {{sound intensity level}} and average sound power level at the receiving side, it proved that a simple sound pressure level test may obtain same measurement accuracy when there is little reflected sound. A semi-anechoic chamber was designed for testing sound {{transmission loss}}es of the seals on a trial vehicle. By comparing the sound pressure levels between {{the location of the}} passenger ear and door area, it proved that most of outside sound energy passed through the door seals into the interior. The sound transmission losses of different sealing conditions were measured which included well sealed and imperfectly sealed conditions; Sound pressure levels at passenger’s ear in three different types of vehicles were also compared, these comparison results indicated this laboratory was capable of distinguishing different sealing conditions. The installation procedure was compared with the one in reverberation room test. Numerical analysis showed that the latter method produced a different compression shape which would definitely influence the sound insulation abilities of the seals.   The transmission mechanism of the acoustic waves through a vehicle seal was also discussed. Contact analysis showed high compression ratio leaded to tremendous inner stress intensity. But any further increase of the contact depth would not improve the effect of wind noise prevention. A vehicle seal with a complex shape was replaced by a simple model. The sound transmission theory of multiple partitions on the basis of mass law was applied. Whereas, compared with the experimental result, a different trend in the high frequency range was found. When taking the transmission though the side material and integration of incident angle into account, the result was quite similar to the experimental one. FEM analysis was also performed. The majority of sound power was believed to transmit along the <b>seal</b> <b>wall</b> into the interior instead of passing through the multiple partitions. A distorted circular duct model is believed to be close to the real geometry. QC 2010111...|$|E

Dense pack cellulose can <b>seal</b> <b>walls</b> from air infiltration while providing the density to limit convection, when installed properly. The University of Colorado School of Architecture and Planning did a study that compared two seemingly identical test structures, one insulated with cellulose and the other with fiberglass. The cellulose insulation lost 26.4% less heat energy over time compared to the fiberglass insulation. It also was shown to tighten the structure more than 30%. Subsequent real world surveys have cellulose performing 20-30% better at reducing energy used for heating than fiberglass.|$|R
3000|$|LLT {{gasification}} method. This method utilizes mined tunnels or constructed roadways {{to connect}} the injection well to the production well [4]. Typical long and large tunnel (LLT) systems consist of a gasification channel, two auxiliary holes, and two auxiliary tunnels (Figure 2). The auxiliary holes are arranged between the injection and production wells and are used as malfunction holes for the injection of air and water vapor, or to discharge gas for added gasifier control. LLT also includes an auxiliary tunnel constructed of bricks, which is an auxiliary installation for air injection that prevents blockage in the gasification channel. The mined tunnels are isolated by <b>sealing</b> <b>walls</b> to prevent leakage of combustible gases from the gasifier [35]. The location and height of the oxidant injection points and gas outlet points can be adjusted, allowing for two-dimensional control of oxidant injection and gas production [28].|$|R
30|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} very few {{examples}} of effectively sealed barrages or water retention schemes in karst areas. Following the experience, conventional injection strategies may fail to seal the flow paths sustainably without a systematic pre-treatment. Such pre-treatment may be the systematic flushing of karst voids using water jets in a close-spaced grid of boreholes. Its aim must be that the grout encounters an “empty” pore system rather than a system partially filled with highly mobile constituents. An alternative is the construction of continuous <b>sealing</b> <b>walls</b> (like diaphragm panels) down from the ground surface. Compared with the present design, both alternatives would require a much higher effort in terms of time and costs. For the existing Gua Bribin barrage, the residual amount of bypassing water (6 – 10  l/min) roughly equals 0.4  % of the HPP’s design output and can, thus, be accepted. Compared to the amount of water used for energy generation by the PAT, this ratio is even distinctly smaller.|$|R

The chamber also gives a good linear response to the gamma field over five degrees under condition of 1 atm. The pressure depen-dence characters show that the ionization current is only sensitive to low pressure. The pressure influence becomes weaker as pres-sure increases mainly due to the decrease of the mean free path of β ray decayed by tritium.

The test area was isolated from its surroundings by <b>sealing</b> <b>walls.</b> To enhance the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons, the water table was lowered to the limits of contamination within the confined area. The required input of oxygen was achieved through a system of suction and pressure lances. The emphasis of this investigation was to determine the efficiency of the in situ remediation. A comparison of highly contaminated soil samples showed a qualitative alteration. In the course of the bioremediation liquid tar oil caked together with grains of soil to form larger aggregates. The analyses of pollutant composition revealed a significant decrease of low molecular weight PAHs up to anthracene.
