5000|$|The quasi-country {{the revolt}} began in, the Princedom of Malagor, {{has long been}} known for its {{independent}} spirit and its rifles; it had long chafed under the Church's studied oppression of it and its artisans. With the new rifles (on Pardal, smoothbore guns and piked made up most of an army. Rifles took far too long to load despite their greater accuracy and range, because balls had to be rammed down the barrel; with the [...] "angels"' introduction of the Minié ball, this issue became moot) the army is considerably superior to conventional Pardalian armies. Other advantages such as bayonet rings, modern meteorology or <b>satellite</b> <b>cartography,</b> or canister shot merely are the icing on the cake.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{concerns}} the very significant contribu-tion of satellite ortho-images to archaeological research. The unavailability of cartography, updated or in adequate scale, is a recurring problem for archaeological research operating in urban and territorial contexts, {{and in the}} last years in-teresting experiences have been carried out with the use of satellite ortho-images; they can provide constant support to field work, both excavations and surveys, and to the man-agement of data in archaeological GIS. As an example of this, the paper shows the results achieved by three research projects carried out by CNR-IBAM in the Near and Mid-dle East, the Hierapolis of Phrygia Survey Project, the Tell Tuqan Survey Project and the Iraq Virtual Museum Project in which base-maps and <b>cartographies</b> <b>satellite</b> ortho-images have been widely used. In these projects, the use of very high resolution satellite images was necessary because large scale and updated cartographies and aerial photos are not avail-able. In the examples shown, satellite ortho-images have different uses, often linked to the possibility or not of an accurate ortho-rectification, with the possibility of the col-lection of Ground Control Points and with the availability of high resolution DEMs. These images were used to create space-maps for the field work, as well as to realize and update archaeological maps and cartographies finalized to archaeo-logical research. In the cases study presented, WorldView- 1, QuickBird- 2 and Ikonos- 2 images, also stereo-pairs, were used...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new urban cartography that was generated with {{emphasis in the}} GIS techniques and methodologies by a project of Instituto Jones dos Santos Neves. The main problem related to this project {{is the lack of}} available data to support the urban and infra-urban scale studies and analysis. It was detected by the project the necessity of a wide revision, update and refinement of the urban cartographic base of the Espírito Santo State. The cartographic bases previously used presented geometric distortions, old information, incompatibilities and toponomy problems related to the use of different sources of information, without the adjustment based on actual orthophotos or <b>satellite</b> images. That <b>cartography</b> is composed by different layers: roads and streets; urban limits; enumerations districts; rivers and water bodies; and quarters. These layers were updated based on remote sensing products like orthophotos and high resolution satellite images. The adopted methodology can be divided in four main stages: (a) geoespatial data modeling; (b) incorporation, compatibilization and reprojection of the existing data; (c) vectorization of the urban cartographic base; (d) delimitation of quarters. This new urban cartography of the Espírito Santo State in the 1 : 15. 000 scale will assist in the socioeconomic research and will be used as a tool for decision support by the public managers. In this way, the new urban cartography becomes an important tool for the democratization of data and information for public policies, for researchers and public administrators.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the very significant contribution of satellite ortho-images to archaeological research. The unavailability of cartography, updated or in adequate scale, is a recurring problem for archaeological research operating in urban and territorial contexts, {{and in the}} last years interesting experiences have been carried out with the use of satellite ortho-images; they can provide constant support to field work, both excavations and surveys, and to the management of data in archaeological GIS. As an example of this, the paper shows the results achieved by three research projects carried out by CNR-IBAM in the Near and Middle East, the Hierapolis of Phrygia Survey Project, the Tell Tuqan Survey Project and the Iraq Virtual Museum Project in which base-maps and <b>cartographies</b> <b>satellite</b> ortho-images have been widely used.

40|$|Broadband surface solar irradiances (SSI) are, for {{the first}} time, derived from SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric <b>CartograpHY)</b> <b>satellite</b> measurements. The {{retrieval}} algorithm, called FRESCO (Fast REtrieval Scheme for Clouds from Oxygen A band) SSI, {{is similar to the}} Heliosat method. In contrast to the standard Heliosat method, the cloud index is replaced by the effective cloud fraction derived from the FRESCO cloud algorithm. The MAGIC (Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code) algorithm is used to calculate clear-sky SSI. The SCIAMACHY SSI product is validated against the globally distributed BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation Network) measurements and compared with the ISCCP-FD (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Flux Dataset) surface shortwave downwelling fluxes (SDF). For one year of data in 2008, the mean difference between the instantaneous SCIAMACHY SSI and the hourly mean BSRN global irradiances is − 4 W m− 2 (− 1 %) {{with a standard deviation of}} 101 W m− 2 (20 %). The mean difference between the globally monthly mean SCIAMACHY SSI and ISCCP-FD SDF is less than − 12 W m− 2 (− 2 %) for every month in 2006 and the standard deviation is 62 W m− 2 (12 %). The correlation coefficient is 0. 93 between SCIAMACHY SSI and BSRN global irradiances and is greater than 0. 96 between SCIAMACHY SSI and ISCCP-FD SDF. The evaluation results suggest that the SCIAMACHY SSI product achieves similar mean bias error and root mean square error as the surface solar irradiances derived from polar orbiting satellites with higher spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|As known, at {{the present}} time, remote sensing {{technologies}} are being improved and year by year, by launching new satellites whose image taking configurations are improved with new techniques, images can be obtained faster with high quality. The satellites which had been launched recently for example; Quickbird, Ikonos and Orbview- 3 have 1 m and better resolution, continue their missions with quite success. As it is known, {{for a few years}} the computer users have been achieving information for every area just by using a computer via the GoogleEarth technology generated by America with the contribution of all other countries. GoogleEarth was improved for showing the images which are taken with remote sensing techniques, transforming to mosaic form for any area and describing the topography and cartography of this area. But, day by day, the various information has begun to be offered by Geographic Information System (GIS) integration to the GoogleEarth and the GoogleEarth has started to develop by this way. Now, the users can provide all types of information for any area after the integration of Geographic Information System to GoogleEarth. For example; they can decide their strategy which they will follow in a probable disaster (earthquake, flood etc.) or even, they can select a restaurant to eat something. In this study, Zonguldak city which is located in North-West part of Turkey is selected as the test field. The high resolution (60 cm) images of American Quickbird satellite are used as pads. Besides, 1 : 1000 scale digital topographic maps are used for the extraction of details like the roads and buildings with cartography and to provide the currency of the satellite images. The data which are acquired from <b>satellite</b> images and <b>cartography</b> have been integrated in each other in GIS. In GoogleEarth, the information from hig...|$|R
