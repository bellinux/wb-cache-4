40|$|Excerpt] Small {{business}} <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> are {{of congressional}} interest because the standards determine eligibility for receiving Small Business Administration (SBA) assistance {{as well as}} federal contracting and tax preferences. Although there is bipartisan agreement that the nation’s small businesses {{play an important role}} in the American economy, there are differences of opinion concerning how to define them. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P. L. 83 - 163, as amended) authorized the SBA to establish <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> for determining eligibility for federal small business assistance. The SBA currently uses two <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> to determine program eligibility: industry-specific <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> and an alternative <b>size</b> <b>standard</b> based on the applicant’s maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. This report provides a historical examination of the SBA’s <b>size</b> <b>standards,</b> assesses competing views concerning how to define a small business, and discusses how the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 might affect program eligibility. It also discusses H. R. 585, the Small Business <b>Size</b> <b>Standard</b> Flexibility Act of 2011, which would authorize the SBA’s Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy to approve or disapprove a <b>size</b> <b>standard</b> proposed by a federal agency if it deviates from the SBA’s <b>size</b> <b>standards.</b> The SBA’s Administrator currently has that authority. It also discusses H. R. 3987, the Small Business Protection Act of 2012, which would require the SBA to make available a justification when establishing or approving a <b>size</b> <b>standard</b> that the <b>size</b> <b>standard</b> is appropriate for each individual industry classification within a grouping of four-digit NAICS codes. The bill would address the SBA’s announced intention to combine <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> and to provide greater consistency for industries that have similar economic characteristics...|$|R

5000|$|Because of the war, current European fashion was {{no longer}} {{available}} to women in the United States. In 1941, hatmakers failed to popularize Chinese and American Indian-based designs, causing one milliner to lament [...] "How different when Paris was the fountainhead of style". As with hosiery hatmakers feared that bareheadness would become popular, and introduced new designs such as [...] "Winged Victory Turbans" [...] and [...] "Commando Caps" [...] in [...] "Victory Gold". American designers, who were often overlooked, became more popular as American women began to wear their designs. American designers of ready-to-wear contributed in other ways too. They made improvements to <b>sizing</b> <b>standards</b> and began to use fiber content and care labels in clothing. [...] Hats {{were one of the}} few pieces of clothing that was not rationed during WWII, therefore {{there was a lot of}} attention paid to these headpieces. Styles ranged from turbans to straw hats. [...] The 1940s are marked by iconic headwear. As mentioned above, clothing restrictions made hats become women’s statement pieces during the war years. Although hats were extremely popular they were not the only head accessories that were popular then. The snood was an important accessory to a woman working in the factory. Snoods were fashionable and functional at the same time, they enabled factory women who were wearing pants and jumpsuits to still look feminine. Snoods pulled hair out of the face by containing it all at the back of the head in a hanging net. With all the long hair hanging in the net, the front of the hair was left out and could be curled and styled to glamourize the factory uniforms. Other popular headpieces were variations of headscarves, such as the bandana Rosie the Riveter is pictured wearing in the recruitment posters. Another variation of the headscarf was simply tying a square scarf folded in half under the chin. Later in the 1950s and 60s these headscarves became highly glamorized by celebrities like Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot, and Jacqueline Kennedy. This glamorized look came from women in the 1940s who wore headscarves over their victory rolls in order to make their simple clothes look dressed up. Draped turbans - sometimes fashioned from headscarves - also made an appearance in fashion, representing the working woman of the period. These were worn by women of all classes.This type of headwear could be glamorous or practical. Turbans were the most functional for the working woman because she was able to have all her hair out of her face and skip washing her hair by covering it with the turban. Both turbans and headscarves were useful for hiding curlers so when a woman got off work all she had to do was take out her curlers and her hair would be set for a night out. All these alternative options to hats were popular, not only for function and glamour, but also because the look could be achieved quite inexpensively.|$|E

Here a procedure was used to adapt commercially available <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> for the <b>sizing</b> of the interleukin- 6 (IL 6) 3 'VNTR, which has allele sizes ranging from 600 to 900 base pairs. The procedure involves inclusion of products from the target PCR reaction as additional <b>size</b> <b>standards</b> for use with the <b>size</b> <b>standard</b> and is therefore applicable to the sizing of any product with any commercial <b>size</b> <b>standard.</b> Initially alleles were sized by fluorescent cycle sequencing to give a true estimate of their size (base pairs).

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, {{the performance}} of metrology equipment directly impacts yield. Fabs and equipment suppliers depend on calibration standards {{to ensure that their}} metrology results are within tolerances and to maintain their ISO [1] and QS [2] quality certifications. This task becomes more challenging as the device features shrink and tolerances become tighter, to the extent of their physical limits in many cases. As the industry keeps finding ways to meet the demanding metrology requirements, calibration standards have been developed and enhanced for all essential measurements, i. e. critical dimensions, thin films, surface topography, overlay, doping, and defect inspections. This paper provides an overview of such standards and demonstrates how they are certified and tested to be traceable to the International System (SI) unit of length in order to ensure reliable and transferable calibrations for fabs. The latest results on 50 nm Critical Dimension (CD) standards, 2 nm film thickness standards, and 50 nm particle <b>sizing</b> <b>standards,</b> along with their certification strategies, are also presented...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sizing</b> <b>standards</b> {{used in the}} United States that {{identify}} the body measurements used {{in the design and}} development of clothing were established from identified “best practices ” of the apparel industry. However, the industry as a whole has not adopted a single system of clothing sizing. We know that manufacturers and retailers use their own sizing systems as a marketing tool, convinced that this is a differential advantage of their product for their market. Regardless of the sizing systems used, however, almost all are based on the myth that humans have mathematically proportional bodies and that they grow in proportional ways. In addition, the shapes and proportions of today’s American population differ greatly from the shapes of the generations before. So a variety of issues impact our inability to ‘fit ’ the American customer of today. These fit issues continue to be a growing concern. This article, as Part One of two, describes the historical process involved in describing the body shapes of humans. In addition, it lays the theoretical framework for the development of an expert shape sorting system using 3 D body scan data...|$|E
40|$|Genetic mapping and DNA {{sequencing}} projects {{could potentially}} be completed more rapidly by using capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) systems running 48 - 96 capillaries simultaneously. Currently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multicolor fluorescent dye-labeling strategies are used to generate DNA profiles containing 18 - 24 genotypes per sample. By using 4 -color fluorescence detection and these multiplex PCR strategies, a CAE system {{has the capacity to}} generate up to 5. 5 million genotypes per year. CAE offers extremely fast, high-resolution separation of DNA and more automated sample processing than conventional systems because the labor-intensive slab-gel pouring and sample-loading steps are eliminated. We used a prototype CAE system in an ongoing linkage analysis study of inherited deafness in Mediterranean families. CA-repeat markers linked to deafness susceptibility genes on chromosomes 7, 11 and 13 were analyzed and DNA profiles generated which contain 6 markers per color. Fragment sizes of over 28, 000 short tandem repeat alleles and 3200 CA-repeat alleles have been determined by CAE. An average sizing precision of +/- 0. 12 base pairs (bp) for fragments up to 350 bp was realized in 1 -h runs. In addition, a versatile non-denaturing matrix was used to separate DNA <b>sizing</b> <b>standards,</b> restriction digests, and multiplex PCR samples. Application of this matrix to Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon deletion screening is also described. These CAE approaches should facilitate rapid genotyping of microsatellite markers and subsequent identification of disease-causing mutations...|$|E
40|$|All sizing surveys {{depend on}} the {{specification}} of body landmarks, and measurements between them. My research therefore began with {{a review of the}} standards, studies and systems used by collaborating partners. I was able to identify omissions and produce an extended version of ISO 8559 : 140 measurements relevant to a widened range of clothing products. Target measurements were scrutinised by industrial partners before being categorised in a new specification. I used the specification to pilot data collection methods, to establish and trial criteria for evaluating scanners, and to train data collection teams (all of whom I monitored during the first days of on-site data collection). The specification was also used to guide software development for automatic landmark detection and measurement extraction, but was subsequently adjusted to reflect new methods - required for capturing measurements using 3 -D scanning technology. This national study (funded by government and industry) applied scanning technology to anthropometry and led the way in revolutionising surveys for the clothing industry. It was the first to use automatic body landmarking techniques with automatic extraction to create not only a database of size, shape and marketing information for the UK population but a model for other national surveys (SizeUSA, etc.) Experience gained enabled me to participate in debates on emerging European and American <b>sizing</b> <b>standards</b> (eTcluster and ASTMS). The study (which I managed) attracted public interest: press events - held when the study was launched and at the commencement of data collection in each region - were key to encouraging subjects to participate (see portfolio).

40|$|The body {{shapes and}} sizes of {{children}} are distinctive and continually developing into adults' shapes. The sizing system for children's garments is not standardised between clothing companies and countries because to follow the national standard sizing system {{and to use the}} data of a national sizing survey is not compulsory for clothing companies. These factors bring about difficulties for garment makers for manufacturing appropriate sizes of clothing as well as for consumers while choosing the size of clothes in the global fashion market. For these reasons, a better understanding of body size and shape of children including their current sizing system and size charts is required. This research is based on in-depth empirical research comparing selected cases which are the UK and Korea. The aim was to provide a systematic technical guideline for garment makers by gaining a knowledge of current children’s body sizes and shapes and consequently providing an alternative set of data for the UK and Korea. Firstly, the main body {{shapes and sizes}} characteristics of infants and children including their growth rate, age classification, and gender differences were considered. Next, data of national sizing surveys and national <b>sizing</b> <b>standards</b> including the current brand size charts of infants and children’s clothing brands in the UK and Korea were compared and analysed by mixed methods. Also, consumer surveys were conducted and analysed {{to be aware of the}} difficulties in choosing sizes and purchasing tendencies of consumers. It was found that national sizing surveys and national sizing systems in the UK and Korea did not correspond significantly and it was referred that understanding of this contrasting designation and body measurement methods should be considered to explore each countries’ market. The different size chart constructing methods and body measurements between the two countries’ brand size charts also should be reflected for developing new size charts. It was also found that the considerably different consumer behaviour in the two countries should be recognised by garment manufacturers...|$|E
