40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} a novel technique to record displacements and compute local strains {{at the surface}} of typical geogrid soil reinforcement products using a noncontact high resolution digital CCD camera (video-extensometer) technique. Specimens of biaxial polypropylene (PP) geogrid, knitted polyester (PET) geogrid, and uniaxial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geogrid were subjected to in-isolation wide-width strip tensile loading under constant rate of strain (CRS), constant load (creep), and stress relaxation load paths. The specimens were gripped using a set of <b>split</b> <b>roller</b> clamps. Targets painted {{on the surface of}} the specimens were tracked in both vertical and horizontal directions using a commercially available CCD camera with ancillary hardware and software. The paper examines repeatability of the test methodology and demonstrates the ability of the method to record strains at high resolution up to rupture and to identify nonuniform distribution of axial and lateral strains in geogrid specimens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the impact and the polygon effect of the chain and the sprocket during the meshing process and achieve the purpose of noise reduction, a Hlow noiseH nano-structured metal mesh-polyurethane composite material <b>split</b> <b>roller</b> chain was designed by means of changing structure and material of chain roller. Noise testing and frequency spectrum analysis were conducted, for the new roller chain {{and the other three}} kinds of the same specification chains with different structural rollers, on the closed force flow noise test bench researched and developed independently. The results show that the new roller chain can absorb some of the impact energy, and reduce vibration and noise of chain drive. The noise level generated by the new roller chain is significantly lower than the other tested roller chains, especially in high frequency and high speed. The difference in noise level is actually 3 - 11 dB in driving sprocket speed of 1000 r/min, and a significant noise reduction is achieved. The results also verify low noise characteristics of the new roller chain and rationality of design method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce chain drive noise, by {{changing}} chain roller structure to mitigate meshing impact and achieve the purposes of noise reduction, a kind of duplex chains with non-metallic elastic material <b>split</b> <b>rollers</b> was designed. To study noise performance of the chains, noise comparison test was done on the same specifications duplex roller chains, and the test results were analyzed and evaluated. The results showed that duplex chains with non-metallic elastic material <b>split</b> <b>rollers</b> could reduce the meshing impact and the polygon effect, which could effectively reduce vibration and noise {{in the process of}} chain drive. So the design was reasonable and feasible, noise level was reduced by 3 - 8 dB and a significant noise reduction was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{models and}} {{associated}} mathematics used within the SPHERBEAN computer program for prediction of the thermomechanical performance characteristics of high speed lubricated double row {{spherical roller bearings}} are presented. The analysis allows {{six degrees of freedom}} for each roller and three for each half of an optionally <b>split</b> cage. <b>Roller</b> skew, free lubricant, inertial loads, appropriate elastic and friction forces, and flexible outer ring are considered. Roller quasidynamic equilibrium is calculated for a bearing with up to 30 rollers per row, and distinct roller and flange geometries are specifiable. The user is referred to the material contained here for formulation assumptions and algorithm detail...|$|R
40|$|Proposed motor {{based on}} {{magnetostrictive}} effect provides stepped angular motion with angular increments of order of 100 microradians. Driven to repeat stepping cycle rapidly enough to achieve maximum speed of about 20 rpm, provides torque {{an order of}} magnitude greater than electric motors, and brakes itself when power turned off. Magnetostrictive rods in electromagnet coils push against drive plate, causing it to rotate slightly. This slight rotation jams conical rollers between cam surfaces on outer drive ring and <b>split</b> drum, so <b>rollers</b> transmit rotation to drum. Suitable for precise, high-torque, fail-safe-braking, direct drive of robot joint, without bulk and weight of additional brake mechanism and gear train...|$|R
