50|$|The <b>sooty-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Turdus. Alternate names for the <b>sooty-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> include the golden-vented bulbul and several names used for other species (black-capped, red-vented, white-eared and yellow-vented bulbul).|$|E

50|$|The <b>sooty-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus aurigaster) is {{a species}} of {{songbird}} in the bulbul family, Pycnonotidae.It is found in south-eastern Asia.Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E
50|$|The park {{serves as}} a {{sanctuary}} for animal species including wild boar, barking deer, wolf, porcupine, pangolin and Siamese hare. Bird life includes junglefowl, white wagtail, grey wagtail, Richard's pipit, <b>sooty-headed</b> <b>bulbul,</b> kingfisher and munia.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} birds {{are found in}} the range such as the blue-winged siva, white-rumped shama, scaly-breasted munia, black bulbul, blue-throated barbet, pin-striped tit-babbler, blue-bearded bee-eater, crested kingfisher, <b>sooty-headed</b> <b>bulbul,</b> {{coppersmith}} barbet, great hornbill, chestnut-headed bee-eater and the red-billed blue magpie.|$|E
40|$|Distributional {{and habitat}} {{information}} on eight introduced bird species in north Sulawesi, Indonesia, is presented. The accounts {{are based on}} our observations {{as well as being}} gathered from published sources and unpublished trip reports. Three species (Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua galerita, <b>Sooty-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus aurigaster and Red-collared Dove Steptopelia tranquebarica) have not previously been reported in north Sulawesi in the published literature, while the continued presence and status of Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora, Zebra Dove Geopelia striata and Rock Dove Columba livia was considered uncertain in the published literature. Further work is required systematically to document the distribution, status and spread of introduced species in the north and other parts of Sulawesiâ€”an imperative from both an economic and conservation perspective...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{assessments}} of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity often ignore hunting pressure or use subjective categories (e. g. high, medium or low) that cannot be readily understood by readers or replicated in other studies. Although animals often appear tame in habitats without hunting compared to habitats with hunting, {{few studies have}} demonstrated such effects. We determined the flight initiation distance (FID; i. e. human-animal distance when the animal begins to flee) of a common frugivorous bird of Southeast Asia, <b>Sooty-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus aurigaster) across a gradient of hunting pressures in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, SW China. Controlling for confounding effects, we show that FID increased with hunting pressure, which was quantitatively measured through encounters with hunters. As FIDs respond more specifically to hunting than other defaunation metrics, we suggest {{they can be used}} as behavioral indicators of hunting pressure in developing conservation strategies.
