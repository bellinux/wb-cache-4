40|$|Hydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> {{sometimes}} {{associated with}} zeolites, form in an alkaline environment, {{in which there}} is a high concentration of dissolved silica. Such an environment existed during the Holocene in N'Guigmi interdunal depressions (Lake Chad), which led to the precipitation of various types of hydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates,</b> including magadiite, kenyaite, and zeolites. Scanning electron and optical microscope observations allow several microstructures to be distinguished. These microstructures result from either precipitation sequences or a transformation along a diagenetic gradient. New petrological, microstructural and geochemical data confirm the transformation of magadiite into kenyaite during its diagenetic evolution, of which the final stage is probably Magadi-type chert. The study of various deposits of these minerals (hardened beds, scattered isolated crystals, mineralized plant debris, irregular concretions) have been used for paleo-environmental reconstruction. The decrease in the abundance of magadiite concretions in the sedimentary sequence can probably be explained by the climatic evolution of the region...|$|R

It is established that the crystalline phase is formed irrespective of a mixing method and acid concentration. It is suggested that the cause of formation of acid salt of phosphoric acid even at a large excess of water glass is replacement of protons H + of silanol ?Si-OH-groups of silicic acid by cations of Na + and formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> which act as a connecting bridge between adjacent globules of the formed hydrogel...|$|R

25|$|In industry, {{the various}} grades of <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate</b> are {{characterized}} by their SiO2:Na2O weight ratio (weight ratios {{can be converted to}} molar ratios by multiplication with 1.032), which can vary between 2:1 and 3.75:1.

25|$|Modern terra sigillata is made {{by adding}} a {{deflocculant}} such as <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate</b> to a watery clay/water slip mixture and then allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by weight. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours.

After an investigation of the water flow, TEPCO began to inject <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate</b> on April 5th, and the outflow was stopped on April 6th. The total amount and radioactivity of the outflow from the crack was estimated to be approximately 520 m3 and approximately 4.7 PBq respectively.|$|E
25|$|Silica {{is rather}} inert chemically. It is not {{attacked}} by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine {{at room temperature}} to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000°C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form {{a wide variety of}} compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate</b> is often used in detergents due to its buffering, saponifying, and emulsifying properties.|$|E

40|$|Publication Date (Web) : December 12, 2015 In this paper, {{results are}} {{presented}} of experiments performed to assess control techniques to counteract the operational problems of agglomeration during gasification of a South Australian low-rank coal in a pilot scale circulating fluidized bed gasification (CFBG) plant. Kaolinite-rich clay additives {{were used in the}} experiments {{in order to reduce the}} problems associated with sodium present in coals. The effect of refreshing and removing the bed material during continuous gasification was also studied experimentally. Agglomerates were observed to form during tests that occurred without the addition of kaolinite; the joints of the agglomerates were found to be comprised principally of sodium and silicon, presumably as <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates.</b> <b>Sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> were also observed to contribute to deposition of bed material and ash in some parts of gasifier. Deposition occurred mainly just above the air delivery inlets to the riser and at the bottom of the recirculation leg. At both of these points, local higher temperatures than in the other parts of the gasifier would be expected, with temperature having a large influence on the viscosity and stickiness of silicate layers and their tendencies to stick to reactor surfaces. The addition of kaolinite clay reduces the formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates.</b> Instead, <b>sodium</b> reacts with kaolinite to form sodium aluminosilicates, which do not melt at fluidized bed gasification conditions. Agglomeration during normal operating conditions was not observed during clay addition tests. These results further show that the formation of coating and agglomerates in the sand bed can be practically eliminated, and with fine-tuning of the Kingston coal gasification process, the problem of agglomeration and/or defluidization can potentially be overcome during operation of a commercial-scale gasifier.

25|$|Most ceramic {{materials}} are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical {{energy in the}} structure; they {{can be thought of}} as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to soda-lime glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate,</b> normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate</b> which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of water}} as a coolant raised the problem of {{corrosion}} and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute sulfuric acid {{was added to the}} water to give it a pH of 6.5. Other additives such as <b>sodium</b> <b>silicate,</b> sodium dichromate and oxalic acid [...] were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons. The aluminum canning process was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process.|$|E
40|$|Inorganic {{adhesives}} {{have several}} benefits over traditional joining methods for joining electrical steels used in magnetic cores of numerous industrial applications. As insulators with very high melting temperatures, the adhesives offer {{the possibility of}} increasing the efficiency of these machines. The aim of this project was to characterize <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> as adhesives for such applications and develop methodology for their processing. The chemical and physical properties of the water-soluble <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> were easily altered by changing the composition of Na₂O, SiO₄, and water, offering a spectrum of properties to investigate. Several aspects of the electrical steel provided by POSCO were also investigated, including surface chemistry and microstructure due to processing of the steel sheets. Coating efficacy was evaluated based on the adhesive's ability to wet the substrate to form a uniform coating, as well as resistance to mechanical loads, including adhesion and flexural strain. Greater degree of alkalinity in the <b>sodium</b> <b>silicates</b> resulted in improved wetting, uniformity, adhesion, and flexural strain for the range of viscosities that supported these behaviors. The microstructure of the electrical steels influenced {{the interaction of the}} adhesive with the surface, but properties still improved with higher alkalinity. Firing parameters were used to alter the mechanical properties of the silicates, as well as to determine operability limits. The best mechanical properties occurred for those coupons fired between 600 °C and 800 °C. The efficacy did not degrade significantly with long exposure to high temperatures, offering promise for sodium orthosilicates as appropriate adhesives for the described applications. Further study of the environmental conditions under which the adhesives will be used, as well as full characterization of the insulating properties will allow the processes developed here to be scaled up for industrial use. by Jordan Marks.
