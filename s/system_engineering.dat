40|$|Although {{modeling}} and simulation and <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> are distinct fields, the increasing complexity of the systems of interest lead us to two emerging disciplines, namely simulation <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> and simulation-based <b>systems</b> <b>engineering.</b> This paper is about simulation <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> which is simulation enhanced by <b>systems</b> <b>engineering.</b> On one hand, it can {{be perceived as a}} natural step {{in the evolution of the}} discipline of simulation, on the other hand, the concepts of simulation <b>systems</b> <b>engineering,</b> the tools and the methodologies, the form and the content of work products, the types of data stores and the information flows currently show a great variety. Notwithstanding, simulation <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> requires a shared conceptualization for coordination, cooperation and integration. There have been previous efforts that contributed to the creation of a common vocabulary. Extending them, this paper proposes to develop an ontology for simulation <b>systems</b> <b>engineering,</b> which will specify not only a common but also an explicit vocabulary.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the class into service has not been without problems. Since June 2005, all active Armidales have undergone operating restrictions on two occasions, both due to water contamination of the main fuel systems. The first occurrence, in September 2006, led to the suspension of operations by the patrol boats for a month, and the engineering controls were redesigned. The problem occurred again in January 2007, and led to an 'operational pause' while Austal redesigned the fuel <b>system,</b> <b>engineering</b> procedures were altered, and fuel quality criteria were tightened. The five ships yet to be completed were fitted with the modified fuel system during construction, while the active ships were refitted {{over the course of}} 2007.

2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior <b>system</b> <b>engineering</b> techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E
