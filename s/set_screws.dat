2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|E

The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end.

This device has certain drawbacks, the most important of which is that the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be screwed in firmly or not at all. When the instrument has been passed through the screw hole, the bent end engaged in the opposite cortex, and the sliding collar pushed against the proximal cortex, the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be engaged firmly.

5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket head, beginning with <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed <b>set</b> <b>screws,</b> holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|E
