50|$|A {{balanced}} {{line is a}} transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, and equal impedance to ground and other circuits. There are many formats of {{balanced line}}s, amongst the most common are twisted pair, <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> and twin-lead.|$|E
50|$|While {{the above}} {{discussion}} focuses on preventing noise from getting in (e.g. into a microphone cable) the same star-quad quadrupole configuration {{is useful for}} audio speaker cable, for split-phase electric power wiring, and even for open-wire <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> transmission line.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} immunity of <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> {{cable is}} a function of the accuracy of the star-quad geometry, the accuracy of the impedance balancing, and the common-mode rejection ratio of the balanced receiver. Star-quad cable typically provides a 10 dB to 30 dB reduction in magnetically-induced interference.|$|E
50|$|Some {{balanced}} lines use 4-conductor <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> {{cable to}} provide immunity to magnetic fields. The {{geometry of the}} cable ensures that magnetic fields will causes equal interference of both legs of the balanced circuit. This balanced interference is a common-mode signal that can easily be removed by a transformer or balanced differential receiver.|$|E
50|$|If {{a ground}} {{conductor}} is also needed, {{it must be}} added {{in a way that}} will not interfere with the star-quad geometry. It should also be added in a geometric configuration that exposes the ground conductor to equal interference from all four star-quad conductors. The most common solution is to wrap the <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> with a cylindrical ground conductor.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} {{benefits of}} twisting, balanced signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level {{applications such as}} microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power cable. The disadvantage is that <b>star</b> <b>quad,</b> in combining two conductors, typically has double the capacitance of similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.|$|E
50|$|The Zobel {{networks}} {{described here}} {{can be used to}} equalise land lines composed of twisted pair or <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> cables. The balanced circuit nature of these lines delivers a good common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). To maintain the CMRR, circuits connected to the line should maintain the balance. For this reason, balanced versions of Zobel networks are sometimes required. This is achieved by halving the impedance of the series components and then putting identical components in the return leg of the circuit.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} is that <b>star</b> <b>quad,</b> in combining two conductors, typically {{has more}} capacitance than similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes an increasing loss of high frequencies as distance increases. The high-frequency loss {{is due to}} the RC filter formed by the output impedance of the cable driver and the capacitance of the cable. In some cases an increase in distortion can occur in the cable driver if it has difficulty driving the higher cable capacitance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Star</b> <b>quad</b> is a four-conductor cable {{in which}} all four {{conductors}} are twisted together around the cable axis. It is sometimes used for two circuits, such as 4-wire telephony and other telecommunications applications. In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors. Other times it is used for a single, balanced line, such as audio applications and 2-wire telephony. In this configuration two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together {{at both ends of}} the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together.|$|E
50|$|In these cases, {{the purpose}} of the <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> {{configuration}} is reversed. The star-quad geometry cancels the magnetic fields that are produced by the two pairs of conductors. This cancellation reduces the magnetic emissions of the cable. To work properly, the cable must be wired in the same fashion as the microphone cable example above. Wires {{on opposite sides of the}} star must be shorted together at each end of the cable. This means that 4 conductors are required for a two-wire circuit. Furthermore, this scheme only works if the two pairs of conductors carry equal and opposite currents.|$|E
50|$|The {{kinds of}} {{stranding}} have different transmission characteristics. The {{capacity of a}} stranding affects itself, for example the two conductors of a quadruple run parallel over the entire cable length in <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> twisting. Capacitance between the conductors is thus substantially higher than with Dieselhorst Martin (DHM) - stranding in which {{the situation of the}} conductors {{to each other in the}} cable changes repeatedly. Because of the smaller work capacity of the DHM stranding it is possible to form additional electric circuits with the help of a phantom circuit. Since the phantom transducers are turned on to in the middle of the master transducers, the currents of the phantom circuit on the two coming Rome circles compensate themselves.|$|E
50|$|Telephone trunk lines, and {{especially}} frequency division multiplexing carrier systems, are usually 4-wire circuits rather than 2-wire circuits (or {{at least they}} were before fibre-optic became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and return circuits themselves. The most common cable format is <b>star</b> <b>quad,</b> where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of a 4-conductor quad-star {{cable is}} roughly {{equal to the}} capacitance of a standard 2-conductor cable about 1.5 times as long. The increased capacitance of the <b>star</b> <b>quad</b> cable is not usually a problem with short cable runs, {{but it can be}} an issue for long cable runs. For example, an 8 m (25 ft) star-quad cable has a capacitance of 150 pF/m [...] for a total capacitance of 1200 pF for the entire length of cable. With a 150-ohm source impedance and 1200 pF load capacitance, the frequency response of this RC circuit is -0.02 dB at 20 kHz. If the cable was 80 m instead of 8 m, then the frequency response would be -0.2 dB at 20 kHz, and -3 dB at 88 kHz.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{balanced}} lines is {{the connection of}} microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in {{the large majority of}} modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as <b>star</b> <b>quad)</b> is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.|$|E
50|$|<b>Star</b> <b>quad</b> cables {{often use}} filler {{elements}} {{to hold the}} conductor centers in a symmetric four-point arrangement about the cable axis. All points of the star must lie at equal distances {{from the center of}} the star. When opposite points are connected together they act as if they are one conductor located at the center of the star. This configuration places the geometric center of each of the two legs of the balanced circuit in the center of the star. To a magnetic field, both legs of the balanced circuit appear to be in the exact center of the star. This means that both legs of the balanced circuit will receive exactly the same interference from the magnetic field and a common-mode interference signal will be produced. This common-mode interference signal will be rejected by the balanced receiver.|$|E
