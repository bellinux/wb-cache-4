HSP 70 expression {{was measured by}} immunohistochemistry and immunoenzymatic methods, resulting in increase in HSP 70 after bath immunization and persistent in fish exposed to an intraperitoneal (i. p.) booster. The HSP 70 increase in thymus was suggested as induction in lymphocytic cells, {{to be related to}} immune system stimulation after vaccination. However, a thymic recruitment of lymphocyte subpopulations, characterized by higher expression of HSP 70, was also hypothesized after vaccination. No apparent relationships were found between HSP 70 and apoptosis. In fact, the vaccination did not modulate the apoptosis response, as measured by TUNEL assay and by immunohistochemistry for active caspase- 3 expression. The lack of apoptosis effects could be ascribed to the use of inactivated bacteria that appeared not able to interfere with programmed cell death mechanisms. This manuscript aims to contribute to the knowledge of some biochemical features underlying the immunization, with a particular emphasis on the modulation of HSP 70. However, further parameters involved in innate/adaptative immunity and apoptosis pathways have {{to be taken into account}} to well establish the functional role of HSP 70 in fish vaccination.

40|$|Anemia is {{a common}} disorder, {{characterized}} by abnormally low levels of red blood cells or hemoglobin. The mechanisms of anemia development and response have been thoroughly studied in mammals, but little is known in other vertebrates, particularly teleost fish. In this study, different degrees of anemia were induced in healthy European <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> specimens (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax)</b> and at pre-determined time points hematological parameters, liver iron content and the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis and hematopoiesis, with particular attention on hepcidins, were evaluated. The experimental anemia prompted a decrease in hamp 1 expression in all tested organs, in accordance to an increased need for iron absorption and mobilization, with slight increases in hamp 2 in the kidney and intestine. The liver was clearly the major organ involved in iron homeostasis, decreasing its iron content and showing a gene expression profile consistent with an increased iron release and mobilization. Although both the spleen and head kidney are involved in erythropoiesis, the spleen was found to assume a more preponderant role in the recovery of erythrocyte levels. The intestine was also involved in the response to anemia, through the increase of iron transporting genes. Administration of Hamp 1 or Hamp 2 mature peptides showed that only Hamp 1 affects hematological parameters and liver iron content. In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms of response to anemia present in <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> {{are similar to the}} ones described for mammals, with these results indicating that the two hepcidin types from teleosts assume different roles during anemia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of a compound diet as a live prey substitute for feeding European <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> larvae (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax</b> L.). The effect of a commercial diet (Nippai ML feed) and live prey (Artemia nauplii) on tryptic enzyme activity, protein content, growth (standard length) and survival rates of <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> larvae were tested during a 27 -day rearing experiment. <b>Sea</b> <b>bass</b> larvae were divided into two groups. The live food group (control group) was fed exclusively on newly hatched Artemia nauplii (Inve AF grade), the test group was fed exclusively with the compound diet from day 15 onwards. As trypsin has been demonstrated to be a useful indicator for evaluating digestibility of food and the nutritional condition of fish larvae, individual tryptic enzyme activity was determined in both feeding groups. Larvae older than 14 days after hatching and fed on live food showed a significantly higher tryptic enzyme activity than larvae fed the compound diet. A similar relationship between tryptic activity and standard length in both test groups was detected only in small larvae (standard length < 7 mm). The usefulness of proteolytic enzyme activity measurements in larval fish research, as well as its use in aquaculture nutrition research, was confirmed. Protein content, increase in length and survival rates of the <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> larvae were additionally determined in order to evaluate an influence on the diet.

S.

The group fed the VM 0. 5 diet all died before day 30. At day 38, the larvae group fed VM 1. 5 had 33 % survival, while the other groups, with higher vitamin levels, showed at least 50 % survival. The higher the percentage VM in the diet, the lower the percentage of column deformities. High dietary vitamin levels positively influenced the formation of mineralized bone in larvae: the higher the dietary vitamin level, the higher the ossification status. In the larvae group fed at the highest vitamin levels, we observed a temporal sequence of coordinated growth factor expression, in which the expression of bone morphometric protein (BMP- 4) preceded the expression of IGF- 1, which stimulated the maturation of osteoblasts (revealed by high osteocalcin expression levels). In groups fed lower proportions of vitamins, elevated proliferator peroxisome-activated receptors (PPAR-gamma) expression coincided with low BMP- 4 expression. Our results suggest that high levels of PPAR-gamma transcripts in larvae-fed diets with a low VM content converted some osteoblasts into adipocytes {{during the first two}} weeks of life.
