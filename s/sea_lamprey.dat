40|$|Abstract: Barriers {{interfere}} with aquatic connectivity by preventing or limiting migratory fishes from spawning and other life history processes, {{and there is}} increasing pressure to restore connectivity. However, conflicting management objectives exist in many jurisdictions where barriers to fish movement inhibit the restoration of native fishes but protect native fish communities above barriers from undesirable invasive species. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, barriers are an important management tool in the control of invasive <b>Sea</b> <b>Lampreys.</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Lampreys</b> remain highly destructive in the Great Lakes, and are a constant threat to a 7 billion dollar fishery. Developing selective, effective bi-directional fish passage to remove <b>Sea</b> <b>Lampreys</b> while allowing the passage of native fishes has become an issue of great importance for Great Lakes fisheries managers. To date, efforts have included a variety of approaches including velocity barriers, seasonal barriers, trap-and-sort fishways, and eel ladders. The integration of emerging technologies, such as push-pull and electrical and pheromone guidance and advances in engineering, such as eel-style ladder traps are providing hope that better selective, effective bi-directional fish passage solutions are possible. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission is developing a research theme specific to selective bi-directional fish passage {{in the hopes of}} resolving the conflict between aquatic fragmentation and invasive species control...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrom March 1989 until May 1995 overall 675 hauls were {{performed}} using a commercial stow net vessel {{to get information}} concerning spatial and seasonal distribution, length frequency distribution, stock situation and migration patterns of lampreys in the Elbe estuary in northern Germany. 2217 river lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis) and 10 <b>sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> (Petromyzon marinus) were caught during the whole study period. The river lamprey occurred in 40. 3 % of the performed stow net hauls. The catch success was highest in the western main channel, whereas the frequency of occurrence of river lampreys was only about 10. 9 % at the most upstream site in the southern marginal area. In 1989 and 1990 significantly more than 50 % of the hauls contained river lampreys. In contrast, from 1991 to 1995 their frequency of occurrence was lower than 40 %, in 1991 even lower than 20 %. <b>Sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> occurred only at 6 from 9 sampled sites and were only observed in 1990 and 1992 – 1994. Total lengths of river lampreys varied between 7 and 46 cm. Based on the length frequency distribution, the following three size classes of river lampreys were separated: LF I (7 to 16 cm), LF II (17 – 26 cm) and LF III (27 – 46 cm). The majority of the caught individuals could be grouped in size class LF III. Total lengths of <b>sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> ranged between 69 and 85 cm and were restricted to only one size class (PM III). 70 % of all <b>sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> were caught in April and May. Most of the <b>sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> were observed in the eastern main channel. The maximum average abundance of river lampreys was observed with 6. 75 Ind · m− 3 · 10 − 6 {{in the same area}} in 1992. However, in 1993 and 1994 the highest average abundances of river lampreys occurred in the western main channel. Based on redundance analysis, a significant correlation between the abundances of lampreys and the environmental variables autumn, spring, summer, salinity, water temperature, grain size, new moon and first moon quarter was found. The downstream migrating river lampreys of size class LF I und the <b>sea</b> <b>lampreys</b> during their anadromous spawning migration showed highest abundances mainly in spring, whereas high abundances of river lampreys of size class LF II in the feeding phase occurred in summer. The presence of both size classes LF I and LF II confirms the successful reproduction of river lampreys in the catchment area of the Elbe. The observation of river lampreys of size class LF III during their anadromous spawning migration was closely correlated with the variable autumn. A spring spawning migration of river lampreys was not observed...|$|R

Exercise led to initial five- to sixfold increases in postexercise oxygen consumption, which remained significantly elevated by 1. 5 – 2. 0 times for the next 3 h. Exercise also led to initial 55 % drops in whole-body phosphocreatine, which was restored by 0. 5 h, but no significant changes in whole-body adenosine triphosphate were observed. Whole-body glycogen concentrations dropped by 70 % immediately following exercise and were accompanied by a simultaneous ninefold increase in lactate.
