5|$|Hard rock {{entered the}} 1990s {{as one of}} the {{dominant}} forms of commercial music. The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC's The Razors Edge (1990), Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991), and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987's Hysteria with Adrenalize, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.|$|E

Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in Weekly Shōnen Sunday; Urusei Yatsura, a comedic science fiction story. She had difficulty meeting deadlines to begin with, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During {{the run of the}} series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet {{due to a lack of}} space. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Weekly Shōnen Sunday magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.|$|E

The accompagnato recitative [...] "" [...] (The serpent that in Paradise) explains that sin has been redeemed. The second chorale [...] "" [...] (<b>Shake</b> <b>your</b> head and say) is also a four-part setting. The vivid bass line illustrates the crushing of the serpent's head.|$|E
500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{began writing}} songs for the {{follow-up}} to their 1999 album By Your Side as free agents, having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract. [...] The {{decision to leave}} was driven by Columbia's promotion of By Your Side. According to band member Rich Robinson, [...] "That record was destined to fail because... just said, 'It's {{not going to do}} well... It's no use wasting time or money.'" [...] The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker.|$|E

It was cut from [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] because the writers {{did not think it}} was funny, nor did it do well with a test audience, {{although}} Oakley thought the animation was terrific. To the production staff's surprise, the scene would make the audience [...] "erupt with laughter" [...] when screened at animation conventions and college presentations, so they decided to insert it in this episode.|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{promoted}} By Your Side {{by performing}} on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. [...] The album debuted {{at its peak}} position of number26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. [...] While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker (1990). [...] Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.|$|E
500|$|While touring {{in support}} of Sho' Nuff, Chris and Rich {{finished}} writing [...] "Diamond Ring" [...] and [...] "Go Tell the Congregation". [...] The two songs were recorded after the tour during a planned session for putting finishing touches on By Your Side, though the decision delayed the album's release from November17 to January12. [...] Rich said, [...] "It's cool that Columbia Records is backing us on an artistic level and they're being open to all the hassles that come with moving an album into the new year. [...] I know we're driving them insane with these last-minute changes, but we know it's all for the right reasons." [...] After finishing the album, Chris noted that it [...] "has {{the same sort of}} energy" [...] as <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker, [...] "...but there is much more to it. There are a lot of subtleties in these songs. These are rock 'n' roll songs with subversive pop hooks." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1964 season, Timberlake {{was awarded}} the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. [...] He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to {{multiple}} All-American teams. [...] After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, [...] "There {{is a great deal of}} loneliness in being an All-America[...] [...] [...] I get sick of it. [...] They all want to <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> hand, but they don't really know you. [...] All they do is stick out the glad hand. [...] I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America." [...] He joked that he might write an autobiography called, [...] "The Loneliness of an All-America." [...] He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", said Chris.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, nod in agreement, <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E

'Ship of Theseus' is one such rare film." ...|$|R

500|$|By Your Side was {{generally}} well received by critics. [...] Regarding the songwriting, most reviewers praised The Black Crowes for {{returning to the}} straightforwardness of <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Money Maker (1990) following the more adventuresome Amorica (1994) and Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] Gemma Tarlach of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel welcomed the album [...] "because it represents a great band's return to what it does best", calling it [...] "45 minutes of good, dirty fun". [...] Wall of Sound's Russell Hall found that the band's emergence from [...] "the jam-band haze that's infected" [...] their recent work resulted in a [...] "laser-sharp focus". [...] Mark Falkner of The Florida Times-Union said that beyond the band's mastery of their influences' musical styles, what prevents them [...] "from being just another tribute act {{is that they have}} (also) mastered the power, the passion and the fun that made the mix work". Some critics, also noting the change in approach, derided the band for returning to mine the same influences perceived in their debut album. [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News thus described By Your Side as [...] "a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy" [...] and marked [...] "Go Faster" [...] a sped-up version of Humble Pie's [...] "Hot 'n' Nasty". [...] The Times Nigel Williamson called [...] "HorseHead" [...] "Zeppelinesque" [...] and labeled [...] "By Your Side" [...] "a kicking boogie half way between [...] 'Cindy Incidentally' and [...] 'Tumbling Dice'". [...] Steve Dougherty of People summed up by commenting, [...] "Purists will wonder why to buy this album when [...] 1972 Exile on Main Street or [...] Stewart's 1970 Gasoline Alley exist on CD." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their Top of the Pops dancing {{style was}} {{critically}} {{described by a}} later performer as [...] "very typical of the 1960s: hands on your hips, wiggle from side to side, wave your {{arms in the air}} and <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> head madly till it almost comes off", though Cook herself said of working on the Doonican show (of which she was dance director) comparing to Top of the Pops, [...] "Pop steps are limited...With Val we have more scope, and we can work to get more of the feel of ballet into our numbers." ...|$|E
