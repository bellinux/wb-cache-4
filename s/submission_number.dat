50|$|First, when {{submitting}} a tip, it {{is important}} to use the Form TCR, which is required to be considered a whistleblower for this program. It contains declarations of eligibility that one must sign off on. A tip can be submitted anonymously, but if this is the case, one must be represented by counsel. When a whistleblower tip is submitted, a TCR <b>submission</b> <b>number</b> will be given in return. When a TCR is submitted to the SEC, their attorneys, accountants, and analysts will review the data submitted to determine how best to proceed. If it is a matter the Enforcement Division is working on already, the TCR gets forwarded to the staff handling that matter. Often a TCR gets sent to the experts in another Division at the SEC for their evaluation. Even if the tip does not cause an investigation to be opened right away, the information provided is retained and may be reviewed again in the future if more facts come to light. If the tip submitted does cause an SEC investigation, the enforcement staff will follow the facts to determine whether to charge an individual, entity, or both with securities violations. These investigations can take months, or even years to be concluded.|$|E

We reduce the estimation problem to a 1 D Ising spin model and define order parameters {{that correspond to}} different characteristics of the MAP-estimated sequence. The solution to the MAP estimation problem has different operational regimes separated by first order phase transitions. The transition points for $L$-channel system with identical noise levels, are uniquely determined by $L$ being odd or even, irrespective of {{the actual number of}} channels. We demonstrate that for lower noise intensities, the number of solutions is uniquely determined for odd $L$, whereas for even $L$ there are exponentially many solutions. We also develop a semi analytical approach to calculate the estimation error without resorting to brute force simulations.

A total of 35 Metschnikowia species have been described to date {{in a wide range of}} hosts, including flowers, fruits, flower-pollinating insects, and lacewings (Mendonca-Hagler et al. 1993; Lachance et al. 2005; Guzmán et al. 2013; De Vega et al. 2014; Kuan et al. 2016; Álvarez-Pérez et al. 2016). Yeasts provide a variety of unique bioactive metabolites that have medicinal importance (Mager and Winderickx 2005; VanderMolen et al. 2013). They are also used as biocontrol agents along with bacteria in agriculture, especially for the prevention of post-harvest diseases in fruits (Janisiewicz et al. 2001; Kurtzman and Droby 2002; Spadaro et al. 2008; Csutak et al. 2013; Türkel et al. 2014) such as Metschnikowia fructicola isolated from grapes (Kurtzman and Droby 2002). Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thumb.); a Korean medicinal plant (Mallavadhani et al. 1998; Kotani et al. 2000; Heo 2001; Giordani et al. 2011; Tsubaki et al. 2012) is one of the many plants that are inhabited by a number of fungal species, including the microfungus Fusicladium levieri (Scholler 2003); Metschnikowia reukaufii and M. gruessii which are mainly found in the nectar (Canto et al. 2015). In a study, it was observed that D. kaki fruit stalk is inhibited by a number of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi (Choi et al. 2017). However, despite the fact that a number of studies have attempted to isolate yeast inhabiting different parts of persimmon over the years, no study is known to have been conducted to isolate yeast species from the fruit stalk of D. kaki. In this study therefore, we describe a new yeast species Metschnikowia persimmonesis Kang and Choi et al., sp. nov. (type strain KIOM_G 15050  = KCTC 12991 BP) isolated from the stalk of native Korean D. kaki cultivars obtained from different regions of South Korea. M. persimmonesis was identified as a novel species based on pyrosequencing of its 18 S rDNA gene. We characterized this species morphologically, genetically, and physiologically, and evaluated its growth in the presence of various nutrients and environmental stimuli. We found that M. persimmonesis produces needle-shaped ascospores which is a basic characteristic of members of the genus Metschnikowia. Its taxonomic membership was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis that revealed M. fructiola as the closest sister species. This novel yeast strain has been given Korean Patent <b>Submission</b> <b>Number</b> (10 - 2016 - 0137873) and international Patent <b>Submission</b> <b>Number</b> (PCT-KR 2017 - 010681) and deposited in the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) for future reference and research.|$|E

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), by the year 2020, 80 % of Canadians will live in Lyme endemic areas. An understanding {{of the association of}} Ixodes scapularis, the main vector of Lyme disease, with it hosts is a fundamental component in assessing changes in the spatial distribution of human risk for Lyme disease. Through the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping methods and spatial analysis techniques, this study examines the population dynamics of the black-legged Lyme tick and its primary host, the white-tailed deer, in eastern Ontario, Canada. By developing a habitat suitability model through a GIS-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis, the relationship of the deer habitat suitability map was generated and the results were compared with deer harvest data. Tick submission data collected from two public health units between 2006 and 2012 were used to explore the relationship between endemic ticks and deer habitat suitability in eastern Ontario. The positive correlation demonstrated between the deer habitat suitability model and deer harvest data allows us to further analyze the association between deer habitat and black-legged ticks in our study area. Our results revealed that the high tick <b>submission</b> <b>number</b> corresponds with the high suitability.
