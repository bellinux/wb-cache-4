They propose that the resolution of this issue will be clarified by brightness observations in the next few years: forcing by a change in sub-solar latitude should be reflected in a flattening and decline of brightness, while solar forcing should be reflected in a flattening and then resumed rise of brightness.|$|E

30|$|DCS {{models with}} trend and <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> are {{described}} in Sect.  6. These models {{can be regarded as}} robust counterparts to the unobserved components ‘basic structural model’ (BSM). Seasonal adjustment can be carried out with the BSM by extracting smoothed components using the standard Kalman filter and smoother. Because DCS models only give filtered components, it is necessary to devise a method for smoothing. In Sect.  7 we apply this method to a monthly series of tourists arriving in Spain and compare the extracted trend and <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> with those obtained by fitting a BSM with the outliers handled by dummy variables.|$|R
40|$|When {{building}} stochastic {{models for}} electricity spot prices {{the problem of}} uttermost importance is the estimation and consequent forecasting of a component to deal with trends and seasonality in the data. While the short-term <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> (daily, weekly) are more regular and less important for valuation of typical power derivatives, the long-term <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> (LTSC; <b>seasonal,</b> annual) are {{much more difficult to}} tackle. Surprisingly, in many academic papers dealing with electricity spot price modeling the importance of the seasonal decomposition is neglected and the problem of forecasting it is not considered. With this paper we want to fill the gap and present a thorough study on estimation and forecasting of the LTSC of electricity spot prices. We consider a battery of models based on Fourier or wavelet decomposition combined with linear or exponential decay. We find that all considered wavelet-based models are significantly better in terms of forecasting spot prices up to a year ahead than all considered sine-based models. This result questions the validity and usefulness of stochastic models of spot electricity prices built on sinusoidal long-term <b>seasonal</b> <b>components.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} predicting climate time series that consist of significant annual and diurnal <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> and a short-term stockastic component. A memory-based method for modeling of the non-linear <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> is proposed that allows the application of simpler linear models for predicting short-term deviations from seasonal averages. The proposed method results in significant reduction of prediction error when predicting error time series of ambient air temperature from multiple locations. Moreover, combining the statistical predictor with meteorological forecasts using linear regression or Kalman filtering further reduces error to typically between 1 ◦ C over a prediction horizon of one hour and 2. 5 ◦ C over 24 hours...|$|R

With the help of this method we can analyze the structure of time-series and separate the harmonic and irregular (trend) components. Combined IVS time-series of zenith wet and total troposphere delays obtained in IGG were used for analysis. For this study, several VLBI stations with the most long time series of troposphere zenith delays were se-lected, also taking into consideration the geographic region where the station is located. The investigations were carried out using SSA mode. As a result, trends and <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> (with annual and semiannual periods) were obtained for all the stations. Using of SSA enabled us to determine nonlinear trends in zenith delay, and also to study variations in the amplitude and the phase of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> with time. 1.

40|$|PurposeThe {{evaluation}} of long-term heavy metal {{concentrations in the}} Gulf of Palermo (Italy) {{has been carried out}} in order to investigate how changes of pollution levels in the last 50 years can be reflected in marine sediments. Measurements of Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn concentrations were performed on dated fractions of a sediment core. Time series analysis has allowed to obtain information on the chronology of the heavy metal pollution of the area and to identify <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> and trends. Materials and methodsHeavy metal concentrations in the < 63 μm fraction of core sections were obtained by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry, after wet sieving, drying, and digestion procedures. Dating of sediment core had been previously achieved by excess 210 Pb method. A methodological approach based on the time series analysis was used in order to investigate the presence of heavy metal cyclic variations and to outline the trend of each pollutant. A spectral analysis was performed on concentration data to investigate the presence of <b>seasonal</b> <b>components.</b> The additive component model, widely used to estimate seasonal and long-term behavior, was chosen for the time series analysis. R statistical software and advanced toolkits have been used. Results and discussionSediment core has been found to provide information for years from 1959 to 2004. Time series analysis results showed the presence of statistically significant cycles, of about 10. 3, 7. 2, and 4. 8 years. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>components</b> of heavy metals concentrations and well known cycles have been compared. In particular, correlations with <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> of Sun Spot Number Cycle, Multivariate ENSO Index, and Winter North Atlantic Oscillation Index have been investigated. Moreover, the presence of trends in heavy metal concentration data has been highlighted. ConclusionsTime series analysis on the concentrations of heavy metals from a dated sediment core sampled in the Palermo Gulf (Italy) has been carried out. Cyclical pattern over a time of about 50 years have been identified thanks to spectral analysis. Statistically significant cycles have been detected, showing how metal concentrations in sediments also depend on natural cycles. <b>Seasonal</b> and trend <b>components</b> have been extracted, through time series decomposition by the LOESS procedures. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>components</b> of our data and of natural cycles show a good agreement in terms of series correlations.

Firstly, the univariate basic structural model (BSM) is applied directly to the aggregated series to obtain estimates of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>components.</b> Secondly, the multivariate basic structural model is applied to a transformed system of cross-sectional series to also obtain estimates of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>components</b> of the aggregated series.

50|$|Seasonal {{adjustment}} is a statistical method for removing the <b>seasonal</b> <b>component</b> {{of a time}} series that exhibits a seasonal pattern. It is usually done when wanting to analyse the trend, and cyclical deviations from trend, of a time series independently of the seasonal components. It is normal to report seasonally adjusted data for unemployment rates to reveal the underlying trends and cycles in labor markets. Many economic phenomena have seasonal cycles, such as agricultural production and consumer consumption, e.g. greater consumption leading up to Christmas. It is necessary to adjust for this component {{in order to understand}} what underlying trends are in the economy and so official statistics are often adjusted to remove seasonal components.|$|E
