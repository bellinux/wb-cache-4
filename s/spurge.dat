5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy <b>spurge,</b> and cheatgrass.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy <b>spurge,</b> St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy <b>spurge,</b> kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all members}} of the family Euphorbiaceae, <b>spurges</b> have {{unisexual}} flowers.|$|R
40|$|The article {{says that}} the petrophilous <b>spurges</b> of the Northern Caucasus {{originated}} from nonpetricolous ancestors of different related groups. The adaptiogenesis of these groups evolved analogously: nonpetrophilous euphorbias – relative petrophytes – optional petrophytes – obligatory scree – <b>spurges</b> and obligatory chasmophytes. The second group includes Tithymalus glareosus, the third – T. petrophilus, T. buschianus, T. schistosus, the fourth – T. oschtenicus, T. kemulariae, the fifth – T. meyeranus, T. baxanicus, T. ardonensis. </p...|$|R

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of <b>spurge</b> and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
25|$|Euphorbia tithymaloides is a {{perennial}} succulent <b>spurge.</b> An erect shrub, {{the plant is}} also known by the scientific name Pedilanthus tithymaloides. However, the genus Pedilanthus has been submerged into the genus Euphorbia, and is more correctly known by its new name (Euphorbia tithymaloides).|$|E
25|$|The major {{commercial}} {{source of}} natural rubber latex is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), {{a member of}} the <b>spurge</b> family, Euphorbiaceae. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{semi-natural}} woodland, {{with some}} ancient trees and others {{which have been}} recently planted. It has a varied flora, including wood anemones, wood <b>spurges</b> and primroses, and diverse birds, bats and insects.|$|R
50|$|These elusive {{birds are}} {{typically}} found between 1,060 and 2,800 metres ASL in forested wadis {{and areas of}} scrub. The fruits of junipers, acacias and <b>spurges</b> appear to form {{the bulk of their}} diet.|$|R
5000|$|The milky sap of <b>spurges</b> (called [...] "latex") {{evolved as}} a {{deterrent}} to herbivores. It is white, and transparent when dry, except in E. abdelkuri, where it is yellow. The pressurized sap seeps from the slightest wound and congeals after a few minutes in air. The skin-irritating and caustic effects are largely caused by varying amounts of diterpenes. Triterpenes such as betulin and corresponding esters are other major components of the latex. In contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely painful inflammation. Therefore, <b>spurges</b> should be handled with caution and kept away from children and pets. Latex on skin should be washed off immediately and thoroughly. Congealed latex is insoluble in water, but can be removed with an emulsifier such as milk or soap. A physician should be consulted if inflammation occurs, as severe eye damage including permanent blindness may result from exposure to the sap. When large succulent <b>spurges</b> in a greenhouse are cut, vapours can cause irritation to the eyes and throat several metres away. Precautions, including sufficient ventilation, are required.|$|R
25|$|Irish <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia hyberna) is an Atlantic {{species that}} in Ireland is only {{found in the}} southwest. In the past the milky sap from its stem was used to cure warts. Fishermen used it to capture fish, utilising {{compounds}} in the sap that prevent fish gills from functioning properly and so suffocate the fish.|$|E
25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia portlandica), sea <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E
25|$|The species {{inhabited}} riparian Caraibeira (Tabebuia aurea) woodland {{galleries in}} the drainage basin of the Rio São Francisco within the Caatinga dry forest climate of interior northeastern Brazil. It {{had a very}} restricted natural habitat due to its dependence on the tree for nesting, feeding and roosting. It fed primarily on seeds and nuts of Caraiba and various Euphorbiaceae (<b>spurge)</b> shrubs, the dominant vegetation of the Caatinga. Due to deforestation in its limited range and specialized habitat, the bird has been rare in the wild throughout the twentieth century. It has always been very rare in captivity, {{partly due to the}} remoteness of its natural range.|$|E
5000|$|Mercurialis [...] is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Euphorbiaceae, the <b>spurges,</b> known {{commonly}} as the mercuries. These are slender herbs (forbs), rhizomatious perennials and woody perennials, native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Thermo-mediterranean level: from 1 to 100 metres {{altitude}} on the south-facing slope. This {{level is}} characterized by a dry summer season from two to three months that promotes wild olives, white asparagus, Mastics, Tree <b>Spurges,</b> Clematis, etc.|$|R
50|$|The beach also is {{flanked by}} sloping sand dunes which are popular for {{climbing}} on, and can be observed undergoing biological succession - The dunes are becoming populated by marram grass and <b>spurges</b> {{at the top of}} the dunes.|$|R
25|$|These {{woodlands}} {{are formed}} by willows, poplars, alder, ash, elm and sometimes by Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica), lime trees, birches and hazel trees. When the humidity starts to diminish in barren {{areas of the}} Ebro valley, the Levante and the southern half of the peninsula, the dryness is often accompanied by an increase of salts in the ground; under such conditions one can find formations of tamarisk shrubs, oleanders and giant reeds (Saccharum ravenae), sometimes accompanied by heather. In soils rich in silica but not in salts, {{such as those of}} the Sierra Morena and the Montes de Toledo, <b>spurge</b> appears, accompanied, in the warmest places, by oleanders and tamarisks.|$|E

25|$|Juba's Greek {{physician}} Euphorbus {{wrote that}} a succulent <b>spurge</b> {{found in the}} High Atlas was a powerful laxative. In 12 BC, Juba named this plant Euphorbia after Euphorbus, in response to Augustus dedicating a statue to Antonius Musa, Augustus's own personal physician and Euphorbus' brother. Botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name Euphorbia to the entire genus in the physician's honor. Euphorbia was later called Euphorbia regisjubae ("King Juba's euphorbia") to honor the king's contributions to natural history and his role in bringing the genus to notice. It is now Euphorbia obtusifolia ssp. regis-jubae. The palm tree genus Jubaea is also named after Juba.|$|E
50|$|Phyllanthus niruri is a {{widespread}} tropical plant commonly found in coastal areas, known by the common names gale of the wind, stonebreaker or seed-under-leaf. It is a relative of the <b>spurges,</b> belonging to the Phyllanthus genus of Family Phyllanthaceae.|$|R
50|$|The Socotra golden-winged grosbeak {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} {{habitats}} from the mountains to sea-level. It typically inhabits fairly arid scrub- or woodland dominated by <b>spurges</b> (Euphorbia), acacias (Acacia) and juniper (Juniperus).

50|$|Croton gratissimus (commonly {{known as}} {{lavender}} croton or lavender fever berry), is a tropical African shrub or small tree with corky bark, growing to 8 m and {{belonging to the}} family of Euphorbiaceae or <b>spurges.</b> Young twigs are slender and angular and covered in silver and rust-coloured scales.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the plants}} that exist at Fajã dos Cubres the {{predominant}} species include, the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), along the lagoon, Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota) and the Azorean <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia azorica). The presence of estuary grasses (Ruppia maritima) within the lagoon is of great importance, since they were exceptional within the Azores (and only at this site). The fajã {{has a variety of}} typical marine flora and fauna, and its lagoon has become a natural refuge for diverse marine and migratory birds. Nesting birds include the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans atlantis) and the common tern (Sterna hirundo). In addition, annually, farmers bring cattle down to the fajã to graze. Although prohibited now, at one time fishing occurred in the lagoon, mostly mullet and anchovies, using netting techniques.|$|E
500|$|Boise National Forest is {{directed}} by the U.S. Forest Service to [...] "control the establishment, spread, or invasion of non-indigenous plant species in otherwise healthy native vegetative ecosystems." [...] The forest's plan addresses the need to control invasive plants, and management efforts include chemical, mechanical, and biological control methods. Invasive plants that are of particular concern in Boise National Forest include spotted knapweed, yellow star-thistle, rush skeletonweed, and leafy <b>spurge,</b> among others.|$|E
500|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy <b>spurge</b> and Yellow toadflax. These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
50|$|Hieronyma is a genus {{belonging}} to the plant family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1848. This family was formerly united with <b>spurges,</b> crotons, copperleaves, etc. (Euphorbiaceae), but {{have turned out to}} be well distinct. The genus is native to South America, Central America, southern Mexico, and the West Indies.|$|R
