The effects of volume fraction of both synthetic and natural fibres on tensile, compression, hardness, and flexural properties of the HDPE were investigated.

The higher strength of the composites was exhibited when at higher weight fraction of both natural and syntactic fibres which was about 50 [*]MPa. Date palm fibre showed good interfacial adhesion to the HDPE despite the untreated condition used. On the other hand, treatment of the fibres is recommended for higher tensile performance of the composites...|$|E

40|$|Oil price {{behaviour}} {{in recent}} years has made it very clear to all industry participants that oil is no longer a classical commodity but rather behaves as a financial asset subject to the influence of the same animal spirits responsible for the ‘irrational exuberance’ that characterises the financial markets, making it impossible to predict in the short term. Crucially, it has become more difficult to seize short-term investment decisions under such price volatility. Regulation might or might not come and in any case its efficiency against ‘over speculation’ remains to be seen. If structured wrongly, regulation could also harm small and midsize companies’ ability to hedge and hence their financial flexibility, forcing them to focus on increasing capital requirements for hedging. In any case <b>short</b> <b>oil</b> price volatility has created a confusing environment for investment decision-making. In this article, we argue that the leadership of the oil industry should learn to feel comfortable with high volatility and with animal spirits in prices while maintaining the longterm focus on supply and demand. In other words, business decisions in the oil industry should continue to be analytical but increasingly intuitive to understand in which part of the oil price cycle the industry stands. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} outcome of {{silicone}} oil removal after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery, and to compare results of a two-port (infusion-extraction) versus a three-port (full vitrectomy) approach. Methods Primary outcome measure was the rate of redetachment. Secondary outcome measures were visual acuity, rate of intraoperative and postoperative epiretinal membrane removal and complications. Results We included 147 consecutive cases. There were 15 cases of giant retinal tear, 26 cases of RRD without proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and 106 cases of RRD with PVR. The overall redetachment rate after silicone oil removal was 17. 7 %. In the group treated with the two-port technique (n= 95), the retina redetached in 16 cases (16. 8 %), and in the group treated with the three-port technique (n= 52), redetachment occurred in 10 cases (19. 2 %). This difference {{was not statistically significant}} (P= 0. 717; chi(2) -test). There was a significantly higher redetachment rate in cases with a <b>short</b> <b>oil</b> tamponade duration of < 2 months. Conclusion We reconfirm a relatively high redetachment rate after silicone oil removal. The risk of redetachment is not lower with the three-port compared with the two-port approach.

40|$|Draft version 1. 0 (2007 - 09 - 05) : {{please do}} not cite without author’s permission! Most of the post-democratization {{literature}} claims that specific sets of domestic governance mechanisms and/or political institutions are sufficient to explain the survival of authoritarian regimes. This claim has been verified by the observation of large-n statistical research that the durability effect has been independent of consistent access to external oil rent revenues across time, even though higher degrees of natural resource revenues tend to prolong the durability of authoritarian regimes across countries. In <b>short,</b> <b>oil</b> bust periods created no trend toward regime crisis or instability in rent-prone states. However, this finding leaves open two important questions: First, apart from oil rent, are there {{other sources of revenue}} which {{have an impact on the}} life expectancy of political regimes? Second, when trying to explain regime survival using material legitimacy (patronage and material co-optation), why do we not concentrate on state expenditures rather than on state revenues? The paper conceptually highlights that authoritarian regimes have a multiplicity of external rent income to their disposal. It shows empirically, using four cases from the Middle East and North Africa, that state spending towards key social groups has been surprisingly stable even during times of fiscal scarcity. ...|$|E

40|$|The high costs, the {{environmental}} impact and the decrease of fossil resources are intensifying the research for alternative raw materials in different industrial fields. The palm oil, extracted from palm tree, is a versatile oil compared with others unsaturated vegetable oils. It’s utilized by medical, food, oil chemistry and cosmetic industry. Recently, your production has been intensified due {{to the possibility of}} utilization as a biodiesel. Most of the vegetable oils can be utilized in the alkyd resin formulation, among them the most explored is the soybean oil in the alkyd resins formulation. 1 The resin is the mainly component of the decorative coatings, being formed by vegetable oil, polybasic acid and a polyhydric alcohol. These materials play an important hole in physical and chemical properties of the obtained coating. A lot of researches are being developed searching an improvement of the coatings properties and the reduction of the costs, modifying the resin components and the synthetic method. The most utilized process in the alkyd resin synthesis is alcoholysis, which allows the utilization of the vegetable oil {{in the form of a}} triglyceride. In this work we investigated the utilization of palm oil in the obtainment of alkyd resin, changing the oil content. 2 It was synthesized <b>short</b> <b>oil</b> resins ( 55 %), as showed in table 1...|$|E

The pH, droplet size, and zeta potential of all formulations were {{in the range of}} 6. 4 – 6. 6, 11 – 14 [*]nm, and − 6 [*]mV to − 8 [*]mV, respectively. Rheological studies showed that the nanoemulsions displayed non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior at low shear rates up to 20 [*]s− 1 with conversion to Newtonian behavior above this shear rate. All nanoemulsions were found to be stable against phase separation on storage at 4 °C and 25 °C for three months. <b>Short</b> <b>oil</b> length alkyd nanoemulsions exhibited significantly higher stability compared with medium and long oil length alkyd nanoemulsions, as demonstrated by an absence of phase separation and only minor changes of droplet size on storage at an elevated temperature of 45 °C for 3 months.

The entrapment efficiency of alkyd nanoemulsions was in excess of 90 % and loss of phenytoin content was restricted to less than 4 % during storage of the nanoemulsions for three months at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C.

40|$|Volatile {{oil prices}} and {{political}} uncertainty surrounding uninterrupted oil supplies has pressured the U. S. Congress and economists to search for substitutes. In response, the U. S. has enacted policies to directly support the production and use of biofuel. The current Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel use by 2022. A {{large proportion of the}} mandate is to consist of corn-based ethanol. Most ethanol is consumed in the U. S. as a 10 percent blend of ethanol and gasoline. In 2014, it is projected oil refineries will hit the blend wall (BW). In <b>short,</b> <b>oil</b> refineries are required to blend more ethanol into gasoline than is allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As a consequence, the EPA will need to either reduce the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2014, or permit additional ethanol blends to be sold. Overall, {{the purpose of the study}} was to analyze the economic impact of changing energy policy on ethanol markets. A structural, supply and demand model was developed. Four equations were estimated, and residuals were simulated to estimate probability distributions for monthly ethanol prices and total demand. Alternative scenarios were developed to estimate how the RFS, the BW, and corn prices affect ethanol markets. The parameter estimates indicated the major determinants of ethanol demand were the RFS and the BW. The results showed the RFS and the BW positively affected the price of ethanol and demand. The base scenario estimated average ethanol price to be $ 1. 89 /gal. When the RFS was reduced by 10. 59 percent, ethanol prices were estimated to decline $ 0. 29 /gal, compared to the base scenario. Total demand declined 600 million gallons. If the BW was increased to 15 percent, the price of ethanol increased approximately $ 1. 10 /gal from the base scenario.
