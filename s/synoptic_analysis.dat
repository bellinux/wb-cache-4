50|$|On August 30, a cloud cluster just to {{the south}} of Panama was {{observed}} by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Moving towards the west for several days, the disturbance remained relatively disorganized, but was classified as a tropical depression of 1200 UTC on September 5, after Satellite analysts at the NESDIS <b>Synoptic</b> <b>Analysis</b> Branch (SAB) and the NHC Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast (TSAF) unit classified the disturbance as a T1.5 by the Dvorak Technique at the time. Additionally, satellite imagery showed a typical banding type pattern, although the associated convection was loosely organized. However, by 0600 UTC September 6, convection had become more intense and better organized. Subsequently, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kenneth, while situated 625 mi south of the southern tip of Baja California. At this time, a large circulation associated with Kenneth was evident, with the ship Silvie III reporting40 mph sustained winds, which was positioned 235 mi away from the storm's center. On September 7, deep convection began to markedly increase near the center of circulation, and it estimated that Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 8. Continuing to strengthen, Kenneth attained Category 2 status at 0600 UTC on September 10, characterized by a distinct eye, and strengthened further to attain major hurricane status six hours later. Moving towards the northwest, Kenneth attained Category 4 status at 1800 UTC, and reached a peak intensity of 150 mph with a minimum barometric pressure of at 0600 UTC on September 11. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken as high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures began to impede on the storm. Kenneth weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early on September 12, and a Category 2 hurricane by 1800 UTC. Moving towards the west-northwest, Kenneth became a minimal hurricane late on September 14, and weakened further to tropical storm status at 00 UTC on September 15. The system weakened to a tropical depression on September 16, and finally, after thirteen days as a tropical cyclone, Kenneth dissipated in the open Pacific, without any effects to land.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with the use of the}} synoptic approach within decision making concerning nuclear waste management. The synoptic approach to decision making refers to an approach to rational decision making that assumes as an ideal, comprehensiveness of information and analysis. Two case studies are examined in which a high degree of <b>synoptic</b> <b>analysis</b> has been used within the decision making process. The case studies examined are the Windscale Inquiry into the decision to build the THORP reprocessing plant and the Nirex safety assessment of nuclear waste disposal. The case studies are used to test Lindblom's hypothesis that a synoptic approach to decision making is not achievable. In the first case study Lindblom's hypothesis is tested through the evaluation of the decision to build the THORP plant, taken following the Windscale Inquiry. It is concluded that the incongruity of this decision supports Lindblom's hypothesis. However, it has been argued that the Inquiry should be seen as a legitimisation exercise for a decision that was effectively predetermined, rather than a rigorous <b>synoptic</b> <b>analysis.</b> Therefore, the Windscale Inquiry does not provide a robust test of the synoptic method. It was concluded that a methodology was required, that allowed robust conclusions to be drawn, despite the ambiguity of the role of the synoptic method in decision making. Thus, the methodology adopted for the second case study was modified. In this case study the synoptic method was evaluated directly. This was achieved through the analysis of the cogency of the Nirex safety assessment. It was concluded that the failure of Nirex to provide a cogent <b>synoptic</b> <b>analysis</b> supported Lindblom's criticism of the synoptic method. Moreover, it was found that the synoptic method failed in the way that Lindblom predicted that it would...|$|E

The European region {{has a history of}} being struck by extreme cyclones that cause {{significant damage}} to property. Thus, it is important to investigate how these cyclones evolve and to find the cause of their strength. In this study a <b>synoptic</b> <b>analysis</b> of Nina, following a method developed by Boettcher and Wernli (2013), is performed. From the method, {{it was found that the}} synoptic environment during Nina featured large low level baroclincity and high moisture content, which are favorable ingredients for formation of a Diabatic Rossby Vortex. It was also found that the presence of an upstream upper level trough, eventually overtaking Nina, caused explosive intensification of the cyclone. Based on the <b>synoptic</b> <b>analysis,</b> strong evidence was found to conclude that Nina evolved similar to a Diabatic Rossby Vortex. In addition, due to significant forecast uncertainty of Nina with respect to the track and location, a sensitivity analysis of the cyclone was performed. From the sensitivity analysis it was found that Nina was heavily influenced by moisture in the low-to mid-levels of the atmosphere, providing additional evidence that Nina evolved similar to a Diabatic Rossby Vortex. By choosing kinetic energy and potential vorticity as response functions in an Adjoint Modeling system at the time of landfall of the cyclone, it was possible to relate the strength and track of Nina to the dynamics at the initial nonlinear field of a forecast. It was found where the initial nonlinear model field could be perturbed to create a stronger storm, and where the initial nonlinear model field could be perturbed to change the track of Nina at landfall.
