40|$|The present paper {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} heat transfer enhancement of a microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet. In order {{to evaluate the}} cooling performance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet, temperature distributions are measured by using a micro-thermal sensor array manufactured through simple and convenient microfabrication processes. Based on these experimental results, the thermal resistance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet is obtained and compared with the thermal resistance as calculated numerically. In order to show the heat transfer enhancement of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging jet, its thermal resistance is {{compared with that of}} a microchannel heat sink with a parallel flow. Under the condition that the pumping power is 0. 072 W, the thermal resistance of the microchannel heat sink <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impinging air jet is experimentally obtained to be 6. 1 ◦C/W, which is enhanced by about 48. 5 % compared with that of the microchannel heat sink with a parallel flow.
