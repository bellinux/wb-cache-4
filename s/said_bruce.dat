When asked who among his boxing opponents most reminded him of Glass Joe, Mike Tyson <b>said</b> <b>Bruce</b> Seldon whom he claimed he didn't even need to hit. Yahoo! Sports' Mike Oz created the [...] "Glass Joe Title" [...] (awarded for poor performance in the MLB). He has so far awarded it to the Los Angeles Angels, the New York Mets, the New York Yankees, and the Atlanta Braves.|$|E

2500|$|Hunter was not {{implicated in}} the Duke Cunningham/Brent R. Wilkes congressional bribery scandal. In December 2005, Hunter {{directed}} that the contributions his campaign received from Wilkes and Wade {{be given to the}} Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund. [...] "We had options," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Bruce</b> Young, treasurer for Hunter's re-election campaign. [...] "We could keep the money, send it back, send it to the government or send it to a charity. We just felt that because of the situation, we would rather not have the money." [...] More than 100 members of the House and Senate – Republicans and Democrats – accepted money from Wilkes, former MZM Inc. president Mitchell Wade, their relatives, employees or political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign watchdog group.|$|E

Going ashore, he and his {{commander}} of covert operations in Europe, Colonel David Bruce, were shot at by a German plane, then moved on toward the American front lines and encountered German machine-gun fire. As they lay on the ground, Bruce later recalled, Donovan said, [...] "David, we mustn't be captured. We know too much." [...] Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn't. [...] "I must shoot first," [...] Donovan <b>said.</b> <b>Bruce</b> replied, [...] "Yes, sir, but can we do much against machine guns with our pistols?" [...] Donovan explained: [...] "Oh, you don't understand. I mean, if we are about to be captured, I'll shoot you first. After all, I am your commanding officer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bahraini {{human rights}} groups and {{opposition}} parties have heavily criticized recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces. Nabeel Rajab said [...] "They're told {{they are going to}} go to a holy war in Bahrain to kill some non-Muslims or kafir [...] or Shias ... And those are maybe responsible for a lot of killing and a lot of systematic torture and human rights violations committed in the past months and years". Michael Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute linked recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces to the lack of government confidence in its own citizens. [...] "So they rely on foreign recruits to unquestioningly carry out orders of violently suppressing protests", he <b>said.</b> <b>Bruce</b> Riedel, a leading American expert on South Asia said [...] "when the very serious demonstrations began and it looked like the regime might even be toppled at a certain point, their hiring of mercenaries went up substantially".|$|E

6000|$|... "Pity," [...] <b>said</b> Jack <b>Bruce.</b> [...] "If you'd {{mentioned}} {{that it was}} Joe who'd been training you, he {{would probably have been}} much more for it. You see, he couldn't know whether you were any good or not from your letter. But if you'd told him that Joe Bevan and Hunt both thought you good, he'd have seen there was something in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wrote Jem to-day {{and told}} him not to worry 'bout you not getting your mayflowers," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Bruce</b> seriously, [...] "'cause I'd see to that. And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now, so it won't be very long before I'll be eighteen, and then I'll go to help him fight, and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place. I wrote Jerry, too. Jerry's getting better, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear you're right," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Bruce,</b> who, having sojourned a {{considerable}} time in England, had {{lost much of}} his northern language and accent. [...] "That horrible instrument, the boot, was brought this very morning to my smiddy for repair.

"Don't you see," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Bruce,</b> looking levelly at Susan, {{out of his}} blackly blue eyes, [...] "if he {{was turned}} into a good man he would {{understand}} how dreadful the things he has done are, and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way.

That is what I would do. Don't you think, Mrs. Blythe, that would be the very worstest punishment of all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Bruce {{returned}} {{later to}} Scotland, and met the King in April 1602. Now, he said, according to Calderwood, {{that he was}} ‘resolved,’ that is, convinced. What convinced him? Mar’s oath. ‘How could he swear?’ asked James; ‘he neither saw nor heard’—that is, what passed between James, {{the man in the}} turret, and the Master. ‘I cannot tell you how he could swear, but indeed he swore very deeply,’ <b>said</b> <b>Bruce,</b> and reported the oath, which must have been a fine example. James took Bruce’s preference of Mar’s oath to his own word very calmly. Bruce was troubled about the exact state of affairs between James and the Master. ‘Doubt ye of that?’ said the King, ‘then ye could not but count me a murderer.’ ‘It followeth not, if it please you, Sir,’ said Mr. Robert, ‘for ye might have had some secret cause.’ {107a} ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{this point}} of conscience, {{the right of a}} king to commit murder on a subject for reasons of State, Protestant opinion seems to have been lenient. When the Ruthvens were killed at Perth, on August 5, 1600, in an affair the most mysterious of all mysteries, the Rev. Robert Bruce, a stern Presbyterian, refused to believe that James VI. had not planned their slaughter. 'But your Majesty might have secret reasons,' <b>said</b> <b>Bruce</b> to the King, who, {{naturally}} and truly, maintained his own innocence. This looks as if Mr. Bruce, like the confessor of Philip, held that a king had a right to murder a subject for secret reasons of State. The Inquisition vigorously repudiated the doctrine, when maintained by a Spanish preacher, but Knox approved of King Henry's (Darnley's) murder of Riccio. My sympathies, on this point, are with the Inquisition.|$|E
