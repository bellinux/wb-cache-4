25|$|Max tries {{programming}} his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. In {{the middle}} of printing out its picks, Euclid prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, {{as well as a}} <b>single</b> <b>pick</b> at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max tosses the printout away. The next morning, he checks the financial pages and sees that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately for the printout but cannot find it. Sol becomes unnerved when Max mentions the number, asking if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.|$|E
500|$|Previewing {{the episode}} {{as one of}} his TV choices for the day, The Guardians Gareth McClean stated that amongst [...] "the snarling, {{shouting}} and awful, contrived sexual tension between Captain Pratt and the team, there's an interesting idea here— the consequences of leading a double life." [...] He described Gwen as [...] "the moral centre of the show" [...] and joked that her [...] "nice-but-dim boyfriend" [...] must be the last person in Cardiff not to know of Torchwood's existence. [...] He concluded by stating [...] "that a giant telepathic alien manatee is involved should by no means discourage viewing." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon also selected the episode as her <b>single</b> <b>pick</b> of the day, praising scenes where Rhys and Torchwood formulate their infiltration plan as containing [...] "the kind of sharp, sarcastic banter that made Buffy such fun to watch". However, she felt that it was a [...] "shame they can't keep it up for the entire episode." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, feeling it to be a [...] "juicy treat to devour, combining heightened drama, genuine emotion and nice touches of humour." [...] He praised the decision to foreground the character of Rhys, the contrast he provided to the operations of the Torchwood team and the realism of the arguments between him and Gwen. He also felt that the episode's [...] "eco-friendly plot" [...] made it easy to sympathise with the alien space whale stating [...] "the emotive howls of pain, big puppy-dog eyes and heartfelt score all [...] to test the tear ducts." [...] However, he criticised the human antagonists for being [...] "two-dimensional plot functions rather than humans" [...] and pointed out the [...] "moral black hole" [...] of Torchwood continuing to buy meat products despite condemning the plight of the space whale. Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave the episode four stars, feeling it highlighted how the [...] "series has evolved" [...] in that [...] "the in-fighting and gratuitous swearing have been replaced with slick dialogue that sizzles with humour and drama– not to mention a team that feels like a properly cohesive unit." [...] He also praised the increased role of Rhys and opined that the episode made the relationship between him and Gwen [...] "the show's most believable." [...] However, he felt that Jack, as the leader of a top secret organisation, should have pressed harder to have Rhys' memory wiped.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{individual}} digits play {{notes on}} the guitar rather than the hand working as a single unit (which is the case when a guitarist is holding a <b>single</b> <b>pick),</b> a guitarist playing fingerstyle can perform several musical elements simultaneously.
