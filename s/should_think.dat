5|$|Olivia {{returns to}} the lab and convinces Astrid to let her review Fauxlivia's notes, believing that she <b>should</b> <b>think</b> like her doppelgänger, she will see {{something}} they missed. Eventually, she comes to identify a cipher based on her childhood name, Olive, that identifies Newton and the other slain shapeshifters, and one {{that has yet to}} be killed. Fringe begins to descend on his residence.|$|E
5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They <b>should</b> <b>think</b> of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he <b>should</b> <b>think</b> about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E

5|$|To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal {{spends most}} of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, {{drinking}} and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under John Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal <b>should</b> <b>think</b> of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a dilemma in who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack <b>should</b> <b>think</b> about whether or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he asked her for advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E

The person <b>should</b> <b>think</b> his worship to be the Last Worship so that he may perform the best he can.|$|E

25|$|While meditating, the {{practitioner}} (whose goal is detachment) <b>should</b> <b>think</b> on {{what makes the}} corpse (who was alive till a day after) different from him and other living beings and thus discover {{the knowledge of the}} living force within all living beings. He (or she) identifies with the corpse and contemplates on the ephemeral nature of the body, whose dissolution leads to the discovery of the living force within.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we <b>should</b> <b>think</b> that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's 1944 State of the Union Address {{advocated}} that Americans <b>should</b> <b>think</b> {{of basic}} economic {{rights as a}} Second Bill of Rights. In his most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included post-secondary education, medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously {{in both houses of}} Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half would benefit from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill.|$|E

25|$|Peter Coni, who {{was elected}} as Chairman of the regatta’s Committee of Management in 1978, was {{supportive}} {{of the idea of}} introducing women's events. However, he had had little time to take any action when there was an attempt to force the issue. Kingston Rowing Club sent in an entry for the Double Sculls Challenge Cup in the names of A.Hohl and P.Bird. The crew was in fact Great Britain internationals Astrid Ayling and Pauline Hart, who had made the entry under their maiden names. The regatta realised the subterfuge and Coni made a statement to the press in which he said that it was 'sad that a long-established club <b>should</b> <b>think</b> it reasonable behaviour to make a deliberately false declaration'. He added that the stewards had no fear of the Sex Discrimination Act.|$|E
25|$|Artist {{development}} {{was a major}} part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they <b>should</b> <b>think,</b> act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era. Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label. The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist development classes.|$|E
25|$|The events {{behind their}} betrothal began after John William was almost killed by cannon fire and roundshot on two {{different}} occasions. His mother, Henriette Amalia, perhaps realizing how vulnerable her son was, quickly began looking for a suitable bride to ensure an heir. In the end, the choice came down to two German princesses. She apparently informed him that he <b>should</b> <b>think</b> of the choice as between two chairs, {{and that he should}} choose the most comfortable of the two. John duly traveled to Hesse-Kassel and became engaged to the 20-year-old Marie Louise within a week. He did not even bother meeting the other candidate. The main factor in this decision was probably that Marie Louise's father was a trusted general under the well-respected Duke of Marlborough. In addition, marriage to a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel would also have served to strengthen John William's place among the other ruling houses.|$|E

500|$|I Should Coco is {{the debut}} studio album by English {{alternative}} rock band Supergrass, released through Parlophone in May 1995. Supergrass were formed in 1993 by Gaz Coombes, Mick Quinn and Danny Goffey and they released their debut single from the album, [...] "Caught by the Fuzz", in May 1995 {{on the small}} independent local label Backbeat Records and was re-released with Parlophone.

500|$|Balzac had {{difficulty}} {{adapting to the}} rote style of learning at the school.

(The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered Honoré, replied: [...] "Remember M. Balzac? I <b>should</b> <b>think</b> I do! I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon {{more than a hundred}} times!") Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.|$|E

500|$|Jones also evinced an {{interest}} in unidentified flying objects, having first encountered unexplained aerial phenomena at Warrnambool, Victoria, in 1930. He reported witnessing another UFO in October 1957, but admitted that he was [...] "loath {{to talk about it}} publicly lest people <b>should</b> <b>think</b> I was either an incompetent witness or getting a little screwy in the head". In the mid-1960s he patronised the Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation and joined the Victorian UFO Research Society. Jones published his autobiography, From Private to Air Marshal, in 1988. He was Australia's last surviving World WarI ace when he died in Melbourne on 24August 1992, at the age of 95.|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, {{and it seems to me}} that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years.

500|$|This {{meant that}} not only would they have a better degree of success than they {{previously}} thought, but {{that there would be}} a larger number of corpses potentially available for selection when the time came. When Montagu discussed the possibility of obtaining a corpse with Bentley Purchase, the coroner for the Northern District of London, he was told there would be practical and legal difficulties: [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>think</b> bodies are the only commodities not in short supply at the moment [...] even with bodies all over the place, each one has to be accounted for." [...] Purchase promised to look out for a body that was technically suitable, with no relatives who would claim the corpse for burial.|$|E
