5000|$|The M30 is {{equipped}} with the Nissan Sonar Suspension II system that was also installed on the Nissan Maxima at the time, which featured a sonar module mounted under the front bumper that scanned the road surface and adjusted the suspension accordingly via actuators mounted on the <b>strut</b> <b>towers.</b> There was also a switch on the center console that allowed the driver to change between [...] "Sport" [...] and [...] "Comfort" [...] settings—essentially [...] "firm" [...] and [...] "soft", respectively.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 {{marked the}} 20th Anniversary for Pontiac's {{flagship}} ponycar, the Trans Am, and Bill Owen at Pontiac Motor Division {{saw to it}} that it was a special one. Pontiac engineers originally wanted to use an all-aluminum V-8 engine in the TTA. That plan never materialized, so the 3.8L Intercooled Buick Turbo V-6 engine from the Buick Grand National was chosen and equip with cylinder heads from the existing 3800 Series I V-6, because of their increased clearance at the <b>strut</b> <b>towers</b> and superior flow.|$|R
5000|$|The Leopard F31 was {{equipped}} with the DUET-SS [...] "Super Sonic Suspension" [...] II system that was also installed on other Nissan vehicles at the time, which featured a sonar module mounted under the front bumper that scanned the road surface and adjusted the suspension accordingly via actuators mounted on the <b>strut</b> <b>towers.</b> There was also a switch on the center console that allowed the driver to change between [...] "Auto", [...] "Soft", [...] "Medium" [...] and [...] "Hard" [...] settings on all models except the XS model, which removed the [...] "Auto" [...] selection.|$|R
25|$|At the 2007 SEMA show in Las Vegas, Ford Custom Accessories {{introduced}} the V6 Appearance Package. Among {{the items were}} a billet grille, scoops, a spoiler and blackout trim treatments. This package includes an upgraded suspension, additional interior trim, and a grille with foglights. Available in 2008 as a $2,398 option, it was promoted with an additional Power Pack FR1 (an 85mm Cold Air Intake sourced from the Bullitt, True Dual exhaust with a X-pipe and Bullitt Mufflers, a Pro-Cal Hand held tuner and a Ford Racing Performance oil filter), handling package FR3 (shocks/struts, front and rear anti-rollbars, V6 lowering springs, and a V6 <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> bar) and a short throw shifter. Available in 2008, the V6 Appearance Package was only available on the V6 Coupe with the Premium Package with either an automatic or manual transmission and only with Grabber Orange, Vapor Silver Metallic, and Dark Candy Apple Red. For 2009 the V6 Appearance Package was offered in Performance White and Black. By 2008, total of 152 V6 Appearance Packages were built and only 96 by 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Bullitt uses {{a version}} of the Mustang GT's {{aluminum}} 4.6L SOHC V8. It has a cold air intake, improved engine calibration, and a revised exhaust system designed to mimic the sound of the Mustang used in the Bullitt movie. Total output is 315hp (235kW) @ 6000rpm and 325lb·ft (440N·m) of torque @ 4250rpm and the engine's redline has been raised to 6500rpm (from the standard Mustang GT's 6250rpm). Premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline is recommended, although an adaptive spark ignition system allows the engine to accept regular grade gasoline. Total output is the same with either fuel, but the engine delivers a flatter torque curve when using premium. The Tremec TR3650 5-speed manual transmission from the Mustang GT is used, but the Bullitt featured a heavier duty rear axle (also used in GT500KR) with 3.73:1 ratio, versus the Mustang GT's 3.31:1 or optional 3:55:1 ratios. The suspension is improved over the standard GT utilizing stiffer springs, struts, and a decorative front <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace while also lowering the car's ride height by six millimeters. Most of the Mustang Bullitt's components are available in the aftermarket for retrofitting earlier S197 Mustang GT vehicles, but some parts used in Bullitt Mustangs are marked to show authenticity.|$|E

2500|$|The entire car is {{essentially}} handmade, {{with the car}} being completely stripped and re-built from the chassis up. Engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key {{areas such as the}} door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the <b>strut</b> <b>towers</b> and transmission tunnel and the engine bay, completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes). The Z-tune is often regarded as the most expensive (prices for some have been known to exceed [...] ) street legal GT-R ever built.|$|R
25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned <b>strut</b> <b>towers</b> to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear drive ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|R

To improve handling, a [...] "sport tuned suspension" [...] and <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace were included.|$|E
2500|$|The Mustang GT {{gained the}} same non-powertrain related {{upgrades}} that standard V6 Mustangs got for 2011. Other, new features exclusive to the 2011 Mustang GT included [...] "5.0" [...] fender badges replacing the [...] "GT" [...] badges used previously, an optional Brembo Brake Package includes 14 inch Brembo front disk brakes {{taken from the}} Shelby GT500, unique 19-inch wheels with Pirelli P-Zero ultra high performance summer only tires, a unique calibration of the Advanced Track stability system including a [...] "sport" [...] mode, and suspension enhancements such as stiffer springs (less aggressive than the BOSS 302 and Shelby models but {{more so than the}} regular GT models) and various other suspension enhancements. Convertible versions of the Mustang GT in particular received a front <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace, stiffened crossmembers, and other enhancements resulting in a 12% increase in structural rigidity compared to 2010 Mustang GT convertibles. All 2011 Mustang GT's with 19inch wheels (brembo brake equipped, California special, etc.) also received the <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace and stiffened cross members.|$|E
5000|$|GT: The GT {{shared the}} ST's engine {{as well as}} the chassis {{designation}} being the ST161 with a 2S-E engine in 1986 quickly changing over to the ST162 with a 3S-FE engine 1987 onwards. The curb weight was 2515 lbs for the coupe and 2546 lbs. for the liftback. A 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission (A140L) was an option, bringing the curb weight up to 2579 and 2610 lbs., respectively. The convertible weighed in at 2700 lbs. for the manual and 2760 lbs. for the automatic. For the interior, the GT came with an electronic 4 speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner, power side mirrors, tilt steering wheel, driver's lumbar support and an automatic retracting radio antenna was standard. Power locks, windows, power tilt/slide sunroof, side mirror defogger, cruise control, electronic air-conditioning, and 13"x5.5" [...] aluminum alloy wheels were optional with 185/70-13 tires. Interestingly enough, a digital instrument panel was available as an option for the non-convertible GT trim only. The GT also includes a front strut bar across the two <b>strut</b> <b>towers</b> as an upgrade over the ST trim, but retains the front ventilated disc and rear drum brake combination from the ST.|$|R
5000|$|Shown as {{a concept}} in November 2003, a sporty XRS model (ZZE131), {{introduced}} in 2004 between the 2005 and 2006 model years only, featured the high-revving [...] at 7600 rpm, 127 lbft Nm at 4400 rpm 2ZZ-GE engine and 6-speed manual from the Toyota Celica GT-S and Lotus Elise. The 2ZZ-GE motor was actually developed with collaboration from Yamaha motors (like other wide-angle head GE, GTE, and GZE Toyota engines), and uses similar technologies found in its sibling motor the 1ZZ-FE. The XRS was very similar to its Corolla S cousin in appearance, however there are significant changes to the mechanical components. The 2ZZ-GE uses a cable throttle (unlike the electronic throttle control of the 2ZZ-GE in the later years of the Celica GT-S) with a lift set-point at 6700 rpm and an 8200 rpm redline. The close ratio C60 6-speed manual transmission, {{also found in the}} Toyota Matrix XRS, was the only transmission available. The sport-tuned suspension lowered the Corolla XRS by 0.5 in. A Yamaha designed brace spans the front <b>strut</b> <b>towers</b> as well as a X-Brace for the rear towers. The steering column is thicker and the power steering system is unique.|$|R
50|$|TRD offers bolt-on headers, sport mufflers, and cat-back {{exhausts}} {{that are}} 50 state emission legal. Cold air intakes are also sold {{but not always}} emission legal. Suspension equipment includes coilovers, springs, dampers and <b>struts,</b> suspension <b>tower</b> braces, sway bars, and wheel upgrades as well. Braking hardware includes full brake kits including calipers, rotors and stainless steel braided brake lines. Separate performance brake pads are also sold. Oil and air filters are offered. Engine head gaskets and camshafts are sold as well. A number of cosmetic modifications are available among other performance equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Ford Racing Performance Group {{provided}} Shelby its FR1 Power Pack to add 25 horsepower to {{the existing}} Mustang GT powertrain with an additional 10ft/lb of torque. The package included a 90mm cold air kit, muffler kit, a new X-pipe and Ford Racing [...] "GTA" [...] axle-back mufflers. The Ford Shelby GT-H also had the Ford Racing Handling Pack (FR3) which included specially tuned dampers, lowering springs, sway bars, <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace, and a Ford Racing 3.55:1 ratio rear axle assembly.|$|E
2500|$|Detail changes {{marked the}} '99 editions of Pontiac's midsize coupe and sedan. New wheel choices {{were the main}} visual change this year. The non-supercharged 3800 Series V6 engine gained five horsepower. This was also the last year that the SE model had the {{optional}} non-supercharged 3800 V6. GT models got a standard rear spoiler this year. The coolant overflow reservoir was relocated from being {{in front of the}} intake box to being mounted to the passenger <b>strut</b> <b>tower.</b> Available [...] alloy wheels came in a new 5-spoke design. The one new option was a Bose 8-speaker audio system.|$|E
2500|$|The Shelby GT500KR {{features}} a {{carbon fiber composite}} hood with functional scoops and vents, twist-lock hood pins modeled on the original 1968 KR, a unique carbon fiber splitter, carbon fiber mirror caps, and functional brake cooling ducts. The suspension was tuned by SVT with unique spring rates, dampers, stabilizer bars, and <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace and was sourced from Ford Racing. Unique Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires were developed for the KR with a unique compound. With the same tread pattern as the Eagle F1 Supercar tire on the 2007–2009 GT500 they can only be identified by a unique Goodyear [...] "Wingedfoot" [...] emblem on the sidewall.|$|E
50|$|Then a great {{sound of}} the trumpet was heard from the castle, {{and the man who}} blew it <b>strutted</b> towards a <b>tower,</b> fully armed, {{flashing}} sunlight in his direction from his shield and brandishing his spear.

5000|$|It {{was built}} from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned {{multi-port}} fuel injection, made 200-210 hp (150-160 kW) at 5200 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. From 1994 to 1997, it used sequential port fuel injection, making [...] at 5200 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow {{as well as}} now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBDII emissions. Output for the 1996-1997 LQ1 is [...] and 220 lbft Nm. It had four large valves per cylinder. The 3.4 L engine used a cogged belt to drive the four overhead camshafts and a chain to drive the intermediate shaft, which is mounted in the same slot where the camshaft would go in {{on any of the}} pushrod engines in the 60-degree family. Adapting a pushrod block for the LQ1's overhead cams was difficult, and the 60° angle made this a very tall engine. The power output for this engine was impressive during its time; however, this engine has never been well liked by auto mechanics, as important maintenance such as spark plug and timing belt changes is very troublesome, especially on later models. Spark plug changes for the three rear cylinders are thought by some to require removing the upper intake manifold when performed as directed by factory service manual, and timing belt changes have a labor rate of 5 hours as opposed to 2-3 for a typical belt-driven engine. In fact, cylinders 1, 3, and 5 spark plugs can be changed by removing the crosswise stabilizer bar from atop <b>strut</b> <b>towers,</b> and using proper socket extensions and a mirror. Timing belt procedure has been posted to You Tube with some labor-saving tips.|$|R
5000|$|The Basantapur Tower ('Basantpur' means [...] "place of Spring") {{is located}} on the south of Nasal Chok. It is a nine-storey tower from the top of which a {{panoramic}} view of the palace and city could be seen. Erotic images are carved on the <b>struts</b> of this <b>tower.</b> This tower is one of the four red towers that King Prithvi Narayan Shah built delimiting the four old cities of the Kathmandu Valley namely, the Kathmandu or the Basantapur Tower, the Kirtipur Tower, the Bhaktapur Tower or Lakshmi Bilas, and the Patan or Lalitpur Tower.|$|R
2500|$|This {{model is}} a limited (1,000 units) version based on the 370Z Coupe Touring, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Datsun 240Z {{arriving}} in North America. It includes manual transmission, the Sport Package (including SynchroRev Match, front chin spoiler, rear spoiler, Nissan Sport Brakes, 19-inch Rays forged aluminium-alloy wheels and viscous limited-slip differential), special [...] "40th Anniversary Graphite" [...] exterior color, red leather interior upholstery, a high-luster smoke wheel finish, red brake calipers, 40th Anniversary badges on the rear hatch and front <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace, red door panel inserts, 40th Anniversary seatback and floormat embroidery, and red stitching on the center stack, shift boot and kneepads.

2500|$|Debuting as a 2008 {{model and}} {{continuing}} for 2009, the Shelby GT500KR ("KR" [...] being an abbreviation for [...] "King of the Road") {{pays homage to}} the original 1968 Shelby Mustang of the same name. Production for '08 was limited to 1011 units (including prototypes), with another 712 KR models built for '09. The KR featured new components and performance enhancements over the standard GT500. The KR's engine was tuned to produce 540hp (403kW) @ 6250 rpm and 510lb·ft (691 N·m) of torque @ 4500 rpm, gains of 40hp and 30lb·ft of torque, respectively over the GT500's. The rear axle has a 3.73:1 ratio. To improve handling and help offset the car's front-heavy weight distribution, the GT500KR featured a Ford Racing <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> brace and uniquely tuned struts, shocks, and springs. Using a carbon fiber hood and a revised exhaust system, the overall weight of the GT500KR was 22lbs lighter than a standard GT500.|$|E
50|$|A strut bar is {{designed}} to reduce this <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> flex by tying the two strut towers together. This transmits the load off each <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> during cornering which ties the two towers together and reduces chassis flex. To accomplish this effectively (especially on MacPherson strut suspensions), the bar must be rigid throughout its length.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Conventionally Transmission Line (TL) towers are steel lattice {{structures}} made from {{hot rolled steel}} angles. The TL towers are designed for various loads e. g. atmospheric generated loads, gravity loads, mechanical loads, etc. The governing load for TL tower design is wind generated loads. The wind is uncertain in nature and may vary {{in time and space}} which can be predicted with certain probability. Further the material properties of hot rolled steel angles may vary depending on various parameters involved in manufacturing process. In this paper, an attempt has been made to consider these uncertainties for the design of TL tower members. The studies are limited to the design of compression strut as per IS: 802 (Part 1 /sec 2) : 1992. First Order Second Moment (FOSM) method is used for calculation of reliability index (β) and failure probability (Pf) of compression <b>strut</b> in Lattice <b>tower.</b> The failure probability calculation methodology is demonstrated for lattice <b>tower</b> compression <b>strut...</b>|$|R
40|$|Structural {{dynamics}} is at {{the center}} of wind turbine tower design - excessive vibrations can be caused by a wide range of environmental and mechanical sources and can lead to reduced component life due to fatigue, noise, and impaired public perception of system integrity. Furthermore, periodic turbulent wind conditions can cause system resonance resulting in significantly increased structural loads. Structural vibration issues may become exacerbated in small wind applications where the analytical and experimental resources for system verification and optimization are scarce. This study combines several structural analysis techniques and packages them into a novel and integrated form that can be readily used by the small wind community/designer to gain insight into tower/rotor dynamic interaction, system modal characteristics, and to optimize the design for reduced tower loads and cost. The finite element method is used to model the tower structure and can accommodate various configurations including fixed monopole towers, guy-wire supported towers, and gin-pole and <b>strut</b> supported <b>towers.</b> The turbine rotor is modeled using the Equivalent Hinge-Offset blade model and coupled to the tower structure through the use of Lagrange’s Equations. Standard IEC Aeroelastic load cases are evaluated and transient solutions developed using the Modal Superposition Method and Runge-Kutta 4 th order numerical integration. Validation is performed through comparisons to theoretical closed form solutions, physical laboratory test results, and peer studies. Finally a case study is performed by using the tool to simulate the Cal Poly Wind Power Research Center Wind Turbine and Tower System. Included in the case study is an optimization for hypothetical guy-wire placement to minimize tower stresses and maximize the tower’s natural frequency...|$|R

50|$|With a MacPherson strut {{suspension}} system where {{the spring and}} shock absorber are combined in the one suspension unit which also replaces the upper control arm, the entire vertical suspension load is transmitted {{to the top of}} the vehicle's <b>strut</b> <b>tower,</b> unlike a double wishbone suspension where the spring and shock absorber may share the load separately. In general terms, a <b>strut</b> <b>tower</b> in a monocoque chassis is a reinforced portion of the inner wheel well and is not necessarily directly connected to the main chassis rails.
