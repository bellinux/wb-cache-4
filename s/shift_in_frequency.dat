To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E
25|$|From the {{perspective}} of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave {{and one of the}} three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves. The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonon, polaron, magnon) or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those quasiparticle types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a Brillouin <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency,</b> is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed quasiparticle. Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types ('quasiparticles'). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E
2500|$|... 2H-Site-specific Natural Isotope Fractionation-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(2H-SNIF-NMR) {{is a type}} of NMR {{specialized}} in measuring the deuterium concentration of organic molecules at natural abundances. The NMR spectra distinguishes hydrogen atoms in different chemical environments (e.g. The order of carbon that hydrogen binds to, adjacent functional groups, and even geminal positions of methylene groups), making it a powerful tool for position-specific isotope analysis. The chemical <b>shift</b> (<b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> units) of 2H is 6.5 times lower than that of 1H. [...] Thus, it is difficult to resolve 2H peaks. To provide high-enough resolution to separate 2H peaks, high strength magnetic field instruments (~11.4T) are applied. Application of NMR to study hydrogen isotopes of natural products was pioneered by G´erard Martin and his co-workers in the 1980s. For several decades it has been developed and expanded. The D/H NMR measurement is sometimes coupled with IR-MS measurement to create a referential standard. The sensitivity of SNIF-NMR is relatively low, typically requiring ~1nbsp&mmol of samples for each measurement. The precision with respect to isotope ratio is also relatively poor compared with mass spectrometry. Even the state-of-art instruments can only measure D/H ratios with around 50~200‰ error depending on the compound. Therefore, so far technique can only distinguish the large D/H variations in preserved materials. In 2007, Philippe Lesot and his colleagues advanced this technique with a 2-Dimensional NMR using chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) instead of isotropic solvents to dissolve organic molecules. This enables the measurements of quadrupolar doublets for each nonequivalent deuterium atom. Thus reduces peak overlaps and provides more detailed information of hydrogen chemical environment.|$|E

All of these bands, excepting that with the highest wave number, <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> with increasing isomorphous substitution. None of them <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> with increas-ing water content. The absorption coefficient for the principal Si-O absorption decreased with increasing isomorphous substitution but increased with increasing water content. Niether isomorphous substitution or water content appeared to have any significant effect on absorption due to O-H stretching or H-O-H bending in the interlayer water. At a critical water content for each montmorillonite, an abrupt change occurred in the absorption coefficient for the principal SilO absorption. This change was ascribed to a sudden rearrangement of the particles...|$|R

50|$|For {{the total}} {{energy of the}} system to remain {{constant}} after the molecule moves to a new rovibronic state, the scattered photon shifts to a different energy, and therefore a different frequency.
