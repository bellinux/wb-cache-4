5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to <b>show</b> <b>just</b> how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, a retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, {{built on}} a Murciélago chassis, was {{announced}} at the Museum of Television & Radio and promoted at the Los Angeles Auto Show, although the car itself was not present at the show. Subsequently, Miura concept was officially debuted at the North American International Auto <b>Show</b> <b>just</b> two weeks later. It was the first design penned by Lamborghini design chief, Walter de'Silva, and commemorated the 40th anniversary of the 1966 introduction of the original Miura in Geneva.|$|E
25|$|A 30 for 30 {{documentary}} on Mike & the Mad Dog, originally planned to air in February 2017, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2017. The show {{was directed by}} Daniel H.

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} {{to the early}} 1990s, KOFY also {{featured}} an in-studio, live kids cartoon show called Cartoon Classics. Hosted by Maestro Dick Bright, the show offered such cartoons as Mighty Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry and Popeye. The show frequently featured local magician Magic Mike (played by Michael Stroud) performing for the studio children. Finally the live-action in-studio segment was scrapped and the <b>show</b> <b>just</b> showed the cartoons straight. Afternoon cartoon shows such as these eventually became {{a thing of the}} past as cable television was able to feature round-the-clock cartoons aimed at younger viewers.|$|E

The tours were largely met with a hostile reaction from fans who knew Dylan as a prominent figure in the American folk music revival, perceiving his move into rock music as a betrayal. Helm left the group after their November 28 performance in Washington, D.C. Session drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Helm for the December dates, and Sandy Konikoff {{was brought in to}} replace Gregg in January 1966.|$|E
25|$|Transliteration is {{the process}} in which a Sumerologist decides how to {{represent}} the cuneiform signs in Roman script. Depending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article Transliterating cuneiform languages.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 'diri' which is written with the signs SI and A. The text transliteration of a tablet will <b>show</b> <b>just</b> the logogram, such as the word 'diri', not the separate component signs.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the <b>show</b> <b>just</b> so they could cut him off.|$|E

500|$|... "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] {{featured}} several notable guest stars, including Matt Czuchry, Ryan Eggold, and San Giacomo, {{who plays}} Harmony Chase, a romantic interest for Keith. Actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, wanted San Giacomo {{to play the}} role of Harmony because of the actors' ongoing friendship since their <b>show</b> <b>Just</b> Shoot Me! Both actors enjoyed the guest appearance so much that they lobbied the show's production team to continue the characters' romantic storyline in the future. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics.|$|E
