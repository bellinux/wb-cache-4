5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve that}} goal, the city created {{the idea of}} {{imposing}} a unified building style – the Spanish Pueblo Revival look, {{which was based on}} work done restoring the Palace of the Governors. The sources for this style came from the many defining features of local architecture: vigas (rough, exposed beams that extrude through <b>supporting</b> <b>walls,</b> and are thus visible outside as well as inside the building) and canales (rain spouts cut into short parapet walls around flat roofs), features borrowed from many old adobe homes and churches built many years before and found in the Pueblos, along with the earth-toned look (reproduced in stucco) of the old adobe exteriors.|$|E
25|$|The Victorian High Gothic period {{also saw}} a {{willingness}} to combine the neo-Gothic with other styles. Two important examples of a mix between Gothic and Romanesque styles are University College in Toronto and the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. Variations on the neo-Gothic style developed in Britain were also imported to Canada. The Scottish baronial style was employed by Chief Dominion Architect David Ewart to create a number of castle like structures in Ottawa. New materials were also incorporated. Cast iron allowed stronger structures with thinner <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> to be built, while some recreated gothic forms in brick, rather than the traditional stone or wood.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to the {{considerable}} {{economies of scale}} Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could {{be left in the}} ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just {{beneath the surface of the}} site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site - indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory - and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.|$|E
500|$|The Kamianets-Podilskyi Industrial Vocational School has {{investigated}} the castle walls. They discovered {{an area of}} quick sand at the roadside next to the [...] "Podzamche", or sub-castle, neighborhood of the city, which {{in the previous year}} had partially undermined the castle's <b>supporting</b> <b>walls.</b> The effects of the quick sand had uncovered the fortress's foundation walls, a little over [...] deep. The foundation walls were built on the limestone that creates a canyon along the river valley. Further excavation work showed that the walls stretched to the west, as well from the Old Castle to the bastions of the new one. The support footings for the old castle bridge were also found in the ditch. From the south in the wall there is a [...] wide and [...] tall opening, through which the Vocational School assumed water flowed.|$|E
500|$|The castle {{was built}} on the {{southern}} end of Portsea Island to protect a deep-water channel running through the Solent to the royal naval base at Portsmouth. Work began in early 1544, under the overall direction of Sir Anthony Knyvett, the Governor of Portsmouth, supported by Richard Cawarden, the Dean of Chichester, and John Chatterton, the captain of the Porstmouth garrison; Thomas Bertie was appointed as the master mason. It is uncertain who designed the castle, although Knyvett described it as being [...] "of his Majesty's own device", which typically indicated that the King had taken a personal role. The design abandoned the earlier use of semi-circular bastions, which could not be fully covered by flanking fire from the <b>supporting</b> <b>walls,</b> and instead used an angular design, forming an early, if imperfect, adoption of the trace italienne-style of fortification already in use in Continental Europe.|$|E

500|$|In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due {{to changes}} in the way domes were constructed, {{including}} advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The so-called [...] "Temple of Minerva Medica", for example, used brick ribs along with step-rings and lightweight pumice aggregate concrete to form a decagonal dome. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. The use of ribs stiffened the structure, allowing domes to be thinner with less massive <b>supporting</b> <b>walls.</b> Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light, although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings. The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome and nothing but paired columns beneath that, using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure.|$|E
500|$|Designers {{had in mind}} a [...] "lantern-like" [...] {{quality for}} the library, [...] "open, light and inviting". THA said {{the goal was to}} create a [...] "feeling of {{openness}} and availability", with a focus on [...] "books and people". Most of the library's collection is housed within a single large room level with the sidewalk outside. The building has an exposed gridded steel roof [...] high, supported by six pairs of slender steel columns and lined with windows. From several column options, Degenkolb chose cantilevered columns designed in a cruciform shape, built from four steel angles measuring [...] The columns taper from the top and provide even distribution of loads, protecting the structure against wind and earthquakes without lateral bracing (or the need for <b>supporting</b> <b>walls).</b> The library features a 32-person capacity meeting room for hosting community events at no charge on a first come, first served basis. The building houses original artwork, including a work by Margot Voorhies-Thompson and, at the entrance, a 15-line poem by Kim Stafford titled [...] "Open This Door of All Doors". The exterior includes 36 stainless steel panels etched with words depicting the history of books.|$|E
500|$|Early wooden domes {{are known}} {{only from a}} {{literary}} source, {{but the use of}} wooden formwork, concrete, and unskilled labor enabled domes of monumental size in the late Republic and early Imperial period, such as the so-called [...] "Temple of Mercury" [...] bath hall at Baiae. Nero introduced the dome into Roman palace architecture in the 1st century and such rooms served as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. The Pantheon's dome, the largest and most famous example, was built of concrete in the 2nd century and may have served as an audience hall for Hadrian. Imperial mausolea, such as the Mausoleum of Diocletian, were domed beginning in the 3rd century. Some smaller domes were built with a technique of using ceramic tubes in place of a wooden centering for concrete, or as a permanent structure embedded in the concrete, but light brick became the preferred building material {{over the course of the}} 4th and 5th centuries. Brick ribs allowed for a thinner structure and facilitated the use of windows in the <b>supporting</b> <b>walls,</b> replacing the need for an oculus as a light source.|$|E

40|$|Analyzes of {{influence}} of the point thermal bridges of buildings with ventilated facade systems on the thermal properties of envelops are presented in the paper. The relation between the separate components of the envelop were made: thermal properties and thickness of <b>supporting</b> <b>wall's</b> layer; value of thermal conductivity and thickness of insulation layer. Studies have shown, {{that the value of}} the point thermal transmittance, which depended on the thermal properties of the envelop and thickness of the layers, might increase to 35 %. The higher thermal conductivity coefficient of the material of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and thickness of the insulation layer, the larger value the point thermal transmittance. And contrary, if the thickness of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and coefficient of thermal conductivity of insulation layer was increased, the value the point thermal transmittance was decreased. It is possible to determine the value of thermal bridges of certain construction design solution by simplified calculations, according to the existing dependencies formulas or graphics. In this case it's necessary to have dependence of the point thermal bridges from thermal insulation properties and dimensions of envelop layers...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the base}} of the dome does not match the plan of the <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> beneath it (for example, a dome's {{circular}} base over a square bay), techniques are employed to bridge the two. The simplest technique is to use diagonal lintels across the corners of the walls to create an octagonal base. Another is to use arches to span the corners, which can support more weight. A variety of these techniques use what are called [...] "squinches". A squinch can be a single arch or a set of multiple projecting nested arches placed diagonally over an internal corner. Squinches can take a variety of other forms, as well, including trumpet arches and niche heads, or half-domes.|$|E
