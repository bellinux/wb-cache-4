5|$|The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. <b>of</b> English. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villain in {{literature}} and cinema poses a problem for traditional critical scholars: how can readers see beyond the villain‟s role as literal antagonist? Differing critical methods approach this problem from their respective systems, but how can a feminist critic see a creature such as <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lamb’s</b> Hannibal Lecter as anything but a misogynistic mass murderer? Intertextual theory seems much more apt to handle a complicated multi-dimensional character such as Hannibal the Cannibal. Traditionally, Intertextualism has dealt primarily with examining texts within a genre with a particular focus on convention: elements of plot, character, and theme are examined {{in light of all}} other works regardless of period or authorial intent. Cinematic Intertextualism operates similarly, only now examining cinematic conventions; however, this approach suffers from a form of myopia as well. What seems lacking is a comprehensive viewpoint that examines literature and film not just within their separate formats, but intertextually between the two. What‟s more, in examining the links between literature and film, and even more all-encompassing viewpoint comes into sharper focus, a viewpoint in which not only are the texts themselves examined through an intertextual lens, but the criticism applied to those texts. This project seeks to examine these comprehensive “Macro-Intertextual” connections between texts – both literary and cinematic – combined with an intertextual view of criticism as well. With this theory in mind, Hannibal Lecter is revealed as much more than cannibalistic madman: through a Macro-Intertextual lens, he and other villains can be seen as social commentary, embodying the societies in which they arise and exposing their society‟s hypocrisies simultaneously. Removed from structuralist theory and classic literary criticism, Macro Intertextualism forms a more all-encompassing viewpoint...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E

5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E

Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak.

5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs.</b> Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
