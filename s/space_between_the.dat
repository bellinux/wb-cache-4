5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Overheating {{caused by}} the lack of <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> video cards forces {{researchers}} using the FASTRA II to keep the side panel door open, so that the video cards can get regular air, decreasing the overall temperature inside the case.|$|E
5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> vocal cords) or {{oral cavity}} (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out {{air from the}} lungs.

3000|$|In general, Fig. 22 {{clearly shows}} a {{correlation}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MIMO channel capacity variation and the TX-RX separation distance, i.e., MIMO channel capacity has a larger variation in near-range LOS conditions {{and a smaller}} capacity variation in far-range NLOS conditions. The possible cause of the larger capacity variations for near-range LOS propagation is greater angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MIMO subchannels. There is greater angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MIMO subchannels for LOS links and less angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MIMO subchannels for far-range NLOS links, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows that as the degree of angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MIMO subchannels becomes smaller, <b>the</b> correlation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> received signals becomes larger, as {{the differences in the}} length of the MIMO subchannel paths decrease. This greater angular spacing causes the different MIMO propagation paths d [...]...|$|R
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> top of the cargo {{and the top of}} the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{each corner}} of the chapel is a {{triangular}} pendentive filling the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> walls and the arch of the vault and forming the spandrel above the windows nearest the corners.

5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{railways}} the railway land in the centre of the town stood empty for many years. Most prominent was a green <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> museum and brook which housed a dis-used pit wheel on a low steel frame, which many passers-by mistook for a spinning wheel. There had long been an aspiration to develop a memorial park or garden on the site to commemorate both the mining history of the town and to provide a new setting for the town's war memorial.|$|E

5|$|The Lassell ring, {{also known}} as the plateau, is the {{broadest}} ring in the Neptunian system.

5|$|The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> large {{fortification}}s {{was covered}} {{by a series of}} smaller redans (chevron-shaped forts) and barkans (trapezoidal forts). The strongest fortification in the outer line of defences was Fort 56 in the suburb of Wola, built around the St Lawrence's Church. It was supported by Lunette 57 in front of it, and two forts (54 and 55) to the south of it. The headquarters was in Fort 73 between Rakowiec and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E
5|$|The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{skin and}} gut {{is filled with}} mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Verses 12.23–31 {{state that}} the lingasharira, which is the subtle body that is not visible, glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead. This shining Shakti (force, energy, power), {{translates}} Bhattacharya, is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision. Atman is perceived when the mind located in the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> eyebrows, becomes free of all distractions and activities. In this state, the yogin becomes aware of self within, and in the sages, in siddhas and others. If dissolution of the mind in the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> eye brows does not occur, the yogin should envision absolute bliss, alternatively the full moon inside the mouth. This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity, helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha (sky), and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation. This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge, {{the goal of the}} practice of yoga.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest}} of the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
