40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} an ergonomically adapted spacer block, used for manual work in a <b>straightening</b> <b>press.</b> This thesis has been performed at Scania Ferruform in Lulea, Sweden, which is an industrial enterprise producing e. g. rear axle bridges used in Scania AB trucks and buses. The report has been performed according to Lulea University of Technology (LTU) guidelines for a thesis work á 15 HP. The results of the thesis presents a multi designed prototype solution of a spacer block which is designed to be highly flexible and solve an ergonomically complex work moment. The solution for example solves heavy lifts by reducing weight and introduces more ergonomically work position and movements. The results should still continue to be verified before going into the live work process, this to reduce risks and pass validations which is not within the scope of this thesis. Three concept solutions have been evaluated after research and identification of the problem. Theoretical studies, work experiences, sketches, available solutions and limitations have been applied to analyze three prototype solutions. Each of the selected prototypes have been designed to a 3 D CAD model and produced to be tested and evaluated in a live working environment with a concept selection matrix. Integrations to find the best applicable solutions have been performed in coherence with design and production personel at Scania Ferruform, but also discussed with supervisors at LTU. Recommendation of future implementations, verifications and alternative solutions is handed over in this thesis, but also with internal communication to secure Scania Ferruforms’s confidentially agreements.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calculate straightening stroke precisely for automatic straightening machines. But, the existing mathematic models for calculating straightening stroke can not solve this problem well. In this paper, the mathematic load-deflection model, which reflects elastic range, elastic-plastic range and elastic spring back of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process, is developed. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. By simplicity, the rectangular section part is selected for study and {{is assumed to be}} the ideal elastic-plastic material. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics theory, through deriving relationships among the load, bending moment, deflection and elastic region length, the theoretical model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process has been established. Finally, two examples are calculated. The results calculated by the model are in good agreement with the results computed by FEM. Experimental data also show that the calculation results by the model is exact and the error is small. So the validity and the accuracy of the model are verified. It will be helpful to the development of automatic straightening machines...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the starter}} sheets were formed, {{they had to}} be flattened, to reduce the {{likelihood}} of short circuits, and then cut, formed and punched to make loops from which the starter sheets are hung from conductive copper hanger bars in the electrolytic cells (see Figure 1). The starter sheets are inserted in the refining cells and dissolved copper deposits on them to produce the cathode copper product (see Figure 2). Because of the manufacturing cost of the starter sheets, refineries using them tend to keep them in the cells as long as possible, usually 12-14 days. On the other hand, the anodes normally reside in the cells for 24-28 days, meaning that there are two cathodes produced from each anode. The starter sheets have a tendency to warp, due to the mechanical stresses they encounter and often need to be removed from the refining cells after about two days to be <b>straightened</b> in <b>presses</b> before being returned to the cells. The tendency to warp leads to frequent short-circuiting.|$|R

Facing the audience, the dancer repeatedly traces a square pattern on the stage with the repetitive lateral movement. On one pass around the perimeter, she rocks an invisible infant in her arms. The ballet ends with the soloist's return to the fence, her back to the audience and face in profile. She plants her leg triumphantly on the upper rail, one arm outstretched, one upraised, in salutation to all she surveys. In a final definitive gesture, she brings her fist down to clasp a knee.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{straightening}} precision of flexible automatic straightening machine, {{a new way of}} establishing straightening model and predicting straightening stroke is proposed based on bending experiment. In this paper, aiming at the LG series linear guide rails, the mathematical load-stroke model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process is established based on elastic-plastic theory. The stroke-deflection model can be obtained by simulating the bending process of guide rails based on loading-unloading FEA analysis. And then the precision straightening model of predicting straightening stroke, which is describe as a simplicity formula, can be fit out based on establishing compensation knowledge base achieved from bending experiment and experimental data processing. The experimental results verify this method's feasibility. It will be helpful to the development of automatic straightening machine's control system...|$|R
40|$|The {{straightening}} technics is one {{of important}} means to improve the straightness of metal bar. A novel way of predicting the straightening stroke is proposed based on mathematical methods and bending experimental and numerical simulation. The experimental and numerical simulation is conducted by following the mathematical load-stroke model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process under the elastic-plastic theory. For the linear guide rails, as an example, the stroke-deflection model focusing on the straightening stroke prediction {{can be achieved by}} contrasting and integrating the bending experimental results and finite element methods (FEM) simulation data. And then the formula for predicting the straightening stroke is presented based on the precise straightening stroke-deflection model. The stroke prediction formula with high precision {{can be applied to the}} straightening stroke prediction in the high straightness metal bar manufacturing process and automatic straightening machine conveniently...|$|R
40|$|Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Komitet Badań NaukowychSo called "XYZ Affair" is not {{properly}} known in Polish historiography. This article {{is an attempt}} to show some controversial problems connected with it. Needless to say that the American-French relationship was nearly broken, especially after the Washington’s Declaration o f Neutrality, 1793. John Adams, as the second president of the USA was faced with the problems with revolutionary France. He was federalist, but he did not share the opinion of them, especially the High Federalists who wanted a war with France. On the contrary, he organized an extraordinary mission to this country to prevent the war. Up till now this mission is still a very controversial one. Firstly, he men who were to go to France (Charles C. Pinckney, Elbridge Gerry and John Marshall) seemed not to be those whom the Directory might accept. In America they were accepted neither by the Congress, nor by both secretaries of state and treasury. President Adams being aware of the negative opinions about such mission ought to presume {{that it would not be}} successful in France. Why then he decided to send those people is still an open question. The other question is connected with the persons known as ”X” ”Y” and ”Z”. The opinion that the Americans did not know them is false. On contrary, they not only knew those men by their names, but they often dined with them and frequently met together. Letters „XYZ” stood then for the really known names. Such a trick was created by Charles C. Pinckney to made the cipher, used in the diplomatic correspondence, not so complicated. Another question if the „XYZ” men were connected with Talleyrand is solved in Marshall’s letters. They unanimously gave us an answer that indeed those people were the men of Talleyrand. The question of a bribe for the Directory was strictly connected with the American relations with the Great Britain. The money given to France were equal with the conflict with Britain. And it was not in the interests of America, especially after Jay’s treaty, 1794. Stanley Elkins’ opinion that the Directory, and especially Talleyrand, were to clever to ask for a bribe is absolutely false, what was proved in this article. On April 3, 1798 president Adams informed Congress about the French demands. This gave the beginning of the affair known as „XYZ” Affair”. The anti-French alitude was very common, <b>straighten</b> by the <b>press.</b> The state of so called „Quasi War” with France forced president Adams to declare Alien and Sedition Acts. Such acts were very unpopular, and in fact, they weakened the Federalist Party. Adams lost his presidential campaign and was defeated by the Republican - Thomas Jefferson. Zadanie pt.
