There is a justified need for further investigation {{in this area of}} paramount importance. This study analyses maritime piracy and robbery related incidents in terms of the major influencing factors such as ship characteristics and geographical locations. An analytical model incorporating Bayesian reasoning is proposed to estimate the likelihood of a ship being hijacked in the Western Indian or Eastern African region. The proposed model takes into account the characteristics of the ship, environment conditions and the maritime security measures in place in an integrated manner. Available data collected from the Global Integrated <b>Shipping</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (GISIS) together with expert judgement is used to develop and demonstrate the proposed model. This model can be used by maritime stakeholders to make cost-effective anti-piracy decisions in their operations under uncertainties. Discussions are given on industrial response to maritime piracy in order to minimize the risk to ships exposed to attacks from pirates. Further recommendations on how maritime security and piracy may be best addressed in terms of maritime security measures are outlined...|$|E

After an evaluation of the incompleteness of these two databases, a novel and tangible method is proposed {{to estimate}} the lower and upper bounds of the number of accidents by using Bayesian analysis under mild assumptions. This method produces the following three important results. First, the annual maritime accident occurrence frequency in the Singapore Strait ranges from 17. 6 to 33. 0; that is, less than 0. 005 % of vessels could be involved in an accident when passing through the Strait. Second, the reporting performances of both maritime accident databases to the Singapore Strait are less than 62. 5 %. In other words, more than 37. 5 % of maritime accidents are not included in the database. Third, ship collisions account for more than 50 % of all types of accidents; this result indicates that a high priority should be assigned to reducing the occurrence of ship collisions by enhancing the navigational systems in the Singapore Strait.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} the cybersecurity issue of <b>ship</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (SIS) from a new perspective which is called opacity. For a SIS, its confidential information (named as “secret”) may be leaked through the working behaviors of each Distributed Control Unit (DCU) from an outside observer called an “intruder” which is able to determine ship's mission state by detecting the source of each data flow from the corresponding DCUs in SIS. Therefore we proposed a dual layer mechanism to enforce opacity by activating non-essential DCU during secret mission. This mechanism is calculated by two types of insertion functions: Safety-assured insertion function (fIS) and Admissibility-assured insertion function (fIA). Due to different objectives, fIS is designed to confuse intruder by constructing a non-secret behaviors from a unsafe one, and the division of fIA is to polish the modified output behaviors back to normal. We define the property of “I 2 –Enforceability” that dual layer insertion functions {{has the ability to}} enforce opacity. By a given mission map of SIS and the marked secret missions, we propose an algorithm to select fIS and compute its matchable fIA and then the DCUs which should be activated to release non-essential data flow in each step is calculable...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{combined}} dataset of 183, 819 port state control (PSC) inspections from various port state control regimes around the world. In theory, there should be no differences in treatments of inspections to determine if a vessel is substandard or not no matter where the inspection was performed. This article uses correspondence analysis in order to investigate whether there are differences and if so, visualizes them for easier interpretation. The results of this analysis confirm that treatment of vessels across port state control regimes differ although some groupings of regimes across the ownership groups can be found. Association can be found between the Paris MoU and the ViÃ±a del Mar Agreement and between the Caribbean MoU and the Indian Ocean MoU while the USCG and AMSA are always apart from the rest. With respect to the distribution of deficiency codes towards regimes, only areas such as structural safety, radio communications or safety and cargo operational areas show similarities while ISM related deficiencies only show strong association with one regime. The differences clearly show that there is room for harmonization across port state control inspections in all inspection areas. Harmonization could be achieved by increasing cooperation amongst the regimes. A good starting point would be the acceleration of the harmonization of inspection procedures, combined training of port state control officers and the use of combined datasets across regimes, in particular in the concept of the development of the Global Integrated <b>Ship</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (GISIS) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} a refined technique {{to measure and}} interpret variables associated {{with the quality of}} an inspection [...] be it port state control or vetting inspections towards the probability of a very serious, serious or less serious casualty. It concentrates on filtering out the effect of variables such as detention, the port state control regime that inspected the vessel, time in-between inspections, deficiencies found during an inspection and the effect of vetting inspections. The consensus amongst policy makers in the shipping industry is that data cannot be combined to target vessels. While this article does demonstrate that the decrease in the probability of casualty is stronger for the South American Region, the Indian Ocean Region and Australia versus North Europe, North America or the Caribbean, it also demonstrates that the data can be combined to target vessels for inspections. Since the time in-between inspections and detention is mostly not significant towards decreasing the probability of casualty, these results reflect the lack of coordination amongst port state control regimes and industry inspections. Due to this lack of coordination and trust, a ship might be inspected in several regimes during a relative short time period where the benefit of an inspection can be easily saturated. Our recommendation on direct policy implication is to promote the harmonization of inspection databases across port state control regimes, preferably with the coordination of the development of the Global Integrated <b>Ship</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (GISIS) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to review the policy of a release of a vessel from detention and to increase cooperation amongst regimes with respect to the follow up of the rectification of deficiencies.

Today's naval ships carry an array of complex electrical and electronic equipment. A typical naval ship has electronics systems to cater to advance weapons systems, a complex drive, shipboard control systems, and equipment such as radar, sonar and communication systems. With the existence of such electrical and electronics equipment, which are vital to the functional ability of the <b>ship,</b> an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is needed to manage the shipboard power system (SPS) data. During different operating conditions of the ship, the electrical topology of the SPS changes. The data representing the connectivity and the system state is needed. This is especially true during critical events such as battle scenarios. During these times, the present procedure of using paper-based maps and information charts {{to keep track of the}} system topology is not efficient. Geographic <b>Information</b> <b>Systems,</b> (GIS) were developed to address the need for managing complex spatial and attribute data. Geographic <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> are different from conventional <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> because they handle spatial and visual data. GIS technology has been used in several different industries including the electric utility industry to manage system facilities. In this thesis the author presents the process by which a GIS was created for a naval shipboard power system (SPS). The system consisted of a 3 -dimensional layout diagram of the power system and a thorough database that stores the network topology and electrical parameters of the SPS. Also presented are standard modules developed for accessing the database data and the processes involved in integrating the GIS with other power system analysis tools such as a fault diagnosis method and a restoration/reconfiguration method. The GIS SPS provides a more efficient method to acquire system topology and system data under different operating conditions of a ship. This increases the overall survivability of the ship and provides the capability to use automated methods such as the fault diagnosis and restoration/reconfiguration methods to reduce the manpower required for the proper operation of a ship...|$|R

Thereby we implement the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” for coherent discovery, view, download and dissemination of aggregated content. MaNIDA receives a unique momentum from the cooperation and financial partnership between main German marine research institutes (AWI, MARUM, HZG, GEOMAR, Uni Hamburg, Uni Kiel, Uni Bremen) and the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency as well as active participation in international and major EU-initiatives (ICSU, GEOSS, SeaDataNet, EMODNET, ODIP). Together with a coherent management strategy coordinated by the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research, sustainability will be achieved via the long-term commitment of framework funding by the Helmholtz Association, Germany’s largest scientific research organization for large-scale facilities and scientific infrastructure. Strategic Aims The installation of the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” will address the urgent demands of the German research community for reliable and easy access to marine research data at one single point of access and truth. Primary focus {{will be given to}} data derived from nationally operated research and monitoring facilities (vessels, observatories, alert systems, etc), whereby related contextual content and publications will {{become an integral part of}} the aggregation effort. For the scientific community we define responsibilities and commitments across partners while complementing existing data repositories and the new portal with well-articulated workflows from the instrument to the data product. Necessary level of quality assurance and user support will be implemented to achieve substantial enhancements in the whole lifecycle management of marine scientific data. The creation of a data curation and customer support centre holds a significant role in that course as well as the intense exchange of ideas/wishes with stakeholders and scientists. Research & Development • In terms of integration, harmonization and aggregation – data from three national large-scale data repositories and national publication e-infrastructures will be aggregated into a central metadata catalogue. • Dynamic procedures for harmonization and integration of content are under development using common vocabulary, terms (ontology) according to international initiatives (SDN, GEOSS, ICSU). • Concerning automation we will improve the standardization of sensor networks (e. g., OGC/SWE standards) and revise and adapt a future version of DSHIP (<b>ship</b> <b>information</b> <b>system),</b> a de-facto standard for research vessels, to repository and portal solutions. • We are developing a series of content-specific discovery, view, download and dissemination services to enable coherent discovery and visualization (search/browse and mapping services) as well as provider based dissemination of content at European and International levels. Finally the “Data Portal of German Marine Research” will enhance data mining in various disciplines as well as improve planning of future expeditions. It will also provide means for combining various data types (e. g. underway data, post cruise data, satellite data, oceanographic and interdisciplinary marine data) into enhanced data products to comply with our data-intensive marine science...|$|R
