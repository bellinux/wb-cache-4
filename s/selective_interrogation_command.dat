40|$|Abstract: A new {{wireless}} sensing network {{paradigm is}} presented for structural monitoring applications. In this approach, both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via a mobile-agent that {{is sent to}} sensor nodes to perform intended interrogations, which can alleviate several limitations of the traditional sensing networks. Furthermore, the mobile-agent provides computation power to make near real-time assessments on the structural conditions. This paper will discuss such prototype systems, which are used to interrogate impedance-based sensors for structural health monitoring applications. Our wireless sensor node is specifically designed to accept various energy sources, including wireless energy transmission, and to be wirelessly triggered on an as-needed basis by the mobile-agent or other sensor nodes. The capabilities of this proposed sensing network paradigm are demonstrated in the laboratory and the field...|$|R

Wedemonstrate in rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes that non-catalytic signaling is associated with rapid internalization of the enzyme and colocalization with vimentin. Trafficking of exogenous hGIIA was monitored with immunofluorescence studies, which revealed that vimentin localization is disrupted by inhibitors of signaling that belong to a rare class of small molecule inhibitors that modulate protein-protein interactions.

40|$|Sensor {{networking}} is {{an important}} first-line component in any structural health monitoring (SHM) application. We present how an interdisciplinary team of structural, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers are tackling a large-scale civil infrastructure SHM application by proposing a new variant on sensor networking. Most sensor arrays are typically interrogated via conventional wired networks, which require centralized processing and powering. Conversely, recent technology advances in embedded architectures and power harvesting have allowed wireless networks to be developed, where each individual sensor is individually powered and communicates with neighboring sensors or substations via hopping protocols. This work will present a hybrid approach to sensor array interrogation, where both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via an autonomous aerial vehicle that is sent (via remote piloting or GPS autopilot programming) to each sensor or node to perform the individual interrogation.

40|$|In {{a quantum}} world, a watched arrow never moves. This is the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE). Repeatedly asking a quantum system "are you still in your initial state?" blocks its {{coherent}} evolution through measurement back-action. Quantum Zeno Dynamics (QZD) leaves {{more freedom to}} the system. Instead of pinning it to a single state, it sets a border in its evolution space. Repeatedly asking the system "did you cross the border?" makes it impenetrable. Since the border can be designed at will by choosing the measured observable, QZD allows one to tailor the system's evolution space. Recent proposals, particularly in the Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) context, highlight the interest of QZD for quantum state engineering tasks, which {{are the key to}} quantumenabled technologies and quantum information processing. We report the observation of QZD in the 51 -dimension Hilbert space of a large angular momentum J = 25. Continuous <b>selective</b> <b>interrogation</b> limits the evolution of this angular momentum to an adjustable multi-dimensional subspace. This confined dynamics leads to the production of non-classical "Schrödinger cat" states, quantum superpositions of angular momentums pointing in different directions. These states are promising for sensitive metrology of electric and magnetic fields. This QZD approach could be generalized to other systems, opening novel perspectives for quantum information processing. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Rising {{resource}} efficiency {{is essential for}} a future green economy. Research and business activities in this field have thus increased dramatically during the past decades. While most environmentally oriented methods suffice to provide deep transparency, few {{have the ability to}} depict optimization potential and/or provide procedural methods of improvement. The general approach of ecological amendments in industries thus often is investment intensive. Numerous companies however do not dispose of appropriate savings. These companies strongly depend on low cost improvements, a field that has yet been neglected in research. In this paper we present a tailored approach for low cost economic and ecologic optimization of manufacturing processes. Therefore, we discuss conflicts and links between characteristic ecological and Lean principles in order to develop a greater Eco Lean mindset. Adopting the Lean philosophy, to do more with less, we introduce a four step approach. Therefore, we expand the traditional understanding of lean waste categories by adding ecologically relevant problem areas. In a first step, the orbit view, economic and ecologic wastage is determined via advanced Gemba walk that consists of visual testing and <b>selective</b> <b>interrogation.</b> We use a plant layout and specific characters to map areas of waste within a production facility. Hereupon, a weighting of problems is executed based on expected effort for implementation and impact on waste reduction.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} {{is presented to}} accurately estimate the resonant features of a multipatch backscatter-based chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. An ultra-wideband impulse radar (UWB-IR) -based reader interrogates the chipless tag with a UWB pulse, and the received backscatter is analyzed in thetimedomain. Thekeycomponents constituting the backscattered signal, the structural mode, and the antenna mode are identified, and their spectral content are analyzed. Analysis shows that the antenna mode backscatter contains the information carrying signal while the structural mode backscatter contains no information about the tag. A semi-analytical model is developed to explain {{the behavior of the}} signal backscattered from the chipless RFID tag. Simulation and semi-analytical results are validated by experimental measurements obtained in an anechoic chamber environment using a 4 -b multipatch chipless RFID tag. The new method does not rely on calibration tags for operation and has a greater degree of freedom in the orientation of tags with respect to a reader. A novel method, <b>selective</b> spectral <b>interrogation</b> (SSI), that uses a set of interrogation pulses to extract information bits stored in the spectral signature of the chipless tag is also introduced.

40|$|The {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} (SSR), that is an evolution of the military identification friend-or-foe systems, is widely used by {{air traffic control service}} providers to localize and identify co-operating aircraft equipped with a standard transponder [1]. The ground SSR installation transmits interrogations, from a rotating, narrow azimuthal beam antenna. The airborne transponders, once they have received an interrogation, transmit at a 1, 090 -MHz carrier a reply signal containing the requested data, i. e., identity (mode A reply) or fight level (mode C reply). Azimuth and range of the aircraft are measured by the interrogator, based on the delay of the reply and on the antenna pointing angle. The current SSR standard is based on the use of <b>selective</b> <b>interrogations</b> and replies and is called mode S: to reduce the interferences, the mode S protocol is based on a message format that includes the unique address of the aircraft. The airborne segment of the SSR is composed of the transponder and a pair of antennas on top and {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. As the aircraft antennas are omnidirectional, many ground stations can receive the replies. This allowed the development of multilateration (MLAT) systems for the aircraft localization based on 1, 090 -MHz signals [2]. A typical MLAT system is composed of a distributed network of 1, 090 -MHz sensors, an interconnecting facility, and a central processor for the fusion of the sensor data. The data fusion relies on the estimation of the signals arrival time at the different stations and on hyperbolic localization. To identify the emitters, the processing is done with mode A replies or mode S replies that contain the emitter identity. A transponder with mode S capability can also transmit a particular downlink format message, called squitter, containing the aircraft's unique address and other information. The squitter signals are not elicited by the SSR interrogation, but they are spontaneously emitted at pseudoperiodical intervals. They are the basis of the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) concept [3]: the ADS-B OUT function periodically transmits information (identity, position, state, etc.) about the aircraft, and the ADS-B IN function receives the messages from nearby traffic. On the airborne side, the ADS-B OUT broadcasts data with onboard equipment using the squitter signals. The airborne ADS-B IN equipment provides to the pilot the traffic scenario, receiving the messages from ground and nearby aircraft ADS-B OUT. Moreover, the ADS-B IN can receive other ground services: the traffic information services-broadcast (TIS-B) and the fight information services-broadcast (FIS-B) [3]. Airport vehicles can be equipped with an ADS-B OUT, a simplified, nonflyable device transmitting 1, 090 -MHz squitter signals containing the identity and the position. As a matter of fact, there are various users of the 1, 090 -MHz channel: 1) SSR transponder replies (modes A, C, S); 2) ADS-B OUT messages; 3) MLAT systems with interrogation capability; and 4) TIS-B.

40|$|Diffuse {{reflectance}} spectroscopy (DRS) is a simple, yet powerful {{technique that}} has the potential to offer practical, non-invasive, and cost effective information for op- tical diagnostics and therapeutics guidance. Any progress towards moving DRS systems from their current laboratory settings to clinical settings, field settings and ambitiously to home settings, is a significant contribution to society in terms of reducing ever growing healthcare expenditures of an aging society. Additionally, im- proving on the existing mathematical models used to analyze DRS signals; in terms of speed, robustness, accuracy, and capability in accounting for larger feature space dimensionality (i. e. extraction of more tissue-relevant information) is equally im- portant for real-time diagnosis in the desired settings and to enable use of DRS in as many biomedical applications (e. g. skin cancer diagnosis, diabetics care, tissue oxygenation monitoring) as possible. Improving the reflectance signal complexity and density through novel DRS instrumentation, would facilitate development of the desired models or put the existing ones built on simulations in practical use; which otherwise could not go beyond being a theoretical demonstration. DRS studies tissue morphology and composition through quantification of one or more (ideally all of them) of the tissue- and wavelength-specific optical properties: absorption coefficient (μa), reduced scattering coefficient (μ 1 s), scattering anisotropy (g), tissue thickness, and scattering phase function details (e. g. higher order moments of the scattering phase function). DRS involves sampling of diffusely reflected photons which experience multiple scattering and absorption as they travel within the tissue, at the tissue surface. Spatially resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (SRDRS) is a subset of general DRS technique, which involves sampling of diffuse reflectance signals at multiple distances to an illumination source. SRDRS provides additional spatial information about the photon path; yielding depth-resolved tissue information critical to layered tissue analysis and early cancer diagnostics. Exist- ing SRDRS systems use fiber optic probes, which are limited in accommodation of large number and high-density collection fibers (i. e. yielding more and dense spa- tially resolved diffuse reflectance (SRDR) measurement data) due to difficulty of fiber multiplexing. The circular shape of the fibers restricts the implementable probe ge- ometries and reduces the fill factor for a given source to detector (i. e. collection fiber) separation (SDS); resulting in reduced light collection efficiency. The finite fiber nu- merical aperture (NA) reduces the light collection efficiency well as; and prevents <b>selective</b> <b>interrogation</b> of superficial tissues where most cancers emerge. Addition- ally, SRDR systems using fiber optic probes for photon collection, require one or more photodetectors (i. e. a cooled CCD); which are often expensive components of the systems. This thesis deals with development of an innovative silicon SRDRS probe, which partially addresses the challenge of realizing high measurement density, miniaturized, and inexpensive SRDRS systems. The probe is fabricated by conventional, flexible and inexpensive silicon fabrication technology, which demonstrates the feasibility of developing SRDRS probes in any desired geometry and complexity. Although this approach is simple and straightforward, it has been overlooked by the DRS community due to availability of the conventional fiber optic probe technology. This new probe accommodates large number and high density of detectors; and it {{is in the form of}} a concentric semi-annular photodiode (PD) array (CMPA) with a central illumination aperture. This is the first multiple source-detector spacing Si SRDRS probe reported to date, and the most densely packed SRDRS probe reported to date for all types of SRDRS systems. The closely spaced and densely packed detectors enable higher density SRDR measurements compared to fiber-based SRDR probes, and the higher PD NA compared to that of fibers results in a higher SNR increasing light collection efficiency. The higher NA of the PDs and the presence of PDs positioned at very short distances from the illumination aperture center enable superficial tissue analysis as well as depth analysis.

40|$|This {{collaborative}} study {{grew out of}} the lived, learned experience of the primary inquirer and co-inquirer, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. Embracing a phenomenological (Heidegger, 1927 / 1962) participatory action attitude (Reason & Bradbury, 2001) using research as a tool to offer a practical alternative, the study aimed to generate knowledge to empower persons with a schizophrenia diagnosis by raising conscious awareness of what either helps or hinders personal recovery. A total of eight credible exemplars with experiences synonymous with a schizophrenia diagnosis participated in open dialogical interviews. An a priori open coding framework derived from my <b>selective,</b> guided <b>interrogation</b> of the personal recovery oriented literature was applied to and iteratively integrated with the inductively driven data which emerged from the interviews. Nine organising themes emerged which converged around three interdependent global themes: Context, Meaning Making and Identity Formation, Interpersonal Relationships and Organisational Culture – Systems. Figural to this intersubjective, contested and co-created multiversal space is a different sort of therapeutic relationship built on pragmatism, authenticity and a tolerant understanding and willingness to embrace and make meaning of disconcerting subjective experiences. The study generates knowledge to challenge and de-construct the essentially contested construct of schizophrenia along with the myths, misconceptions and negative stereotypes which maintain “it”, by raising conscious awareness of and redressing the inherent power imbalance in staff-client relationships and by privileging and validating the voices of the people who own the experience. These hitherto largely unheard voices support the call for an empowering “paradigm shift in relation to the experience that these [schizophrenia] diagnoses refer to” (BPS, 2014).

A different level {{of information about the}} location of other air traffic was presented to each of three groups of flight crews during their execution of eight simulated air carrier flights. A fourth group of pilots flew the same segments without TCAS 2 equipment. Traffic conflicts were generated at intervals during the flights; many of the conflict aircraft were visible to the flight crews. The TCAS equipment successfully ameliorated the seriousness of all conflicts; three of four non-TCAS crews had hazardous encounters. Response times to TCAS maneuver commands did not differ {{as a function of the}} amount of information provided, nor did response accuracy. Differences in flight experience did not appear to contribute to the small performance differences observed. Pilots used the displays of conflicting traffic to maneuver to avoid unseen traffic before maneuver advisories were issued by the TCAS equipment.
