5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of the <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of the <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% {{of the population of}} Galicia, they only held 15% of the <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia existed only on paper.|$|E

The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E

Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the House while losing <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament.

When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties.
