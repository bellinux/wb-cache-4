2500|$|In a review, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku hailed Sword Art Online as {{the smartest}} series in recent years; Eisenbeis {{particularly}} noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing [...] "definition to exactly {{what love is}} like in a virtual world." [...] However, {{in the second half}} of the novels, criticism was levied at the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress trope, stating that a strong female lead was [...] "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." [...] Eisenbeis further complained that [...] "in the first arc of Sword Art Online, Asuna was a strong fighter and one of the leaders who thousands depended on to get them through the death game alive. In the second arc, she was powerless, locked in a literal bird cage and molested by her captor while waiting for her hero to rescue her. In Gun Gale Online, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> more than a spectator cheering on her man. And even in Calibre, she was just another member of the ensemble cast." ...|$|E

Mauretania had her last public inspection on 8 July, a Sunday with 20,000 in attendance, with the monies raised going to local charities. Scrapping began shortly after and with great rapidity. Unusually, she was cut up afloat in drydock, with a complex system of wooden battens and pencil marks to monitor her balance. In a month her funnels were gone.

Yukina has long brown hair, brown eyes, and wears glasses(She is terrified when she is seen without them, based on a traumatic event that happened when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little).</b> At some point, she was unsure of her feelings towards Shigure and Akira, so she decided to go out with both of them to finally pick the one who makes her heart race the most. Although she had stronger feelings towards Shigure than to her cousin, Yukina chose Akira. When she realized her true feelings, she broke up with Akira and later on, confessed them to Shigure when he came back from his studies.|$|E
