60|$|He {{was a large}} {{powerful}} man, of that rugged {{build and}} hairy aspect that might have suggested {{the idea that he}} would be difficult to kill. He was a fair man, with red hair and a deeply sun-burned face, on which jovial good-humour sat almost perpetually enthroned. At the moment when we introduce him to the reader, however, that expression happened to be modified in consequence of his having laid him down to sleep in a sprawling manner on his back--the place as well as the position being, apparently, one of studied discomfort. His legs lay over the heel of the bowsprit; his big body reposed on a confused heap of blocks and cordage, and his neck rested on the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor,</b> so that his head hung down over it, presenting the face to view, with the large mouth wide open, in an upside down position. The man was evidently on the verge of choking, but, being a strong man, and a rugged man, and a healthy man, he did not care. He seemed to prefer choking to the trouble of rousing himself and improving his position.|$|E
6000|$|Glynn Proctor was {{a notable}} {{exception}} to the prevailing rule of indifference to small things. By nature he was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superior stamp <b>of</b> mind to his comrades; besides, he had been better educated; and more than all, he {{was at that time}} under the influence of Ailie Dunning. She admired what she admired; he liked what she liked; he looked with interest at the things which she examined. Had Ailie sat down beside the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old <b>anchor</b> and looked attentively at it, Glynn would have sat down and stared at it too, in the firm belief that there was something there worth looking at! Glynn laughed aloud sometimes at himself, to think how deeply interested he had become in the child, for up to that time he had rather avoided than courted the society of children; and he used to say to Ailie that the sailors would begin to call her his little sweetheart, if he spent so much of his time with her; to which Ailie would reply by asking what a sweetheart was; whereat Glynn would laugh immoderately; whereupon Ailie would tell him not to be stupid, but to come and play with her! ...|$|R
