5|$|What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

500|$|Yancey {{researched}} {{the subject of}} grace, asking non-Christians what they associated with Evangelical Christianity. None of their responses mentioned grace; most cited political stances, such as opposition to LGBT rights and abortion. The author initially intended to call his book What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace: and Why Don't Christians Show More of It? Zondervan, its eventual publisher, objected to the title's forcefulness, despite Yancey's argument that he wrote the book about how [...] "we Christians are simply not known by the greatest gift we have". On February 3, 1997, Christianity Today published an essay by Yancey, the magazine's editor-at-large, with the title [...] "A State of Ungrace", {{saying that it was}} the basis of two chapters of Yancey's upcoming book with the working title of What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace and Why the World Needs More of It.

500|$|In 2006, What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? placed 17th on Christianity Todays list {{of fifty}} books that had most shaped Evangelicals.

Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? because many of his Christian students were more concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted. Detweiler writes that Christianity was founded on forgiveness and that Christians should not bear the burden of guilt, and he therefore agrees with Yancey that [...] "grace" [...] is [...] "our last best word".|$|E

These include a modern retelling of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, an account of Yancey's friendship with Mel White who came out as homosexual, a comparison of the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo, and a summary of Karen Blixen's short story [...] "Babette's Feast".|$|E

500|$|Christians of many {{denominations}} treat What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? as a handbook. In it, Yancey {{coined the}} phrase [...] "scandal of grace", {{referring to the}} idea that God may choose to forgive people who have done evil deeds, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle who was persecuting Christians. The phrase [...] "scandal of grace" [...] has become widely used in Christian circles. In 2005, the Barna Group, a California-based research firm, asked senior pastors across the United States which books they had found helpful during the past three years. What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? was one of nine books mentioned by at least two percent of the respondents; the other eight included Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Church and The Purpose Driven Life and John C. Maxwell's The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.|$|E
500|$|Yancey was {{inspired}} to write What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? after President Bill Clinton asked him, [...] "Why do Christians hate so much?" [...] Although Yancey initially intended to call the book What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace: and Why Don't Christians Show More of It?, Zondervan, its publisher, objected to this title despite the author's contention that he wrote the book to communicate the belief that grace {{is one of the}} best quality Christians, like himself, have to offer but are not necessarily identified with it. The book was successful at secular and Christian stores, selling more than 15million copies by 2006 and becoming Yancey's best-known book. In it, Yancey coined the phrase [...] "scandal of grace", referring to the idea that God forgives some of the worst people, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle.|$|E

500|$|For Booklist, Ray Olson called What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? a [...] "well-written and {{engaging}} book [...] {{will continue to}} nourish readers' hunger for spiritual sustenance long after it has answered the appetites of an initial burst of consumers". He compared the book to Max Lucado's The Great House of God, also published in 1997, writing that, although Yancey and Lucado have both written several bestselling Christian books, Yancey's book was edited better. Olson praised as pithy the author's summaries of [...] "Babette's Feast" [...] and Love in the Time of Cholera. In the Calgary Herald, David Briggs compares What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? to Johann Christoph Arnold's Seventy Times Seven: The Power of Forgiveness, also published in 1997; according to both books, Christians should be more charitable to others and less judgmental of them. Henry Carrigan writes in his Publishers Weekly review that [...] "the book's anecdotal style is often frustrating, but Yancey's measured prose and his insights into the stories make the book worth reading". In her 1998 Winnipeg Free Press review, Karen Toole-Mitchell criticizes Yancey's contention that everyone needs grace and that Christians have a special ability to offer it. She calls Yancey's grace [...] "cheap... {{because it was not}} needed, it was not felt, and ultimately it was not received".|$|E
500|$|In a 1998 Presbyterian Record review, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway {{writes that}} What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? made him [...] "thankful afresh for God's grace and {{challenged}} {{to live a}} life reflecting it". Callaway was haunted by Yancey's question, [...] "If grace is <b>so</b> <b>amazing,</b> why don't Christians show more of it?" [...] and expressed his appreciation to the author at the 1998 Christian Booksellers Association convention. When he asked Yancey why he wrote the book, the author answered: [...] "I long for the church to become a culture of grace... A graceful church knows how to welcome failure and rewards vulnerability so that a person automatically thinks of the church when needing help." [...] Yancey asked Callaway if he thought the book would generate controversy, and Callaway said it would. Callaway asked Yancey why his book was so harsh in its description of Christians, and Yancey responded, [...] "I'm picking on Christians because I am one". Yancey said that he knew many gracious Christians and that secular culture was filled with examples of ungrace, including media manipulation of body image and the belief that [...] "there ain't {{no such thing as a}} free lunch", which contradicts the concept of undeserved grace from God as taught in Christianity.|$|E
500|$|A 1999 Christian Science Monitor review said that, {{filled with}} [...] "poignant stories" [...] that are [...] "likely to ruffle some feathers, this {{compelling}} book challenges Christians {{to become a}} genuine healing force in society". Presbyterian pastor John Buchanan, {{editor and publisher of}} The Christian Century, also reviewed What's <b>So</b> <b>Amazing</b> About Grace? that year, writing that [...] "Yancey is such a good writer and such a generous evangelical that even though I occasionally disagree with his conclusions, I'm glad {{to be in the same}} family with him".|$|E
