5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers {{felt that it was}} dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of Woman, for example, did not include her in the collection of Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> companionate marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
25|$|Doukas was loosely {{related to}} the {{imperial}} family by having as his mistress Eudokia Angelina, daughter of Alexios III and Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. He took the throne for himself as Alexios V. The crusaders and Venetians, incensed at the murder of their supposed patron, prepared to assault the Byzantine capital. They decided that 12 electors (six Venetians and six crusaders) <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> a Latin emperor.|$|E

25|$|Some consequentialists—most notably Peter Railton—have {{attempted}} {{to develop a}} form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by Williams. Railton argues that Williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are {{to be determined by}} the sort of life that they express. On his account, the agent <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.|$|E
25|$|When Poirot {{finishes}} his explanation, everyone is silent. Poirot suggests Bianchi <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> which explanation they {{present to the}} police: the simple or the complex one. Bianchi decides that the simple solution {{will be more than}} enough to satisfy the police and that Ratchett deserved everything he got. Poirot agrees with the decision, and he departs to prepare his report to the Yugoslavian police, even though he admits he will struggle with his conscience. The train becomes free of the snow and leaves as the passengers celebrate at the outcome of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Ideological {{disputes}} {{were also}} widespread. Israel had been initially recognized {{by both the}} United States and the Soviet Union. For {{the first three years}} of its existence, Israel was in the Non-Aligned Movement, but David Ben-Gurion gradually began to take sides with the West. The question of which side of the Cold War Israel <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even had Marxist members leave. The disillusionment particularly set in after the Slánský trial in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried.|$|E

25|$|Nilsen's {{scholastic}} record was above average, though not exemplary. Although he displayed {{a flair for}} both history and art, {{he was known to}} shun sports of any kind. He finished his schooling in 1961 and briefly worked in a canning factory as he considered which career path he <b>should</b> <b>choose.</b> After three weeks at the factory, Nilsen informed his mother that he intended to join the army, where he intended to train as a chef. Nilsen passed the entrance examinations and received official notification he was to enlist for nine years' service in September 1961, commencing his training at St. Omer Barracks in Aldershot.|$|E
25|$|According to Ikuhiko Hata and Fumio Takahashi, whom Hata {{depended}} on for his research, after the battalion commanders agreed to surrender, the other soldiers in Takenaga's unit were assembled {{to see whether}} they would agree with the plan. Takahashi and Hata say that according to one of the surviving company commanders, after being told that the surrender was an order from Takenaga, those in favour were asked to raise their hands. Then, when around half of the soldiers did not raise their hands, they were issued hand grenades and told that they <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> their own fate (a Japanese euphemism for suicide). After this, all of the soldiers agreed to the surrender plan.|$|E
25|$|The ansar (helpers of Muhammad and the muhajirun) held {{a meeting}} to discuss {{choosing}} a new leader of their part of the community. When news of the meeting spread, Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah rushed to the scene. Abu Bakr argued that if the ansar chose a leader of themselves only, the Muslim community would split; the new leader must come from the Quraysh (Muhammad's tribe), and Sa'd ibn Ubadah agreed. Abu Bakr suggested that the people <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> Umar or Abu Ubayda, since both were capable. Umar took Abu Bakr's hand and declared his allegiance (bay'ah, an Arabian custom), followed {{by the rest of}} the gathering. However, this decision would not have been binding on the rest of the Muslims unless they gave their bay'ah (which all did, except Ali's supporters).|$|E

25|$|Criticisms of {{this new}} format, {{as well as the}} boring hockey, was what made the NHL revert the format of the All-Star Game to its {{original}} incarnation. Some of the criticisms included the fact that teammates often opposed each other in the All-Star Game under the new format, and some stated that the early date of the game was detrimental to the exposure of the NHL in the States, being held {{at the same time as}} the World Series and the National Football League (NFL) season. In what would be later a reality, Toronto Star columnist Red Burnett suggested that the game should be played mid-season and that fans <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> their starting lineup, a system which had long been in use in the States with regard to Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E
25|$|The events {{behind their}} betrothal began after John William was almost killed by cannon fire and roundshot on two {{different}} occasions. His mother, Henriette Amalia, perhaps realizing how vulnerable her son was, quickly began looking for a suitable bride to ensure an heir. In the end, the choice came down to two German princesses. She apparently informed him that he should think of the choice as between two chairs, and that he <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> the most comfortable of the two. John duly traveled to Hesse-Kassel and became engaged to the 20-year-old Marie Louise within a week. He did not even bother meeting the other candidate. The main factor in this decision was probably that Marie Louise's father was a trusted general under the well-respected Duke of Marlborough. In addition, marriage to a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel would also have served to strengthen John William's place among the other ruling houses.|$|E
25|$|Martí as a liberator {{believed}} that the Latin American countries needed to know the reality of their own history. Martí also saw {{the necessity of a}} country having its own literature. These reflections started in Mexico from 1875 and are connected to the Mexican Reform, where prominent people like Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and Guillermo Prieto had situated themselves in front of a cultural renovation in Mexico, taking on the same approach as Esteban Echeverría thirty years before in Argentina. In the second “Boletin” that Martí published in the Revista Universal (May 11, 1875) one can already see Martí’s approach, which was fundamentally Latin American. His wish to build a national or Latin American identity was nothing new or unusual in those days; however, no Latin-American intellectual of that time had approached as clearly as Martí the task of building a national identity. He insisted on the necessity of building institutions and laws that matched the natural elements of each country, and recalled the failure of the applications of French and American civil codes in the new Latin American republics. Martí {{believed that}} “el hombre del sur”, the man of the South, <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> an appropriate development strategy matching his character, the peculiarity of his culture and history, and the nature that determined his being.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, in the English tradition, {{judges were}} seen as being agents of the King and his court, who {{represented}} him throughout his realm. Madison believed that in the American states, this direct link between state executives and judges {{was a source of}} corruption through patronage, and thought the link had to be severed between the two, thus creating the [...] "third branch" [...] of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point. Madison, however, did not believe that the judiciary should be truly independent, but rather beholden to the legislature rather than the executive. At the Convention, some sided with Madison that the legislature <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> judges, while others believed the president <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> judges. A compromise was eventually reached that the president <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> judges and the Senate confirm them.|$|E

500|$|Bell {{attempted}} to portray {{himself as the}} heir apparent to Schmoke. However, disclosures from a lawsuit revealed Bell's financial troubles, which included having his car repossessed. Bell lost support after he stated that voters <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> him because [...] "I look like you." [...] Stokes began to lose support after {{he was charged with}} lying about having a college degree, when it was discovered that he did not graduate from Loyola University Maryland, as his campaign literature stated. It was also revealed that Stokes settled an income tax lien. [...] Bell's supporters rallied outside the offices of The Baltimore Sun, challenging that they were writing negative stories about African American candidates, and giving better treatment to O'Malley during the campaign. Stokes was able to recover support when he received endorsements from The Baltimore Sun, the Baltimore Afro-American, and the ministerial alliance.|$|E
500|$|Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Shining with Kubrick, {{notes that he}} [...] "always {{said that it was}} better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it.

According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly [...] "wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance". Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to [...] "enigmas and allegories" [...] and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.|$|E
500|$|Button {{was delighted}} with his then career best finish of fourth {{position}} and praised his {{team for the}} timing to the switch to wet-weather tyres.

Additionally he revealed that {{towards the end of the}} race, he did not have oil in his engine with temperatures continuously rising. de la Rosa scored points for the second time in the season, having taken fifth at the European Grand Prix. de la Rosa thought that the Grand Prix was [...] "strange" [...] though he was happy with the effort of his team. Michael Schumacher, who retired on the first lap, after Fisichella collided with him, accused the latter of causing the incident. [...] "I am out of the race not because of David (Coulthard) but because of Fisichella." [...] he said. Fisichella however said that he was maintaining his racing line and believed that drivers <b>should</b> <b>choose</b> their preferred racing line before he described his Grand Prix as a [...] "waste". Schumacher's manager Willi Weber rejected reports that the accident was part of a conspiracy.|$|E
