5|$|Thirty-seven {{people were}} killed during the storm and its aftermath. Most of them were killed in motor vehicle accidents, {{including}} one in Ontario, three in Nebraska, two in New York, two in Illinois, two in New Jersey, two in Indiana, two in Delaware, one in New Brunswick, five in Quebec, one in Louisiana, one in New Hampshire, six in Vermont, one in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania, one in Virginia, and six in Ohio. In addition to traffic accidents, fatalities were reported due to tornadoes, heart attacks while <b>shoveling,</b> roof collapses due to heavy snow, falling tree branches and carbon monoxide poisoning. In Quebec City, a 16-year-old boy disappeared during the snowstorm and was found dead three days later in a snow bank.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while <b>shoveling,</b> snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
5|$|Utility {{providers}} are regulated monopolies: Xcel Energy supplies electricity, CenterPoint Energy supplies gas, CenturyLink provides landline telephone service, and Comcast provides cable service. In 2007 citywide wireless internet coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30. The Minneapolis Wi-Fi network earns $1.2 million annual profit {{and as of}} 2010 has about 20,000 customers. The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow <b>shoveling</b> throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at <b>shoveling</b> in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in <b>shoveling</b> or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E
25|$|Mediæval European miners {{believed}} in underground spirits. The kobold filled this role in German folklore and {{is similar to}} other creatures of the type, such as the English bluecap, Cornish knocker and the Welsh coblynau. Stories of subterranean kobolds were common in Germany by the 16th century. Superstitious miners believed the creatures to be expert miners and metalworkers who could be heard constantly drilling, hammering, and <b>shoveling.</b> Some stories claim that the kobolds live in the rock, just as human beings live in the air.|$|E
25|$|One person died in Magnolia, Delaware, after {{suffering}} a heart attack while <b>shoveling.</b> A power outage at the Delaware City Refinery, thought {{to be related to}} the storm, forced the facility to shut down after chemicals were released. A mother and her 1-year-old son died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Passaic, New Jersey, after snowfall blocked their vehicle's tailpipe; a 3-year-old girl was hospitalized, but later died on January27. Three other people died while attempting to walk home during the blizzard: one each in East Greenwich, Hackensack, and Mahwah.|$|E
25|$|John and Prudence Spargo {{arrived at}} the port of New York in February 1901. The promised lecture series proved to be vastly exaggerated and Spargo wound up {{standing}} in bread lines to get food and <b>shoveling</b> snow from the sidewalks of the city for $7.50 a week. Eventually a few socialist lectures did come and Spargo made the acquaintance of many leading radicals in the city, including Christian Socialist George D. Herron, Job Harriman, and Algernon Lee. Spargo cast his lot with the dissident (and newly independent wing of the Socialist Labor Party headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit), teaching at a SLP education center in Brooklyn, and working as an assistant to the lawyer Hillquit.|$|E
25|$|Since {{food and}} {{supplies}} were {{in short supply}} in the area {{by the end of}} the storm, on February 1, the travel ban was lifted from 7:00 am until noon so 1,900 stranded travelers could leave the area. Agricultural interests were adversely affected by the storm, with the dairy industry hardest hit due to farmers’ inability to get milk to market. In Jefferson County alone, about 85% of dairy farmers were forced to dump milk because tank trucks could not reach farms. This contributed to $8million in agricultural losses. Other problems included barns collapsing from the snow (seven in Jefferson County), feed and grain shortages, disposal of manure, and farmers being unable to reach barns to feed cattle. Five deaths were reported in northern New York as a result of the storm, all due to heart attacks (four occurring while <b>shoveling</b> snow and another in his car).|$|E
25|$|There were 23 total storm-related {{deaths in}} western New York, with 11 in the City of Buffalo, plus seven {{more in the}} rest of Erie County, three in Wyoming County, and one each in both Niagara and Orleans counties. At least nine were found buried in cars, while others {{involved}} heart attacks while <b>shoveling</b> snow, and car accidents. The above-stated death tolls are listed in the USACE report on cleanup efforts in the storm, while a slightly different death toll is listed by the NWS on their Blizzard of 1977 webpage, which indicates 29 deaths resulted from the storm. The Buffalo Area Chamber of Commerce estimated a total economic loss for Erie and Niagara counties combined of US$221,490,000 for the 5.5-day period starting on January 28, with 175,000people losing wages of US$36,250,000. An estimated $20million or more was spent removing snow, with USACE alone spending over $6million on contractors in western New York. Total damage reached $300million. For 11 days, national media showed images of a city covered in snow up to roofs of houses.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels {{were ordered}} {{and shipped to}} Europe {{for use by the}} 1st Canadian Division. Preliminary tests, however, {{revealed}} that the shovel’s blade was incapable of stopping even small caliber bullets. Its value as a digging tool was also questioned as soldiers commented against the shovel’s weight, its inability to be easily carried, {{and the fact that the}} blade was poor for <b>shoveling</b> loose soil as it contained a large sight-hole. With such a reputation, several high-ranking Canadian and British military officials refused to press the instrument into service. With these developments, an executive order was eventually issued for the shovels to be reduced to scrap. A total sum of $1,400 was recovered in the salvage; a figure far less than the original contract price, which tagged each MacAdam shield-shovel at $1.35. Despite being condemned by the military, a small following of Canadian snipers continued to use the shovel. Aware of the tool’s limitations, they preferred to use them in a collective series for added protection.|$|E
25|$|General {{interest}} magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, {{short stories}} and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One {{of them was the}} historically significant Collier's (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor William Chenery in 1925. Martin drew many of its covers during the Roaring Twenties, including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923–27). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following: catching a baseball, loading up on desserts (pictured below), playing the flute, wearing a straw hat, shooting marbles, <b>shoveling</b> snow, carrying schoolbooks on head, riding a sled, winding up a toy, eating turkey at Christmas, bobbing for apples, playing football (pictured), happily swimming, getting a shaved haircut, saying grace, working as a messenger, daydreaming at school about fishing and going down a water slide. He seldom veered from this subject matter.|$|E
500|$|Higginbotham {{attended}} Lincoln School, {{a segregated}} {{high school in}} Trenton. [...] Prior to Higginbotham, no black student had {{been put on the}} academic track (which was a significant step towards attending college), because Latin, a requirement for the program, was not taught at the black elementary schools. Higginbotham's mother convinced the principal at the junior high school to enroll him in a second-year Latin course, even though he had never studied first year Latin. To ensure {{that he was able to}} pass the required classes, the junior high Latin teacher offered to tutor him at her home during the summer. Higginbotham's family was of modest economic means, so he worked while attending school, mowing lawns, <b>shoveling</b> snow, and working as a bus boy at the Stacy Trent hotel. While in high school, Higginbotham manipulated his birth certificate in order to get working papers at 15, a year before the law allowed, so that he could work in a pottery factory <b>shoveling</b> clay.|$|E

[...] Since the bridge is over an expressway-like trench of Columbus Drive, <b>shoveling</b> the snow onto passing cars {{is not an option}} and the Brazilian hardwood would be damaged by rock salt. The city not only mandates that the bridge be swept and washed daily, but also that the parapets be wiped free of fingerprints.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours <b>shoveling</b> snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why.

500|$|The May 18, 1980, {{event was}} the most deadly and {{economically}} destructive volcanic eruption {{in the history of}} the United States. Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, [...] of railways and [...] of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from <b>shoveling</b> ash. U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape. A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than [...] of material. A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older rock.

500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually <b>shoveling</b> meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E

2500|$|After the Middle Ages, {{the name}} scapula for {{shoulder}} blade became dominant. The word scapula can etymologically {{be explained by}} its relatedness to ancient Greek verb σκάπτειν, to dig. This relatedness give rise to several possible explanations. First, the noun σκάπετος, trench [...] derived from this verb, and the to scapula related noun σκαφη, similarly derived from the aforementioned verb, might connect scapula {{to the notion of}} (con)cavity. The name scapula might be related that due to existence of the spine of the scapula a concavity exist in the scapula. Otherwise, the designation scapulae is also seen as synonym of ancient Greek συνωμία, the space between the shoulder blades, that is obviously concave. Συνωμία consists of σύν, together with, and ὦμος, shoulder. Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to σκάπτειν might originally meant shovel. Similarly to the resemblance between the Latin pala (spade) and the shoulder blade, a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the shoulder blade. Alternatively, the shoulder blade might be used originally for digging and <b>shoveling.</b>|$|E
