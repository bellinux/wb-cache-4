500|$|William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll {{helped to}} popularise less formal gardens in their many books and {{magazine}} articles. Robinson's The Wild Garden, published in 1870, {{contained in the}} first edition an essay on [...] "The Garden of British Wild Flowers", which was eliminated from later editions. In his The English Flower Garden, illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset, Kent and Surrey, he remarked, [...] "One lesson of these little gardens, that are <b>so</b> <b>pretty,</b> is that one can get good effects from simple materials." [...] From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses. Her Colour in the Flower Garden (1908) is still in print today.|$|E
500|$|Kirshner {{opined that}} the {{situation}} with Jenny was [...] "not pretty". Jenny loves two people at once, She {{is the kind of}} character [...] "who will just grab experiences because of the holes inside her [...] she will leave the casualties in the wake behind her." [...] Kirshner often pushed and encouraged for more truth. She made Jenny's sex scenes [...] "darker, painful, and sometimes not <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> to watch". Kirshner did not mind portraying sex scenes with other females. She described them as [...] "more fun and easier" [...] and that she genuinely felt there was [...] "nothing to be ashamed of." [...] For her there was a [...] "comfort level that is beautiful". Kirshner had never appeared nude in previous roles, but she requested to go nude as Jenny in certain scenes to add to the reality.|$|E
500|$|Kerr's {{first film}} role {{was in the}} British {{production}} Contraband in 1940, but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E

500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / is where I drew some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was kind of funny, they looked <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> and clean, it looked like they didn't know what they were singing about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces like a drug dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — you might even feel bad for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz {{writing on}} behalf of Billboard {{magazine}} felt that Destiny's Child [...] "came back strong after a three-year hiatus, showing off their dance skills in the video" [...] for [...] "Lose My Breath". Jess Harvell of the website Pitchfork Media criticized the [...] "weird mink stole" [...] Beyoncé wore in the clip. A writer of People felt that the group borrowed from their old looks for their outfits in the video [...] "glammed up in stilettos and fur". Justin Myers from the Official Charts Company considered {{it to be a}} proof that the group was back in 2004, and showed them being [...] "totally kick-ass – <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> autobiographical". The music video was nominated for the Best Dance Video category at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Missy Elliott's [...] "Lose Control" [...] (2005). In 2014, The Guardian editor Michael Cragg ranked the video for [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] in his list of the ten best videos by Beyoncé. He remarked that the clip featured bigger budget than the group's previous visual efforts and praised the concept, saying, [...] "It's a simple idea executed perfectly, especially when Beyoncé gives herself side-eye, flicks her hair and then watches while one of the other Beyoncé's dances like a creature possessed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kurosawa {{dropped out}} of high school and worked in a variety of service-sector jobs {{including}} waitressing at a coffee shop and a sushi bar. When she was first scouted to appear in an Adult Video she was receptive to the idea. Recalling AVs she had seen in her father's collection, she later explained, [...] "I thought some of the girls were <b>so</b> <b>pretty,</b> and I wanted to have pictures of myself taken like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reviewer}} in the London Review in 1865 {{denounced the}} characters of Wegg and Venus, [...] "who appear to us in all the highest degree unnatural—the one being a mere phantasm, {{and the other a}} nonentity." [...] However he applauded the creation of Bella Wilfer: [...] "Probably the greatest favourite in the book will be—or rather is already—Bella Wilfer. She is evidently a pet of the author's, and she will long remain the darling of half the households of England and America." [...] E.S. Dallas, in his 1865 review, concurred that [...] "Mr Dickens has never done anything in the portraiture of women <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> and so perfect" [...] as Bella.|$|E
2500|$|Around a {{month before}} the albums completion, the band began looking through reels of old {{recordings}} that Lacey had collected, one of which contained [...] "On Life's Highway", a gospel hymn written by Bertrand Brown. The band felt that the song fit perfectly as an opening and closing to the album, believing that there was something quite shocking in having something <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> lead into something so aggressive in the opening track, [...] "Vices". Samples of a Baptist church minister giving a sermon and a child speaking are also used in the title track [...] "Daisy". In the case of previous album sessions, the band had spent around six months recording; however, with no set deadline from Interscope and no budget to be concerned about due to owning all of the equipment and studio, the band ended up spending around 12 months recording. Over the course of the albums production the band had written and demoed around 35 songs. This was narrowed down to 15 tracks, and then ultimately the final 11. The track [...] "Lazy" [...] by Brian Lane was amongst the songs cut, although Lacey was keen to include it on the final album.|$|E
2500|$|On January 13, 2012, Rap-Up {{released}} a remix of [...] "We Found Love" [...] featuring American rapper Flo Rida. Flo Rida's parts overlap Calvin Harris' produced dance beats. In the opening lines, Flo Rida introduces himself and raps tongue twisters about Rihanna and The Bahamas, [...] "You know I got love for you/ See {{what happened was}} we in Bahams/ I remember it was the ox summer, oh <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> I/ [...].Girl {{nice to meet you}} what's the honour/ Yeah she tap me told me she Rihanna.". He also references singer Mick Jagger singing that he is [...] "rocking a party 'like I'm Mick Jagger." [...] Flo Rida, himself in an interview with NME revealed that it was an honor for him to work with Rihanna. He also revealed that [...] "We Found Love" [...] was one of his favorite songs and that's why he decided to make a remix with Rihanna. He added that Calvin Harris' production impressed him and heavily influenced him on his future work. Rihanna also noted that she decided to work with Flo Rida because of his [...] "wild" [...] productions on his songs.|$|E

2500|$|Wise {{also spent}} {{considerable}} {{time and effort}} on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, Noël Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder, Wise looked for a [...] "name" [...] actress—Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences—and decided on Eleanor Parker. The casting of the children characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child-actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition {{to pursue a career}} as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, [...] "She was <b>so</b> <b>pretty</b> and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately." [...] The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe.|$|E
