25|$|Indianapolis {{took the}} second half kickoff and stormed down the field, {{overcoming}} some blown plays along the way. During the drive, Trudeau was sacked for an 11-yard loss on second down and 11, but a defensive holding penalty negated the play and gave the Colts a first down. Later on, Dickerson fumbled the ball, but Trudeau {{picked it up and}} threw a 15-yard first down completion to Bill Brooks. Eventually, Indianapolis reached the Browns 20-yard line, but linebacker Eddie Johnson hit Trudeau as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air where it was intercepted by Wright at the 14.|$|E
25|$|At the party, Bender is overheard {{saying that}} all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and {{delivers}} {{a solution to the}} robots; every last one needs to blast their exhaust vents at the same time, <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the sky, in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls to its feet. Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{were set}} {{a target of}} 239 for victory, and {{although}} {{that would have made}} it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury he had picked up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket {{for the rest of the}} innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only to be caught in the slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it looked as though he would be caught after hitting the ball <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.|$|E
500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being {{applied to a}} conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with the nacelles at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|E
500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E

[...] The engine was equipped with an afterburner that, unlike on later engines, was either fully lit, or off (i.e. {{it did not have}} [...] "zones"). [...] The engine produced 18,000lb of thrust at full power, enough to allow the F-8 to climb <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> clean configuration. [...] The Crusader was the first jet fighter in US service to reach 1,000mph; U.S. Navy pilot R.W. Windsor reached 1,015mph on a flight in 1956.|$|E

[...] For this reason, manes that are roached usually need to be kept that way, though occasionally roaching a damaged mane and allowing it to grow out evenly is effective as a last resort for a mane that has been partly torn out, badly tangled or otherwise cannot be restored to a smooth condition.|$|E
2500|$|Catatonia {{describes}} a profoundly agitated {{state in which}} the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. [...] There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior.

[...] Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air and the arm staying there).|$|E

2500|$|While {{attractive}} to American audiences, the {{association with the}} Beatles, partly through Badfinger being an Apple Records act, continued to hinder the band's attempts to forge their own identity. Having already tired of playing their debut hit song, the Paul McCartney-written [...] "Come and Get It", Badfinger would experience similar artistic compromises during the production of <b>Straight</b> <b>Up.</b> <b>In</b> {{other areas of the}} group's operation, all four members signed a management deal with American agent Stan Polley in November 1970, and the band hired part of Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire as a base for songwriting and rehearsing.|$|E

She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch for his services as a writer. In an interview Leonard said that the author [...] "sat <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his chair and said, 'I always knew I'd one day make a porny.'" [...] Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with [...] "Two-hundred fifty thousand". Leonard then asked if he'd be interested in adapting his novel-biography of Marilyn Monroe, but Mailer replied that he wanted to do something original. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.|$|E
