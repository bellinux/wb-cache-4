50|$|Singapore is {{the second}} Asian country after Japan to {{implement}} a comprehensive Common <b>Services</b> <b>Tunnel</b> system to distribute various utility services to all city developments. The Marina Bay network of purpose-built tunnels houses water pipes, electrical and telecommunication cables and other utility services underground. CST not only improves reliability of services supplies and allows easy maintenance and new installations, it also has 100% emergency backup services and the capacity for expansion to meet changing utility needs.|$|E
50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes. Communications utilities like fiber optics, cable television, and telephone cables are also sometimes carried. One {{may also be}} referred to as a <b>services</b> <b>tunnel,</b> services trench, services vault, or cable vault. Smaller cable containment {{is often referred to as}} a cable duct or underground conduit. Direct-buried cable is a major alternative to ducts or tunnels.|$|E

5000|$|The Common <b>Services</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is a {{development}} of the Marina Bay area in Singapore. It {{is said to be}} the second of its kind in Asia after Japan. This utility tunnel will house telecom cables, power lines, water pipes as well as provision for pneumatic refuse collection pipes. The 1.4 km phase one of the tunnel has cost about S$81 million (about US$51 million) while the 1.6 km phase two, which is under construction and scheduled to be ready in 2010, will cost S$137 million (about US$86 million).|$|E
50|$|Marina Boulevard is a road in Singapore {{running along}} {{the western side of}} Marina Bay. Starting at Raffles Place {{intersecting}} with Collyer Quay and running south, {{there are a number of}} landmark buildings along the length of it. One Marina Boulevard and One Raffles Quay form bookends of its northern terminus. Located along it are The Sail @ Marina Bay, the landmark promontory space, Central Linear Park (under construction), Marina Bay Financial Centre, and eventually Marina South Pier and the future Marina South residential community. The Common <b>Services</b> <b>Tunnel</b> runs underneath it. The first part of the road from Coller Quay to Marina View Link is a two-way street and the part from Marina View Link to the East Coast Parkway (ECP) is a five-lane, one-way road towards the ECP.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the firm capitalised on work funded by British Rail to develop means of calculating the {{aerodynamic}} behaviour of high-speed trains in long, complex tunnel systems (the resulting methods are still used today to design tunnels for rail traffic). MHA and French firm SETEC were appointed as joint advisers to the British and French Channel Tunnel Companies, who proposed a workable scheme. Exploratory construction contracts were let, but the British Government abandoned the scheme in 1975, {{with the first}} tunnel boring machine (built to dig the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel)</b> literally sitting on its launch frame. Despite the lack of funding, a short section of <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> was dug beneath the English coast through ground that had been filled with instruments to assess {{the performance of the}} TBM.

50|$|The {{objective}} was to construct two 7.6 m rail tunnels, 30 m apart, 50 km in length; a 4.8 m <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the two main ones; pairs of 3.3 m cross-passages linking the rail <b>tunnels</b> to the <b>service</b> one at 375 m spacing; piston relief ducts 2 m in diameter connecting the rail tunnels 250 m apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail <b>tunnels,</b> with the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> always preceding the main ones by at least 1 km to ascertain the ground conditions.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the case history of a 13 m wide, 17 m high and 40 m long <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> at Toledo Station, previously constructed in a deep open shaft and belonging to the Line 1 of the Napoli underground network. The existing Line 1 has been recently extended with a new stretch consisting of five new stations connected by twin rail tunnels for a total length of about 5 km. Toledo Station main shaft is located by a side of the line and it is connected to the pedestrian platforms by the above mentioned large size <b>service</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The station is situated in the historical center of the city of Napoli, under a deeply urbanized area. In Fig. 1 a longitudinal section of the main shaft of the station and of the large <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> with the above and surrounding buildings is sketched. The focus of this paper is on the settlement caused by the tunnel excavation and {{on the use of the}} Artificial Ground Freezing (AGF) technique to allow the safe excavation of the large crown of the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel,</b> located about one half in a silty sand layer and one half in yellow tuff, well below the groundwater table...|$|R
2500|$|On 17 January 2015, both tunnels {{were closed}} {{following}} a lorry fire which filled the midsection of Running Tunnel North with smoke. Eurostar cancelled all services. [...] The shuttle train had been heading from Folkestone to Coquelles and stopped adjacent to cross-passage CP 4418 just before 12:30 UTC. [...] Thirty-eight passengers and {{four members of}} Eurotunnel staff were evacuated into the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and then transported to France using special STTS road vehicles in the <b>Service</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> [...] The passengers and crew {{were taken to the}} Eurotunnel Fire/Emergency Management Centre close to the French portal.|$|R
2500|$|Initial {{geological}} investigation occurred from 1946 to 1963, {{which involved}} drilling the sea-bed, sonic surveys, submarine boring, observations using a mini-submarine, and seismic and magnetic surveys. To establish a greater understanding, a horizontal pilot boring was undertaken {{along the line}} of the <b>service</b> and main <b>tunnels.</b> Tunnelling occurred simultaneously from the northern end and the southern. The dry land portions were tackled with traditional mountain tunnelling techniques, with a single main tunnel. However, for the 23.3-kilometre undersea portion, three bores were excavated with increasing diameters respectively: an initial pilot <b>tunnel,</b> a <b>service</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and finally the main <b>tunnel.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> was periodically connected to the main tunnel with a series of connecting shafts, at 600- to 1,000-metre intervals. The pilot tunnel serves as the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> for the central five-kilometre portion. Beneath the Tsugaru Strait, the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) was abandoned after less than two kilometres (...) owing to the variable nature of the rock and difficulty in accessing the face for advanced grouting. Blasting with dynamite and mechanical picking were then used to excavate.|$|R
