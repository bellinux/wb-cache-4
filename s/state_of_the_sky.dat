50|$|This thesis {{was taken}} up again by the French author Guy Breton in his {{publication}} Les Beaux mensonges de l'histoire (The Beautiful Falsehoods of History). Breton alleges that the entire story of Juliette Dodu was not in fact anything but a fable gotten up by the journalist of the Figaro who signed himself Jean de Paris in an article of May 26, 1877, {{acting on behalf of}} M. de Villemessant, his director. In fact, it was not until seven years after the fact that one first heard of Mlle. Dodu. Guy Breton cites as reference general Aurelle de Paladines, {{commander in chief of the}} army of the Loire, who nowhere mentions that heroic salvation of his army. Lieutenant-colonel Rousset, author of a Histoire de la guerre Franco Allemande 1870-1871 (History of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871), never makes any reference to it, while he swarms with lively details up to and including the depth of the snow and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Neither the report of M. Steenackens, director of the posts and telegrams of the period, who described all the acts of resistance of his employees during that war.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{association}} between psychiatric disease, climatic and seasonal factors in patients recorded to the Emergency Unit, in Messina Hospital (Italy). Method: A total of 6565 psychiatric patients were recorded to the Emergency Unit in Messina from January 2005 and December 2010. Each psychiatric visit in emergency, was categorized by date of appearance and admitting diagnosis according to diagnostic categories: Anxiety, Mood Disorders and Psychosis. Local weather data were obtained from the Metereological Instituted “Aereonautica Militare” station in Messina, Sicily, In addition, to gathering data on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> temperature, atmosphericpressure with the normalized value at sea level, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, the station is connected to a buoy located on the eastern sector of Tyrrhenian Sea. Results: In anxiety disorders we have found relevant results comparison between winter and spring (p=. 007) and spring and fall (p=. 001). In affective disorders the differences occur in relation to winter and fall (p=. 002), spring and fall (p= 001), spring and summer (p= 002). The psychotic disorder presents significant differences between summer and fall (p=. 001) and spring and fall (p=. 002). Conclusions: We can observe a similarity of affective disorders, i. e. anxiety and mood disorders compared to psychosis, which have different influences and probably according to dissimilar etiopathogenetic ways. In our research, the distribution of anxiety disorders is higher than depressive disorders in terms of delivering emergency room visits. The major differences occur comparing spring and fall, the seasons when all pathological classes have significant differences. It follows that the most abrupt climate change, typical of these seasons, as a whole, cause psychopathological emergencies. The study is important for planning a more effective assistance for patients needing psychiatric support...|$|E

Short intervals, from time to time, occurred, when the clouds would break away, and the sun appear; but these intervals did not liberate the fleet from its confinement, for they were not long enough in duration to allow the sea to go down.
