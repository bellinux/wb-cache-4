5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was <b>seasonal,</b> <b>work</b> on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

Some Nicaraguans migrate for <b>seasonal</b> <b>work</b> opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s, notably from Chile and Argentina, as well as people from El Salvador who fled from guerrillas and government death squads.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century its main {{industry}} was kelp collection and export. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the kelp industry supported a large amount of the population. It was <b>seasonal</b> <b>work,</b> with collection taking place in the months of May, June and July, when it was considered possible to dry it outdoors. The dried kelp would usually then be burnt, and the ash used to produce various products, including fertiliser (mostly soda ash) and iodine. The ruined kiln on the south shore may have been used for this. Between 1817 and 1828, no less than 256 tonnes of kelp were collected in Ulva. Kelpers collected on average, a wage of two shillings a week, and a stone of wheat.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{experiences}} a constant flow of immigration. On average, close to 300,000 legal immigrants {{enter the country}} every year; about half are ethnic Russians from the other republics of the former Soviet Union. There is a significant inflow of ethnic Armenians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz and Tajiks into big Russian cities, something that is viewed unfavorably by some citizens. According to a 2013 opinion poll, 74% of Russians view {{the large number of}} labor migrants as a negative phenomenon. According to the United Nations, Russia's legal immigrant population is the third biggest in the world, numbering 11.6 million. In addition, there are an estimated 4 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia. In 2015, Ukraine-Russia was the world's largest migration corridor after Mexico-USA. According to the Armenian government, between 80,000 and 120,000 Armenians travel to Russia every year to do <b>seasonal</b> <b>work,</b> returning home for the winter. According to the Tajik government, at least 870,000 Tajiks are working in Russia. In 2014, remittances from Russia accounted for around one-third of Kyrgyzstan's and over 40% of Tajikistan's GDP.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, Dartiguenave was {{replaced}} by Louis Borno, who ruled without a legislature until 1930. That same year, General John H. Russell, Jr., was appointed High Commissioner. The Borno-Russel dictatorship oversaw {{the expansion of the}} economy, building over [...] of road, establishing an automatic telephone exchange, modernizing the nation's port facilities, and establishing a public health service. Sisal was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports. However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture had limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed at <b>seasonal</b> <b>work</b> in the more established sugar industries of Cuba and the Dominican Republic. An estimated 30,000–40,000 Haitian laborers, known as braceros, went annually to the Oriente Province of Cuba between 1913 and 1931. Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty. At the forefront of opposition among the educated elite was L'Union Patriotique, which established ties with opponents of the occupation in the US itself, in particular the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
2500|$|The Relief Project Workers' Union (RCPU) was the {{successor}} to the Relief Camp Workers' Union, which had led the 1935 strike that culminated in the On-to-Ottawa Trek and Regina Riot. After the earlier strike, the maligned federal relief camps run by the Department of National Defence were replaced by [...] "relief projects" [...] operated by the provinces and funded by both levels of government. The pay-rate {{was similar to the}} earlier camps – five dollars a month compared to the twenty-cents per day offered by the [...] "slave camps". The work was primarily <b>seasonal</b> <b>work</b> on farms. As in 1935, unemployed men from across the country drifted to British Columbia because of the milder climate, but also because relief projects in forestry camps paid as much as three times that of equivalent farm placements. From the perspective of the government, the main difference between the earlier camps established under R. B. [...] "Iron Heel" [...] Bennett and the relief projects under William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals was that the men were comparatively isolated from each other making it more difficult to organize. In both cases, the throngs of disaffected unemployed men were kept out of urban centres.|$|E
2500|$|The Zafimaniry {{primarily}} grow maize {{and beans}} {{and have been}} traditionally reliant on tavy (slash-and-burn agriculture). The average Zafimaniry man spends 22 days a year on clearing agricultural land through tavy, while {{the remainder of his}} time can be dedicated to other income earning activities like wood carving or migrating to find <b>seasonal</b> <b>work</b> elsewhere. Maize, which was probably adopted by the Zafimaniry around 200 years ago, is now their staple crop. Fields are burned each year {{at the start of the}} planting season, and are cultivated for four to ten years before their fertility is depleted and they are left fallow for around five years before being planted again. As a field becomes less fertile, maize and bean cultivation is abandoned in favor of potatoes and sweet potatoes. Cassava is the last crop to be grown in a field before it is allowed to go fallow During the fallow period, the Zafimaniry use the fields for other purposes, such as for grazing cattle, growing medicinal plants, and growing non-food plants, bushes and trees for fibers and construction material. After seventy years of this fertile-fallow cycle, the Zafimaniry stop cultivating the land plot entirely and allow it to become permanently fallow pasture land. [...] They supplement their corn, taro and beans with wild products gathered in the surrounding forests, particularly including honey and crayfish.|$|E

6000|$|A rough census {{taken in}} 1916 among our {{soldiers}} gave the astounding figure of 750,000 desirous {{of going on}} the land. That figure will shrink to a mere skeleton unless on demobilisation the Government is ready with a comprehensive plan. The men fall roughly into two classes: those who were already on the land; those who were not. The first will {{want to go back}} to their own districts, but not to the cottages and wages they had before the war. For them, it is essential to provide new cottages with larger gardens, otherwise they will go to the Dominions, to America, or to the towns. A fresh census should be taken and kept up to date, the wants of each man noted, and a definite attempt made now to earmark sites and material for building, to provide the garden plots, and plan the best and prettiest type of cottage. For lack of labour and material no substantial progress can be made with housing while the war is on, but if a man can see his cottage and his ground ready, in the air, he will wait; if he cannot, he will be off, and we shall have lost him. Wages are not to fall again below twenty-five shillings, and will probably stay at a considerably higher level. The cottage and the garden ground for these men will be the determining factor, and that garden ground should be at least an acre. A larger class by far will be men who were not on the land, but having tasted open-air life, think they wish to continue it. A fresh census of this class and their wants should be taken also. It will subdivide them into men who want the life of independent medium and small holders, with from 100 to 20 acres of land, and men who with 5 or 10 acres of their own are willing to supplement their living by <b>seasonal</b> <b>work</b> on the large farms. For all a cut-and-dried scheme providing land and homes is absolutely essential. If they cannot be assured of having these within a few months of their return to civil life, they will go either to the Dominions or back to the towns. One of them, I am told, thus forecasts their future wants: [...] "When we're free we shall have a big spree in the town; we shall then take the first job that comes along; if it's an indoor job we shan't be able to stick it and shall want to get on the land." [...] I am pretty sure he's wrong. He will want his spree, of course; but if he is allowed to go back to a town job he is not at all likely to leave it again. Men so soon get used to things, and the towns have a fierce grip. For this second class, no less than the first, it is vital to have the land ready, and the cottages estimated for. I think men of both these classes, when free, should be set at once to the building of their own homes and the preparation of their land. I think huts ought to be ready for them and their wives till their homes are habitable. A man who takes a hand in the building of his house, and the first work on his new holding, is far less likely to abandon his idea of settling on the land than a man who is simply dumped into a ready-made concern. That is human nature. Let him begin at the beginning, and while his house is going up be assisted and instructed. Frankly, I am afraid that in the difficulty of fixing on an ideal scheme and ideal ways of working it, we shall forget that the moment of demobilisation is unique. Any scheme, however rough and ready, which will fix men or their intention of settling on the land in Britain at the moment of demobilisation will be worth a hundred better-laid plans which have waited for perfection till that one precious moment is overpast. While doctors quarrel, or lay their heads together, the patient dies.|$|E
