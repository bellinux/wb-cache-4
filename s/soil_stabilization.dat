2500|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>stabilization</b> is the {{permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to <b>soil</b> <b>stabilization</b> is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs <b>soil</b> <b>stabilization</b> may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

We asked how changes in the amount and timing of precipitation affect litter decomposition, and <b>soil</b> C <b>stabilization</b> in semiarid ecosystems. Methods The study took place at a long-term (18 years) ecohydrology experiment located in Idaho. Precipitation treatments consisted of a doubling of annual precipitation (+ 200 mm) added either in the cold-dormant season or in the growing season. Experimental plots were planted with big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), or with crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum). We quantified decomposition of sagebrush leaf litter, and we assessed organic soil C (SOC) in aggregates, and silt and clay fractions. Results We found that: (1) increased precipitation applied in the growing season consistently enhanced decomposition rates relative to the ambient treatment, and (2) precipitation applied in the dormant season enhanced <b>soil</b> C <b>stabilization.</b> Conclusions These data indicate that prolonged increases in precipitation can promote soil C storage in semiarid ecosystems, but only if these increases happen at {{times of the year}} when conditions allow for precipitation to promote plant C inputs rates to soil...|$|R

We conducted controlled laboratory studies to investigate the effects that river birch (Betula occidentalis Hook.) and smallwing sedge (Carex microptera Mack.) had on the fate and behavior of Pb in a contaminated soil (3000 mg Pb/kg) and railings (13 000 mg Pb/kg) collected from an abandoned mining site in Utah. Significant Pb accumulation in aboveground tissue was observed in smallwing sedge (≥ 1000 mg/kg dry wt.) in both the soil and railings, but Pb was primarily excluded by birch (≤ 300 mg/kg dry wt.). Lead exclusion in birch resulted in elevated concentrations of Pb in the rooting zone in both the soil and railings. In the soil, the exchangeable Pb concentration of the unplanted control was not significantly different than the birch rhizosphere but was higher than the birch bulk (nonrhizosphere) soil fraction. This suggested that plants using exclusionary mechanisms of metal resistance may promote <b>soil</b> Pb <b>stabilization</b> by sequestering normally mobile fractions of Pb in the rhizosphere. However, both birch and smallwing sedge increased the leachate Pb concentration by 2 mg/L and decreased the pH by one unit in the railings compared with unplanted controls. Leachate Pb concentrations and pH were not significantly affected by plants in the soil. This indicated that the ability of metal-resistant plants to promote <b>soil</b> Pb <b>stabilization</b> is <b>soil</b> specific and depends on the level of Pb contamination and soil characteristics controlling the solubility and mobility of Pb.

We conducted controlled laboratory studies to investigate the effects that river birch (Betula occidentalis Hook.) and smallwing sedge (Carex microptera Mack.) had on the fate and behavior of Pb in a contaminated soil (3000 mg Pb/kg) and tailings (13 000 mg Pb/kg) collected from an abandoned mining site in Utah.

Three different soils were used, which differed in metal content, pH, and nutrient content. The effect of the plants on soil Pb fate was also considered. Both species were found to be Pb-resistant, but the resistance was attributed to different mechanisms. Under birch, the rhizosphere became enriched in Pb over time, suggesting that the plant promoted <b>soil</b> Pb <b>stabilization.</b> Smallwing sedge, in contrast, accumulated Pb, which appeared to promote <b>soil</b> Pb <b>stabilization</b> and decontamination by reducing the relative mobility of the metal.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of earthworm activity on soil aggregate stability under various tillage systems. Three tillage treatments were compared (moldboard plowing (MP), surface tillage (ST) and no-tillage (NT)). We present here an original method by which earthworm casts were quantified via image analysis at 2 - and 12 -cm depths. In addition, soil aggregate stability expressed as the mean weight diameter (MWD) and factors involved in <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stabilization</b> such as <b>soil</b> organic carbon, hot-water extractable carbohydrate content (HWEC) and water repellency (WR) of aggregates were measured in earthworm casts and bulk soil. In superficial soil layers, the relative cast abundance was small and more abundant under NT than the ST and MP treatments. At 12 cm, the relative cast abundance doubled irrespective of the tillage treatment and tended to be higher with conservation tillage (i. e., NT and ST). Moreover, the MWD increased in casts compared to the bulk soil in this deeper layer. The increase inMWDin casts was explained in part by the increase in soil organic matter (carbon content and HWEC) and the WR. For the two depths, we found a positive relation between the MWD from the bulk soil and casts among the tillage treatments. We conclude from this study that casts located at a 2 -cm depth did not participate in <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stabilization,</b> while at 12 cm the greatest structural stability observed under conservation tillage was explained in part by the production of casts...|$|R
