40|$|A {{prototype}} {{of an integrated}} electronics car sensor has been developed. It is a device that locks a vehicle seat belt when it is tilted or horizontally accelerated more than normally expected for a vehicle, keeping the occupant safely in her seat. It uses an accelerometer as sensor, an FPGA for signal processing and a truck <b>belt</b> <b>retractor</b> containing an electromechanical actuator. A comparison between a mechanical car sensor and the prototype car sensor show {{that it is possible}} to get comparable performance and a more silent operation using the prototype. Further it is possible to automatically calibrate the prototype car sensor so that the sensor might be installed with an inclination relative to the horizontal plane, enabling development cost cutting being able to use a <b>belt</b> <b>retractor</b> model for several car models. A drawback is that this car sensor demands a power supply...|$|R

The influence of the type of restraint system, the occupant seat, the age and the crash severity was investigated. The results indicate that the risk of abdominal AIS 3 + injuries increased with crash severity and decreased with the introduction of <b>belt</b> <b>retractors.</b> Rear <b>belted</b> passengers were observed to be more likely injured than front belted occupants. The organs injured in frontal crashes for belted occupants were mainly hollow organs especially jejunum, ileum and mesentery...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{emergency}} locking unit (ELU) {{for a seat}} <b>belt</b> <b>retractor</b> which is mounted on the back frame of a vehicle seat. The proposed unit uses a recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor and solenoid mechanism. The seat has an upper frame supported to tilt on a lower frame. The <b>retractor</b> in <b>belt</b> in seat (BIS) system {{is supported by the}} upper frame. The proposed recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor comprises orientation means for maintaining a predetermined orientation of emergency relative to the lower frame independently of the force of gravity when the upper frame tilts on the lower frame. Experimental results show that the developed recliner sensor unit operates effectively with respect to rollover angles. Thus, the developed unit will have a considerable potential to offer a new design concept in BIS system...|$|R

40|$|Histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> {{of breast}} cancer have {{distinctive}} morphological features and account for up to 25 % of all invasive breast cancers. We sought to determine whether at the genomic level, histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> {{of breast cancer}} are distinct from grade- and estrogen receptor (ER) -matched invasive carcinomas of no <b>special</b> <b>type</b> (IC-NSTs), and to define genes whose expression correlates with gene copy number in histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> of breast cancer. We characterized 59 breast cancers of ten histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Hierarchical clustering revealed that the patterns of gene copy number aberrations segregated with ER-status and histological grade, and that samples {{from each of the}} breast cancer histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> preferentially clustered together. We confirmed the patterns of gene copy number aberrations previously reported for lobular, micropapillary, metaplastic, and mucinous carcinomas. On the other hand, metaplastic and medullary carcinomas were found to have genomic profiles similar to those of grade- and ER-matched IC-NSTs. The genomic aberrations observed in invasive carcinomas with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells support its classification as IC-NST variant. Integrative aCGH and gene expression analysis led to the identification of 145 transcripts that were significantly overexpressed when amplified in histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> of breast cancer. Our results illustrate that together with histological grade and ER-status, histological type is also associated with the patterns and complexity of gene copy number aberrations in breast cancer, with adenoid cystic and mucinous carcinomas being examples of ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancers with distinctive repertoires of gene copy number aberration...|$|R

40|$|Pre-crash systems (PCSs) use {{environment}} and vehicle dynamics sensors {{to improve the}} effectiveness of passive safety devices by activating them before a collision occurs. The autonomous character of these intelligent vehicle systems, required to anticipate dangerous traffic situations, {{as well as the}} combination of new hardware and software technologies make the design extremely complex. This paper presents an evaluation of a PCS using the VEhicle Hardware-In-the-Loop (VEHIL) test facility. The prototype system utilizes a longrange forward-looking, installed for adaptive cruise control systems, for activation of a reversible <b>belt</b> <b>retractor.</b> The VEHIL laboratory enables testing of intelligent vehicle systems in a hardware-in-theloop environment, where only the relative motion between host and target vehicle is reproduced. The accuracy of VEHIL test setup made sensor validation and control system testing much easier and more flexible. It appeared to be useful for finetuning sensor post-processing algorithms, path prediction algorithms, and activation times. In addition, the radar system is modeled with the PRESCAN simulation tool, which enables simulation of environment sensors in a virtual environment. The simulated sensor output can be used for development of sensor post-processing, sensor fusion and control algorithms. Also other design aspects like sensor positioning and overall system architecture can be considered...|$|R
