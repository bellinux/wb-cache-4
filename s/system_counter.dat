50|$|Some {{supporters}} of the presidential <b>system</b> <b>counter</b> that impediments to a leadership change, being that they {{are little more than}} an unavoidable consequence of the direct mandate afforded to a president, are thus a strength instead of a weakness in times of crisis. In such times, a prime minister might hesitate due to the need to keep parliament's support, whereas a president can act without fear of removal from office by those who might disapprove of his actions. Furthermore, even if a prime minister does manage to successfully resolve a crisis (or multiple crises), that does not guarantee and he or she will possess the political capital needed to remain in office for a similar, future crisis. Unlike what would be possible in a presidential system, a perceived crisis in the parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers or rivals an opportunity to launch a vexing challenge for a prime minister's leadership. As noted above, in such situations a prime minister often resigns if they even moderately doubt their ability to endure a challenge, and {{there is no guarantee that}} the sudden accession of an unproven prime minister during a crisis will be a change for the better—the ouster of Thatcher (who, after successfully prosecuting the Falklands War, was nevertheless compelled to resign in the midst of the Persian Gulf Crisis) is seen as an example by those who argue her successor, John Major, proved less able to defend British interests in the ensuing Gulf War.|$|E

50|$|Defenders of the <b>system</b> <b>counter</b> that a {{book which}} fails to mention {{specific}} negative facts regarding the aggression and atrocities committed by Japan during World War II would also fail the Ministry of Education's approval process. During the approval {{process for the}} aforementioned history textbook by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, the author was ordered to revise the book's content several times before receiving final approval. Moreover, during the Cold War, the Ministry rejected textbooks by left-leaning publishers which attempted to portray the Soviet Union, Mainland China, North Korea and other Communist countries in a positive light. Defenders {{also point out that}} during the 1960s and 1970s, the extent of the atrocities, as well as the existence of many of the incidents, were still being debated by Japanese historians; therefore, the Ministry of Education was correct in rejecting references to specific atrocities such as the Nanking Massacre during that era, but the Ministry finally insisted on the inclusion of those same incidents after Japanese historians had finally reached consensus during the 1990s. They also point out that, North and South Korea, as well as China, which happen to be the most outspoken critics of the Japanese textbook approval process, do not allow private publishing companies to write history textbooks for their schools. Instead, the governments of those countries write a single history textbook for all of their schools. In the case of South Korea, the government strictly examines textbooks from different companies before being publicized. Critics of Chinese and Korean textbooks also argue that the textbooks of those countries are far more politically censored and self-favoring than Japanese textbooks.|$|E

Rather, we found comparable declines in both gross primary productivity and respiration suggesting little change in net flux, with a transitory recovery of respiration 6 - 7 years after mortality associated with increased incorporation of leaf litter C into soil organic matter, followed by further decline in years 8 - 10. The mechanism of the impact of tree mortality caused by these biotic disturbances is consistent with reduced input rather than increased output of carbon...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of initial {{conditions}} {{on the behavior of}} coupled frictional elastic systems subject to periodic loading. Previously, it has been conjectured that the long term response will be independent of initial conditions if all nodes slip at least once during each loading cycle. Here, this conjecture is disproved {{in the context of a}} simple two-node <b>system.</b> <b>Counter</b> examples are presented of “unstable” steady-state orbits that repel orbits starting from initial conditions that are sufficiently close to the steady state. The conditions guaranteeing stability of such steady states are shown to be more restrictive than those required for the rate problem to be uniquely solvable for arbitrary derivative of the external loading. In cases of instability, the transient orbit is eventually limited either by slip occurring at both nodes simultaneously, or by one node separating. In both cases a stable limit cycle is obtained. Depending on the slopes of the constraint lines, the limit cycle can involve two periods of the loading cycle, in which case it appears to be unique, or it may repeat every loading cycle, in which case distinct limit cycles are reached depending on the sign of the initial deviation from the steady state. In the case of instability an example is given of a loading for which a quasi-static evolution problem with multiple solutions exists, whereas all rate problems are uniquely solvable...|$|E
