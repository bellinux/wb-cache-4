50|$|Finger spools are a simple, compact {{low tech}} {{alternative}} to reels {{best suited to}} relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular flanges {{with a hole in}} the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is <b>secured</b> by <b>clipping</b> a bolt snap through a hole on one of the flanges and over the line as it leaves the reel. Line is reeled in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.Spools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.|$|R
40|$|Open {{techniques}} {{represent a}} valid repair option for severe asymmetric pectus excavatum in adults. The use of metal supports is recommended {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. A wide variety of metal supports have been proposed, with pre-, trans- or retrosternal fixation. A novel open technique using titanium bars fixed to the ribs with clips has been recently introduced (STRATOS™ system) for chest wall reconstruction, rib fracture fixation and chest wall malformation repair. We employed this technique in two adult patients with severe asymmetric pectus excavatum: after sternal mobilization, one bar is passed below the body of the sternum and <b>secured</b> with <b>clips</b> bilaterally to two ribs. In the first case, the results remained excellent 5 years after surgery. In the second case, the initial results were satisfying but the bar ruptured after 30 months: removal of the bars and clips was performed and a subsequent recurrence of the deformity occurred. The experiences reported in literature are still too limited to draw firm conclusions about the use of the STRATOS™ system in pectus excavatum repair, but it seems that the use of two bars may reduce the risk of rupture. At present, we are the only ones who reported long-term results...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clazosentan, an endothelin {{receptor}} antagonist, {{significantly and}} dose-dependently reduced angiographic vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). We investigated whether clazosentan reduced vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned patients with aSAH <b>secured</b> by surgical <b>clipping</b> to clazosentan (5 mg/h, n= 768) or placebo (n= 389) {{for up to}} 14 days (27 countries, 102 sites, inpatient and outpatient settings) using an interactive web response system.

She had a shade of pink hair closer to the -01 model, which was <b>secured</b> by <b>clips</b> that held them in Bunch-like pigtails while her outfit was sleeveless, more in line with the -02 model. She was under the command of a superior office during a time when Lyar was a new cadet. She had no dialogue in her short appearance, and unlike either of the upgraded versions, appeared colder and emotionless in comparison to the more inquisitive nature of -01 and exuberant nature of -02. In episode 11, Hidden Past, while Kotoko is backing her memories up in the event of her destruction, LeBlanc is able to disable Kotoko after she discovers his plan to link the computer systems in Watcher's Nest to the mainframe in the ruins. Despite this, Prim is able to take control of Kotoko's body in order to help her stop Le Blanc. In episode 13, Misaki, Lyar returns to greet Kotoko-02 after her repairs have been complete by Nodera. When she inquires as to the nature of Misaki, Kotoko reveals there is nothing in her memory banks about an individual with that name. She then inquires if Lyar is ok.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Management of {{ischemic stroke}} in the {{presence}} of aneurysmal brain disease is controversial. Recent retrospective evidence suggests that in selected patients, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) remains a safe approach for reperfusion. METHODS: We document a case of post-thrombolysis aneurysmal rupture. Supported by additional scientific literature we postulate that acute aneurysmal thrombosis leading to stroke in the culprit artery may be an ominous sign of rupture and should be considered separately from fortuitously discovered distant aneurysmal disease. RESULTS: A 71 -year-old female presented with an acute right middle cerebral artery stroke syndrome. IVT allowed vessel reperfusion and revealed a previously concealed, juxtaposed non-giant M 1 segment saccular aneurysm. Secondary aneurysmal rupture ensued. The aneurysm was <b>secured</b> by surgical <b>clipping.</b> Postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that despite reports of thrombolysis safety {{in the presence}} of brain aneurysms, thrombolysis remains potentially hazardous and hints toward an increased risk when the stroke arises on the parent vessel itself...|$|R
50|$|By contrast, Robby's {{considerable}} {{size and}} its construction from rigid sections that had articulated joints combined {{to create a}} far more convincing viewer experience. To access the suit, the three sections were dismantled and the operator climbed into the legs. The torso was then placed around him, the two sections were <b>secured</b> with internal <b>clips,</b> and the operator was strapped into an internal harness; finally the head was fitted, the internal electronics were connected to external power with hidden cables, and the suit was switched on and ready for filming. This design thus {{made it possible to}} film Robby from any angle and for him to move about and carry out the actions required without either betraying the obvious presence of the operator inside or revealing how they got in and out. One of the suit's few drawbacks was that its many intricate moving parts made a considerable amount of noise, so for all the scenes featuring Robby, the actors had to re-voice their dialogue in post-production to eliminate this unwanted sound.|$|R

5000|$|... "Basket arch" [...] {{turnouts}} (Korbbogenweichen) {{were built}} in 1988 at Saalbach junction so that trains could branch at 200 km/h. They were initially the most elaborate turnouts in Germany. As {{the continuation of the}} high-speed line to Stuttgart was then under construction, the points were initially fixed in the branching position. Their length is 154 m and their weight (including the concrete sleepers) is 210 t. The point blades are 40 m-long, the moveable point frogs are 15 m long. The radius of the branching track is initially 7,000 m and reduces at the frog to 6000 m. The two sets of point blades are operated by two turnout motors with eight points of activation and closed with eight clamps. Separate test contacts are used to monitor the position of the points. The moveable point frogs are activated by a motor and <b>secured</b> by three <b>clip</b> fasteners. In the points area, two points signals are installed at the approaches and a third in the centre of the turnout. Another innovation was the use of slide chairs that require little lubrication. The two turnouts are still among the fastest in terms of operating speeds in Germany.|$|R
50|$|Conditions {{that affect}} the {{installed}} stress arise through lots of activities. It is accepted that any action that disturbs the ballast, track components, geometry and rails will affect the 'Critical Rail Temperature' and cause {{the stability of the}} track to be subject to adverse thermal forces. A typical example would be when a piece of rail has been removed due to a defect, or when an Insulated block joint (IBJ) is to be replaced. In cases such as these, the stressing engineer would ensure that the old rail is measured and marked with 'TellTale' indicators on the foot of the rail at the extremities of the replaced length. The rail would then be 'Flame Cut', and the <b>clips</b> <b>securing</b> it to the sleepers/ties are removed starting at the point of the cut outward to the limit of renewal. The existing defective rail is then cut out and movement at the 'tell tales' noted for re-instatement. The stressing engineer will then calculate the 'Original Stress free temperature' of the removed section and determine how much stress, if any has been lost and needs replacing. The new rail is fitted and welded at one end. The new rail is then cut to suit the Calculated length and a stressing kit is then fitted at the end still to be welded. The kit is clamped to the rail and it pulls the gap together, leaving enough space for a second weld. Once the rail is stressed to the appropriate temperature the weld is made. After setting the weld and an appropriate cooling period of time has elapsed, the stress kit is removed.|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{vasospasm}} after aneurysmal {{subarachnoid hemorrhage}} (aSAH) {{is a frequent}} but unpredictable complication associated with poor outcome. Current vasospasm therapies are suboptimal; new therapies are needed. Clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, has shown promise in phase 2 studies, and two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (CONSCIOUS- 2 and CONSCIOUS- 3) are underway to further investigate its impact on vasospasm-related outcome after aSAH. Here we describe the design of these studies, which was challenging with respect to defining endpoints and standardizing endpoint interpretation and patient care. Main inclusion criteria are: age 18 – 75 years; SAH due to ruptured saccular aneurysm <b>secured</b> by surgical <b>clipping</b> (CONSCIOUS- 2) or endovascular coiling (CONSCIOUS- 3); substantial subarachnoid clot; and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades I-IV prior to aneurysm-securing procedure. In CONSCIOUS- 2, patients are randomized 2 : 1 to clazosentan (5 mg/h) or placebo. In CONSCIOUS- 3, patients are randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to clazosentan 5 mg/h, 15 mg/h or placebo. Treatment is initiated within 56 h of aSAH and continued until 14 days after aSAH. Primary endpoint is a composite of mortality and vasospasm-related morbidity within 6 weeks of aSAH (all-cause mortality, vasospasm-related new cerebral infarction, vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficit, neurological signs or symptoms {{in the presence of}} angiographic vasospasm leading to rescue therapy initiation). Main secondary endpoint is extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at week 12. A critical events committee assesses all data centrally to ensure consistency in interpretation, and patient management guidelines are used to standardize care. Results are expected at the end of 2010 and 2011 for CONSCIOUS- 2 and CONSCIOUS- 3, respectively.

5000|$|IRBs {{are made}} of rubber and consist of four {{inflatable}} tubes - two side tubes, a bow tube and a keelson tube. This specific feature coupled with the obvious {{fact that they are}} used in the water, has coined the term [...] "rubber duck" [...] or simply [...] "duck" [...] to describe an IRB. Typically the rubber is coloured a shade of red termed 'Rescue Red' although a particular make of craft manufactured by Arancia come in a shade of orange.They have a rigid floor piece and a rigid transom for fitting an outboard motor (usually 25 hp).This motor is capable of providing a maximum drive speed of between 25-30 knots on flat water. 2-Stroke fuel is stored in a flexible fuel bladder and is <b>secured</b> by 4 <b>clips</b> to the floor in the bow. An IRB is crewed by two people - an IRB Operator/Driver and an IRB Crewman. The Operator sits on {{the lower half of the}} port side pontoon where he operates the outboard motor to control the boat. He has a single foot strap to help him stay in the boat. His left hand can hold on to a strap on the port side pontoon and his right hand operates the outboard motor by means of a tiller arm and throttle. The Crewman sits on the upper half of the starboard side pontoon. A handle is attached by a rope to the nose of the boat for him to hold with his left hand, while his right hand may hold a strap attached to the starboard pontoon. He balances the boat and allows it to go over large waves before they break without flipping. He also assists when going through a breaking wave, commonly referred to as [...] "punching-through". As of 2011 only one foot strap is available for a crew member.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Horseshoe Kidneys are {{the most}} common renal fusion anomaly. When surgery is {{contemplated}} for renal-cell carcinoma in such kidneys, aberrant vasculature and isthmusectomy are the major issues to consider. We describe a case of a pure laparoscopic radical heminephrectomy with hand-sewn management of the isthmus for a 11 cm tumour in a horseshoe kidney. Presentation A 47 -year-old man complaining of palpable left flank mass for two months. Magnetic resonance of the abdomen revealed a 11 cm renal mass arising from the left moiety of an incidentally discovered horseshoe kidney. Preoperative CT angiography revealed a dominant anterior renal artery feeding the upper and midpole, with two other arteries feeding the lower pole and isthmus. The patient was placed in a modified flank position. A four-port transperitoneal technique was used, the colon was reflected. Renal pedicle was dissected and the renal arteries and renal vein were <b>secured</b> with polymer <b>clips.</b> The kidney was fully mobilized and a Satinsky clamp was placed on the isthmus for its division. A running 2 - 0 vicryl hand-sewn was used for parenchyma hemostasis. The specimen was extracted intact in a plastic bag through an inguinal incision. Results The operative time was 220 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 200 mL. There were no immediate or delayed complications. The patient resumed oral intake on postoperative day 1 and was discharged on postoperative day 2. Pathologic examination of the specimen confirmed a 11 cm organ-confined chromophobe renal-cell carcinoma, with negative margins. Discussion Laparoscopic oncologic surgery in patients with horseshoe kidneys can be technically challenging. The presence of a large cancer in a horseshoe kidney should not preclude a purely laparoscopic approach. With the aid of a Satinsky clamp, the isthmus can be sharply divided and sutured in a fashion similar to the open technique. To our knowledge, this report represents the largest cancer (11 cm) removed laparoscopically {{in the context of a}} horseshoe kidney...|$|R
