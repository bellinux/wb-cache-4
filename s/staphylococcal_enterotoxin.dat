40|$|Staphylococcal {{foodborne}} intoxication, {{in which}} major symptoms are vomiting and diarrhoea, occurs after ingestion of thermostable <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> produced in food by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci. <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> are normally not or only slightly inactivated during food processing, storage, distribution {{or during the}} preparation of the food in the kitchen. Therefore, if enterotoxigenic staphylococci are able to grow in food to more then 105 - 106 cfu/g/ml before they are killed there is still a risk of intoxication with consumption. The legislation of the Republic of Serbia lays down criteria for coagulase- positive staphylococci in food. However, the number of coagulase-positive staphylococci may not always be a good indicator of the presence of staphylococal enterotoxins, and the number of cells may have already decreased although the product still contains enterotoxins.

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>Enterotoxin</b> B was produced as an incapacitating agent.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to environmental cues the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus synthesizes and releases proteinaceous enterotoxins.

40|$|<b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> (SE) are exoproteins {{produced}} by Staphylococcus aureus {{that act as}} superantigens and have been implicated as {{a leading cause of}} food-borne disease and toxic shock. Little is known about how these molecules penetrate the gut lining and gain access to both local and systemic immune tissues. To model movement in vitro of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins,</b> we have employed a monolayer system composed of crypt-like human colonic T- 84 cells. SEB and SEA showed comparable dose-dependent transcytosis in vitro, while toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST- 1) exhibited increased movement at lower doses. Synthetic peptides corresponding to specific regions of the SEB molecule were tested in vitro to identify the domain of the protein involved in the transcytosis of SE. A toxin peptide of particular interest contains the amino acid sequence KKKVTAQELD, which is highly conserved across all SE. At a toxin-to-peptide ratio of 1 : 10, movement of SEB across the monolayers was reduced by 85 %. Antisera made against the SEB peptide recognized native SEB and also inhibited SEB transcytosis. Finally, the conserved 10 -amino-acid peptide inhibited transcytosis of multiple <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins,</b> SEA, SEE, and TSST- 1. These data demonstrate that this region of the <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> plays a distinct role in toxin movement across epithelial cells. It has implications for the prevention of staphylococcal enterotoxin-mediated disease by design of a peptide vaccine that could reduce systemic exposure to oral or inhaled superantigens.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to assess Staphylococcus aureus growth {{and the time of}} first {{detection}} of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> type A, B and C (SEA, SEB, SEC) in different type of milk, depending on the strain and storage conditions. Raw, pasteurized, and UHT milk were inoculated with three strains of S. aureus, and growth patterns were determined by the plate method in accordance with EN ISO 6888 - 1. Baird-Parker agar medium was used for the detection of S. aureus and the Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) used with a miniVIDAS analyzer tested the production of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins.</b> The results of model experiments showed the dependence of the growth rate and subsequent production of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> on incubation (storage) temperature, S. aureus strain, and type of milk. A significant finding was that the growth of S. aureus and production of enterotoxins in raw milk was inhibited by natural microflora, and production of enterotoxins was therefore not detected in raw milk within 102 hours of storage either at 15 °C or 22 °C. The highest risk of SEs production is associated with secondary contamination of pasteurized and UHT milk when stored at room temperature, where production was first detected after 12 hours of incubation...|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcal food {{poisoning}} {{is one of}} the most common foodborne diseases resulting from the ingestion of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> (SEs) preformed in foods by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), mainly Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci in raw milk during the production process leads to the contamination of products and outbreaks of alimentary intoxication. The problem of Staphylococcus aureus in cheese remains significant on a global level. Domestic cheese contaminated with enterotoxigenic staphylococci can result in the formation of enterotoxin, which can produce foodborne illness when the product is ingested. Due to microbiological contamination, microbiological criteria are tools that can be used in assessing the safety and quality of foods. In order to avoid foodborne illness, the Serbian Regulation on General and Special Conditions for Food Hygiene (Official Gazette of RS, No. 72 / 10) provides microbiological criteria for <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> in dairy products...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the involvement of}} the recently described <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> G and I in toxic shock syndrome.

These strains were selected because they produced none of the toxins known to be involved in these syndromes (toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and enterotoxins A, B, C, and D), enterotoxin E or H, or exfoliative toxin A or B, despite the fact that superantigenic toxins were detected in a CD 69 -specific flow cytometry assay measuring T-cell activation. Sets of primers specific to the enterotoxin G and I genes (seg and sei, respectively) were designed and used for PCR amplification. All of the strains were positive for seg and sei.

50|$|In {{addition}} to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses {{are caused by}} enterotoxins (exotoxins targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom appearance varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, {{as in the case}} of enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus in which symptoms appear in one to six hours. This causes intense vomiting including or not including diarrhea (resulting in staphylococcal enteritis), and staphylococcal enterotoxins (most commonly <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxin</b> A but also including <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxin</b> B) are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated. It occurs mainly in cooked and processed foods due to competition with other biota in raw foods, and humans are the main cause of contamination as a substantial percentage of humans are persistent carriers of S. aureus. The CDC has estimated about 240,000 cases per year in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{molecular}} biology, enterotoxin type B, also known as <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxin</b> B (SEB), is an enterotoxin produced by the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.

Being quite stable, the toxin may remain active even after the contaminating bacteria are killed. It can withstand boiling at 100 °C for a few minutes. Gastroenteritis occurs because SEB is a superantigen, causing the immune system to release a large amount of cytokines that lead to significant inflammation.|$|E
