5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the <b>snacking</b> and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E

For example, a person who knows that eating after a certain time in the evening triggers compulsive food behavior might include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from eating after that time of night; a person who knows that <b>snacking</b> between meals triggers compulsive food behavior would probably include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from chewing (or sucking) between meals.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} truckers have unhealthful eating {{patterns}} {{as a result}} of poor food choices and food availability at truck stops is partially to blame. The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or not stored in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular <b>snacking</b> while on the road and consumption of one large meal at the end of day. The daily meal is often high in calories and may be the highlight of the trucker’s day. Food intake varies during working hours compared to days off and truckers eat meals at the wrong circadian phase during the day.|$|E

500|$|The next {{song on the}} album's track list, [...] "You're So Cold," [...] was {{originally}} intended to be the lead single from Emotions, eventually being switched for the title track. The song's introduction features a piano and a capella vocal, working into its chorus. Chris Nickson wrote [...] "The song sailed into the chorus, driven by the house-y piano work, the bubbly, <b>snacking</b> rhythm belying the angry lyrics, the upbeat tone of voice." [...] As Nickson hinted at, its lyrics featured an angry message, calling out an unfaithful lover and asking how he could be [...] "So Cold." [...] "So Blessed" [...] was a song Carey wrote with Afanasieff, infusing fifties style pop balladry into it. Carey's voice in the song is very restrained, as she stays within her lower registers throughout {{the duration of the}} track. [...] "To Be Around You" [...] was described by Nickson as [...] "far more staccato." [...] Its production and melody was intended to pay tribute to [...] "Got to Be Real" [...] by Cheryl Lynn, as well as featuring spoken voices {{towards the end of the}} song. Nickson described [...] "Till the End of Time" [...] as a [...] "gentle, almost lullaby melody." [...] It was a love ballad, preparing the listener for the song's final track, [...] "The Wind." [...] The latter song featured the album's strongest jazz influence, and sampled a piano melody from Russell Freeman during the 1950s. After Afanasieff presented Carey with the melody he had discovered, it inspired her to write the melody and lyrics, which told of a friend that perished in a drunk-driving accident. Musically, the album fulfilled its greatest challenge, according to critics. It had helped master Carey's usage and infusion of several genres which she had not tapped into during the recording of her debut.|$|E
2500|$|For dental health, {{frequency}} of sugar intake {{is more important}} than the amount of sugar consumed. [...] In the presence of sugar and other carbohydrates, bacteria in the mouth produce acids that can demineralize enamel, dentin, and cementum. [...] The more frequently teeth are exposed to this environment, the more likely dental caries is to occur. [...] Therefore, minimizing <b>snacking</b> is recommended, since <b>snacking</b> creates a continuous supply of nutrition for acid-creating bacteria in the mouth. [...] Also, chewy and sticky foods (such as candy, cookies, potato chips, and crackers) tend to adhere to teeth longer. However, dried fruits such as raisins and fresh fruit such as apples and bananas disappear from the mouth quickly, and do not appear to be a risk factor. For children, the American Dental Association and the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the {{frequency of}} consumption of drinks with sugar, and not giving baby bottles to infants during sleep (see earlier discussion). [...] Mothers are also recommended to avoid sharing utensils and cups with their infants to prevent transferring bacteria from the mother's mouth.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Prior {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} fruit/vegetables and sedentary activities {{can serve as}} substi-tutes for high-calorie <b>snack</b> foods, when the behavioral costs for obtaining <b>snack</b> food increase. The current study investigated if fruit/vegetables are better substitutes for <b>snacks</b> than sedentary activities are and whether individual differences in dietary restraint {{play a role in}} how <b>snacks</b> are being substituted. Design: Participants (n 59) performed a concurrent schedules task, in which fruit/vegetables, sedentary activities, and <b>snacks</b> were simultaneously available. The response requirement for earning <b>snacks</b> increased per trial. Afterward, dietary restraint was measured. Main Outcome Measures: The amount of responses for <b>snacks</b> per trial and the amount of points earned for fruit/vegetables and sedentary activity per trial. Results: When <b>snacks</b> are harder to obtain, participants increased working for both fruit/ vegetables and sedentary activities. No differences were found for dietary restraint in the way <b>snacks</b> were substituted. However, high-restrained participants worked harder for <b>snack</b> foods than low-restrained participants. Conclusion: Fruit/vegetables and sedentary activities are both equally viable substitutes for high-calorie <b>snacks.</b> High-calorie <b>snacks</b> have a higher reinforcing value for highly restrained eaters...|$|R

2500|$|To make 1kg (2.2lb) of chocolate, about 300 to 600 {{beans are}} processed, {{depending}} on the desired cocoa content. In a factory, the beans are roasted. Next, they are cracked and then deshelled by a [...] "winnower". The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs. They are sometimes sold in small packages at specialty stores and markets {{to be used in}} cooking, <b>snacking,</b> and chocolate dishes. Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree, they contain high amounts of theobromine. Most nibs are ground, using various methods, into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. [...] This [...] "liquor" [...] is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in (more) cocoa butter and sugar (and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an emulsifier), and then refined, conched and tempered. [...] Alternatively, it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% cocoa powder. Standard cocoa powder has a fat content around 10–12%. Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture, other confectionery, soaps, and cosmetics.|$|E
2500|$|Maharashtrian cuisine is an {{extensive}} balance {{of many different}} tastes. It includes a range of dishes from mild to very spicy tastes. Bajri, wheat, rice, jowar, vegetables, lentils, and fruit form important components of the Maharashtrian diet. Popular dishes include puran poli, ukdiche modak, batata wada, sabudana khichdi, masala bhat, pav bhaji, and wada pav. Poha or Misal Pav flattened rice is also usually eaten at breakfast.

These are the Kolhapuri Sukka mutton, pandhra rassa, and tabmda rassa. Shrikhand, a sweet dish made from strained yogurt, is a main dessert of Maharashtrian cuisine. The cuisine of Maharashtra can be divided into two major sections—the coastal and the interior. The Konkan, on the coast of the Arabian Sea, has its own type of cuisine, a homogeneous combination of Malvani, Goud Saraswat Brahmin, and Goan cuisines. [...] In the interior of Maharashtra, the Vidarbha and Marathwada areas have their own distinct cuisines. The cuisine of Vidarbha uses groundnuts, poppy seeds, jaggery, wheat, jowar, and bajra extensively. A typical meal consists of rice, roti, poli, or bhakar, along with varan and aamtee—lentils and spiced vegetables. Cooking is common with different types of oil. [...] Savji food from Vidarbha is well known all over Maharashtra. [...] Savji dishes are very spicy and oily. Savji mutton curries are very famous. Like other coastal states, an enormous variety of vegetables, fish, and coconuts exists, where they are common ingredients. Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. Grated coconuts are used to flavour many types of dishes, but coconut oil is not widely used; peanut oil is preferred. Kokum, most commonly served chilled, in an appetiser-digestive called sol kadhi, is prevalent. During summer, Maharashtrians consume panha, a drink made from raw mango.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Snack</b> {{consumption}} {{has been}} reported to increase over recent decades. Little is known about possible associations between <b>snack</b> composition and <b>snack</b> eating location. In the present study, we aimed to describe the contribution of <b>snacks</b> to dietary intake in Norwegian adults and to investigate whether the composition of <b>snacks</b> differed according to where they were eaten. Methods Dietary data were collected in 2010 and 2011 using two telephone administered 24  h recalls about four weeks apart. In total, 1787 participants aged 18 - 70 years completed two recalls. The recorded eating locations were at home, other private household, work/school, restaurant/cafe/fast-food outlet and travel/meeting. Results <b>Snacks</b> contributed to 17 % and 21 % of the energy intake in men and women, respectively. Compared with main meals, <b>snacks</b> had a higher fiber density (g/MJ) and contained a higher percentage of energy from carbohydrates, added sugars and alcohol, while the percentages of energy from fat and protein were lower. The top five energy-contributing food groups from <b>snacks</b> were cakes, fruits, sugar/sweets, bread and alcoholic beverages. <b>Snacks</b> were mostly eaten at home (58 % of all <b>snacks)</b> or at work/school (23 % of all <b>snacks).</b> <b>Snacks</b> consumed at work/school contained less energy, had a higher percentage of energy from carbohydrates and had lower percentages of energy from added sugars, alcohol and fat than <b>snacks</b> consumed at home. <b>Snacks</b> consumed during visits to private households and at restaurants/cafe/fast-food outlets contained more energy, had a higher percentage of energy from fat and had a lower fiber density than <b>snacks</b> consumed at home. Conclusions We conclude that <b>snacks</b> {{are an important part of}} the diet and involve the consumption of both favorable and less favorable foods. <b>Snacks</b> eaten at home or at work/school were generally healthier than <b>snacks</b> consumed during visits to other private households or at restaurants/cafe/fast-food outlets.
