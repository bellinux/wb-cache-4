The governing equation is the physically based hydrologic method of flood routing with the output being an optimal estimate of stage given known inputs of streamflow.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades a {{significant}} body of knowledge has been gained on the adaptation {{of the human body}} going into near weightlessness conditions {{as well as for the}} re-adaptation to 1 xg Earth conditions after an orbital space flight. Ground-based paradigms for microgravity simulation have been developed such as head down tilted bed rest or dry-immersion studies. In such systems adaptations of the human body to long term immobilization and increased upper-body fluid <b>shifts</b> <b>bed</b> have been studied. But could we learn something on human body adaptations to altered gravity conditions using centrifuges? How does the body adapt to a long duration (days, weeks or longer) exposure to a hypergravity environment? And, once the body has fully adapted to a hypergravity environment, how does it re-adapt going from a hypergravity condition to a relatively hypo-gravity condition of 1 xg, or even going from centrifuge / hypergravity environment into a bed-rest setting? Can such transitions learn us something about the gravity transitions as a crew will experience going to Moon or Mars. Is hypergravity therefore a good model to study the effect of re-entry in gravitational environments after long duration space flight? We established a Topical Team sponsored by ESA ans supported by NASA and JAXA in which we address the issues as mentioned above.

The final outcome of the ESA Topical Team will be a clear answer about the feasibility of long duration hypergravity, and if and how hypergravity studies can provide useful knowledge to support future space flight on the one hand and the medical issues in e. g. the ageing population with its contemporary lifestyle on the other hand (osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, obesity) ...|$|R

40|$|The Early Paleozoic collisional system {{located in}} the Olkhon region at the western shores of Lake Baikal {{resulted}} from collision of the Siberian paleocontinent and a complex aggregate composed by fragments of a microcontinent, island arcs, back-arc structures and accretionary prisms. The main events were associated with complete manifestation of shear tectogenesis initiated by oblique collision. The current structure includes tectonically displaced components of ancient geodynamic systems that used to have been located dozens and hundreds of kilometres apart. Horizontal amplitudes of tectonic displacement {{seem to have been}} quite high; however, numerical data are still lacking to support this conclusion. Information about the structure of the upper crust in the Paleozoic is also lacking as only deep metamorphic rocks (varying from epidote-amphibolite to granulite facies) are currently outcropped. Formations comprising the collisional collage are significantly different in composition and protoliths, and combinations of numerous <b>shifted</b> <b>beds</b> give evidence of a 'bulldozer' effect caused by the collisional shock followed by movements of crushed components of the ocean-continent zone along the margin of the Siberian paleocontinent. As evidenced by the recent cross-section, deep horizons of the Early Paleozoic crust comprise the collisional system between the Siberian craton and the Olkhon composite terrain.  A permanent inclusion in the collisional combinations of rocks are unusual synmetamorphic injected bodies of carbonate rocks. Such rocks comprise two groups, marble melanges and crustal carbonate melted rocks. Obviously, carbonate rocks (that composed the original layers and horizons of stratified beds) can become less viscous to a certain degree at some locations during the process of oblique collision and acquire unusual properties and can thus intrude into the surrounding rocks of silicate composition. Such carbonate rocks behave as protrusions or intrusions and contain inclusions of silicate rocks. Formation of marble melanges is a multi-staged process: they occur as early tectonic covers and, more often, accompany shear zones of large lengths, comprise late push-out nappes initiated by shear faults, participate in construction of ring and vortex structures that are generated by shearing in the geological medium of inhomogeneous rheology. In general, the available data give evidence of the fact that formation of synmetamorphic marble melanges is a direct consequence of the oblique collision geodynamics and a sensitive indicator of such a regime. A pure guesswork may suggest that the occurrence of the marble melanges can be associated with a catastrophic loss of viscosity of the carbonate rocks due to a sharp increase of velocities of shear deformations that accompanied the oblique collision.  </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} {{for analysis of}} thermal gradients in a catalytic packed bed milli-reactor operated under radio frequency (RF) heating has been presented. A single-point temperature measurement would cause the misinterpretation of the catalytic activity in an RF-heated reactor, {{because of the presence}} of a temperature gradient. For reliable data interpretation, the temperature should be measured at three positions along the reactor length. The temperature profile can be accurately estimated with the exact analytical solution of a one-dimensional (1 D) convection and conduction heat-transfer model, and it can also be approximated with a second-order polynomial function. The results revealed that the position of maximum temperature in the catalytic <b>bed</b> <b>shifts</b> toward a downstream location as the flow rate increases. The relative contribution of conduction and convection to the overall heat transport has been discussed. The design criteria for a near-isothermal milli-reactor have been suggested. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{sedimentation}} processes of volcanic origin on benthic fauna {{are comparable to}} those caused by certain anthropogenic activities such as those derived from dredging, land movement, and deforestation (Miserendino et al. [2012]). According to Paul and Meyer ([2001]), a strong decrease in density and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates can be expected {{as a response to}} siltation. Increased turbidity has been associated with higher insect drifts (Doeg and Milledge [1991]), and generally, the <b>shift</b> in <b>bed</b> sediments from stable boulder-cobble to finer sediment sizes favors species adapted to unstable habitats, such as chironomids and oligochaetes (Pedersen and Perkins [1986]; Collier [1995]). Studies of sedimentation processes related to urban streams, have shown a decrease in available refugial space, making invertebrates highly susceptible to drift during floods (Borchardt and Statzner [1990]). It has also been confirmed that high levels of suspended solids alter benthic primary production in streams. Wantzen ([1998]) observed a significant scouring effect by silt (‘sand jet effect’) that reduced or removed epilithic algae and biofilms, which play a key role as a food source for grazing invertebrates. Additionally, high loads of suspended solids may increase turbidity, reducing stream primary production and interfering predator-prey relationships (e.g., optical orientation of dragonfly larvae). Moreover, allochtonous material, such as leaves and detritus may be covered by slow sand movement and become inaccessible for epibenthic detritivorous animals, consequently modifying the trophic structure (Wantzen [1998], [2006]).|$|R

This permits to assess sustainable restoration plan, especially concerning sediment augmentation below dams. The use of a hierarchical multicriteria approach on the Ain River permits us to assess a diagnosis of sediment deficit impact integrating several morphological (channel <b>shifting,</b> river <b>bed</b> degradation and river bed coarsening) and ecological components (Riparian and floodplain lake and fish communities). Our diagnosis also integrates a temporal and spatial approach better to link human pressures and environmental responses and to identify the dam effects amongst other drivers (e. g. grazing decline and channel regulation). The results confirm causality links between sediment deficit and slight channel bed degradation (0. 01 m. year- 1) or channel bed paving and thus highlight the impact of the dam on the drying of the riparian forest and on former channel community. However, the relationship between incision and reduction in active channel lateral mobility is more difficult to establish. The role of sediment deficit in the current variability of the riparian regeneration capacity and, thereby, landscape diversity along the lower valley remains unclear. This study also confirms the relevance of using different ecological indicators, notably because all components present different adjustment time scales, whereas some of them are more sensitive to other impacts...|$|R
