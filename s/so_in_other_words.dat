25|$|Postwar world {{capitalism}} {{suffered from}} a huge dollar shortage. The United States was running huge balance of trade surpluses, and the U.S. reserves were immense and growing. It was necessary to reverse this flow. Even though all nations wanted to buy US exports, dollars {{had to leave the}} United States and become available for international use {{in order for them to}} do <b>so.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> the United States would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit, financed by an outflow of US reserves to other nations (a US financial account deficit). The US could run a financial deficit by either importing from, building plants in, or donating to foreign nations. Recall that speculative investment was discouraged by the Bretton Woods agreement. Importing from other nations was not appealing in the 1950s, because US technology was cutting edge at the time. So multinationals and global aid which originated from the US burgeoned.|$|E

And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' <b>So,</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

Companies try to limit credit risk by securing their trade transactions {{in accordance with their}} credit policy that determines in some way the choice of trade transaction security tools. This article presents a full range of trade transaction security tools according to the general division into personal and property securities. The author pays {{attention to the fact that}} while conducting a proper credit policy in relation to clients, a company has chances to monitor efficiently the receivables and insist on their payment as well as use, as needed, the earlier prepared trade transaction security tools. The author convinces that regardless of the choice of trade transaction security tools, or reasons leading the receivables managing person, the basic criterion of security evaluation shall be its real, checked and verified value. The pledge on an object that does not exist is not worth much. The same applies to security granted by an insolvent person...|$|R

The parties do not contest that respondents had standing to initiate this case against the California officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8. But once the District Court issued its order, respondents no longer had any injury to redress, and the state officials chose not to appeal. The only individuals who sought to appeal were petitioners, who had intervened in the District Court, but they had not been ordered to do or refrain from doing anything. Their only interest was to vindicate the constitutional validity of a generally applicable California law. As this Court has repeatedly held, such a [...] "generalized grievance"—no matter how sincere—is insufficient to confer standing.|$|E

The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro dwelt, and which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery sheds were at some {{distance}} behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia did not glance at the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation had swept over her: at any rate, we may call it <b>so.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> she was angry with herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be told, for her actions--an inevitable mood.|$|E

50|$|Accommodation (or condescension) is the {{theological}} principle that God, while being in His nature unknowable and unreachable, has nevertheless communicated with humanity {{in a way}} which humans can understand and respond to. The concept is that scripture has accommodated, or made allowance for, the original audience's language and general level of understanding.

50|$|Another {{point is}} to {{distinguish}} the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society {{at that point in}} history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is {{the same as that of}} consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of John Milton are more fruitful than R. D.

50|$|Melharmony {{functions}} on {{a sophisticated}} {{set of principles}} that also take into consideration melodic rules and structure. Melodic systems {{in many parts of}} the world have tended to expand horizontally, exploring more scales and modes with specific ascending and descending sequences as opposed to the primary Major or Minor scales which form the core of harmonic systems. An instance of this would be the Carnatic music of India where each raga (mode) demands integrity to scale, sequence, key phrases (fragmentation), hierarchy of notes within its structure and <b>so</b> forth. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> each raga is not merely a melodic mode or scale but a unique melodic scheme.

5000|$|The {{reason why}} this is a fallacy may be {{understood}} by asking how the homunculus [...] "sees" [...] the internal movie.

But that raises the question of how this homunculus sees the [...] "outside world". To answer that seems to require positing another homunculus inside this second homunculus's head, and <b>so</b> forth. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> a situation of infinite regress is created. The problem with the homunculus argument is that it tries to account for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain.|$|R
