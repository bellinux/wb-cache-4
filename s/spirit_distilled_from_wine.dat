50|$|In English-speaking countries, eau de vie {{refers to}} a <b>distilled</b> {{beverage}} made <b>from</b> fruit other than grapes. Similar terms may be local translations or may specify the fruit used to produce it.

In French, however, eau de vie is a generic term for <b>distilled</b> <b>spirits.</b> The proper French term for fruit brandy is eau-de-vie de fruit, while eau-de-vie de vin means wine spirit (brandy), and several further categories of <b>spirits</b> (<b>distilled</b> <b>from</b> grape pomace, lees of wine, beer, cereals, etc.) are also legally defined as eau-de-vie in a similar fashion.

50|$|A common {{characteristic}} of many IMFLs, distinct from spirits {{elsewhere in the}} world, is that irrespective of the final product the starting ingredient is a neutral <b>spirit</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>from</b> molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry. This neutral spirit at 96% alcohol by volume is first reduced to 42.8% using demineralized water, whereupon flavors and other spirits are added. Caramel is added at this stage to impart colour to the spirit. Most commonly, grain or malt-based whisky, which may include imported Irish or Scotch whisky is blended with the spirit. The same applies to other IMFL spirits, like rum or vodka. However, some recent entrants distill spirits per traditional methods even when manufacturing in India.|$|R

Aguardente bagaceira is made from pomace {{as a way to}} prevent waste after the wine season. It is usually bootlegged, as most drinkers only appreciate it in its traditional 50% to 80% ABV.

The spirits produced either in columns filled with copper or aluminum pot still exhibits the lowest DMS contents but the higher sulfate and methanol contents, whereas spirits produced in stainless steel or porcelain showed higher DMS concentration and lower teors of sulfate ion and methanol. These observations are coherent with DMS oxidation to sulfate, with methanol as by product, {{in the presence of}} either copper or aluminum...|$|R

50|$|His {{commitment}} to the cognac method of distillation and maturation gained him a national reputation for superior brandy. Santhagens was instrumental in framing the legislation that became the Wine and Sprits Act of 1924, which promulgated criteria for brandy distillation, including permissible additives and fermentation processes.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretations of evidence. The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. <b>Distilling</b> technology passed <b>from</b> the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century. The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was <b>distilled</b> <b>from</b> <b>wine.</b> An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 – 1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.|$|R
