5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{assistant}} engineers {{working on the}} album was a 19-year-old Alan Parsons. He went on to engineer Pink Floyd's landmark album The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and produce many popular albums himself with the Alan Parsons Project.

5|$|Pink Floyd {{were founded}} by {{students}} Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene {{during the late}} 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
50|$|Moon {{subsequently}} {{started work}} on a second solo album, which was never completed. Two <b>Sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> was re-released by Repertoire Records in 1997, including the finished songs that Moon had made for his second album. Two <b>Sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> was again re-released by Castle Music and Sanctuary Records in July 2006, as a two-disc Deluxe Edition, featuring the original 10 songs plus 41 bonus tracks.|$|R

5|$|Richard William Wright (28 July 1943– 15 September 2008) was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was {{a founder}} member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, performing on {{all but one of}} the group's albums including The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours.|$|E
5|$|The main footage in {{and around}} the amphitheatre was filmed over four days in October 1971, using the band's regular touring equipment, {{including}} studio-quality 16-track tape recorders.

5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and {{was found}} by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It {{is an area of}} concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E

5|$|The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following {{the departure of}} founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E

50|$|Ferrer {{was born}} in Santa Monica, California, <b>the</b> oldest <b>of</b> five {{children}} of Academy Award winning actor José Ferrer and singer Rosemary Clooney.

He was <b>the</b> cousin <b>of</b> actor George Clooney and <b>the</b> nephew <b>of</b> journalist Nick Clooney.

5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, {{either side of a}} Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E
50|$|If the Moon's {{rotation}} were purely synchronous, Earth {{would not}} have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's libration, Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Earth traces out an approximate oval 18° in diameter. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> As a result, near <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> near and far <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Earth is sometimes below the horizon and sometimes above it.|$|R
50|$|These views showed mountainous terrain, very {{different}} from the near side, and only two dark, low-lying regions which were named Mare Moscoviense (Sea of Moscow) and Mare Desiderii (Sea of Desire). Mare Desiderii was later found to be composed of a smaller mare, Mare Ingenii (Sea of Ingenuity), and several other dark craters. The reason for this difference between <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is still not fully understood, but it seems that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark lavas that flowed out to produce the maria formed under the Earth-facing half.|$|R
