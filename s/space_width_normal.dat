40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} radiographic {{features of}} osteoarthritis (OA) {{to determine which}} is more closely associated with knee pain and hence might {{be used as a}} radiographic definition of OA in the community. To evaluate joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in <b>normal</b> subjects.  METHODS— 452 subjects from a case-control community study of knee pain (294  women, 158  men, mean age 62  years, range 40 - 80) underwent AP standing and mid-flexion skyline radiographs. Joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> measured by metered calliper to 0. 1  mm, and graded individual features of OA (osteophyte 0 - 3, narrowing 0 - 3, sclerosis 0 - 1, cysts 0 - 1) were assessed in all three compartments independently by two observers who were blind to clinical status. Subjects were categorised as having knee pain by a positive response to both parts of the question "Have you ever had pain in or around the knee on most days for at least a month? If so, have you experienced any pain during the last year?" RESULTS—Intraobserver reproducibility for joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> measurements was to within ± 0. 4 mm (95 % CI for limits of agreement); κ values for grading were > 0. 7. One hundred and twenty five subjects were without knee pain or osteophyte. In these radiographically normal knees, mean joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> varied according to sex but did not decrease with age. A definition based on the presence of osteophyte ⩾grade 1  in any compartment was more efficient at predicting pain than definitions based on either measurement or grading of joint space; there was no clear threshold of joint space loss at which the likelihood of pain substantially increased. The presence of osteophyte at the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) was more sensitive but less specific than at the tibiofemoral joint (TFJ); the addition of PFJ assessment improved sensitivity from 38. 1 % to 62. 3 % with a reduction in specificity from 82. 7 % to 58. 7 % for the presence of knee pain.  CONCLUSION—Among {{men and women in the}} community, osteophyte is the radiographic feature that associates best with knee pain. Radiographic assessment of both TFJ and PFJ should be included in all community studies. Joint space loss is not a feature of asymptomatic aging, and there is not a biological cut off for joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> below which the likelihood of knee pain markedly increases.    Keywords: osteoathritis; knee pai...|$|R

Current methods require proprietary software or have not been well validated; our purpose was to develop and assess the reliability of a digital joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> quantification method using public access software. We studied 95 patients, asymptomatic in the ankles and without history of ankle trauma, but with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis, participating in an ongoing longitudinal trial. Weightbearing anteroposterior radiographs of the ankle and supine radiographs of the pelvis were assessed, and the narrowest medial and lateral tibiotalar joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> and hip joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were measured using Image J software (US NIH, Bethesda, MD).

40|$|Patients with {{suspected}} pisotriquetral osteoarthritis {{may show}} joint space narrowing. However, {{the extent of}} joint space narrowing and its deviation from the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (JSW) in <b>normal</b> anatomy is unknown. In this pathoanatomic study, we therefore compared the JSW in the pisotriquetral joint between osteoarthritic patient wrists and healthy wrists. We reviewed preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of 8 wrists of patients with ulnar-sided wrist pain who underwent a pisiformectomy with confirmed pisotriquetral osteoarthritis at surgery. We also reviewed CT scans of 20 normal wrists from healthy volunteers serving as control group. Three-dimensional CT models of the pisiform and triquetrum were obtained from both affected and normal wrists, after which the minimum JSW was calculated in an automated fashion. In the patient group, the median (interquartile range) of the minimum JSW was 0. 1 mm (0. 0 - 0. 2), and in the control group, 0. 8 mm (0. 3 - 0. 9) (P =. 007). We showed that the pisotriquetral joint space in osteoarthritic patient wrists was significantly narrowed compared with healthy wrists. These results suggest that JSW evaluation has a potential diagnostic value in the work-up of patients with suspected pisotriquetral osteoarthritis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of axial {{traction}} during acquisition of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist with regard to joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (12 male, mean age 38. 1 years) were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study. Three-compartment wrist MR arthrographies were performed between October and December 2009 on a 3 T unit using a fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted isotropic high-resolution volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence in the coronal plane, with and without axial traction (3 kg). Two radiologists measured radiocarpal (radioscaphoid, radiolunate) and midcarpal (lunocapitate, hamatolunate) joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> with and without traction, and assessed the amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces using a three-point scale: 0 = absence, 1 = partial, 2 = complete. RESULTS: With traction, joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> increased significantly at the radioscaphoid (Delta = 0. 78 mm, P < 0. 01), radiolunate (Delta = 0. 18 mm, P < 0. 01), and lunocapitate (Delta = 0. 45 mm, P < 0. 01) spaces, and both observers detected significantly more contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. At the hamatolunate space, the differences in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (Delta = 0. 14 mm, P = 0. 54) and amount of contrast material were not significant. CONCLUSION: Direct wrist MR arthrography with axial traction of 3 kg increases joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> at the radiocarpal and lunocapitate spaces, and prompts better coverage of the articular cartilage by the contrast material.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the biochemical markers of arthritis and the radiographic grading of osteoarthritis (OA) in knees. Seventy-one women aged 49 - 85 years with knee OA were studied. Anterior-posterior knee radiographs and hand radiographs were taken in all patients. The radiographic grading of OA in the knee was performed by using the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and the joint <b>space</b> <b>width.</b> The 71 patients with knee OA were divided into two groups: 37 patients exhibiting generalized osteoarthritis (GOA) and 34 non-GOA patients, according to the grading of their hand radiograph. C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary pyridinoline, YKL- 40, plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 were measured as the biochemical markers of arthritis. The radiographic grading with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale revealed a significant relationship to the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (P = 0. 003) : the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> decreased with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade. All biochemical markers had negative correlations with the joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> but only urinary pyridinoline had a significant correlation (P = 0. 039). Pyridinoline (P = 0. 034) and TIMP- 1 (P = 0. 017) also exhibited a significant relationship to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. In GOA evaluations, the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> did not differ between GOA and non-GOA patients. CRP, pyridinoline, YKL- 40 and MMP- 3 levels were significantly greater in GOA patients than in non-GOA patients.

PURPOSE: To determine what factors affected joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and narrowing in patients after removal of isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 62 patients (15 women and 47 men) with all ligaments intact, no previous surgery to either knee, and an isolated degenerative medial meniscus tear removed in 1 knee were examined. The mean age at examination was 58. 2 years at a mean follow-up of 9. 4 years (range, 4 - 20 years). Subjective results were obtained with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee survey. Radiographs were taken using 45 ° weightbearing posteroanterior views. Midpoint and perceived minimum joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of the medial and lateral compartments of both knees were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm by 2 observers at different times, and they were blinded as to the previous measurements (Pearson intra- and interclass correlations, > 0. 93). Joint space narrowing was found by calculating the difference in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> between knees. Percentage of normal joint space loss was calculated by dividing joint space narrowing by the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in the contralateral knee.

The {{purpose of this}} pilot study was to quantify radiographic changes in subchondral bone after treatment with a minimally invasive joint unloading implant (KineSpring® Knee Implant System). Methods: Nine patients with unilateral medial knee OA resistant to nonsurgical therapy were treated with the KineSpring System and followed for 2 years. Main outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, function, and stiffness subscores and independent core laboratory determinations of joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and fractal signature of the tibial cortex. Results: WOMAC scores, on average, improved by 92 % for pain, 91 % for function, and 79 % for stiffness over the 2 -year follow-up period. Joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in the medial compartment of the treated knee significantly increased from 0. 9 mm at baseline to 3. 1 mm at 2 years; joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in the medial compartment of the untreated knee was unchanged. Fractal signatures of the vertically oriented trabeculae in the medial compartment decreased by 2. 8 % in the treated knee and increased by 2. 1 % in the untreated knee over 2 years.

METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal (one year duration), multicentre study was made of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip (American College of Rheumatology criteria). Data on clinical activity (pain, functional impairment), demographic data (age, gender, body mass index), and femoral head migration (superolateral, superomedial, concentric) were collected when the patient entered the study; radiological grade (joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in millimetres at the narrowest point using a 0. 1 mm graduated magnifying glass, evaluated by a single observer unaware of the chronology of the films) was recorded at the patient's entry to the study and after one year. RESULTS: Analysis {{of the means of}} the differences between two analyses performed by a single observer of 30 pairs of radiographs (one performed after an interval of one year) (0. 06 (SD 0. 23)) suggested that a change of more than 0. 56 mm (2 SD) after a one year follow up could define progression of osteoarthritis of the hip. Of the 508 patients recruited, 461 (91 %) completed the one year follow up and radiological progression was observed in 102 (22 %). The factors predictive of radiological progression that were identified in the multivariate analysis were: radiological joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> at entry 10, age at entry > 65 years (odds ratios 2. 11, 4. 25, 2. 51, 2. 66, 1. 90, respectively).

CONCLUSION: These data suggest that radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis could be defined by a change in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of at least 0. 6 mm after a one year follow up period, is correlated with the changes in clinical status of the patients, and is related not only to demographic data (age, gender), but also to some specific characteristics of osteoarthritis (localisation, radiological severity, clinical activity) ...|$|R

The program that failed to discriminate in the 0 - 12 month interval {{was not the same}} program that failed in the 0 - 18 month interval. The committee agreed at an interim meeting in November 2007 that an important goal for computer-based measurement programs is a 90 % success rate in making measurements of joint pairs in followup studies. This means that the same joint must be measured in images of both timepoints in order to assess change over time in serial radiographs. None of the programs met this 90 % threshold, but 3 programs achieved 85 %- 90 % success rate. Intraclass correlation coefficients for assessing change in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in individual joints were 0. 98 or 0. 99 for 4 programs. The smallest detectable change was < 0. 2 mm for 4 of the 5 programs, representing 29 %- 36 % of the change within the 99 th percentile of measurement...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether {{radiographic}} hip joint space thickness was changed by weight-bearing (WB) compared with non weight-bearing (NWB) position, and to evaluate whether radiographs centered on the hip were more sensitive than pelvic X-rays to detect such a change. Anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis were made in 30 patients with hip osteoarthritis OA (46 OA and 11 normal hips). Osteoarthritic, as well as contralateral normal hips, were analyzed. Radiographs centered on OA hip were performed in 28 other patients. X-rays were made in WB and NWB positions using a standardized radiological procedure. Measurements of mean joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (MeanJSW), maximum joint space narrowing (MaxJSN) and joint space surface area (JSA), were made using a computerized image analysis system. The joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> was unaffected by WB in normal joints but decreased with WB in OA joints. The decrease was significant only when considering MaxJSN in patients with a joint space thickness smaller than 2. 5 mm. The difference between WB and NWB was larger in radiographs centered on the hip than on pelvic X-rays. MeanJSW and JSA were found to be less sensitive than MaxJSN. The decrease of joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> was inversely correlated with joint space size in WB. These results suggest that WB radiographs of the hip should be used in preference to NWB in studies of hip OA...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of axial traction during acquisition of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography examination of the knee in terms of joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and amount of contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. Direct knee MR arthrography was performed in 11 patients on a 3 -T MR imaging unit using a T 1 -weighted isotropic gradient echo sequence in a coronal plane with and without axial traction of 15 kg. Joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were measured at the level of the medial and the lateral femorotibial joint with and without traction. The amount of contrast material in the medial and lateral femorotibial joint was assessed independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists in a semiquantitative manner using three grades ('absence of surface visualization, 'partial surface visualization or 'complete surface visualization'). With traction, joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> increased significantly at the lateral femorotibial compartment (mean = 0. 55 mm, p = 0. 0105) and at the medial femorotibial compartment (mean = 0. 4 mm, p = 0. 0124). There was a trend towards an increased amount of contrast material in the femorotibial compartment with axial traction. Direct MR arthrography of the knee with axial traction showed a slight and significant increase of the width of the femorotibial compartment with a trend towards more contrast material between the articular cartilage surfaces...|$|R
