30|$|Positive searching. Positive searching is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a deliberate, effortful attempt to recognise <b>something</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>value</b> in a given situation. Tucker (2007) has noted the importance of attending to positive aspects of situations for appreciative functioning. Recognising <b>something</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>value</b> is necessary to make the appraisals of benefit that underlie appreciative functioning (e.g. Adler and Fagley 2005; Wood et al. 2010); hence, positive searching {{increases the likelihood of}} making benefit appraisals.|$|R

25|$|Under {{a strict}} {{construction}} {{of the meaning of}} Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be extended to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The Levitical code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are the truest expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.|$|E

One intangible form of property recognized under the mail and wire fraud statutes is the right to control the disposition of government funds.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{earliest}} widespread criticisms of Riley were opinions that his dialect writing {{did not actually}} represent the true dialect of central Indiana. In 1970 Peter Revell wrote that Riley's dialect was more similar to the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region. Revell made extensive comparison to historical texts and Riley's dialect usage. Philip Greasley wrote that while [...] "some critics have dismissed him as sub-literary, insincere, and an artificial entertainer, his defenders reply that an author so popular with {{millions of people in}} different walks of life must contribute <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> and that his faults, if any, can be ignored." ...|$|E

2500|$|Consideration [...] is {{a concept}} devised by English common law, and is {{required}} for simple contracts, but not for special contracts [...] (contracts by deed). The case of Currie v Misa declared consideration to be a “Right, [...] Interest, [...] Profit, [...] Benefit, or Forbearance, [...] Detriment, [...] Loss, [...] Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> given by a promissor in exchange for <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.|$|E

So too was his next film, a remake of A Farewell to Arms (1957). To make A Farewell to Arms, he reportedly turned down Marlon Brando's role in Sayonara, William Holden's role in The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Charlton Heston's role in Ben-Hur. A Farewell to Arms received negative reviews, failed {{at the box office}} and became the last production by David O. Selznick.|$|E

2500|$|Gambling is the [...] {{of money}} or <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (referred to as [...] "the stakes") on an event with an {{uncertain}} outcome with the primary intent of winning money or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: [...] consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the [...] is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers {{on the outcome of}} a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.|$|E
2500|$|Techniques used to fool US air-power also {{included}} placing gasoline-soaked rags {{along the trail}} to fool pilots into thinking they had hit or ignited <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> Truck lights were dimmed or mounted under vehicles, and at regular intervals on some routes, spaces were cut into the jungle trees, forming small cups into which kerosene or some other flammable liquid was poured. This was lit to provide guide lights to moving men and material, invisible from the air. Waterways were also pressed into service via use of the [...] "floating barrel" [...] technique- steel drums packed with supplies that floated downstream for later collection. About 100,000 people were kept working on the Trail as porters, drivers, mechanics and anti-aircraft troops. By 1970, the entire Trail bristled with anti-aircraft batteries.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} theme of the film, Kubrick stated that [...] "there's {{something}} inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly". Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could [...] "remember hating". However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have [...] "contributed <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> to the [...] genre" [...] and mentioned it as one of his [...] "personal favorites". Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.|$|E

50|$|Removal of {{currency}} from circulation is substantially harder than introducing it {{as a reward}} for player actions.

2500|$|... "Consideration" [...] {{indicates}} {{the fact that}} all parties to a contract have exchanged <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of estoppel or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations. In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding. In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply {{on the basis of a}} [...] "meeting of the minds" [...] or a [...] "concurrence of wills". Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their 'abstraction principle' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract) the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. Unjust enrichment law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.|$|E
2500|$|Scalia {{argued that}} {{a better way to}} {{determine}} whether a prior conviction qualified as a [...] "crime of violence" [...] under the residual provision would be to see whether it posed at least as much risk of injury as the enumerated crime that posed the least such risk. [...] That crime could not be arson or the explosives crime, and so Scalia was left with burglary or extortion. [...] In Taylor the Court ruled that [...] "burglary" [...] in the ACCA's definition of [...] "violent felony" [...] had a generic meaningunlawful or unprivileged entry into or remaining in a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime. [...] Scalia posited a generic definition of extortion: [...] obtaining <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force. [...] As between the two, burglary posed less of an inherent risk of harm because it did not, by definition, in its generic sense, involve the use of force. [...] "The burglar may be prepared to flee {{at the first sign of}} human presence", after all.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly, the English law on {{contractual}} bargains {{was affected}} by its trading relations with northern Europe, particularly since the Magna Carta 1215 had guaranteed merchants [...] "safe and secure" [...] exit and entry to England [...] "for buying and selling by the ancient rights and customs, quit from all evil tolls". In 1266 King Henry III had granted the Hanseatic League a charter to trade in England. The [...] "Easterlings" [...] who came by boats brought goods and money that the English called [...] "Sterling", and standard rules for commerce that formed a lex mercatoria, {{the laws of the}} merchants. Merchant custom was most influential in the coastal trading ports like London, Boston, Hull and King's Lynn. While the courts were hostile to restraints on trade, a doctrine of consideration was forming, so that to enforce any obligation <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> needed to be conveyed. Some courts remained sceptical that damages might be awarded purely for a broken agreement (that was not a sealed covenant). Other disputes allowed a remedy. In Shepton v Dogge a defendant had agreed in London, where the City courts' custom was to allow claims without covenants under seal, to sell 28 acres of land in Hoxton. Although the house itself was outside London at the time, in Middlesex, a remedy was awarded for deceit, but essentially based on a failure to convey the land.|$|E
