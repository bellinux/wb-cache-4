50|$|Historically, a {{mortgagor}} (the borrower) and a mortgagee (the lender) {{executed a}} conveyance of legal {{title to the}} property in favour of the mortgagee as security for the loan. If the loan was repaid, then the mortgagee would return the property; if the loan was not repaid, then the mortgagee would keep the property in satisfaction of the debt. The equity of redemption was the right to petition the courts of equity to compel the mortgagee to transfer the property back to the mortgagor once the <b>secured</b> <b>obligation</b> had been performed. Today, most mortgages are granted by statutory charge rather than by a formal conveyance, although theoretically there is usually nothing to stop two parties from executing a mortgage in the more traditional manner.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{aspects of}} the <b>securing</b> of <b>obligations</b> in {{international}} trade The <b>securing</b> of <b>obligations</b> in the international trade is recently, possibly more than ever before, very topical issue, {{and the reason is}} quite clear - there is a strong need to <b>secure</b> international contractual <b>obligations</b> by effective and reliable securing instruments because of the economic and debt crises which started in 2008 and has been still a very actual problem.

The goal of the thesis is to describe legal aspects of <b>securing</b> <b>obligations</b> considering the determination of an applicable law, under which the securing is governed. Because of the author's long- term working bank experience, the final part of the text deals with a securing by a bank guarantee. In {{the first part of the}} thesis there are described legal relations in which an international element appears, and there are also described a purpose, function, categorization and different types of securing instruments respective of the international trade.

40|$|Coast to Coast Stores, Inc. v. Gruschus was {{the first}} Washington case {{to deal with the}} {{potential}} conflict between the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.) and the Franchise Investment Protection Act (FIPA), arising when a franchisor repossesses goods after a franchisee defaults under a security agreement. The Washington Supreme Court avoided the conflict, however, by holding that because the franchisor never terminated the franchise, the FIPA protections were not triggered. The U. C. C. remedies therefore applied: the franchisor could collect the proceeds of a liquidation sale of the secured goods-in this case the franchisee 2 ̆ 7 s inventory and supplies-in reduction of the franchisee 2 ̆ 7 s indebtedness; and the franchisor was relieved of the FIPA burden of purchasing all of the franchisee 2 ̆ 7 s inventory and supplies at fair market value. Washington franchisors breathed a sigh of relief, no longer fearing that they would be forced to buy out franchisees who fail in business: to avoid the FIPA purchase provision, the franchisor need only repossess its security without explicitly terminating the franchise contract. In correctly choosing not to apply FIPA, the Washington Supreme Court found basis for its decision in a technical construction of the terms 2 ̆ 2 franchise 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 termination 2 ̆ 2 as they appear within the Act. This technical construction, however, need not determine the result, for even when the franchisor terminates, the U. C. C. remedies should apply if the franchisee has defaulted on a <b>secured</b> <b>obligation</b> to the franchisor. As the Coast dissent argued, 2 ̆ 7 a strict construction of the law probably mandated application of the FIPA purchase provision in lieu of the U. C. C. default sections. That same constructionist interpretation, however, unreasonably burdens the franchisor and exceeds the remedy necessary to implement the protectionist policy that inspired FIPA. The logical interpretation of the franchisor 2 ̆ 7 s duty to purchase the franchisee 2 ̆ 7 s inventory and supplies denotes their fair market value as the actual proceeds realized at a wholesale level sale. This Note explains the difference between the U. C. C. and FIPA remedies and why their respective valuations should be interpreted as more similar than different. The Note then examines the Coast court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning and offers additional support for preserving the U. C. C. remedies even if a franchise is terminated when a franchisor repossesses franchised goods after a franchisee defaults on a <b>secured</b> <b>obligation</b> owed to a franchisor...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to give reader a {{treatise}} about specific use of bill of exchange as a securing instrument. The promissory note as a debtor security may take various economic life functions. Since the inception of law of exchange it was primarily the medium of payment, whereas the securing function was developed much later.

For example, guarantees may be called, with the guarantors having the subsequent right to make a claim against the estate for the amounts {{they were required to}} pay. Guarantees can normally be demanded by suppliers from officers and directors, and parent company guarantees are also common. Financial institutions, in order to fully realize on <b>secured</b> <b>obligations</b> of a debtor, will normally require guarantors to execute a [...] "Guarantee and Postponement of Claim", which prevents the guarantor from filing a claim against the estate until the secured creditor has been paid in full.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the extent of {{security}} interests in property. A security interest is a right of a creditor to resort to an asset with priority to at least some other creditors of the grantor of security when debt or defaults on the <b>secured</b> <b>obligation.</b> This works examines to what extent the secured creditor’s right is, or ought to be, affected when the encumbered asset undergoes changes that result in a new derived asset. Three scenarios are looked at: where new assets (“fruits”) are derived from the original collateral; where the original collateral is substituted for another asset or where it is incorporated or mixed with other assets into a new product. The question has attracted little judicial or academic attention. In the key case Buhr v Barclays Bank Plc [2001] EWCA 1223 it was held that that the secured creditor had a right to sale proceeds of collateral by virtue of its property right. This was termed as a “principle of substitutions” encompassing accretions, fruits and proceeds of the original collateral. It is suggested that this “principle” does not exist in current English law. This is so whether the security is fixed or floating. If a security interest is to extend to derived assets, parties ought to bargain for it. If new assets are a result of dispositions unauthorised by the secured creditor the creditor may claim the proceeds by asserting a new right based on unjust enrichment, not by virtue of the original property right. English law contrasts with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the US, where the secured creditor automatically acquires right to proceeds. Law and economics analysis suggests that extending security to proceeds promotes efficiency of secured credit but only if proceeds are understood narrowly and do not include fruits...|$|E
50|$|Foreclosure {{is rarely}} {{exercised}} as a remedy. To execute foreclosure, the secured party needs to petition the court, {{and the order}} is made in two stages (nisi and absolute), making the process slow and cumbersome. Courts are historically reluctant to grant orders for foreclosure, and will often instead order a judicial sale. If the asset {{is worth more than}} the <b>secured</b> <b>obligations,</b> the <b>secured</b> party will normally have to account for the surplus. Even if a court makes a decree absolute and orders foreclosure, the court retains an absolute discretion to reopen the foreclosure after the making of the order, although this would not affect the title of any third party purchaser.|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to replicate the effect of security by making an outright transfer of the asset, with a provision that the asset is re-transferred once the <b>secured</b> <b>obligations</b> are repaid. In some jurisdictions, these arrangements may be recharacterised as the grant of a mortgage, but most jurisdictions tend to allow the parties freedom to characterise their transactions as they see fit. [...] Common examples of this are financings using a stock loan or repo agreement to collateralise the cash advance, and title transfer arrangements (for example, under the [...] "Transfer" [...] form English Law credit support annex to an ISDA Master Agreement (as distinguished from the other forms of CSA, which grant security)).|$|R

Firms with entirely private wholesale debt financing recover a median value of 78. 4 % of total claims.
