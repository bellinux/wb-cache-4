5|$|By 1959 {{overcrowding}} as {{a result}} of the post-World War II baby boom forced the construction of a third <b>school</b> <b>building.</b> Land was purchased in 1960 at the former site of Hastings Pond, which had been filled in during construction of Interstate 94 through Saint Paul, and the building was completed at a cost of $3,663,529.78. Johnson High School has been located at the third <b>school</b> <b>building</b> since the fall of 1963.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the new}} ten-floor, $150 million {{building}} {{located in}} Lower Manhattan began in 1989. The new building was designed by the architectural firms of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Cooper, Robertson & Partners. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> in ten years and, at the time, was the costliest high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> ever built in the city.|$|E
5|$|Rescuers {{heading to}} the scene of the Kehoe farm fire heard the {{explosion}} at the <b>school</b> <b>building,</b> turned back, and headed toward the school.

50|$|Light Timber Construction (or LTC) was {{the name}} given to a {{standardised}} architectural design used {{for the construction of}} hundreds of state <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> in Victoria, Australia, between 1954 and 1977. LTC <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> were designed for speed of construction, uniform appearance and low cost. Many LTC <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> are either being demolished, or refurbished and so intact original-condition examples are becoming rare.|$|R
40|$|The {{survey was}} {{begun in the}} spring of 1935. Collecting the data which {{involved}} personal inspection of the approximately four thousand public <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> of the State consumed approximately twelve months; and assembling, interpreting and presenting the data thus collected, another year. This report contains the most complete data ever assembled on the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> of the state. The findings have emphasized two facts: first, there is a wide variation among districts and among counties in ability to provide <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> and equipment; second, the existence {{of a large number of}} <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> which are unfit and unsafe for school use...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} solutions for renovation processes in the ventilation of fifteen <b>school</b> <b>buildings.</b> The quality of indoor air as well as the operation of ventilation were studied. Both measurements and questionnaires to teachers were used before and after the renovation work. The quality of the indoor air measured in the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> was essentially improved as the renovation work proceeded. As the contents of carbon dioxide in the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> ranged between 1, 200 – 2, 400 ppm before the renovation work, they were below 1, 250 in the maximum in all the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> with only one exception after that. After the renovation the maximum carbon dioxide contents in the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> furnished with natural ventilation were decreased 850 ppm in the average. The air temperatures were higher than recommended both before (23 °C in the average) and after (22 °C in the average) the renovation. The heating network was not balanced in all the <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> before the measurements were made after the renovation work. In the estimates given by teachers working in these <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> the quality of the air was experienced to have improved from school grade 6. 5 to that of 7. 9 (scale 4 … 10) ...|$|R
5|$|The main Scarborough <b>School</b> <b>building,</b> Vanderlip Hall, was {{designed}} by William W. Bosworth, known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles. The <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was constructed in a severe, all-white Neoclassical style, and was completed early in 1917. In addition to a grand porticoed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring , ringed on three sides with French windows. In the 1960s, an additional Modernist structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.|$|E
5|$|The {{new site}} was {{completed}} in 1968, and the current high <b>school</b> <b>building</b> opened in 1971. In the 1980s, as school enrollment declined and costs increased, the Grade <b>School</b> <b>building</b> was leased to Pace University and the remaining students in that building (grades six through eight) occupied {{a portion of the}} new High <b>School</b> <b>building.</b> In 1988, a plan for a larger village and school meeting and performance area was initiated. A new auditorium {{was completed in}} 1998. After a bond vote in 2001, the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed in the early 2000s adjoining the high school.|$|E

50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{highlighted the}} need for earthquake-resistant design for structures in California. Many <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> were damaged, with more than 230 <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> that either were destroyed, suffered major damage, or were judged unsafe to occupy. The California State Legislature passed the Field Act on April 10, 1933, mandating that <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> must be earthquake-resistant. If the earthquake had occurred during school hours, the death toll {{would have been much}} higher.|$|R

5|$|By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society {{was given}} {{authorization}} to raise monies from a lottery {{to build a}} new <b>school</b> <b>building.</b> The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called {{for the construction of a}} new <b>school</b> <b>building.</b> On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society to establish a seminary for learning at the academy. That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society; the building now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High <b>School</b> <b>building.</b> This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same <b>school</b> <b>building</b> remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} few decades, there was a {{noticeable}} increase in earthquakes activities that cause great losses related with human and structures. The losses {{have a negative effect}} on the economy especially in developing countries that should follow all possible scientific methods to minimize that bad effect. <b>School</b> <b>buildings</b> have an important role in the educational process and they may serve as emergency shelters after earthquake events. So, <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> need a complete strategy for evaluating their capability to face the probable earthquakes. This paper is concerned with an important step for that required strategy to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of existing reinforced concrete <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> on the national level. A proposed methodology is presented for that purpose by developing qualitative norms for factors that supposed to have a major effect on the seismic behavior of the <b>school</b> <b>buildings.</b> This methodology is based mainly on questionnaire forms and a computer program in order to execute this methodology quickly and with reasonable accuracy based on scientific fundamentals. The proposed methodology is calibrated using some affected <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> by various earthquake events in different countries. The results showed good agreement with the state of damage of the <b>school</b> <b>buildings,</b> so it can be applied by the official authorities for preparing a prioritization plan of the structural safety of all existing reinforced concrete <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> in Egypt...|$|R
