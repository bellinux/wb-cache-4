Some video games also include built-in recording features, such as Grand Theft Auto V(2013), which included in-game recording and editing features in its PlayStation 4 and Xbox One re-releases, allowing players to record and edit gameplay to share with others. Video content is typically shared over the internet via streaming, using video sharing and media streaming websites such as YouTube and Twitch, where the content has a potential audience consisting of millions of people.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} is {{only provided}} via a public API, {{which can be}} used by any application to provide screen sharing functionality. Windows Desktop Sharing API exposes two objects: RDPSession for the sharing session and RDPViewer for the viewer. Multiple viewer objects can be instantiated for one Session object. A viewer can either be a passive viewer, who is just able to watch the application like a <b>screencast,</b> or an interactive viewer, who is able to interact in real time with the remote application. The RDPSession object contains all the shared applications, represented as Application objects, each with Window objects representing their on-screen windows. Per-application filters capture the application Windows and package them as Window objects. A viewer must authenticate itself before it can connect to a sharing session. This is done by generating an Invitation using the RDPSession. It contains an authentication ticket and password. The object is serialized and sent to the viewers, who need to present the Invitation when connecting.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>screencasts</b> as an {{instructional}} technology is increasing rapidly in higher education. While {{there appears to}} be a consensus around students’ satisfaction with the provision of technology enhanced tools, there is limited evidence revolving around their impact in terms of knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the reasons why students choose to engage (or not) with these resources remain largely unreported. The study assessed the effect of using <b>screencasts</b> on undergraduate students’ understanding and engagement with learning material in one of their modules. Customised <b>screencasts</b> were used as optional additional learning and teaching resources. Grades obtained in a test module (with <b>screencasts)</b> and a control module (without <b>screencasts)</b> were compared to gauge the impact of <b>screencasts</b> on knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, the reasons for students’ engagement (or lack thereof) with the <b>screencasts</b> were explored using questionnaires. A modest but significant impact of <b>screencasts</b> on knowledge acquisition was found and students’ perception of the <b>screencasts</b> was overwhelmingly positive. Students suggested that <b>screencasts</b> should be kept short to summarise lectures or delve in-depth into complex concepts but should not replace whole lectures. Reasons for not using <b>screencasts</b> revolved around a lack of understanding of what the resources were but also a reported lack of fit between the nature of the tool and self-assessed learning style...|$|R
40|$|The {{researchers}} {{engaged in}} cooperative inquiry {{in order to}} explore <b>screencasts</b> as online instructional tools. In total, each researcher analyzed 37 <b>screencasts,</b> which provided over two hours of instruction. The content area of these <b>screencasts</b> concentrated on teaching specific computing procedures (e. g., how to install web server software or how to add a table in a word processor). The researchers analyzed their own self-produced <b>screencasts</b> {{as well as those}} that were professionally produced. Analyses of the <b>screencasts</b> led the researchers to discover common structural components (i. e., bumpers, screen movement, and narration) and common instructional strategies (i. e., provide overview, describe procedure, present concept, focus attention, and elaborate content). By synthesizing the common structure and common instructional strategies, the researchers offer a framework for considering the role of <b>screencasts</b> as online instructional tools. To introduce a practical application of the framework, the researchers created a <b>screencasting</b> checklist, which may be used by online instructors and instructional designers to develop and assess their own <b>screencasts.</b> This initial work invites additional research and development in order to refine the <b>screencasting</b> framework and checklist...|$|R

40|$|Basic {{calculus}} {{skills that}} are prerequisites for advanced mathematical studies {{continue to be a}} problem for a significant proportion of higher education students. While there are many types of revision material that could be offered to students, in this paper we investigate whether short, narrated video recordings of mathematical explanations (<b>screencasts)</b> are a useful tool to enhance student learning when revisiting prerequisite topics. We report on the outcomes of a study that was designed to both measure change in student performance before and after watching <b>screencasts,</b> and to capture students' perception of the usefulness of <b>screencasts</b> in their learning. Volunteers were recruited from students enrolled on an entry module for the Mathematics Master of Science programme at the Open University to watch two <b>screencasts</b> sandwiched between two online calculus quizzes. A statistical analysis of student responses to the quizzes shows that <b>screencasts</b> can {{have a positive effect on}} student performance. Further analysis of student feedback shows that student confidence was increased by watching the <b>screencasts.</b> Student views on the value of <b>screencasts</b> for their learning indicated that they appreciated being able to i watch a problem being solved and explained by an experienced mathematician; ii hear the motivation for a particular problem-solving approach; iii engage more readily with the material being presented, thereby retaining it more easily. The positive student views and impact on student scores indicate that short <b>screencasts</b> could play a useful role in revising prerequisite mathematics...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} preferences and attitudes of Ontario ophthalmologists and ophthalmology residents toward <b>screencasting</b> as an educational tool with potential use for continuing medical education (CME) events. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty of 256 participants completed the survey. Methods: The surveys were sent to participants by email, with follow-up via telephone. Study participants were urban and rural Ontario ophthalmologists, registered with the Canadian Ophthalmological Society, and University of Toronto ophthalmology residents. Pre-recorded online presentations - <b>screencasts</b> - were used as the main intervention. Online surveys were used to measure multiple variables evaluating {{the attitudes of the}} participants toward <b>screencasting.</b> This data was then used for further quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Over 95 % of participants replied favourably to the introduction and future utilization of <b>screencasting</b> for educational purposes. Rural ophthalmologists were the most enthusiastic about future events. Practising in rural Ontario was associated with a higher interest in live broadcasts than practising in urban centres (p< 0. 02), an association supported by qualitative data. Qualitative analysis revealed geographic isolation, busy schedules, ease of use/access, and convenience to be the key factors contributing to interest in <b>screencasting.</b> Conclusions: Practising ophthalmologists and residents in Ontario are interested in academic online <b>screencasting.</b> Rural ophthalmologists were more interested in live lectures than their urban colleagues. More research is required to assess the potential of <b>screencasting</b> as a CME tool. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} study has investigated the ‘Digital Divide’ {{in regard to}} aphasia, and discovered {{that it was possible}} for people with aphasia to learn new computer skills when provided with specific aphasia-friendly training resources and a one-to-one tutor. Following this, a case study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of individualised aphasia-friendly <b>screencasts,</b> as a way for a person with aphasia to learn new computer skills independently. Five individualised <b>screencasts</b> were developed for the participant, using ‘Skype’ as the subject matter. Data was collected from the participant over six home visits. The effectiveness of the <b>screencasts</b> was evaluated by the researcher using a five-point rating scale of independence and the completed task duration, focusing on the two main tasks ‘making a call/video call’ and ‘adding a contact’. In addition, the researcher provided the participant with task sheets and practice sheets, to analyse the correlation between the participant’s viewing of the <b>screencasts</b> and practising of the tasks, with the participant’s performance in the rating scales of independence. Measures were initially taken following a demonstration alone. Following this, measures were taken after the introduction of the <b>screencasts</b> to analyse their effectiveness as learning tools. A significant difference was observed in one of the primary tasks pre- and post-introduction of the <b>screencasts.</b> Improvements were also made in other tasks. Over a three week period, analysis of the data showed that the participant learnt a new computer skill, and made improvements in other computer skills {{as a result of the}} <b>screencasts.</b> This demonstrated the potential of aphasia-friendly <b>screencasts</b> as an independent learning tool for people with aphasia...|$|R
40|$|Undergraduate {{mathematics}} is traditionally designed and taught by content experts with little contribution from students. Indeed, {{there are signs}} that there is resistance from mathematics lecturers to involve students in the creation of material to support their peers - notwithstanding the fact that students have been successfully engaged as co-creators of material in other disciplines. There appears to be little research into what issues may lead to reservations to using student-created content in mathematics learning. This paper takes a case study approach to investigate the reasons for lecturers' resistance to undergraduate student contributions to learning material, in particular with a view to the production of <b>screencasts</b> of mathematical explanations. It also investigates the views of students producing mathematical <b>screencasts.</b> This study {{is part of a larger}} research project investigating undergraduate involvement in mathematics module design. Four second-year students, who were producing mathematics <b>screencasts</b> as part of an internship, and five academics, were interviewed to gain an understanding of their views of the value of student <b>screencasts.</b> The interviews focused on the particular contributions students make to <b>screencasts,</b> outcomes for the students and level of lecturer acceptance of these resources. We argue that students benefit from creating <b>screencasts</b> for their peers by gaining deeper mathematical understanding, improved technological skills and developing other generic skills required of today's graduates. In contrast, we confirm lecturer resistance to using student-generated <b>screencasts</b> in their teaching materials. Lecturer reservations pertain to students' lack of mathematical maturity and concerns over the mathematical integrity of the content that students produce. We conclude that close collaboration between students and lecturers during the design and production phases of <b>screencasts</b> may help lecturers overcome reservations, whilst preserving the benefits for students. In addition, we provide evidence that the process is a valuable professional development opportunity for the lecturers themselves...|$|R
