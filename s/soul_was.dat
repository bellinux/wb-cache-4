5|$|Sons of <b>Soul</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} {{entirely by}} the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment. They intended {{to pay homage to}} their musical influences—classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s—and incorporated live instrumentation, funk, and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches. Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E
5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the lead}} of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia began to {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly {{the stars of the}} Motown label. This psychedelic <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E

5|$|Sons of <b>Soul</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by Wing Records and Mercury Records on June 22, 1993, to widespread critical acclaim. The record's commercial success included a 43-week chart {{run on the}} Billboard 200 and a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales {{of at least two}} million copies. With its success, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{became one of the most}} popular R acts during the genre's commercial resurgence in the early 1990s. However, after an ill-fated tour, the band went on hiatus and pursued individual projects before reuniting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{tracked the}} final mixes {{of the songs}} at Caribbean Sound Basin. Its main studio used a 64-channel SSL 4064 G mixing console, the {{secondary}} studio used a 48-track Neve console with flying faders, and its third studio used an Amek BC2 console. The group mostly used the older Neve console. In tracking the songs, they started with a drum machine groove as a basic track and recorded it. The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix. Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live. Sons of <b>Soul</b> <b>was</b> subsequently mastered by engineer Herb Powers at his New York City studio P.M. Entertainment.|$|E

5|$|A few hip-hop dance shows {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the 1990s such as 1991's The Party Machine with Nia Peeples and 1992's The Grind. Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) Dance Fever, Dance 360, The Wade Robson Project, MTV Dance Crew, America's Best Dance Crew, Dance on Sunset, and Shake It Up. In 2006, MTV France documented {{the creation of a}} dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew. Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original <b>Soul</b> <b>was</b> coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste Debout, the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste Debout) all made appearances during the show.|$|E
5|$|As a term, neo <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> {{coined by}} Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
50|$|Future Throwback <b>Soul</b> <b>is</b> a term {{often used}} by UK singer-songwriter Daley in the 2010s to {{describe}} a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Although both soulful and conscious, future <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from neo soul as it infuses more elements of pop, electronica, dubstep and hip hop instead of jazz and funk. Simply put, Future <b>Soul</b> <b>is</b> soulful songwriting infused with forward thinking electronic production.|$|R
2500|$|In Helena Blavatsky's Theosophy, the <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> {{the field}} of our {{psychological}} activity (thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and so on) {{as well as of}} the so-called paranormal or psychic phenomena (extrasensory perception, out-of-body experiences, etc.). However, the <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> not the highest, but a middle dimension of human beings. Higher than the <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> the spirit, which is considered to be the real self; the source of everything we call [...] "good"—happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, etc. While the spirit is eternal and incorruptible, the <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> not. The <b>soul</b> acts as a link between the material body and the spiritual self, and therefore shares some characteristics of both. The <b>soul</b> can <b>be</b> attracted either towards the spiritual or towards the material realm, being thus the [...] "battlefield" [...] of good and evil. It is only when the <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> attracted towards the spiritual and merges with the Self that it becomes eternal and divine.|$|R

5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|One of Galen's major works, On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, {{sought to}} {{demonstrate}} {{the unity of the}} two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects. He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> in the brain, the spiritual <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> in the heart, and the appetitive <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine. This idea is now referred to as localization of function. Galen's assignments were revolutionary for the time period, which set the precedent for future localization theories.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Aquinas {{claimed that}} X’s <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> X’s only {{substantial}} form, although X also had numerous accidental forms {{that accounted for}} X’s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which {{in the case of}} a human being is rational capacity. He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms. However, Aquinas did not claim that the <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> identical to the person. He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person. So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.|$|E

25|$|The {{belief in}} ghosts as {{souls of the}} {{departed}} is {{closely tied to the}} concept of animism, an ancient belief which attributed souls to everything in nature. As the 19th-century anthropologist George Frazer explained in his classic work, The Golden Bough (1890), souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body. Although the human <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it was widely held that the <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (ca.
