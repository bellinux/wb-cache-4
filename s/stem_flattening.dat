40|$|From 2010 to 2011 in Niger, {{the effects}} of a wind erosion-alleviating practice, i. e. {{mulching}} pearl millet fields with crop residue, on populations of and damage induced by millet stem borer (MSB), head miner (MHM), and head scarab (MHS) were studied. Significant differences in the survival of MSB diapausing larvae in millet stems {{at the end of the}} dry season were found at both Sadore and Doukoudoukou. At Sadore, mean MSB larval survival in the treatment where stems were exported at harvest and stored on platforms (treatment 1) was 1. 2 /stem, i. e. significantly higher than in all other treatments. Survival was between 0. 1 and 0. 2 larva in treatments 2 (with millet stems left standing from harvest throughout the dry season) and 3 (with millet <b>stems</b> <b>flattened</b> toward the end of the dry season, four months after harvest). It was less than 0. 1 larva in treatments 4 (with millet <b>stems</b> <b>flattened</b> in the middle of the dry season, two months after harvest) and 5 (with millet <b>stems</b> <b>flattened</b> at the beginning of the dry season, at harvest). At Doukoudoukou, mean MSB larval survival in treatment 1 was 0. 14 /stem, i. e. significantly higher than in treatments 4 and 5 (0. 02 – 0. 03 larva), with intermediary findings obtained in treatments 2 and 3 (0. 04 – 0. 08 larva). The population and biomass of diapausing MHM pupae and of MHS larvae in the soil were low at both locations, and not affected by crop residue management. Thus, crop residue management whereby stems were left standing until the end of the dry season did not enhance control of millet head pests via increased predator activity, while it increased MSB survival in stems...|$|R

5000|$|The {{roots of}} all Prosthechea species possess a velamen (a thick sponge-like covering) {{differentiated}} into epivelamen and endovelamen. Flavonoid crystals {{were observed in}} both the roots and leaves. The erect <b>stems</b> form <b>flattened</b> or thickened pseudobulbs. There are 1 to 3 terminal, sessile leaves. The leathery blade is ovate to lanceolate. (Euchile leaves are softer and thinner than other Prosthechea leaves.) ...|$|R
50|$|The blades are a grey-green {{color and}} are short, usually 2 - 15 cm long with rough edges. The erect stems can grow 1 - 30 cm tall. The <b>stems</b> are {{slightly}} <b>flattened,</b> often tinged purple in colour.|$|R
50|$|Smilax auriculata is a {{perennial}} vine producing underground rhizomes and sometimes tubers. Plants are climbers with zigzag branching, sometimes reaching {{a height of}} 9 m (30 feet). Prickles on the <b>stem</b> are <b>flattened</b> and rigid, about 4 mm (0.16 inches) long. Leaves are evergreen, narrowly ovate, not waxy, up to 8.5 cm (3.4 inches) long.

500|$|Divided into nine tribes, this is {{the largest}} subfamily, {{including}} all the [...] "typical" [...] cacti. Members are highly variable in habit, varying from tree-like to epiphytic. Leaves are normally absent, although sometimes very reduced leaves are produced by young plants. Stems are usually not divided into segments, and are ribbed or tuberculate. Two of the tribes, Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae, contain climbing or epiphytic forms with a rather different appearance; their <b>stems</b> are <b>flattened</b> and may be divided into segments.|$|R
50|$|It has a <b>flattened</b> <b>stem,</b> or peduncle, {{that can}} {{grow up to}} between 30 - 65 cm tall.It has 2 short branches, (or pedicels), the lowest branch is similar in length to the bract. The other branch, appears from the {{midpoint}} on the stem.|$|R
30|$|We {{observed}} that the growth of medullary vascular bundles continues but gradually becomes minimal, while the peripheral vascular bundles continue to grow in these seven Piper species. This result {{is consistent with a}} previous report (Trueba et al. 2015) that secondary thickening is actually restricted to the peripheral vascular bundles in species undergoing secondary growth. The variations in the activity of the medullary vascular bundles and the peripheral vascular bundles result in unusual distribution patterns of xylem and phloem, which influences stem shape based on the shape of the peripheral vascular bundles (Beck 2011). The function of the <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> of lianas is related to their climbing habit, where they are either appressed to or leaning on the supporting tree’s trunk; this habit is entirely restricted in epiphytic lianas (Obaton 1960). The seven Piper species climb via adventitious roots and form a cambial variant type with <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> or oblate in that the broad face of the flattened axis contacts branches of trees (Carlquist 2001). The <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> as well as adventitious roots seem related to an epiphytic habit. More than two vascular bundle rings or two development types might be seen in stem of larger diameter, so it is valuable to observe more details in further studies.|$|R
50|$|Two {{varieties}} are currently recognized. D. a. var. ackermannii has longer cladodes (<b>flattened</b> <b>stem</b> portions), 35 - 75 cm long, and longer tepals, 7 - 10 cm long. D. a. var. conzattianum has shorter cladodes, 10 - 50 cm long, and shorter tepals, 4 - 6 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Allium falcifolium, grows from a reddish-brown bulb {{one to two}} centimeters wide. The reddish or {{yellowish}} green <b>stem</b> is <b>flattened</b> {{such that}} it is thick {{in the center and}} thin along the edges. There are usually two leaves, which, as its common name suggests, are curved like the blade of a scythe. The stem is short and topped with an inflorescence of 10 to 30 flowers, each of which is one to one and a half centimeters wide. Each flower has six pinkish, red-purple, or white-streaked purple tepals.|$|R
50|$|The Ensign had a cushion-grip {{handlebar}} {{that could}} be adjusted to height and an adjustable comb which lifted <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> which might not otherwise be cut. Polished beechwood front rollers allowed mowing up to the lawn edge and could be replaced quickly with sidewheels for cutting long or wet grass.|$|R
5000|$|Taeniocrada is a genus of extinct {{plants of}} Devonian age (...) [...] It {{is used as}} a form genus for fossil plants with {{leafless}} <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> which divided dichotomously and had prominent midribs regarded as containing vascular tissues. It has been suggested that some species assigned to this genus were aquatic.|$|R
5000|$|Zootrophion is a genus of 23 known {{species of}} orchid, native to Central America, South America and the West Indies. The <b>stems</b> have inflated, <b>flattened</b> sheaths. The flowers bear sepals that fuse at their tips to form box-like {{structures}} that resemble animal's heads, hence the generic name, which means [...] "menagerie".|$|R
50|$|Key {{features}} of the original definition of the genus Taeniocrada were that it possessed leafless <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> with prominent midribs which appeared to contain vascular tissues. As more species {{were added to the}} genus, its definition became less clear. Three of the better-known species are T. decheniana, T. dubia and T. stilesvillensis.|$|R
50|$|Species in this genus {{have small}} fruiting bodies, {{typically}} less than 1.5 cm in diameter. Basidiocarps are pleurotoid or cyphelloid in shape, meaning {{they have a}} reduced <b>stem,</b> and a <b>flattened</b> cap that is kidney-shaped or circular when viewed from above. Gills are well-developed and radiate outwards from an off-center point of origin or lacking.|$|R
50|$|This cactus grows {{prostrate}} or upright to {{a maximum}} length of 60 centimeters. The <b>stem</b> segments are <b>flattened</b> and oval in shape, up to 18 centimeters long by 7 wide. The black-tipped spines are up to 4 centimeters long. The cactus produces yellow flowers year-round. The fleshy red fruit is up to 3 centimeters long by 2 wide.|$|R
50|$|Commelina polhillii is {{an annual}} herb with ascendent(=reclining {{for a while}} then turning upward) to decumbent (=trailing) stems up to 75 cm long. <b>Stems</b> are <b>flattened</b> on one side, {{sometimes}} maroon or with maroon stripes. Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, tapering at the tip, up to 12 cm long, sometimes with cilia (=long soft hairs) along the margins. Spathes are solitary, each with 3 or 4 flowers. Sepals are translucent. Petals are buff-orange, kidney-shaped, broader than long, up to 4 mm across. Seeds are rather unusual for the genus: spherical to elliptical with a crater-shaped pit on one side, with a small raised conical point {{in the middle of}} the pit.|$|R
50|$|Stenocarpus umbelliferus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to New Caledonia. It has a prostrate or upright habit, growing up to 5 metres in height. <b>Stems</b> are <b>flattened</b> when young, later becoming rounded. The leaves are thick and leathery with a slightly wavy margin. These may be ovate, elliptic, lanceolate or spathulate in shape with petioles that are 3 to 12 mm long. White, cream or pale yellow flowers occur in groups of 3 to 8 per umbel. These are followed by dark-coloured glabrous follicles that are 25 to 80 mm long and 3 to 5 mm wide.|$|R
50|$|Schlumbergera microsphaerica resembles {{other species}} of the genus Schlumbergera in that it has {{leafless}} green stems, made up of distinct segments, which act as photosynthetic organs. However, most other species have strongly <b>flattened</b> <b>stems,</b> whereas S. microsphaerica has branching stems made up of narrow, more or less cylinder-shaped segments, each 1.5 - 4.0 cm long by 2 - 5 mm in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Flat-stalked {{pondweed}} grows {{annually from}} turions and seed, producing branching plants with slender, <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> that are well-branched. The submerged leaves are long, rather grass-like, sessile, and translucent. The leaf tips are mucronate (i.e. with the midrib extending {{out of the}} leaf, giving a pointed appearance). [...] Abundant turions are produced along the stem, especially in autumn as the plant disintegrates.|$|R
50|$|Dactylis {{species are}} {{perennial}} grasses, forming dense tussocks growing to 15-140 centimetres tall, with leaves 20-50 cm long {{and up to}} 1.5 cm broad, and distinctive tufted triangular flowerheads comprising a panicle 10-15 cm long, turning pale grey-brown at seed maturity. The spikelets are 5-9 mm long, typically containing two to five flowers. The <b>stems</b> have a <b>flattened</b> base, which distinguishes them from many other grasses.|$|R
50|$|The {{climbing}} fetterbush (Pieris phillyreifolia) is a woody shrub-vine which climbs without clinging roots, tendrils, or thorns. It directs its stem into a crevice in {{the bark}} of fibrous barked trees (such as bald cypress) where the <b>stem</b> adopts a <b>flattened</b> profile and grows up the tree underneath the host tree's outer bark. The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge {{near the top of}} the tree.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flattened</b> <b>stem</b> {{segments}} are fleshy, {{round and}} blue-grey in colour. These {{are up to}} 30 cm in diameter and have sharp spines up to 5 cm in length. Yellow, sessile flowers with a fleshy base are produced {{on the edges of}} the upper stem segments. These are followed by barrel-shaped fleshy fruits which are pink or purple and up to 8 cm long.|$|R
5000|$|Cylindropuntia was {{formerly}} {{treated as a}} subgenus of Opuntia, but have now been separated based on their cylindrical stems (Opuntia species have <b>flattened</b> <b>stems)</b> {{and the presence of}} papery epidermal sheaths on the spines (Opuntia has no sheaths). A few species of mat- or clump-forming opuntioid cacti are currently placed in the genus Grusonia. Collectively, opuntias, chollas, and related plants are sometimes called opuntiads.|$|R
50|$|Taeniocrada decheniana, {{from the}} Lower Devonian, had {{separate}} fertile stems which repeatedly branched in a dichotomous fashion ending in sporangia {{between 3 and 7}} mm long. A few sporangia were borne {{on the sides}} of stems. The species was found in dense stands. It has been suggested that it was aquatic or semi-aquatic because it apparently did not have stomata on the <b>flattened</b> <b>stems.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is in {{the genus}} Selaginella and this creeper is {{characterized}} by having <b>flattened</b> <b>stems,</b> bearing four rows of ovate leaves which vary in size according to their position. Its specific epithet, [...] "denticulata" [...] comes from the Latin [...] "dens" [...] which means tooth, and alludes to the denticles that appear on the leaves. It was identified by the nineteenth century botanist Antoine Frédéric Spring.|$|R
50|$|Cissus subaphylla {{is a low}} shrub in {{the grape}} family Vitaceae, endemic to the Yemeni island of Socotra. The plant grows mainly in dry, low-lying areas on {{alluvial}} fans or on limestone slopes, and is rarely found above elevations of 300 m, where it is replaced by C. hamaderohensis. It {{does not have the}} climbing habit of other Cissus species, and its <b>stems</b> are <b>flattened</b> and gray-green in colour, with relatively small leaves and flowers. The tangled mats of C. subaphylla stems act as a protective covering for plants regularly eaten by goats and other browsing animals; the plant is thus important in the rehabilitation of species such as Dendrosicyos, Maerua and Commiphora.|$|R
5000|$|Echinochloa crus-galli {{is a type}} of wild grass {{originating}} from tropical Asia that was formerly classified as a type of panicum grass. It is commonly known as cockspur (or cockspur grass), barnyard millet, Japanese millet, water grass, common barnyard grass, or simply [...] "barnyard grass" [...] (which may refer to any species of Echinochloa or the genus as a whole however). This plant can grow to 60" [...] (1.5 m) in height and has long, flat leaves which are often purplish at the base. Most stems are upright, but some will spread out over the ground. <b>Stems</b> are <b>flattened</b> at the base. The seed heads are a distinctive feature, often purplish, with large millet-like seeds in crowded spikelets.|$|R
50|$|Juncus phaeocephalus is {{perennial}} with creeping rhizomes. It has <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> {{that are}} two-edged and can {{grow up to}} 1.5 ft tall. Its leaves are shorter than its flowering stems. Brown-head Rush can be easily mistaken from sedges or irises because of its stems and leaves. These plants have many flowers that exhibit a brownish color with one to several spherical heads {{at the ends of}} the stem.|$|R
50|$|The parent {{species from}} which epiphyllum hybrids were bred are {{different}} in appearance and habit from most cacti. They {{are found in the}} tropical forests of Central America where they grow as climbers or on trees as epiphytes. They have leafless (or apparently leafless) <b>flattened</b> <b>stems</b> which act as the plants photosynthetic organs. Relatively large flowers are borne {{on the sides of the}} stems; in many species they open at night.|$|R
