2500|$|Some {{websites}} offered early tickets, {{which the}} Association of Secondary Ticket Agents warned were fake. [...] "We are warning {{people not to}} buy tickets that are not yet on sale because {{it is unlikely that}} they will receive those tickets", announced the organization's chief, Graham Burns. He concluded, [...] "It's impossible when the dates haven't been announced to be selling tickets for something when there are no announced dates". Jackson's official website allowed fans to register early for a [...] "pre-sale" [...] draw. Some fans had difficulty applying, as the website could not deal with the large number of registrations—reportedly up to 16,000 applications a second. In the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>24</b> <b>hours,</b> nearly a million people from around the world registered for pre-sale tickets, enough to fill the venue 50 times over. Tickets that had not even been printed were selling on auction website eBay for £300. Sales of Jackson's albums increased following the press conference. Overnight, sales of Off the Wall rose 200%, Bad rose 110%, Dangerous rose 165% and Thriller 25 rose 155%.|$|E
