25|$|Vincent W. Fallio {{writes that}} {{ancestor}} cults first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies.

Secret societies may have served a similar function in these complex quasi-theocratic societies, by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> of folk religion and elite religion.|$|E
25|$|Anguissola's {{education}} and training had different implications than that of men, since men and women worked in <b>separate</b> <b>spheres.</b> Her training was not to help her into a profession wherein she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother. Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or history paintings.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Germany annexed Austria and, {{together}} with major Western European powers, signed the Munich Agreement following which Germany, Hungary and Poland divided parts of Czechoslovakia between themselves. German plans for further eastward expansion, {{as well as}} the lack of resolve from Western powers to oppose it, became more apparent. Despite the Soviet Union strongly opposing the Munich deal and repeatedly reaffirming its readiness to militarily back commitments given earlier to Czechoslovakia, the Western Betrayal led to the end of Czechoslovakia and further increased fears in the Soviet Union of a coming German attack. This led the Soviet Union to rush the modernization of its military industry and to carry out its own diplomatic maneuvers. In 1939 the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany dividing Eastern Europe into two <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> of influence. Following the pact, the USSR normalized relations with Nazi Germany and resumed Soviet-German trade.|$|E

500|$|The Industrial Revolution led to {{extensive}} mechanization, {{resulting in}} a shift from home manufacturing to large-scale factory production. As this rapid transition took place, families lost many of their production functions. Instead, family members had to {{work outside the home}} to support their families.

The husband became the [...] "breadwinner" [...] by going out and working, while the wife stayed home and took care of the family.|$|E
500|$|A {{second problem}} is the {{difficulty}} of comparisons across cultures. [...] "Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature." [...] In-depth surveys {{may be the only}} way to get necessary information desired, but they make it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. [...] "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were <b>separate</b> <b>spheres.</b> 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that 'every mother is a working mother.' There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment." ...|$|E
500|$|These <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> lead Stace {{to reflect}} on both proofs for God and acosmism. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only {{accessible}} by intuition and not logic. [...] "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, {{is a direct result}} of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." [...] Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant. Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley's gender {{concerns}} did not cease with generic issues. In {{the musical}} contest between Apollo and Pan {{in the first}} act, Apollo is associated with masculine characteristics, such as philosophy, science, and reason, and Pan is associated with feminine characteristics, such as sheep and nature. however, as Purinton notes, [...] "both sing egocentric lyrics that boast of their 'instruments' and their deeds". When Apollo wins, the play appears to celebrate [...] "male superiority". However, Pan appeals the decision to King Midas, who reverses the decision in Pan's favour, {{for which he is}} then punished. Purinton argues that the play therefore breaks down traditional gender distinctions, portraying characters with mixed gender signals. In this way, she writes, [...] "as cross-dressed dramaturgy, then, Midas is a comedy about women's issues played out on male bodies". For her, the play dramatizes the problems with the nineteenth-century ideology of <b>separate</b> <b>spheres,</b> where women were expected to remain in the private, domestic sphere and men were expected to participate in the political, public sphere.|$|E
500|$|When Æthelwulf succeeded to {{the throne}} of Wessex in 839, his {{experience}} as sub-king of Kent had given him valuable training in kingship, and he in turn made his own sons sub-kings. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, on his accession [...] "he gave to his son Æthelstan {{the kingdom of the}} people of Kent, and the kingdom of the East Saxons [...] and of the people of Surrey and of the South Saxons [...] ". However, Æthelwulf did not give Æthelstan the same power as his father had given him, and although Æthelstan attested his father's charters as king, he {{does not appear to have}} been given the power to issue his own charters. Æthelwulf exercised authority in the south-east and made regular visits there. He governed Wessex and Kent as <b>separate</b> <b>spheres,</b> and assemblies in each kingdom were only attended by the nobility of that country. The historian Janet Nelson says that [...] "Æthelwulf ran a Carolingian-style family firm of plural realms, held together by his own authority as father-king, and by the consent of distinct élites." [...] He maintained his father's policy of governing Kent through ealdormen appointed from the local nobility and advancing their interests, but gave less support to the church. In 843 Æthelwulf granted ten hides at Little Chart to Æthelmod, the brother of the leading Kentish ealdorman Ealhere, and Æthelmod succeeded to the post on his brother's death in 853. In 844 Æthelwulf granted land at Horton in Kent to Ealdorman Eadred, with permission to transfer parts of it to local landowners; in a culture of reciprocity, this created a network of mutual friendships and obligations between the beneficiaries and the king. Archbishops of Canterbury were firmly in the West Saxon king's sphere. His ealdormen enjoyed a high status, and were sometimes placed higher than the king's sons in lists of witnesses to charters. His reign is the first for which there is evidence of royal priests, and Malmesbury Abbey regarded him as an important benefactor, who is said to have been the donor of a shrine for the relics of Saint Aldhelm.|$|E

5000|$|Archaeological {{studies of}} {{religion}} increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, {{rather than as}} a <b>separate</b> <b>sphere</b> of activity. They include religion as an axis of identity that structures social life and personal experience. Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically “religious” artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas. For example, John Chenoweth (2009) [...] interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to Quaker ideals of plainness and modesty.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the example}} of Karl Polanyi, Finley argued that the ancient economy should not be {{analysed}} using the concepts of modern economic science, because ancient man had no notion of {{the economy as a}} <b>separate</b> <b>sphere</b> of society, and because economic actions in antiquity were determined not primarily by economic, but by social concerns. This text later came under scrutiny, with varied criticism coming from, amongst others, Kevin Greene,who argues that Finley underplays the importance of technological innovation, and C. R. Whittaker,who rejects the concept of a [...] "consumer city".|$|R
30|$|Local {{governments in}} Sweden and Denmark balance between {{self-government}} and central control {{and between the}} autonomous and integrational model of local government (Kjellberg, 1995). According to the autonomous model, local governments are a <b>separate</b> <b>sphere</b> of government with a primary function to secure democratic participation and the efficient provision of local services. In the integrational model, local governments are {{one part of the}} public sector and their main role is to implement national policies. These tensions are evident in the Swedish and Danish integration policies, where the ambitions of the unitary state governments meet powerful local governments (Sellers and Lindtsröm, 2007).|$|R
2500|$|The {{notion of}} <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> {{dominated}} Victorian beliefs about gender roles, {{assuming that the}} roles {{of men and women}} are clearly delineated. Public life (including work) is within the masculine domain, and private life (domesticity) is within the feminine. The expression of feelings is considered feminine, and aggression is seen as masculine. Resolving conflict with words is feminine, and men are likely to resort to physical resolution (including war). The mistress of the home is the guardian of morality and religion and [...] "The Angel in the House". The public sphere is considered dangerously amoral and, in the work of authors such as Dickens, disasters ensue when characters do not conform to contemporary standards.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical {{in the sense}} that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. [...] He wrote, [...] "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false." [...] and [...] " [...] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things." [...] However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason [...] "strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> of knowledge that each applies to.|$|E
2500|$|Gaskell's {{novel of}} manners has the broader {{context of an}} {{industrial}} novel about the Black Country, where young girls (like Bessy) die of [...] "cotton consumption"; capitalists disregard legal obligations, and workers refuse prophylactic facilities, instigate strikes and foment riots (O'Farrell, 1997, p 58). It can be criticised, as Martin Dodsworth did in 1970, for giving the love affair precedence over the industrial context and for dwelling on the emotional conflict between Margaret and Thornton. However, North and South is not simply an industrial Pride and Prejudice Margaret acquires stature and a public role, challenging the Victorian idea of <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> (Stoneman, 1987, p.167). She befriends Bessy Higgins (a young, working-class woman), gradually abandons her aversion [...] "shoppy people" [...] and – recognising Thornton's qualities, crosses social classes to consider herself [...] "not good enough" [...] for him. Although the novel ends in Harley Street (where it began), Margaret's estrangement from the vain, superficial world of her cousin Edith and Henry Lennox is emphasised by her choice of Thornton and Milton (Pollard, 1967, p.111).|$|E

2500|$|Religion, {{especially}} Afrikaner Calvinism, {{played an}} instrumental {{role in the}} development of Afrikaner nationalism and consequently the apartheid ideology. The Dutch Reformed Churches of South Africa were involved throughout the 18thcentury in a constant battle against modernism and modernity. They aligned with the conservative views of Abraham Kuyper, who emphasised God's authority over <b>separate</b> <b>spheres</b> of creation. These spheres, for example historical nations, had to be preserved and protected from liberalism and revolutionary ideologies. Kuyper also rejected the Enlightenment with its emphasis on human rationality and individuality and thought that it had led to the ideals of equality, fraternity and freedom of the French Revolution. In his view, all these ideas challenged God's authority. Afrikaner theologians worked from this foundation and defined a number of political, economic and cultural spheres that had their separate, independent destinies. The Afrikaner history was also reinterpreted through a Christian-nationalistic ideology. Already Paul Kruger, president of Transvaal and a founding member of the Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika or 'Dopper Church', referred to it as [...] "sacred history" [...] with volk as the chosen people, where the Great Trek was seen as the Exodus from the British rule in Cape to the Promised Land of the Boer Republics.|$|E

[...] Two types of sexual harassment have gain widespread fame in the workplace and are being addressed. [...] The first revolves around a woman being fired, or demoted due to a refusal to offer sexual favors to her superior. [...] This is called retaliatory. [...] The second revolves around an environment that is denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace. [...] This is called environmental. [...] Despite these being addressed, due to ambiguities in the legal framework, these types of harassment can be hard to enforce. [...] Women are bringing it to the public's attention through attempts to speak out against the injustice, however, many remain silent, fearing they will be fired if they speak out. [...] This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace. [...] Sexual harassment can be a double edged sword in the workplace however. [...] Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers are laughing stocks. [...] Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position. [...] Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department. [...] Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred. [...] Men's opinions of women in Japan vary greatly, primarily due to their experiences with women.
