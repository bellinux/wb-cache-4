40|$|We {{document}} that S&P 500 futures {{finish in the}} proximity of the closest strike price more often on days when <b>serial</b> <b>options</b> on S&P 500 futures expire than on other days. The effect is driven by the interplay of market makers' rebalancing of delta hedges due to the time-decay of the hedges as well as in response to reselling (and early exercise) of in-the-money options by individual investors. Consistent with limits to arbitrage, we find that the effect is asymmetric and stronger above the strike price. In line with increased options activity, pinning becomes more pronounced in recent years. Pinning, Futures, Options, Option Expiration, Hedging...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{and growing}} importance attached to serials {{in the broadest}} sense, both as an archival souree and an information disseminating agency, requires a complete understanding of the various, and many, ramifications involved in writing, producing, documenting, disseminating, storing, and disposing of the information concerned. The current economic situation has prompted an even closer scrutiny and evaluation of methods involved, and the importance, of this form of literature. The appreciation of serials varies considerably in practice from librarian to librarian and, more importantly, from library school to library school. Acknowledging this fact the Department of Library and Information Studies at Loughborough University of Technology introduced a <b>serials</b> <b>option</b> into its degree programme some years ago, and which has attracted a consistent amount of interest. This paper will outline the syllabus involved. Because {{of the variation in}} serials appreciation as mentioned above, a point of view backed by the United Kingdom Serials Group and by other parties - publishers, agents and librarians - the British Library awarded the author a research grant to investigate the demands of practising librarians and the methodologies of teaching the subject at library schools. Whilst concentrating on UK practice a cross sectional view was obtained from countries overseas. It is hoped that preliminary findings will be available {{at the time of the}} conference which will reveal the dichotomy of views of the needs of the practising librarian and the way the subject is taught by the professional teaching institutions...|$|R
50|$|The Model 16 {{evolved into}} the TRS-80 Model 16B with 256 KB in July 1983, and later the Tandy 6000, gaining an {{internal}} hard drive along the way and switching to an 8 MHz 68000. Tandy offered 8.4MB, 15 MB, 35 MB, and 70 MB external hard drives, up to 768 KB of RAM, and up to six additional RS-232 serial ports supporting multi-user terminals. Additional memory and <b>serial</b> port expansion <b>options</b> were available from aftermarket companies.|$|R
40|$|Good quality entropy {{sources are}} {{indispensable}} in most modern cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, many currently deployed networked devices {{do not include}} them and may be vulnerable to Random Number Generator (RNG) attacks. Since most of these systems allow firmware upgrades and have serial communication facilities, the potential for retrofitting them with secure hardware-based entropy sources exists. To this aim, very low-cost, robust, easy to deploy solutions are required. Here, a retrofittable, sub 10 $ entropy source based on chaotic dynamics is illustrated, capable of a 32 kbit/s rate or more and offering multiple <b>serial</b> communication <b>options</b> including USB, I 2 C, SPI or USART.

50|$|Virtual {{serial port}} {{emulation}} {{can be useful}} in case {{there is a lack of}} available physical serial ports or they do not meet the current requirements. For instance, virtual serial ports can share data between several applications from one GPS device connected to a <b>serial</b> port. Another <b>option</b> is to communicate with any other serial devices via internet or LAN as if they are locally connected to computer (serial over LAN/serial-over-Ethernet technology). Two computers or applications can communicate through an emulated serial port link. Virtual serial port emulators are available for many operating systems including MacOS, Linux, and various mobile and desktop versions of Microsoft Windows.|$|R
50|$|The VT101 and VT102 were cost-reduced, non-expandable {{follow-on}} versions. The VT101 {{was essentially}} a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and <b>serial</b> printer port <b>options</b> pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen {{on top of the}} normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output. The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set, ReGIS, which used custom ANSI codes to send the graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a separate graphics mode like the VT105.|$|R
5000|$|Producer Sol Lesser had {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} five Tarzan films that Edgar Rice Burroughs had optioned to an independent producer in 1928. That producer went bankrupt and the contract was thought to have lapsed. However, due to {{the wording of the}} contract the courts found in Lesser's favour and held that it was still valid. Lesser announced his own Tarzan production a few weeks into the filming of MGM's Tarzan the Ape Man. MGM paid Lesser to delay production until their film was released. [...] Tarzan the Fearless was the first of Sol Lesser's Tarzan productions. Lesser never made another <b>serial</b> with his <b>options,</b> moving to feature films instead. [...] Burroughs had assured MGM that their contract was exclusive, so the rival production was an embarrassment. However, despite their initial problems, Lesser and Burroughs became friends and later worked out a five-picture deal (at one per year).|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to propose}} and {{implement}} a control system for {{a new type of}} piezomotor with the action elements of MPA for the purpose of measuring characteristics of this piezomotor needed for its use in practice. At the beginning the text processes theoretical data needed for design the control system. The author describes the principle of piezoelectric effect and deals with issues of piezomotors, which are based on this principle. Primarily theoretical knowledge relating to the piezomotor is processed. He also describes the characteristic of microcontroller C 8051 F 015 based on processor core 8051, which is main element of whole control system. His peripherals, which are used in control system, are described more. One of the main parts of the text is design of analog board, which create sawmill course of voltage on piezocrystals of piezomotor. Images are used for description its individual parts. The circuit is controlled by digital and analog outputs of the microcontroller. Another part of the work is focused on communication between microcontroller and PC, which transmits instructions from user using the <b>serial</b> line. Further <b>options</b> of proposed application are shown and important used software components are described. Equally important is program for the microcontroller, which processes incoming messages from PC and manages its digital and analog outputs. In the next chapter is shown design of piezomotor and implementation of prototype the control system. Conclusion of work is devoted to measurement of piezomotor characteristics that shows resolution dependence on frequency, voltage amplitude and vertical pressure. The outgrowth of project, which is elaborated in this work, is the functional control system for the piezomotor with possibility of control through user application on PC. Obtained characteristics of piezomotor will be used for implementation into practice...|$|R
