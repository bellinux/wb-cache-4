The Navy's UCP {{is based on}} a design that incorporates sparse black and medium grey shapes on a light grey background. The Marines have a woodland pattern featuring light brown, olive green and dark blue shapes on a tan or light olive background. Slight colour variations have been noted. Other than a greenish flight suit and a <b>standard</b> <b>service</b> dress, the Air Forces's Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) camouflage features a variation of the six-colour desert pattern. In each service's UCP, the name of the service branch, rank, and gallantry badges are worn on the chest; insignia are worn on the shoulders with the compulsory flag-of-Pakistan patch.|$|E

500|$|While {{long range}} rifles became the {{standard}} {{weapon in the}} 1830s, armies were slow to adapt their tactics and uniforms, perhaps {{as a result of}} mainly fighting colonial wars against less well armed opponents. Not until the First Boer War of 1880/81 did a major European power meet an opponent well equipped with and well versed in the use of modern long range repeating firearms, forcing an immediate change in tactics and uniforms. Khaki-coloured uniform became <b>standard</b> <b>service</b> dress for both British and British Indian Army troops stationed in British India in 1885, and in 1896 khaki drill uniform was adopted by British Army for the service outside of Europe in general, but not until the Second Boer War, in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on khaki (officially known as [...] "drab") for Service Dress.|$|E

40|$|The {{large number}} of people on {{sickness}} and disability benefits due to mental disorders in Denmark has increased the need for improved rehabilitative services to facilitate their return to work. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the use of psychoeducation in relation to the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of a Danish job centre for individuals on sick leave with regard to relevance, elements contributing to recovery, and improvements of psychoeducation as an intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 individuals on sick leave who were at risk of having a mental disorder. The interviews were analysed using systematic text condensation inspired by Giorgi’s phenomenological analysis. The resulting core themes describing psychoeducation with respect to the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job centre included access and relevance of psychoeducation in relation to the job centre’s <b>standard</b> <b>services,</b> social support, self-care, and psychoeducation intervention. This study concludes that the informants consider psychoeducation a relevant offer to individuals on sick leave who are at risk of having a mental disorder. The relevance of the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job-centre services was considered to be low. Furthermore, psychoeducation reinforces peer support and inclusion of relatives as elements to aid recovery to a much larger extent than do the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job centre. In general, the results support the use of psychoeducation in a municipal job-centre setting as a targeted and beneficial offer to individuals on sick leave who are at risk of having a mental disorder. </p...|$|R
