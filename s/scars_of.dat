5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. The <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E

5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of {{the adult}} is developed through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect {{of the adult}} is visible before the outer surface hardens – the head, resting on the thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success for Hammer and they quickly {{announced}} that Nigel Kneale was writing a new Quatermass story for them but the script never went further than a few prelimininary discussions. Kneale did eventually write a fourth Quatermass story, broadcast as a four-part serial, titled Quatermass, by ITV television in 1979, an edited version of which was also given a limited cinema release under the title The Quatermass Conclusion. Quatermass and the Pit marked the return to directing for the cinema for Roy Ward Baker {{and he went on}} to direct such films as The Anniversary (1968), Moon Zero Two (1969), The Vampire Lovers (1970), <b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Dracula (1970), Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974) for Hammer. He also directed Asylum (1972), And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973) and The Vault of Horror (1973) for Hammer's rival, Amicus Productions.|$|E

25|$|Croydon was the {{location}} of London's main airport until the Second World War. During the war, much of central Croydon was devastated by German V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, and for many years the town bore the <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> the destruction. After the war, Heathrow Airport superseded Croydon Airport as London's main airport, and Croydon Airport quickly went into a decline, finally closing in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Culp's Hill {{became a}} prime tourist {{attraction}} after the battle. It {{was close to}} the town and, unlike most battles in open fields, it was heavily wooded and the extreme firepower took a very visible toll on the trees, some of which were completely sheared off.

25|$|Knock Murton and Kelton Fell {{bear the}} <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> mining activity, having been {{the site of}} {{extensive}} haematite workings.

A railway, the Rowrah and Kelton Fell Line, was built up the valley between the two hills, the line of which can still be traced. A further working, the Croasdale Iron Mine, operated {{to the south of}} Kelton Fell.|$|E

25|$|Periareolar: a border-line {{incision}} {{along the}} periphery of the areola, which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a mastopexy (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In periareolar emplacement, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola’s circumference. Silicone gel implants can be difficult to emplace via periareolar incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0cm) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola’s border (periphery), they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> women with light-pigment areolae; when compared to cutaneous-incision scars, the modified epithelia of the areolae are less prone to (raised) hypertrophic scars.|$|E

25|$|During {{the process}} of {{drafting}} the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains {{do not like to}} pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and this leads to the development of large strip malls, impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows the <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since not only is it neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> {{a breast}} augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E
25|$|Periareolar: an {{incision}} made {{along the}} areolar periphery (border), which provides an optimal approach when {{adjustments to the}} IMF position are required, or when a mastopexy (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In the periareolar emplacement method, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola's circumference.

Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola's border, they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> women with light-pigment areolae. Furthermore, periareolar implantation produces a greater incidence of capsular contracture, severs the milk ducts and the nerves to the nipple, thus causes the most post-operative functional problems, e.g. impeded breast feeding.|$|E
