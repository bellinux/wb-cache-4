40|$|The ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak {{requires}} an electrical power up {{to a few}} hundred MVA for a time period of 10 – 20 s. The power and energy is provided by three separate networks based on flywheel generators. In 1999, during a routine check performed on generator EZ 3, {{it was discovered that}} coupling bolts of the flywheel generator shaft were deformed. Given that the active load of the generator (~ 100 MW) in service is well below the design value of the shaft (~ 800 MW), the damages may only be explained by a torsional resonance of the <b>shaft</b> <b>line,</b> itself excited by active power transients from the converter loads.

Since torsional shaft oscillations are characterised by very low damping, torsional resonance can become dangerous even for over-dimensioned generator shafts.

For this reason energy and dynamic load resulting from machine vibrations grows. In this case cause and effect are mutually connected by feedback, that inevitably leads to occurrence of a failure. This paper presents results of investigations carried out on the basis of vibration analysis of propulsion systems installed on 207 P minesweepers.

The <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and hoop strain of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining.</b> Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> temperature reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the hoop strain increase sharply. However, the hoop strain is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining,</b> the concrete strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition. In addition, the reinforcement ratio should not be too small for the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> in frozen bedrock. And further, the fiber reinforced concrete, shrinkage-compensating concrete and low hydration heat concrete technology can also be adopted to reduce the cracks as much as possible and to avoid penetrating cracks.

The centrifugal compressor is driven via a variable speed electrical motor through a gearbox. The main characteristics of the <b>shaft</b> <b>line</b> are the following: 9 MW electrical motor running from 1250 to 1875 rpm to cover the whole operating speed range of the compressor; Gearbox with a speed ratio of 7. 035; Centrifugal compressor (back to back arrangement) from 72 to 167 bara (first stage) and from 165 to 307 bara (second stage); Low speed and high speed flexible couplings of membrane type technology.
