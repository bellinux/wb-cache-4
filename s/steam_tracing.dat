5000|$|Most large marine diesels run {{on heavy}} fuel oil (sometimes called [...] "bunker oil"), which is a thick, viscous and almost {{flameproof}} fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk {{as it is a}} waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability. This is usually accomplished by <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> on fuel lines and steam coils in fuel oil tanks. The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.|$|E
40|$|For decades, <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> {{has been}} an {{accepted}} practice in the heating of piping, vessels, and equipment. This paper presents recent product innovations such as "burn-safe" and "energy efficient" <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> products. For the many applications where <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> is applied for simple freeze protection, recently developed products which reduce the heat transfer rate and thus the energy consumption of steam tracers will be discussed. This paper will provide several <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> examples that will exhibit the use of experimental data, mathematical analysis, and FEA/CFD numerical simulation techniques...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the selection of}} maximum pipe thickness to achieve efficient thermal insulation in piping with <b>steam</b> <b>tracing</b> was developed. The bibliographical review allowed identifying the limitations of previous investigations {{with regard to the}} selection of pipe thickness in transfer systems with <b>steam</b> <b>tracing.</b> The model for calculating the overall lost heat was prepared. The procedure considers economic criteria for the selection of pipe thickness and established an optimal thickness value which guarantees a total minimum cost by establishing a balance between the expenditures resulting from heat loss and the project costs...|$|E
50|$|Electric heat tracing, heat tape or surface heating, is {{a system}} used to {{maintain}} or raise the temperature of pipes and vessels. Trace heating {{takes the form of}} an electrical heating element run in physical contact along the length of a pipe. The pipe must then be covered with thermal insulation to retain heat losses from the pipe. Heat generated by the element then maintains the temperature of the pipe. Trace heating may be used to protect pipes from freezing, to maintain a constant flow temperature in hot water systems, or to maintain process temperatures for piping that must transport substances that solidify at ambient temperatures. Electric trace heating cables are an alternative to <b>steam</b> <b>trace</b> heating where <b>steam</b> is not available or unwanted.|$|R
50|$|The {{most useful}} {{instrument}} for analyzing {{the performance of}} steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The <b>steam</b> engine indicator <b>traces</b> on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, {{which can be used}} to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines. See image of indicator diagram below (in Types of motor units section).|$|R
40|$|In the 1820 s and 1830 s, British {{industry}} faced {{a choice}} between two energy sources to fuel its expansion: water and coal. A series of water reservoir schemes were proposed to scale up the power capacity of rivers in the central manufacturing districts, but the schemes with the largest potentials were never realized. Instead, the industry veered toward steam power, fatefully linking self-sustaining growth to the combustion of coal for mechanical energy. This article presents the first inquiry into {{the fate of the}} reservoir schemes. It describes the work of Robert Thom, leading Scottish engineer, champion of water, and critic of <b>steam,</b> and <b>traces</b> the fate of several plans in Lancashire. It demonstrates that water, contrary to the dominant narrative of coal in the Industrial Revolution, was consistently the cheaper alternative. The reservoir schemes had the drawback of obliging manufacturers to coordinate their energy consumption, submit to planning, and contribute to collective funding of construction work. In an environment of free competition, this ultimately proved unfeasible. This raises questions on the perception of the role of energy in the Industrial Revolution, {{as well as of the}} prerequisites for a future transition to renewable energy sources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} basic {{considerations in}} designing a heat tracing system using either team or electrical tracing. Four basic reasons to heat trace are dealt with: water freeze protection, chemical freeze protection, viscosity maintenance, {{and maintenance of}} a fluid above its dew point. <b>Steam</b> <b>tracing</b> was the first method used for tracing and remains the most widely used. Electric tracing is widely used where close temperature control at elevated temperatures is required. The prefabricated/preinsulated bundle concept eliminates {{many of the problems}} encountered in hand fabrications. These bundles provide uniform contact between tubes, insulation that has been pre-engineered for the given purpose, and a flexible, waterproof jacket...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Reflux {{condensation}} tests examining steam condensation in a PWR {{steam generator}} (SG) were {{conducted at the}} Oregon State University (OSU) Advanced Plant Experiment (APEX) Test Facility from 2005 through 2007. The experimental data collected will provide a basis to assess <b>TRACE</b> <b>steam</b> generator modeling techniques and assist in development of improved models for condensation and steam generator thermal-hydraulics. The data collected using the APEX facility is also applied to the EPR reactor design. During a small break loss of coolant accident, reflux condensation {{may be used in}} removing the decay heat after reactor shutdown. It has been determined that the decay heat generated after shutdown can be removed by controlling the secondary side pressure to create a temperature difference...|$|R
40|$|Since {{as many as}} 40 - 60 % of a plant's {{steam traps}} may be used on steam tracer lines, it is {{essential}} to select the correct, properly sized 'traps'; to optimize the efficient removal of condensate while providing maximum heat transfer to maintain desired product temperatures and greatly reduce steam losses. Factors related to achieving uniform product temperatures and maximum heat transfer rates and energy efficiency are: 1. Types and Methods used for Steam Tracing; 2. Systematic heat balance required to achieve economic tracer lengths; 3. Maximum allowable trapping distance for specific applications 4. Data important to determine condensate loads; 5. Trap selection, sizing, good installation practices, and proper maintenance. Using an engineered approach to <b>steam</b> trapping of <b>trace</b> heating systems have resulted in stable tracer line temperatures while reducing steam consumption 10 - 50 % with minimum maintenance...|$|R
500|$|In early 1928, West Carnifax {{was sold}} to the Export Steamship Corporation for {{operation}} under their American Export Lines brand. In {{the first half of}} that year, West Carnifax was sailing in New York â€“ Mediterranean service. While near the Azores sailing from Alexandria, Egypt, to Boston in October, West Carnifax responded to an SOS from the American tanker [...] which reported being in trouble during a storm. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, when the cargo ship arrived at the specified location after <b>steaming</b> overnight, no <b>trace</b> of the crew was found; only oil slicks and a floating vegetable box were found on the surface. In October the following year, under her new name of SS Exford, the ship docked at the Soviet Black Sea port of Novorossiysk to deliver a cargo of machinery and became the first American ship to dock at a Soviet port since the end of World War I. Exford remained in Black Sea service into 1931.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of transient system {{behavior of a}} nuclear power plant is the goal of systems code calculations, and evaluation of a code's calculation accuracy is accomplished by assessment and validation against appropriate system data. These system data may be either from a running system prototype or scaled model test facility, and are comprised of the relevant phenomena during both steady state and transient conditions. The identification and characterization of the relevant data, and the assessment and validation of thermal hydraulic systems codes, has been the objective of multiple international research programs. The validation and assessment of the TRACE systems code against the Multi-Application Small Light-Water Reactor (MASLWR) natural circulation, helical coil steam generator, nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) design is a novel effort, and is the topic of the present paper. Specifically, the current work relates to the assessment and validation process of the system thermal-hydraulic TRACE code against the natural circulation database developed in the OSU-MASLWR test facility. This facility was constructed at Oregon State University under a Department of Energy grant in order to examine the natural circulation phenomena of importance to the MASLWR reactor design, which includes an integrated helical coil steam generator. This paper illustrates a preliminary sensitivity analysis to evaluate the fidelity of various methods to model the OSU-MASLWR <b>steam</b> generator in <b>TRACE.</b> The results of these analyses show that oscillations observed in a previous study by Mascari (2008) are related to the particular steam generator nodalization used. The SNAP animation model capability is used to show a direct visualization of selected calculated data...|$|R
