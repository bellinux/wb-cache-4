40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) The graduate {{project is}} a three dimensional virtual reality game which uses user motion tracking for input and stereoscopic vision for display. The game created is a searching game where keyboard and user head movements are used for input. The <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>glasses</b> that the user wears are tracked to calculate head movement. The user can choose between controlling the avatar's movement with head movements or controlling the first person view with head movements. The graphics are rendered using the Ogre Graphics Engine. The motion tracking is calculated using the OpenCV library with a web-camera. Nvidia 3 D Vision for stereoscopic vision was used with the project. This paper will discuss the motion tracking, stereoscopic display, and the Ogre Engine used in the project. The design {{and implementation of the}} project is described and evaluated.

40|$|Objective: Stereoscopic vision display {{technology}} {{has been shown to}} be a useful tool in image-guided surgical interventions. However, the concept has not been applied to 3 -dimensional echocardiography-guided cardiac procedures. We evaluated stereo-scopic vision display as an aid for intracardiac navigation during 3 -dimensional echo-cardiography-guided beating-heart surgery in a model of atrial septal defect closure. Methods: An atrial septal defect (6 mm) was created in 6 pigs using 3 -dimensional echocardiography guidance. The defect was then closed using a catheter-based patch delivery system, and the patch was attached with tissue mini-anchors. Stereoscopic vision was generated with a high-performance volume renderer with <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Three-dimensional echocardiography with stereoscopic vision display was compared with 3 -dimensional echocardiography with standard display for guidance of surgical repair. Task performance measures for each anchor placement (N 5 32 per group) were completion time, trajectory of the tip of the anchor deployment device, and accuracy of the anchor placement. Results: The mean time of the anchor deployment for stereoscopic vision displa...|$|E
40|$|We present four {{models for}} {{describing}} a 3 -D vision. Similar {{to the mirror}} scenario, our models allow 3 -D vision with no need for additional accessories such as <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>glasses</b> or a hologram film. These four models are based on brain interpretation rather than pure objective encryption. We consider the observer âsubjectiveâ selection of a measuring device and the corresponding quantum collapse {{into one of his}} selected states, as a tool for interpreting reality in according to the observer concepts. This is the basic concept of our study and it is introduced in the first model. Other models suggests âsoftenâ versions that might be much easier to implement. Our quantum interpretation approach contribute to the following fields. In technology the proposed models can be implemented into real devices, allowing 3 -D vision without additional accessories. Artificial intelligence: In the desire to create a machine that exchange information by using human terminologies, our interpretation approach seems to be appropriate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{insights}} into how virtual 3 -D visual display systems contributed to cross-functional team collaboration in a product conceptual design review environment. During this empirical testing, three commercially available 3 -D display systems [Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), Binocular Ommi-Orientation Monitor (BOOM), and <b>stereoscopic</b> shutter <b>glasses</b> with monitor] were compared to a traditional monoscopic (2 -D) monitor system. The design task was to evaluate a new concept for armored vehicle refueling. Test results and analysis indicated that some virtual environment (VE) technologies provided significant advantages during certain phases of the review process, but no single device fully satisfied all individual and team needs. The primary conclusion reached was that while VE technologies have a potential to reduce product development time and life cycle costs, a phased approach using VE devices supported by face-to-face team member interaction is recomme [...] ...|$|R

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the teratogenic potential of chloramphenicol to induce cleft palate in rats. Material and methods: 10 female Wistar rats were used to perform the mating, allocated into two groups: G 1 – 5 female rats received 0. 5 mg/kg of sodium chloride intramuscularly from the 14 th to the 17 th day of pregnancy (control); G 2 – 5 female rats received 0. 5 mg/kg of chloramphenicol intramuscularly from the 14 th to the 17 th day of pregnancy.

40|$|For 3 D display systems, {{detection}} and tracking of the observer’s view point {{is necessary to}} render the correct view according to the observer position. In this paper, we present a new real-time view point tracking system using a single web cam.

40|$|International audienceUser's {{perception}} of product, by essence subjective, {{is a major}} topic in marketing and industrial design. Many methods, based on users' tests, are used so as to characterise this perception. We are interested in three main methods: multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, and preference mapping. These methods are used to built a perceptual space, in order to position the new product, to specify requirements by the study of user's preferences, to evaluate some product attributes, related in particular to style (aesthetic). These {{early stages of the}} design are primordial for a good orientation of the project. In parallel, virtual reality tools and interfaces are more and more efficient for suggesting to the user complex feelings, and creating in this way various levels of perceptions. In this article, we present on an example the use of multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method and preference mapping for the subjective assessment of virtual products. These products, which geometrical form is variable, are defined with a CAD model and are proposed to the user with a spacemouse and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Advantages and limitations of such evaluation is next discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{delight in}} using our eyes, {{particularly}} when puzzling over pictures. Art and illusionists {{is a celebration}} of pictures and the multiple modes of manipulating them to produce illusory worlds on flat surfaces. This has proved fascinating to humankind since the dawning of depiction. Art and illusionists is also {{a celebration of the}} ways we see pictures, and of our ability to distil meaning from arrays of contours and colours. Pictures are not only a source of fascination for artists, who produce them, but also for scientists, who analyse the perceptual effects they induce. Illusions provide the glue to cement the art and science of vision. Painters plumb the art of observation itself whereas scientists peer into the processes of perception. Both visual artists and scientists have produced patterns that perplex our perceptions and present us with puzzles that we are pleased to peruse. Art and illusionists presents these two poles of pictorial representation as well as presenting novel ‘perceptual portraits’ of the artists and scientists who have augmented the art of illusion.
