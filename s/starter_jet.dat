50|$|Entering the 2006 season, Pennington {{trained with}} new {{throwing}} coaches, and worked significantly {{on the strength}} of his torso and throwing mechanics. During training camp, new head coach Eric Mangini told players and the press that the quarterback position was still uncertain, and that all four Jets quarterbacks (Chad Pennington, Patrick Ramsey, Brooks Bollinger, and Kellen Clemens) had a chance to be the <b>starter.</b> The <b>Jets</b> medical staff limited Pennington's throws {{to ensure the safety of}} his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|After {{three seasons}} with quarterback Boomer Esiason as the <b>starter,</b> the <b>Jets</b> {{decided to go}} in a {{different}} direction and released Esiason in the offseason. They signed Neil O'Donnell, who had just led the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl, to replace him in the hopes he would duplicate his success with the Steelers. The Jets received the first pick in the NFL draft in April and drafted wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson out of the University of Southern California. The Jets also signed offensive tackles Jumbo Elliott and David Williams and receivers Jeff Graham and Webster Slaughter. The Jets spent $70 million in the offseason on free-agent and rookie contracts.|$|R
50|$|Hennessy {{was drafted}} by the New York Jets in the 10th round (256th overall pick) of the 1977 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1977, he {{appeared}} in 14 games (two as a <b>starter)</b> for the <b>Jets.</b> The following year, he was a starter at linebacker in all 16 regular season games for the 1978 New York Jets. In 1979, he again appeared in all 16 games for the Jets, though none as a starter.|$|R
50|$|On March 11, 2015, Fitzpatrick {{was traded}} by the Houston Texans to the New York Jets for a late-round {{conditional}} draft {{pick in the}} 2015 NFL Draft. The move reunited Fitzpatrick with his former Head Coach Chan Gailey, who was hired during the off-season as the Jets offensive coordinator and play-caller. Following an incident in the locker room, where starting quarterback Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw after being attacked by IK Enemkpali, Fitzpatrick was tentatively named the Week 1 <b>starter</b> for the <b>Jets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Taylor was {{selected}} by the New York Jets in the 1st round (20th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft. [...] During the 1972 New York Jets season, Taylor appeared as a linebacker in 14 games, five as a starter, and had one interception. [...] In 1973, Taylor appeared in eight games, three as a <b>starter,</b> for the <b>Jets.</b> [...] In May 1974, Taylor signed a multi-year contract with the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League. The Wheels' head coach, Dan Boisture, said Taylor would be [...] "the focal point of our defense." ...|$|R
40|$|Observation of upward {{electrical}} discharges from thunderstorms {{has been}} sporadically {{reported in the}} scientific literature. According to their terminal altitudes, they are classified as starters (20 – 30 km), jets (40 – 50 km) and gigantic jets (70 – 90 km). They not only {{have a significant impact}} on the occupied atmospheric volumes but also electrically couple different atmospheric regions. However, as they are rare and unpredictable, our knowledge of them has been built on observations that typically record only one type of such discharges. Here we report a close-distance observation of seven upward discharges including one <b>starter,</b> two <b>jets</b> and four gigantic jets above Tropical Depression Dorian. Our optical and electromagnetic data indicate that all events are of negative polarity, suggesting they are initiated in the same thundercloud charge region. The data also indicate that the lightning-like discharge channel can extend above thunderclouds by about 30 km, but the discharge does not emit low-frequency electromagnetic radiation as normal lightning...|$|R
50|$|The Titans {{finished}} the 2008 regular {{season with a}} record of 13-3, top seed in the playoffs, and a first round bye. In the divisional round they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 13-10. A last minute field goal by Matt Stover won the game for the Ravens. Collins indicated after the season {{that he would like to}} play in 2009, but only as a <b>starter.</b> Collins replaced <b>Jets</b> quarterback Brett Favre in the 2009 Pro Bowl, after first alternate Philip Rivers pulled out. He re-signed with the Titans on February 27, 2009. His new contract was worth $15 million, with $8.5 million guaranteed over two years.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Boxer engines {{were used}} as a starter motor for the first German jet engines to power up the engine at {{cranking}} speed. The two-cylinder two-stroke flat engine was developed by Norbert Riedel ("Riedel starter"), had a cylinder capacity of 270 cc and a power of 8 kW (10.5 hp) at 7150 rpm and essentially functioned as a pioneering example of an APU for starting a jet engine. It was an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit in {{the hub of the}} turbine compressor and started electrically or with a pull starter. The engine was produced by the Victoria works in Nuremberg and served as a <b>starter</b> for the <b>jet</b> engines Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003.|$|R
25|$|The Jets {{opened the}} season with a match-up against the Miami Dolphins. Revis, the {{established}} <b>starter,</b> intercepted former <b>Jet</b> Chad Pennington's pass in the end zone with five seconds remaining in the game to preserve the Jets' 20–14 victory. A week later, Revis held Patriots wide receiver Randy Moss to two catches for 22 yards. Mangini praised Revis' attention to detail and perfecting the flaws of his game. Revis was beaten by Chris Chambers for a 27-yard touchdown during the Jets' week three contest against the San Diego Chargers—he recorded two tackles in the loss to San Diego. The following week, the Jets faced the Arizona Cardinals with wide receivers Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin. He intercepted two Kurt Warner passes, one of which he returned 32 yards for a touchdown, the first of his NFL career.|$|R
5000|$|Mirer {{requested}} {{to be released}} by the Bears {{in the beginning of}} the 1998 season, and signed with the Green Bay Packers. [...] Mirer never played a down for Green Bay, which was led by Brett Favre, and was later traded to the New York Jets in 1999 where he replaced an injured Vinny Testaverde as the <b>Jets</b> <b>starter..</b> In 2000, he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers to compete with Jeff Garcia. In 2002, Mirer became the a backup for the Oakland Raiders, and became the starter for part of 2003. In 2004. Mirer was signed by the Detroit Lions, but saw no playing time. Mirer had a 63.5 passer rating, 11,969 passing yards, and 50 touchdown passes before he retired in 2004. Although playing for several teams that did make the playoffs during his career, Mirer never played a single down in the postseason.|$|R
50|$|The Patriots {{home opener}} came against an injury-shot Jets squad. Chad Pennington {{had been injured}} in preseason and former <b>Jets</b> <b>starter</b> Vinny Testaverde had to take over; it was the future Patriot's first game against New England since a 44-7 {{slaughter}} by the Pats in September 2002. The Jets running game had been shut down in that 2002 matchup and it didn't do much better this time around, totalling just 65 yards, 53 of them from former Patriot Curtis Martin. Kevin Faulk and Antowain Smith rushed for 134 yards and Tom Brady threw for 181 yards, but until the final five minutes {{of the third quarter}} it was a battle of field goals - tied at 9 until Brady ran in a one-yard score. At the start of the fourth rookie Asante Samuel picked off Testaverde and ran back a 55-yard touchdown. Vinny did connect with Wayne Chrebet two minutes later, but the remaining thirteen minutes went scoreless as the Patriots took the win 23-16.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Croyle {{started the}} Chiefs' opening {{game against the}} New England Patriots, but {{suffered}} a shoulder injury. Huard played {{for the remainder of}} the game and started the team's Week 2 matchup against the Oakland Raiders. Huard was injured in the game and replaced by Tyler Thigpen. Thigpen was the third Chiefs starting quarterback in the 2008 season. The Chiefs prepared Croyle throughout their bye week in order to return in Week 7 against the Tennessee Titans. Croyle suffered a season-ending knee injury in the game, and when Huard substituted, he suffered a thumb injury leading to Thigpen finishing the game at quarterback. After the game, it was confirmed that both Croyle and Huard were placed on injured reserve, and Thigpen was announced as the <b>starter</b> against the <b>Jets</b> in Week 8. The Chiefs signed both Ingle Martin and Quinn Gray to replace both Croyle and Huard on the depth chart. Thigpen started the remaining ten games of the season, but the Chiefs finished with a franchise-worst 2 - 14 record and continued to lack stability at the QB position under head coach Herman Edwards.|$|R
50|$|Lee Roy Selmon {{was held}} {{ineffective}} by Oilers tackle Leon Gray. Behind the blocking of Gray and tight end Dave Casper, Earl Campbell rushed for 203 yards. Coach McKay singled out rookie linebacker Scot Brantley for praise, {{but for the}} most part the Buccaneers' play was marked by missed tackles and mental errors. The receiving corps was especially prone to errors, with receivers frequently running wrong routes or being penalized for illegal formation or pass interference. The poor play of the receivers contributed to the coaching staff's decision to sign a receiver. Their first choice was Gerald Carter, who had been one of the last training camp cuts, but Carter had to clear recall waivers and was claimed by the New York Jets. San Francisco 49ers and ex-FSU receiver Mike Shumann was signed instead. The Buccaneers had to play many inexperienced players, with rookie Andy Hawkins taking Dave Lewis' place, all of the regular interior offensive linemen injured, and guard Ray Snell too ill to start. Two starters on the line, center Jim Leonard and left guard George Yarno, had a combined 1 year of NFL experience between them. Right guard Greg Roberts' place was taken by former <b>Jets</b> <b>starter</b> Darrell Austin, who had caused Roberts' knee injury by falling on him. Austin had no starting experience with the Buccaneers.|$|R
5000|$|On November 6, 2016, in a Week 9 {{game against}} the Jets' AFC East divisional rival Miami Dolphins, Petty saw his first regular season action in relief of <b>Jets</b> <b>starter</b> Ryan Fitzpatrick, who was injured {{in the third quarter}} of the game. Petty {{completed}} two passes for 19 yards in his one drive before Fitzpatrick returned. The Jets lost the game by a score of 27-23. Due to Fitzpatrick's injury in the previous game, Petty started for the Jets just a week later against the Rams, where he completed 21-of-34 passes for 163 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. The interception came on the last drive, resulting in a loss for the Jets. In a Monday Night Football game on December 5 against the Indianapolis Colts, Petty replaced the benched Fitzpatrick for the second half of the game with the Jets down 24-3 to the Colts. Petty went 11-for-25 in passing, totaling 135 yards, which included one touchdown pass and two interceptions in a 41-10 loss. On December 6, he was named the starter for the final four games of the season. After the game, Jets head coach Todd Bowles said, [...] "The plan was for us to start him the last four games anyway, so we just started a half early." [...] In Week 14 of the 2016 season, Petty notched his first career win as a starter, throwing for a career-high 257 yards as he helped lead the Jets to an 23-17 overtime victory after trailing the San Francisco 49ers 17-3 at halftime. In his third game as a starter, he helped the Jets keep the game close against the Miami Dolphins in the first half with the Dolphins only having a 13-10 lead. However, in the second half, a lousy effort by the Jets defense led to three touchdowns in four minutes by the Dolphins spoiled Petty's contributions, eventually leading to a 34-13 loss. On Christmas Eve against the Patriots, he injured his left shoulder in the second quarter after tackling cornerback Malcolm Butler after he recovered a fumble by running back Khiry Robinson in a 41-3 blowout loss. Two days later on December 26, he was placed on injured reserve, ending his season.|$|R
