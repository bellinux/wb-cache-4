The game was announced and shown at the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition on November 1–3, 1974, for release that month. It was then advertised in the December 7 issue of Cash Box.|$|E

2500|$|Additional {{fire and}} rescue {{from the town}} of Phuket arrived 30 minutes later.

Additionally, the Airport failed to include [...] "Crash on Airport" [...] procedures in its air <b>service</b> <b>manual</b> as required by ICAO, so the highly skilled and trained rescuers within Thailand were never contacted. The only passengers who exited the aircraft alive did so of their own accord. These inadequate materials and delays may have had a negative impact on passengers who initially survived the crash.

2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory head bolt torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets.

However, owing to the lack of a recall or appropriate service bulletin, the head gasket problem would recur in another 75,000 miles or so if the gasket was replaced and the bolts were retorqued to the erroneous <b>service</b> <b>manual</b> specifications of [...] With the head bolts torqued correctly, the engines were otherwise extremely durable.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{shortsighted}} Congressional penny-pinching, {{very few}} live-fire {{trials of the}} torpedo or exploder were ever done, and those only in top secrecy. The goal of most exercise firings {{was to get the}} torpedo to run under the target, after which it was assumed the magnetic influence feature would do the work. This misplaced trust in the magnetic exploder helped mask the depth problems encountered by early torpedoes, for if the exploder were to work properly a depth error of a few feet would not matter. Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt offered the hulk of [...] , but prohibited the use of a live warhead, and insisted BuOrd pay the cost of refloating her if she was hit in error.

Inexplicably, no live fire trials were ever done with production units. Chief of Naval Operations William V.
