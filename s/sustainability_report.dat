40|$|Recent {{growth in}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> has been {{followed}} by growth in <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance. Although <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> and its assurance are both still voluntary in many countries around the world, like New Zealand, several organisations have already disclosed <b>sustainability</b> <b>reports</b> publicly and also engaged in the assurance process. The aim of this research project is to explore {{the current state of}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance in New Zealand listed companies. The intention is to discover the motivations for, and barriers to, assurance engagement; identify the preferred assurers; and introduce the influential factors for improving the quality of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance statements. Mono and multiple methods are implemented in this exploratory research. The research design is divided into four sequential phases. The first phase considers information about the current status of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance. The second phase analyses <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance statements published by companies listed on NZX through content analysis. The last two phases investigate sustainability managers’ and sustainability assurers’ viewpoints about several aspects of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance through one-on-one online semi-structured interviews. Using agency theory, signalling theory and stakeholder theory, this research provides insights into motivations for, and barriers to, <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance engagement from the perspectives of the sustainability assurers and two groups of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations – those that have not yet engaged, and those that have already engaged, in the assurance process. The results highlight the characteristics of the preferred sustainability assurers. This research also identifies that while the quality of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance statements is increasing, there is still considerable room for improvement. iv A number of potential limitations including subjectivity apply to this research which uses a qualitative approach on a small population of New Zealand listed companies. Despite these limitations, this research still provides some valid insights about <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance in a voluntary environment. In particular, this research extends previous studies to add to <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance knowledge by collating the results of several data gathering and data analysis techniques, which examine that area comprehensively. This research provides broader insights into the terms of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance since it considers all types of internal and external sustainability assurance as well as two groups of reporting organisations. The findings of this research will practically benefit organisations; sustainability assurers; New Zealand authorities, legislators and standard setters; and other stakeholders by introducing the characteristics of best practice for <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> assurance in a voluntary <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> and assurance environment...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} increase in the publication of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reports</b> in the corporate world in the last decade, <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> in higher education institutions is still in its early stages. This study’s aim was to explore the relationship between <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> and organizational change management for sustainability in higher education. A survey was sent to higher education institutions worldwide that have published <b>sustainability</b> <b>reports</b> in the last ten years.

The findings showed that <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> has been predominantly driven by internal motivations, and that the <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> process leads to incremental changes, such as an increase in awareness of sustainability and improvements in communication with internal stakeholders. Some factors impeding change are the absence of an external stakeholder engagement process, the lack of inclusion of material impacts in reports, and the lack of institutionalization of <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> in the higher education system.
