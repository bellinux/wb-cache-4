The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether there is a relationship between the wearing of tinted <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> and personality type in physically healthy subjects. The Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire 5 th Edition, a multidimensional standardized self-report inventory, was used to determine the personality type of 98 participants. Twenty currently wore tinted <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> for reasons other than ocular disease, sun protection, outdoor or indoor glare reduction, pattern sensitive epilepsy, migraines, reading difficulties or fashion. The remainder did not wear tinted <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> for any purpose other than sun protection. Tinted lens wear and no tinted lens wear groups were age and gender matched. There was no statistically significant difference in five global personality factors between the no-tint and tint groups: extraversion (p = 0. 31), anxiety (p = 0. 75), tough-mindedness (p = 0. 96), independence (p = 0. 63), and self-control (p = 0. 87). This suggests that the use of tinted lenses by physically healthy people is unlikely to be an indicator of personality type. © 2007 The Author...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} different interventions {{to slow down the}} progression of myopia in children. MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials. gov from inception to August 2014. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions for controlling the progression of myopia in children with a treatment duration of at least 1 year for analysis. Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcomes were mean annual change in refraction (diopters/year) and mean annual change in axial length (millimeters/year). ResultsThirty RCTs (involving 5422 eyes) were identified. Network meta-analysis showed that in comparison with placebo or single vision <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses,</b> high-dose atropine (refraction change: 0. 68 [0. 52 – 0. 84]; axial length change: − 0. 21 [− 0. 28 to − 0. 16]), moderate-dose atropine (refraction change: 0. 53 [0. 28 – 0. 77]; axial length change: − 0. 21 [− 0. 32 to − 0. 12]), and low-dose atropine (refraction change: 0. 53 [0. 21 – 0. 85]; axial length change: − 0. 15 [− 0. 25 to − 0. 05]) markedly slowed myopia progression. Pirenzepine (refraction change: 0. 29 [0. 05 – 0. 52]; axial length change: − 0. 09 [− 0. 17 to − 0. 01]), orthokeratology (axial length change: − 0. 15 [− 0. 22 to − 0. 08]), and peripheral defocus modifying contact lenses (axial length change: − 0. 11 [− 0. 20 to − 0. 03]) showed moderate effects. Progressive addition <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> (refraction change: 0. 14 [0. 02 – 0. 26]; axial length change: − 0. 04 [− 0. 09 to − 0. 01]) showed slight effects. ConclusionsThis network analysis indicates that a range of interventions can significantly reduce myopia progression when compared with single vision <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> or placebo. In terms of refraction, atropine, pirenzepine, and progressive addition <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> were effective. In terms of axial length, atropine, orthokeratology, peripheral defocus modifying contact lenses, pirenzepine, and progressive addition <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> were effective. The most effective interventions were pharmacologic, that is, muscarinic antagonists such as atropine and pirenzepine. Certain specially designed contact lenses, including orthokeratology and peripheral defocus modifying contact lenses, had moderate effects, whereas specially designed <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> showed minimal effect...|$|R

50|$|Base curve radius, {{or simply}} base curve, {{abbreviated}} BCR or BC, {{is the measure}} of one important parameter of a lens in optometry. On a <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens,</b> it is the flatter curvature of the front surface. On a contact lens it is the curvature of the back surface and is {{sometimes referred to as}} the back central optic radius (abbreviated BCOR). Typical values for a contact lens are from 8.0 to 10.0 mm. The base curve is the radius of the sphere {{of the back of the}} lens that the prescription describes (the lower the number, the steeper the curve of the cornea and the lens, the higher the number, the flatter the curve of the cornea and the lens). This number is important in order to allow the contact lens to fit well to the wearer's cornea for comfort, to facilitate tear exchange, and to allow oxygen transmission.|$|E

Methods Experiment 1 : The relative changes in phototoxicity, scotopic sensitivity, and melatonin suppression of five blue-light filtering plano <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> were calculated based on their spectral transmittances measured by a spectrophotometer. Experiment 2 : A pseudo-randomized controlled {{study was conducted to}} {{evaluate the}} clinical performance of two bluelight filtering <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> (BF: blue-filtering anti-reflection coating; BT: brown-tinted) with a regular clear lens (AR) serving as a control. A total of eighty computer users were recruited from two age cohorts (young adults: 18 - 30 yrs, middle-aged adults: 40 - 55 yrs). Contrast sensitivity under standard and glare conditions, and colour discrimination were measured using standard clinical tests. After one month of lens wear, subjective ratings of lens performance were collected by questionnaire. Results All tested blue-light filtering <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> theoretically reduced the calculated phototoxicity by 10. 6 % to 23. 6 %. Although use of the blue-light filters also decreased scotopic sensitivity by 2. 4 % to 9. 6 %, and melatonin suppression by 5. 8 % to 15. 0 %, over 70 % of the participants could not detect these optical changes. Our clinical tests revealed no significant decrease in contrast sensitivity either with (95 % confidence intervals [CI]: AR-BT [- 0. 05, 0. 05]; AR-BF [- 0. 05, 0. 06]; BT-BF [- 0. 06, 0. 06]) or without glare (95 % CI: AR-BT [- 0. 01, 0. 03]; AR-BF [- 0. 01, 0. 03]; BT-BF [- 0. 02, 0. 02]) and colour discrimination (95 % CI: AR-BT [- 9. 07, 1. 02]; AR-BF [- 7. 06, 4. 46]; BT-BF [- 3. 12, 8. 57]). Conclusion Blue-light filtering <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> can partially filter high-energy short-wavelength light without substantially degrading visual performance and sleep quality.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that ultraviolet radiation in sunlight may cause cataracts and other eye disease. We evaluated the effect of prescription eyewear in attenuating ocular exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the sunlight portions of the ultraviolet spectrum (295 - 350 nm). Using natural sunlight as the source, the attenuation was measured with two ultraviolet detectors, one sensitive to only UVB (295 - 315 nm) and one sensitive to both UVA and UVB (295 - 350 nm). A random sample of <b>spectacles,</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses,</b> and contact lenses was examined. The average transmission, as measured with either detector, was highest for soft contact lenses, followed by glass <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses,</b> untinted hard contact <b>lenses,</b> and plastic <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses.</b> Measurements performed with mannikins wearing spectacles showed that an average of 6. 6 per cent of incident radiation reached the eye even when the lenses were covered with black opaque tape. The amount of exposure was increased substantially when the spectacles were moved 0. 6 cm away from the forehead. The results show that the protection against ultraviolet exposure provided by prescription eyewear is highly variable and depends largely on its composition, size, and wearing position...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{way to treat}} forms of aniseikonia, {{including}} macropsia, is {{through the use of}} auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{recently}} demonstrated that chromaticity could affect eye growth and refractive development in guinea pigs but it remained unclear whether correction with <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> could balance these effects and how retinal responses change with different spectral compositions of light. Three illumination conditions were tested: blue, {{red and white}} light. Animals were raised without or with monocular <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> from three to seven weeks of age. Luminance electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded to explore retinal responses with the different spectral compositions. In our special colony of pigmented guinea pigs, characterized by residual hyperopia, spontaneous myopia and poor emmetropization, red light induced early thinning of the choroid and relative myopia, compared to white light. Effects of red light could not be suppressed if positive <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> were worn. ERGs showed that red light failed to elicit robust retinal responses. Blue light inhibited axial eye growth, even when animals were reared with negative lenses. Intensity-matched blue and white light elicited similar a-waves but different b-waves, suggesting that the wavelength of light affects visual control of eye growth through different processing in the inner retina. We hypothesize that blue light might stimulate preferentially the ON pathway to inhibit myopia induced by negative lenses, at least in guinea pigs...|$|R
40|$|Third order (primary) {{aberration}} {{theory has}} had little application {{to the design of}} aspheric <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses.</b> Such an application would be useful because: 1. Third order theory is useful in designing simple optical systems, as relatively simple equations can be used to obtain approximate magnitudes of aberrations and to show how these aberrations change with variations in design parameters without recourse to a large mass of data. 2. Asperising one or both surfaces of <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses</b> allows the correction of off-axis power errors in high positive power lenses where this would be otherwise impossible, and enables other factors, such as distortion correction, to be considered simultaneously with off-axis power error correction over the total range of lens powers. Third order formulae are developed for calculation of distortion in thin <b>spectacle</b> <b>lenses,</b> when one or both surfaces are conicoid aspherics. Results are presented which show the validity of using third order theory. Solutions which allow correction of rotatory or peripheral distortion, when one lens surface is a conicoid aspheric, are illustrated. A study of these solutions shows that one of the off-axis power errors (eg. oblique astigmatism) and one of the distortions can be simultaneously eliminated, but the lens forms required are too curved to be cosmetically feasible...|$|R

40|$|Minor {{differences}} in colour perception between pseudophakic, phakic, and spectacle aphakic eyes {{were identified by}} the Pickford-Nicholson anomaloscope and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test. The results suggest that pseudophakic eyes are more sensitive to red and less sensitive to blue than aphakic eyes corrected with spectacles. Spectrophotometer measurements reveal that the Rayner-Pearce posterior chamber intraocular lens {{used in this study}} transmits an evenly balanced colour spectrum, whereas an aphakic <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> exhibits significant colour distortion, reducing the red and enhancing the blue transmission. This distortion may possibly be attributed to the increased chromatic aberration in the <b>spectacle</b> <b>lens</b> compared with the intraocular lens...|$|E
