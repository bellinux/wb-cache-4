40|$|Improving {{the quality}} factor of the {{mechanical}} oscillations of micron <b>scale</b> <b>beams</b> in a viscous fluid, such as water, is an open challenge of direct relevance {{to the development of}} future technologies. We study the stochastic dynamics of doubly-clamped micron <b>scale</b> <b>beams</b> in a viscous fluid driven by Brownian mo-tion. We use a thermodynamic approach to compute the equilibrium fluctua-tions in beam displacement that requires only deterministic calculations. From calculations of the autocorrelations and noise spectra we quantify the beam dy-namics by the quality factor and resonant frequency of the fundamental flexural mode over a range of experimentally accessible geometries. We carefully study the effects of the grid resolution, domain size, linear response, and time-step for the numerical simulations. We consider beams with uniform rectangular cross-section and explore the increased quality factor and resonant frequency as a baseline geometry is varied by increasing the width, increasing the thickness, and decreasing the length. The quality factor is nearly doubled by tripling ei-ther the width or the height of the beam. Much larger improvements are found by decreasing the beam length, however this is limited by the appearance of additional modes of dissipation. Overall, the stochastic dynamics of the wider and thicker beams are well predicted by a two-dimensional approximate theory beyond what may be expected based upon the underlying assumptions, whereas the shorter beams require a more detailed analysis.

40|$|We {{study the}} scaling of {{two-dimensional}} crack roughness using large <b>scale</b> <b>beam</b> lattice systems. Our {{results indicate that}} the crack roughness obtained using beam lattice systems does not exhibit anomalous scaling {{in sharp contrast to the}} simulation results obtained using scalar fuse lattices. The local and global roughness exponents (ζ_loc and ζ, respectively) are equal to each other, and the two-dimensional crack roughness exponent is estimated to be ζ_loc = ζ = 0. 64 ± 0. 02. Removal of overhangs (jumps) in the crack profiles eliminates even the minute differences between the local and global roughness exponents. Furthermore, removing these jumps in the crack profile completely eliminates the multiscaling observed in other studies. We find that the probability density distribution p(Δ h(ℓ)) of the height differences Δ h(ℓ) = [h(x+ℓ) - h(x) ] of the crack profile obtained after removing the jumps in the profiles follows a Gaussian distribution even for small window sizes (ℓ).
