A magnetic field-induced electric polarization (P⃗) and a finite magnetocapacitance (MC) is observed {{at the onset}} of the magnetically ordered state (T_c = 59 K). Both P⃗ and MC are explored in considerable detail as a function of temperature (T), applied field H⃗_a, and relative field orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes. The magnetodielectric data show a number of anomalies which signal magnetic phase transitions, and allow to map out the phase diagram of the system in the H_a-T plane. Below the 3 up- 1 down collinear ferrimagnetic phase, we find two additional magnetic phases. We demonstrate that these are related to the field-driven evolution of a long-period helical phase, which is stabilized by the chiral Dzyalozinskii-Moriya term D M⃗·(∇×M⃗) that is present in this non-centrosymmetric compound. We also present a phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg theory for the ME_H effect, which is in excellent agreement with experimental data, and shows three novel features: (i) the polarization P⃗ has a uniform as well as a long-wavelength spatial component that is given by the pitch of the magnetic helices, (ii) the uniform component of P⃗ points along the vector (H^yH^z, H^zH^x, H^xH^y), and (iii) its strength is proportional to η_∥^ 2 -η_^ 2 / 2, where η_∥ is the longitudinal and η_ is the transverse (and <b>spiraling)</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic ordering.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a spiral arterial blood flow pattern in humans has been widely accepted. It is believed that this <b>spiral</b> <b>component</b> of the blood flow alters arterial haemodynamics in {{both positive and negative}} ways. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of spiral flow on haemodynamic changes in aorta–renal bifurcations. In this regard, a computational fluid dynamics analysis of pulsatile blood flow was performed in two idealised models of aorta–renal bifurcations with and without flow diverter. The results show that the spirality effect causes a substantial variation in blood velocity distribution, while causing only slight changes in fluid shear stress patterns. The dominant observed effect of spiral flow is on turbulent kinetic energy and flow recirculation zones. As spiral flow intensity increases, the rate of turbulent kinetic energy production decreases, reducing the region of potential damage to red blood cells and endothelial cells. Furthermore, the recirculation zones which form on the cranial sides of the aorta and renal artery shrink in size in the {{presence of}} spirality effect; this may lower the rate of atherosclerosis development and progression in the aorta–renal bifurcation. These results indicate that the spiral nature of blood flow has atheroprotective effects in renal arteries and should be taken into consideration in analyses of the aorta and renal arteries. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Mixed {{morphology}} pairs offer a simplification of {{the interaction}} equation that involves a gas-rich fast rotator paired with a gas-poor slow rotator. In past low resolution IRAS studies {{it was assumed that}} the bulk of the far infrared emission originated in the <b>spiral</b> <b>component.</b> However our ISO studies revealed a surprising number of early-type components with significant IR emission some of which turned out to show active nuclei. This motivated us to look at the current statistics of active nuclei in mixed pairs using the FIR-radio continuum correlation as a diagnostic. We find a clear excess of early-type components with radio continuum emission and an active nucleus. We suggest that they arise more often in mixed pairs via cross fueling of gas from the spiral companion. This fuel is more efficiently channeled into the nucleus of the slow rotating receptor. In a sample of 112 mixed-morphology pairs from the Karachentsev catalog we find that about 25 - 30 % of detected mixed pairs show a displacement from the radio-FIR relation defined by normal star forming galaxies. The latter objects show excess radio continuum emission while others extend the relation to unusually high radio and FIR flux levels.

50|$|Instead of an {{electrostatic}} field {{we can also}} use a magnetic field to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion, and to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest magnetic lens is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil, and gets weaker as we move away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an electrostatic lens, the paths in a magnetic lens contain a <b>spiraling</b> <b>component,</b> i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a magnetic lens is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an electrostatic lens. The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other magnetically soft material) magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties, and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses.|$|R

In AM 0500 - 620, the slope of the fractal perimeter-scale relation steepens systematically from low to high extinction. In AM 1316 - 241, we cannot determine a unique fractal dimension from the defining area-perimeter relation, so the projected dust distribution is best defined as fractal-like. In neither galaxy do we see regions even on single-pixel scales in spiral arms with AB > 2. 5. The measurements in NGC 1275 are compromised by our lack of independent knowledge of the foreground system's light distribution, but masked sampling of the absorption suggests an effective reddening curve much flatter than the Milky Way mean (perhaps indicating that the foreground system has been affected by immersion in the hot intracluster gas) ...|$|E

A rich sequence of magnetic transitions are examined by measuring temperature and field-dependent magnetization and diffused neutron scattering (DNS) using polarized neutron at different temperatures. While paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition is enhanced from 97 K in bulk to 99 K at 0. 5 kOe field, followed by a decrease in lock-in-transition (TL) from 15 K in bulk to 8 K, spiral ordering temperature does not show a significant change. A strong disagreement between paramagnetic moment obtained from the fitting of χ- 1 = (T/C) + (1 /χo) - (b/T - θ) and ferrimagnetic moment obtained from the M versus H loop taken at 2 K, nonsaturated magnetization at 50 - 100 kOe field, two order of magnitude higher coercivity (Hc), and splitting of ac susceptibly confirm the core-shell structure of the particles. Furthermore, a magnetic scattering analysis clearly shows that while the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition is continuous, the spiral ordering is sharp, short range, and commensurate in contrast to incommensurate spiral order observed single crystal of CoCr 2 O 4...|$|E
40|$|We perform {{calculations}} of isolated disc galaxies to investigate how {{the properties of}} the ISM, the nature of molecular clouds, and the global star formation rate depend on the level of stellar feedback. We adopt a simple physical model, which includes a galactic potential, a standard cooling and heating prescription of the ISM, and self gravity of the gas. Stellar feedback is implemented by injecting energy into dense, gravitationally collapsing gas, but is independent of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. We obtain fractions of gas, and filling factors for different phases of the ISM in reasonable ageement with observations. Supernovae are found to be vital to reproduce the scale heights of the different components of the ISM, and velocity dispersions. The GMCs formed in the simulations display mass spectra similar to the observations, their normalisation dependent on the level of feedback. We find ~ 40 per cent of the clouds exhibit retrograde rotation, induced by cloud-cloud collisions. The star formation rates we obtain are in good agreement with the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, and are not strongly dependent on the star formation efficiency we assume, being largely self regulated by the feedback. We also investigate the effect of spiral structure by comparing calculations with and without the <b>spiral</b> <b>component</b> of the potential. The main difference with a spiral potential is that more massive GMCs are able to accumulate in the spiral arms. Thus we are able to reproduce massive GMCs, and the spurs seen in many grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. The presence of the spiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate, but can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formation of long-lived, strongly bound clouds.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} types of an approaching flow on the performances of straight conical diffusers. Also, the relationships among inlet boundary layer thickness, inlet swirling components and diffuser performances are investigated. Tests are carried out on straight conical diffusers with total divergence angles ranging from 6 ° to 18 ° and with diffuser area ratios ranging from 2. 1 to 15. 9. According to the result, good performances are obtained if the approaching flow has a symmetrical axial velocity profile with one directional swirling component or a distorted axial velocity profile with double <b>spiral</b> swirling <b>components,</b> and the performances are not so good {{if it has a}} simple distorted axial velocity profile without swirling components or with one directional swirling component...|$|R
40|$|Seyfert's Sextet and VV 172, 5 -m {{photographs}} {{have been}} subjected to image processing to yield field-galaxy density analysis, redshift-scaled imagery, interaction morphology display and enhancement, color difference imagery,modeling of the VV 172 halo, and image texture analysis of the <b>spiral</b> galaxy <b>components</b> of Seyfert's Sextet. An effort is made to evaluate the evidence for physical association of the discordant redshift components of these groups. An especially noteworthy characteristic of the groups is their extended luminous halos. The halo of VV 172 cannot be explained by the overlapping envelopes of galaxies with normal luminosity profiles, and the high redshift spiral galaxy in the Sextet is found to have an asymmetric internal structure and associated filament which suggest gravitational perturbation by {{the other members of the}} group...|$|R
