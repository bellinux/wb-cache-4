[...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I want to make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand.</b> Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and {{to be a part of}} the crowd." ...|$|E

6000|$|M. de Bellegarde's {{face flushed}} a little, {{but he held}} his head higher, as if to {{repudiate}} this concession to vulgar perturbability. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> me," [...] he said to Newman.|$|E

Yes, {{it is very}} good, {{nothing could}} be better, for I know the off-saddling place by the stream in Tiger's Nek, {{and it is a}} nice place for men to hide behind the rocks and trees. Listen now for the plan, and be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> it.

6000|$|I have mighty {{little to}} say, dear boy, to seem worth 2-1/2d. I {{have thought of}} the Piper, {{but he does not}} seem to come as yet; I get him too metaphysical. I shall make a shot for Hester, as soon as I have {{finished}} the Emigrant and the Vendetta and perhaps my Dialogue on Character and Destiny.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "that's {{just the}} point. But no {{two of us}} are made wholly alike. I hadn't practised law very long before I {{began to realize that}} {{conditions}} were changing, that the new forces at work in our industrial life made the older legal ideals impracticable. It was a case of choosing between efficiency and inefficiency, and I chose efficiency. Well, that was my own affair, {{but when it comes to}} influencing others--" [...] He paused. [...] "I want you to see this as I do, not for the sake of justifying myself, but because I honestly believe there is more to it than expediency,--a good deal more. There's a weak way of looking at it, and a strong way. And if I feel <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> it, I shall be satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{forget your}} smile," [...] he said. [...] "In all other respects you will do. The walk has {{improved}} your complexion, and the hat becomes you. Look Mrs. Lecount steadily in the face; show no embarrassment when you speak; and if Mr. Noel Vanstone pays you pointed attention, don't {{take too much}} notice of him while his housekeeper's eye is on you. Mind one thing! I have been at Joyce's Scientific Dialogues all the morning; and I am quite serious in meaning to give Mrs. Lecount the full benefit of my studies. If I can't contrive to divert her attention from you and her master, I won't give sixpence for our chance of success. Small-talk won't succeed with that woman; compliments won't succeed; jokes won't succeed--ready-made science may recall the deceased professor, and ready-made science may do. We must establish a code of signals {{to let you know}} what I am about. Observe this camp-stool. When I shift it from my left hand to my right, I am talking Joyce. When I shift it from my right hand to my left, I am talking Wragge. In the first case, don't interrupt me--I am leading up to my point. In the second case, say anything you like; my remarks are not of the slightest consequence. Would you like a rehearsal?

I’m not going to represent this sonofabitch." [...] Regardless of his initial reaction, Shapiro took the case, getting Rockwell's case dismissed in roughly twenty minutes. After the hearing, Rockwell reportedly told Shapiro: [...] "Listen up, Jewboy, just because you got me off, that doesn’t do anything for you.

5000|$|Oolong {{was trained}} to balance objects on his head, an art called [...] "Head Performance" [...] by his owner. The first object {{balanced}} on Oolong's head was a 35mm film canister on 25 May 1999. Akutagawa later used tea cups, bread, fruit, pancakes (actually dorayaki), and a rabbit skull. Although most reactions on the Internet were positive, there were some complaints by people who believed the practice to be cruel to animals. In response, Akutagawa wrote in a message to website visitors: [...] "Some visitors have written me e-mails, accusing me of being cruel to my rabbit and that I am abusing my pet. This was never my intention when I included numerous links to photographs, showing Oolong's unique ability to hold objects on his head.

And we're going to bring them to justice. So anybody wishes to join them, you go right ahead and join them.

The following is an excerpt from this statement: [...] "In the last few weeks, the cancer has rather quickly taken control. My oncology and palliative care consultants informed me openly and honestly just before Christmas that I now probably have only weeks to live, and I am prepared for that as I can be, accepting it with faith as a gift of God's grace ... Rather than resign, I would like to continue among you as your bishop {{and the father of}} our diocesan family until this stage of my life ends. I do not know how long that will be. I am most grateful for the ways you have cared for and so prayerfully supported me in recent years. You remain very much in my thoughts and care. As I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand,</b> I am able to do very little, and will need to rely on others. Please can I ask you to limit any expressions of care to prayer for now, rather than anything else to which I cannot respond." ...|$|E
