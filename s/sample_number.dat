40|$|Sampling is {{important}} for many applications in research areas such as graphics. vision, and image processing. In this paper. we present a novel stratified sampling algorithm (SSA) for the coiled tubing surface with a given probability density function. The algorithm is developed from the inverse function of the integration for {{the areas of the}} coiled tubing surface. We exploit a Hierarchical Allocation Strategy (HAS) to preserve sample stratification when generating any desirable <b>sample</b> <b>numbers.</b> This permits us to reduce variances when applying our algorithm to Monte Carlo Direct Lighting for realistic image generation. We accelerate the sampling process using a segmentation technique in the integration domain. Our algorithm thus runs 324 orders of magnitude faster when using faster SSA algorithm where the order of the magnitude is proportional to the <b>sample</b> <b>numbers.</b> Finally. we employ a parabolic interpolation technique to decrease the average errors occurred for using the segmentation technique. This permits us to produce nearly constant average errors, independent of the <b>sample</b> <b>numbers.</b> The proposed algorithm is novel, efficient in computing and feasible for realistic image generation using Monte Carlo method...|$|R

40|$|Cities are {{increasingly}} vulnerable to floods generated by intense rainfall, {{because of their}} high degree of imperviousness, implementation of infrastructures, and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change. Accurate information of convective storm characteristics at high spatial and temporal resolution is a crucial input for urban hydrological models {{to be able to}} simulate fast runoff processes and enhance flood prediction. In this paper, a detailed study of the sensitivity of urban hydrological response to high resolution radar rainfall was conducted. Rainfall rates derived from X-band dual polarimetric weather radar for four rainstorms were used as input into a detailed hydrodynamic sewer model for an urban catchment in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Dimensionless parameters were derived to compare results between different storm conditions and to describe the effect of rainfall spatial resolution in relation to storm and hydrodynamic model properties: rainfall <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. storm size), catchment <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. catchment size), runoff and sewer <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> (rainfall resolution vs. runoff and sewer model resolution respectively). Results show catchment smearing effect for rainfall resolution approaching half the catchment size, i. e. for catchments <b>sampling</b> <b>numbers</b> greater than 0. 5 averaged rainfall volumes decrease about 20 %. Moreover, deviations in maximum water depths, form 10 to 30 % depending on the storm, occur for rainfall resolution close to storm size, describing storm smearing effect due to rainfall coarsening. Model results also show the sensitivity of modelled runoff peaks and maximum water depths to the resolution of the runoff areas and sewer density respectively. Sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall input seems low compared to spatial resolution, for the storms analysed in this study. Findings are in agreement with previous studies on natural catchments, thus the <b>sampling</b> <b>numbers</b> seem to be promising as an approach to describe sensitivity of hydrological response to rainfall variability for intra-urban catchments and local convective storms. More storms and different urban catchments of varying characteristics need to be analysed in order to validate these findings. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the rate of}} convergence of linear <b>sampling</b> <b>numbers</b> of the embedding H^α,β (T^d) H^γ (T^d). Here α governs the mixed smoothness and β the isotropic smoothness in the space H^α,β(T^d) of hybrid smoothness, whereas H^γ(T^d) denotes the isotropic Sobolev space. If γ>β we obtain sharp polynomial decay rates for the first embedding realized by sampling operators based on "energy-norm based sparse grids" for the classical trigonometric interpolation. This complements earlier work by Griebel, Knapek and Dũng, Ullrich, where general linear approximations have been considered.

40|$|In limited-view {{computed}} tomography reconstruction, iterative image reconstruction with sparsity-exploiting methods, such as total variation (TV) minimization, inspired by compressive sensing, potentially claims large reductions in sampling requirements. However, a quantitative notion of this claim is non-trivial {{because of the}} ill-defined reduction in sampling achieved by the sparsity-exploiting method. In this paper, exact reconstruction sampling condition for limited-view problem is studied by verifying the uniqueness of solution in TV minimization model. Uniqueness is tested by solving a convex optimization problem derived from the sufficient and necessary condition of solution uniqueness. Through this method, the sufficient <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> of exact reconstruction is quantified for any fixed phantom and settled geometrical parameter in the limited-view problem. This paper provides a reference to quantify the sampling condition. Using Shepp-Logan phantom as an example, the experiment results show the quantified <b>sampling</b> <b>number</b> and indicate that an object would be accurately reconstructed as the scanning range becomes narrower by increasing <b>sampling</b> <b>number.</b> The increased samplings compensate for the deficiency of the projection angle. However, a lower bound of the scanning range is presented, in which an exact reconstruction cannot be obtained once the projection angle is narrowed to this extent no matter how to increase sampling...|$|R
