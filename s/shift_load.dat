In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the <b>shift</b> <b>load</b> effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.|$|E

When the shifting costs are large compared with peak charges, the model has a unique equilibrium. Coincident-peak charging and anytime-peak charging give different outcomes when the peak load for one purchaser does not coincide with the coincident peak. Coincident-peak charges favour purchasers whose peaks do not coincide with the system peak. They are more effective than anytime-peak charges at decreasing peak loads and therefore low-ering peak charges. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{pursuit of}} the {{economic}} and environmental benefits, an increasing popularity has been witnessed in distributed generators (DGs) such as photovoltaic (PV) panels. The PV owners aim to gain benefits by exporting surplus energy back to the grid [1], which causes a number of operational challenges for the distribution networks. These challenges include power fluctuations, renewable output curtailment and voltage stability risk [1, 2, 3, 4]. In order to solve such problems, utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS), is believed to be a promising alternative. BESS is a centralized controllable storage system with the capacity ranging from hundreds of kW to dozens of MW.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} cement plants {{and their ability to}} shed or <b>shift</b> <b>load</b> to participate in demand response (DR). Relevant factors investigated include the various equipment and processes used to make cement, the operational limitations cement plants are subject to, and the quantities and sources of energy used in the cement-making process. Opportunities for energy efficiency improvements are also reviewed. The results suggest that cement plants are good candidates for DR participation. The cement industry consumes over 400 trillion Btu of energy annually in the United States, and consumes over 150 MW of electricity in California alone. The chemical reactions required to make cement occur only in the cement kiln, and intermediate products are routinely stored between processing stages without negative effects. Cement plants also operate continuously {{for months at a time}} between shutdowns, allowing flexibility in operational scheduling. In addition, several examples of cement plants altering their electricity consumption based on utility incentives are discussed.

40|$|Investigations into demand side {{reductions}} {{have been}} {{encouraged by the}} South African electricity utility, Eskom, in sectors with high electricity consumption, such as the cement industry. The South African cement industry is responsible for 5 % of the electrical consumption for the mining and industrial sector. It has also been estimated that by 2020 this sector will be ranked fifth for energy savings potential. This paper investigates the potential of a loadshifting (altering energy use method) scheme to reduce evening peak loads and save electrical costs on a raw mill at a South African cement plant. A spread sheet-simulation was performed, which showed that six hours of load-shifting could be achieved, without adversely affecting production. This was corroborated by a pilot study where the load was successfully shifted for six hours over a week-long period. The specific raw mill would achieve a reduction in yearly electrical costs of 2 % when employing this load-shifting strategy. The results, however, showed that cost-saving opportunities are highly dependent on {{the reliability of the}} mills and on the change in production demand. Therefore, load-shifting schemes have to be flexible on a daily basis to <b>shift</b> <b>load</b> whenever possible. [URL]...|$|E
30|$|Electrical {{power supply}} is demand-oriented {{to date and}} not {{flexible}} enough for the challenges described above. In the future, {{it will be necessary}} to change the energy demand according to power generation of renewable energy sources, which means that the regulation will be moved from electricity suppliers to the consumer’s side. Through suitable concepts of demand regulation and distribution, the power grid will be stabilized and optimized [8]. Possible concepts are demand side management and demand response, which are described in [9 – 11]. Demand side management techniques like <b>load</b> <b>shifting</b> and peak clipping are the most known approaches. At <b>load</b> <b>shifting,</b> the <b>load</b> is <b>shifted</b> from a peak period to an off-peak period without changing the total energy consumption of both periods, whereas at peak clipping, the load is reduced by reducing the power consumption [12]. To use these techniques, it is necessary to identify load peaks through analyzing power data from the grid. Based on analysis, an algorithm for <b>shifting</b> <b>load</b> peaks could be developed [13].|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff structure by Eskom, the implementation of projects that <b>shift</b> <b>load</b> from peak TOU times to times of the day when electrical energy is less expensive has increased. To enable load shifting on mine dewatering pumps, preparation before and recovery after peak TOU is needed for effective results. This induces a preparation- and comeback load in the standard TOU. With an annual increase in TOU tariffs and the rate of increase of standard TOU being greater than that of the peak TOU, a reduction in electrical energy consumption before and after peak TOU is needed. To enable this, a step-by-step control technique was developed to promote the shifting of load from standard-to off-peak TOU, while still realising a full load shift from peak TOU. This technique entails dynamic control ranges of underground dam levels as opposed to the conventional constant control range method. Control range upper and lower bounds were optimised through the formulation and application of equations taking into account various system parameters. Two case studies were used to test the developed technique. Results indicated significant additional financial savings when compared to conventional control methods.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the possibility to}} reduce congestion in the transmission grid through large-scale implementation of demand-side management (DSM) {{in the form of}} load shifting for the EU- 27 countries, Norway, and Switzerland for Year 2020. A linear, cost-minimising, dispatch model that includes a DC load-flow description of the transmission system and a general representation of load shifting is used. It is assumed that the EU Member States fulfil the targets for Year 2020 in their national renewable energy action plans. In the model calculations, a reference case without load shifting is compared with cases in which the load shifting is 5 %, 10 %, 15 % or 20 % of the load. The possibility to <b>shift</b> <b>load</b> in time is added exogenously and economic incentives for DSM are not evaluated. Three types of congestion are identified: peak-load-hour congestion, low-load-hour congestion and all-hour congestion. Peak-load-hour congestion is reduced as the DSM share of the load increases, whereas low-load-hour congestion, which is typically associated {{with a high level of}} wind generation, persists at all the DSM penetration levels investigated. We show that all-hour congestion occurs between systems that have large differences in supply structure, and that the impact of DSM on all-hour congestion is low. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{electric}} power grid is experiencing peak loads during day time in week days. High loads result in high costs and negative environmental impacts. One way {{to balance the}} electricity use is demand response, which means shifting load from peak hours to off peak hours. Electricity distributors can implement time-of-use electricity tariffs as an incentive for the end-users to be more flexible in their electricity use. In this study an attempt is made to segment electricity users in households based on their behavior and motivation to shift their electricity use to off peak hours. Behavioral and psychographic variables based on the theory of planned behavior were used to construct a survey.
