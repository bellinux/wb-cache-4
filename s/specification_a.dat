While an upgraded form of ICTS (Mark II Vehicles designed by Bombardier) had been considered, the current recommendation is to implement the LRT/tram technology used for Transit City to save on the fleet and track maintenance costs currently incurred by this unique-within-Toronto system.

However, under Rob Ford, the renovated and extended Scarborough RT will {{become a part of the}} Eglinton Crosstown LRT instead and renamed Eglinton–Scarborough Crosstown line.|$|E

2500|$|Standard Gerber was a {{numerical}} control (NC) format designed by Gerber Systems Corp to drive their vector photo plotters for the PCB {{industry in the}} 1960s and 1970s.

The term RS-274-D, without the qualifying [...] "Gerber" [...] postfix, is sometimes used informally for standard Gerber. Standard Gerber became the de facto standard format for PCB images.|$|E
2500|$|Fifteen {{hundred of}} each of the three models (Bantam BRC-40, Ford GP, and Willys MA) were built and {{extensively}} field-tested. Delmar [...] "Barney" [...] Roos, Willys-Overland's chief engineer, made design changes to meet a revised weight <b>specification</b> (<b>a</b> maximum of , including oil and water). He was thus able to use the powerful but comparatively heavy Willys [...] "Go Devil" [...] engine, and win the initial production contract. The Willys version of the car would become the standardized Jeep design, designated the model MB and was built at their plant in Toledo, Ohio. The familiar pressed-metal Jeep grille was actually a Ford design feature and incorporated in the final design by the Army.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{thermal profile}} is ranked {{on how it}} fits in a process window (the {{specification}} or tolerance limit). Raw temperature values are normalized {{in terms of a}} percentage relative to both the process mean and the window limits. The center of the process window is defined as zero, and the extreme edges of the process window are ±99%. A PWI {{greater than or equal to}} 100% indicates that the profile does not process the product within <b>specification.</b> <b>A</b> PWI of 99% indicates that the profile [...] runs at the edge of the process window. For example, if the process mean is set at 200°C, with the process window calibrated at 180°C and 220°C respectively; then a measured value of 188°C translates to a process window index of 60%. [...] A lower PWI value indicates a more robust profile. For maximum efficiency, separate PWI values are computed for peak, slope, reflow, and soak processes of a thermal profile.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{approach}} for handling the complex dynamics of a multi-agent system {{is based on}} distinguishing aggregation levels.

To this end, <b>a</b> <b>specification</b> at <b>a</b> lower aggregation level can be created, describing basic steps in the processes of a system.
