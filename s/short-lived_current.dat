Initially billed by CNN as [...] "a week of special programming", {{the program was}} hosted by advertising executive and television personality Donny Deutsch with a panel that consisted of political commentator and gay rights activist Margaret Hoover, ESPN columnist Rick Reilly and ESPN NFL analyst Jason Taylor. A fifth panelist slot was filled by a different person each day. (Get to) The Point attracted {{a great deal of}} ridicule on Twitter during its time on air. Also during that time, the program averaged just 268,000 viewers with an average of merely 77,000 viewers in the 25-54 viewing demographic. It was also mocked by comedian Jon Stewart during his Comedy Central show. As a result of the low ratings, CNN's management decided not to continue with the show, cancelling (Get to) The Point after only a week of airtime.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{utilization}} of immersive distributed virtual environments for military training is readily apparent (Stytz 1996; Stytz, Soltz, & Wilson 1996). These virtual environments {{are capable of}} simulating thousands of real-world and synthetic components, all interacting in real time. The user must attempt to base decisions on relevant information within the environment. However, due to the dynacism of the environment, information is difficult to locate and <b>short-lived.</b> <b>Current</b> direct manipulation human-computer interfaces are inadequate in these environments. Therefore, we must investigate new methods for enabling users to perform their tasks within these environments. We are currently investigating the use of interface agents to alleviate the problem of cognitive overload in virtual environments (Banks et al. 1997). The driving goal of our research {{is to develop a}} comprehensive software engineering, knowledge engineering, and knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Power MOSFETs {{are often}} {{required}} {{to operate in}} a space radiation environment; therefore, they are susceptible to a catastrophic failure mode called single-event burnout. Single-event burnout of power MOSFETs is initiated by the passage of an energetic-heavy ion through the parasitic BJT inherent to the power-MOSFET structure. The electron-hole pairs generated by the ion support a <b>short-lived</b> <b>current</b> source which imposes a base-emitter voltage on the parasitic BJT. If a sufficient base-emitter voltage is imposed, the parasitic BJT enters second breakdown and burnout of the MOSFET occurs. A semi-analytical model has been developed to predict the energy required of the incident ion to initiate burnout. This thesis addresses the portion of this model which relates {{the energy of the}} incident ion to the base-emitter voltage imposed on the parasitic BJT. The initial base-emitter potential is determined using image-source techniques...|$|E

Consequently {{the amount of}} social engagement that users produce tends to be <b>short-lived.</b> The <b>current</b> study investigates {{the length of time}} a Facebook post continues to engage users. The posts of 100 participants, 50 men and 50 women, were followed for a 24 -hour period.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis discusses {{the evolution of}} individual initiative in fighter tactics of the Soviet Air Force. World War II forced pilots to break from restrictive tactics and to develop and use initiative in combat. By war's end, Soviet fighters' initiative greatly resembled western fighters'. However, since WWII technology and doctrine led {{to an increase in}} control measures and a decline in initiative. Despite this, veterans of combat have consistently spoken out for realistic training and the freedom for fighter initiative. As a result, emphasis on initiative rose in the late 1970 's. But current Soviet pilots do not come close to having the initiative of WWII fighters and the recent emphasis on initiative may be <b>short-lived.</b> <b>Current</b> tech­nology gives the Soviet Air Force the choice of developing or extinguishing initiative among their fighters. History suggests that without a threat to their survival the choice against initiative will be made. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|E
40|$|Alamethicin, a 20 -residue peptaibol, induces voltage-dependent ion {{channels}} in lipid bilayers {{according to the}} barrel-stave model. To study relationships between the proline- 14 -induced kink region and the channel-forming behavior of the peptide, a set of alamethicin analogs with proline incorporated at positions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, respectively, {{as well as an}} analog with alanine instead of proline at position 14 were synthesized. Macroscopic conductance experiments show that the voltage dependence of the peptides is conserved although slightly influenced, but the apparent mean number of monomers forming the channels is significantly reduced when proline is not located at position 14. This is confirmed in single-channel experiments. The analogs with proline next to position 14 (i. e., 13, 15, 16) show stable conductance levels, but of reduced number, which follows the order Alam-P 14 > Alam-P 15 > Alam-P 16 > Alam-P 13. This {{reduction in the number of}} levels is connected with changes in the lifetime of the channels. Analogs with proline at position 11, 12, or 17 produce erratic, extremely <b>short-lived</b> <b>current</b> events that could not be resolved. The changes in functional properties are related to structural properties as probed by circular dichroism. The results indicate that proline at position 14 results in optimal channel activity, whereas channels formed by the analogs bearing proline at different positions are considerably less stable...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} {{the most common cause of}} cancer- related death worldwide, causing over 1. 2 million deaths each year. Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) {{consists}} of a group of malignancies that are pathologically and molecularly diverse but that are all characterised by a poor prognosis. Survival rates for lung cancer patients have improved very slowly and only to a modest degree owing partly to poor funding for research into this malignancy and stigma associated with smoking, as well as relative chemo-resistance. However, in recent years, NSCLC has become an exemplar for precision medicine, mainly following development of drugs targeting the receptors of epidermal growth factor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase. While epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors are only applicable to a minority of patients and benefits are almost invariably <b>short-lived,</b> <b>current</b> studies indicate that at least 50 % of patients with NSCLC have a targetable mutation. With a growing armamentarium of inhibitors against these targets in development, there is a hope that a greater proportion of patients will benefit from precision medicine and that such benefits will be sustained. However, there remain significant challenges in the development of precision medicine in NSCLC. These include: identification and validation of new targets; ensuring biopsies are fit for purpose; tumour heterogeneity; requirements for serial tumour assessments; and not least cost. In this review, we will discuss the current status of precision medicine in NSCLC as well as how basic and translational research are paving the way towards overcoming the above challenges. In addition, we will pay attention to clinical strategies in respect to liquid biopsies and the potential use of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes in cancer therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|This report {{details the}} results of an {{investigation}} into hydrographic and hydrochemical conditions over ten offshore banks around the coast of south Sweden. Four of these banks are situated in the Kattegat. The remainder lie in the southern and western Baltic Proper. The investigation included field sampling, where each bank was visited on one occasion, and the temperature and salinity structure mapped while the concentrations of nutrients were measured. These data were analysed, and results compared and complemented with predictions from operational numerical models (for currents and waves). The banks are areas with strong horizontal gradients in temperature and salinity. They influence the large scale circulation, steering mean currents through the deeper water, resulting in the mean currents over the banks being weak. The influence of short term wind events are significant however, with intense, <b>short-lived</b> <b>currents</b> occurring over the banks. Nutrient concentrations in the waters above the banks were very similar to those in the adjacent basins. Immediately over the bottom however, silicate concentrations were often higher than at similar depths away from the banks. Similarly, oxygen saturation immediately above the bottom was frequently lower than in mid-water at the same depth. In the Kattegat, large areas are at risk from seasonal oxygen deficiency. The shallow nature of the banks however often means that they escape the worst impacts...|$|R

40|$|The 21 st century Olympic Agenda aims {{to align}} {{itself with the}} concept of {{sustainable}} development and has driven improved environmental quality in host cities, such as the Green Games in Sydney 2000 and the planned Beijing 2008 Games and in London 2012 as the Low Carbon Games. Air quality has long been a concern of Olympic mega-cities, although the air quality plans and strategies have often seemed short-lived and unsustainable in the long term. We have explored air quality data and air pollution control from seven Olympic cities: Mexico City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Sydney and Athens and also Beijing and London which will host Olympic Games in near future. The study shows that despite a high altitude and air pollution problems, Mexico City had no clear environmental policy in place for the 1968 games. The characteristic smog of Los Angeles raised concerns about athletic performance at the Olympic Games of 1984, but there were limited efforts to tackle the ozone concentration during these games. The 1996 Atlanta Games represents a case where temporary public transport changes were used as a tactic to reduce air pollution. In Sydney a well planned sustainable strategy reduced air pollutants and CO 2 emissions in 2000, but Athens' long efforts to improve air quality for the 2004 games were not wholly effective. Even where strategies proved successful the improvements in air quality seem <b>short-lived.</b> <b>Current</b> host cities Beijing and London are developing emission reduction plans. These have clear air quality objectives and are well intentioned. However, the improvements may be too narrow and may not be sustainable in the long term. Our analysis looks at the origins of success and failure and how more coherent improvements might be achieved and what would promote sustainable plans for air quality management at future games. The study illustrates the feedback between air pollution science and policy awareness...|$|E

The ocean circulation model has been forced at the surface by a medium, high or very high resolution atmospheric forcing. The simulated ocean parameters have been compared with satellite data and they were found to be generally in good agreement. High and very high resolution atmospheric forcings have been able to form noticeable, although <b>short-lived,</b> surface <b>current</b> structures, due to their ability to detect transient atmospheric disturbances.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{location of the}} Azores, midway between Europe and America, poses problems relative to their colonization and the biogeographic affinity of the biota presently living there. In {{the way of the}} Gulf Stream, originating off American shores, the Azorean biota, marine and terrestrial alike is predominantly European. To explain this distributional paradigm the present study investigates the Neogene fossil record of Santa Maria, Azores in order to establish the biogeographical relationships of the Pleistocene to Recent littoral molluscan fauna of this archipelago. The bulk of the Azorean malacofauna, both in the Pleistocene (71. 3 %) and in Recent times (75. 6 %) is biogeographically related with the eastern Atlantic, and that the Pleistocene (Eemian) fossil fauna is basically the same as the Recent fauna, with a few losses of tropical species and of shallow water bivalves associated to fine sand substrates. It is hypothesized that during Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, short-duration events have occurred during which <b>short-lived</b> oceanic <b>currents</b> must have been established, especially during or shortly after glacial terminations. During these short-term events, the arrival of species to the Azores may have been increased and facilitated by temporary sea-surface currents that no longer exist now. Probable routes of dispersal to the archipelago of the Azores are also discussed, as well as the possible influence of the Pleistocene glaciations in the shallow water marine molluscs of these islands...|$|R
40|$|These devices use {{photomultiplier}} tubes attached to pieces of scintillator plastic, and use complex readout electronics. They are coincidence detectors, requiring simultaneous detections {{in two or}} more aligned detectors. In a coincidence detector, the ability of cosmic rays to pass through matter allows them to pass through two (or more) aligned samples of scintilla-tor, triggering the attached photomultipliers simultaneously. However, the high cost and relative complexity of photomulti-plier tube-based CR detectors limit their use {{in a high school}} setting. (A complete QuarkNET system, including all elec-tronics and detectors, costs more than $ 5000 as of this writ-ing; the components of the Berkeley system, if purchased new, would run about half that sum.) As noted earlier, Geiger counters are sensitive to CRs. A CR passing through the wall of a Geiger-Muller tube (GMT) will ionize gas atoms in the tube, and those electrons will be accelerated toward the high-voltage sense wire that runs {{down the length of the}} tube. Along the way, they ionize other atoms, creating a <b>short-lived,</b> measurable <b>current</b> pulse. Jackson and Welker 5 showed that a common digital data acquisition board or device (such as a PASCO ScienceWorkshop or Vernier LabPro) could be used to monitor several Geiger counters at once. Simultaneous detections are candidate CRs. This is still expensive—a good Geiger counter can run into the hundreds of dollars, and at least two are required. (Aware Electronics 6 produces a system for doing just this.) Researchers at the Uni-versity of Pennsylvania have built their own GMTs and used them to create an inexpensive coincidence CR detector. 7 (A good resource for educational CR detectors is the website jlab. org/~cecire/toolkit/crdetectors. html.)

40|$|Ireland began {{actively}} recruiting nurses internationally in 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, 35 % of {{new recruits}} into {{the health system}} were non-EU migrant nurses. Ireland is more heavily reliant upon international nurse recruitment than the UK, New Zealand or Australia. This paper draws on in-depth interviews (N= 21) conducted in 2007 with non-EU migrant nurses working in Ireland, a quantitative survey of non-EU migrant nurses (N= 337) conducted in 2009 and in-depth interviews conducted with key stakeholders (N= 12) in late 2009 /early 2010. Available primary and secondary data indicate a fresh challenge for health workforce planning in Ireland as immigration slows and nurses (both non-EU and Irish trained) consider emigration. Successful international nurse recruitment campaigns obviated the need for health workforce planning in the short-term, however the assumption that international nurse recruitment had ‘solved’ the nursing shortage was <b>short-lived</b> and the <b>current</b> presumption that nurse migration (both emigration and immigration) will always ‘work’ for Ireland over-plays the reliability of migration as a health workforce planning tool.

40|$|Increasingly, Web data is {{displayed}} in pages generated {{according to a}} template (e. g., product listings at amazon. com, faculty directories, class schedules). This trend makes structured querying of such Web data a valuable capability for {{a growing number of}} applications, including many ad hoc, exploratory, and <b>short-lived</b> tasks. Unfortunately, <b>current</b> methods for answering such queries require writing complex Perl scripts or creating customized wrappers and storing the extracted data in a DBMS, which is often overkill for these types of on-the-fly tasks. In this paper we propose SLIC, a solution to this problem. Given a set of Web pages generated according to some templates, SLIC allows the user to quickly pose SQL queries, obtain initial results, and then iterate with the system to get increasingly better results. At each step, SLIC asks relatively simple questions to solicit minimal structural information from the user in order to extract data and refine the answers. Extensive experiments on real-world domains show that for many practical queries (1) SLIC is significantly faster than current methods, and (2) the user needs to answer only a few relatively simple questions before obtaining useful answers. SLIC thus provides a promising first step toward a principled solution for on-the-fly extraction and querying of Web data...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies against {{neuronal}} receptors and synaptic proteins {{are associated}} with autoimmune encephalitides (AE) that produce movement and psychiatric disorders. In order to exert their pathological effects on neural circuits, autoantibodies against central nervous system (CNS) targets must {{gain access to the}} brain and spinal cord by crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a tightly regulated gateway formed by endothelial cells lining CNS blood vessels. To date, the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie autoantibody-triggered encephalitic syndromes are poorly understood, and how autoantibodies breach the barrier remains obscure for almost all AE syndromes. The relative importance of cellular versus humoral immune mechanisms for disease pathogenesis also remains largely unexplored. Here, we review the proposed triggers for various autoimmune encephalopathies and their animal models, as well as basic structural features of the BBB and how they differ among various CNS regions, a feature that likely underlies some regional aspects of autoimmune encephalitis pathogenesis. We then discuss the routes that antibodies and immune cells employ to enter the CNS and their implications for AE. Finally, we explore future therapeutic strategies that may either preserve or restore barrier function and thereby limit immune cell and autoantibody infiltration into the CNS. Recent mechanistic insights into CNS autoantibody entry indicate promising future directions for therapeutic intervention beyond <b>current,</b> <b>short-lived</b> therapies that eliminate circulating autoantibodies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} La Caleta Formation and its eruptive history interpreted using sedimentary logs, isopach and isopleth data, granulometry and geochemical studies. The formation {{has been}} subdivided into six members, which were emplaced during five eruptive phases. The eruption commenced with fallout from a Plinian eruption column that collapsed, generating a rapid succession of <b>short-lived</b> pyroclastic density <b>currents</b> that deposited extensive ignimbrites and co-ignimbrite ash layers, {{culminating in a}} more sustained pyroclastic current that deposited a thick, predominantly massive ignimbrite, capped with a lithic breccia interpreted to represent caldera collapse. Fine ash layers can be deposited by ashfall or pyroclastic density currents and their fine grain size coupled with poor exposure, can hinder interpretations of their depositional origin, which is vital if using ash layers for hazard assessment. A new method of discriminating between {{these two types of}} deposit is presented in this thesis. Samples of unequivocal depositional origin were collected from formations within the Bandas del Sur Group and their fabrics, analysed using Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS). This revealed differences in the distribution of susceptibility axes, the imbrication of the magnetic foliation and the strength and shape of the anisotropy between the two types of deposit. However the discrimination using the traditional AMS plots was found to be equivocal in some instance, so a new discriminant plot has been devised, which can successfully discriminate between the two types of ash layer. AMS has been used to categorise cross-stratified, stratified, diffusely bedded and massive lithofacies, and to interpret flow-boundary conditions and depositional mechanisms. Samples were collected from ignimbrites and ash layers from the Bandas del Sur Group and their AMS fabrics compared. The distribution of the magnetic susceptibility axes on the stereonets has been used to infer flow-boundary conditions; girdle distributions represent more tractional processes, whereas well-grouped distributions represent more granular processes and random distributions represent fluid escape dominated flow-boundary zones. The most significant outcome was the recognition of different types of massive deposit, based on variations in the distribution of the susceptibility axes, which are interpreted to have been deposited at a fluid-escape dominated flow-boundary influenced by other processes (traction and/or granular shear). This indicates that not all massive deposits are emplaced in the same way. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
