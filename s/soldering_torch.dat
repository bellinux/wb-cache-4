50|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as a <b>soldering</b> <b>torch,</b> heat torches used in jewelry making are often fueled by butane, propane, MAPP gas, or a mixture of propane and oxygen. Heat torches are more effective at working with certain metals, such as sterling, gold, and copper, because they are able to heat these metals to a higher degree than traditional soldering irons and soldering guns.|$|E
50|$|Compression {{fittings}} {{are popular}} {{because they do}} not require soldering, so they are comparatively quick and easy to use. They require no special tools or skills to operate. They work at higher pressures and with toxic gases. Compression fittings are especially useful in installations that may require occasional disassembly or partial removal for maintenance etc., since these joints can be broken and remade without affecting the integrity of the joint. They are also used in situations where a heat source, in particular a <b>soldering</b> <b>torch,</b> is prohibited, or where it is difficult to remove remains of water from inside the pipe which prevent the pipe heating up to allow soldering.|$|E
50|$|For non-electronic {{applications}} <b>soldering</b> <b>torches</b> use a flame {{rather than}} a soldering tip to heat <b>solder.</b> <b>Soldering</b> <b>torches</b> are often powered by butane and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, {{can be used for}} soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally <b>soldered</b> with a <b>torch</b> by directly applying the open flame.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{plumbing}} tools include pipe wrenches, flaring pliers, pipe vise, {{pipe bending}} machine, pipe cutter, dies and joining {{tools such as}} <b>soldering</b> <b>torches</b> and crimp tools. New tools {{have been developed to}} help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or problems, they use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.|$|R
40|$|Context: Alloys {{have been}} {{considered}} to be of paramount importance {{in the field of}} prosthodontics. Long span prosthesis may often require joining of one or more individual castings to obtain better fit, occlusal harmony and esthetics in comparison to one-piece casting. Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanical properties of base metal alloys joined by two different techniques, namely, gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldering</b> and laser fusion, compared to a one-piece casting. Mechanical properties evaluated were tensile strength, percentage of elongation and hardness of the solder joint. In addition, corrosion properties and scanning electron microscopic appearance of the joints were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The samples were prepared according to American Society for Testing Materials specifications (ASTM, E 8). Specimens were made with self-cure acrylic and then invested in phosphate-bonded investment material. Casting was done in induction casting machine. Thirty specimens were thus prepared for each group and compared with 30 specimens of the one-piece casting group. Statistical Analysis Used: SPSS software (version 10. 0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and Benferroni post hoc tests were done for multiple comparisons between the groups and within the groups for mean difference and standard error. Results: Results showed that tensile strength of the one-piece casting was higher than laser fused and gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldered</b> joints. Laser fused joints exhibited higher hardness values compared to that of gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldered</b> joints. Scanning electron microscopic examination revealed greater porosity in the gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldered</b> joints. This contributed to the reduction in the strength of the joint. Gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldered</b> joints showed less corrosion resistance when compared to laser fused joints and one-piece casting. Conclusion: Laser fusion, which is a recent introduction to the field of prosthodontics, produces joints which have properties between those of one-piece casting and the gas oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldering...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{extremely}} simple, made largely of sheet metal. Construction started {{late in the}} summer of 1936 and was completed in March 1937. Two weeks later the engine was running on hydrogen, but the high temperature exhaust led to considerable [...] "burning" [...] of the metal. The tests were otherwise successful, and in September the combustors were replaced and the engine was run on gasoline for the first time. Ohain had at last, albeit five months after Frank Whittle, working in parallel in England, run a self-contained turbojet. Running on gasoline proved to clog up the combustors, so Hahn designed a new version based on his <b>soldering</b> <b>torch,</b> which proved to work much better. Although the engine was never intended to be a flight-quality design, it proved beyond a doubt that the basic concept was workable, and Ohain had at last caught up with Whittle. With vastly more funding and industry support, Ohain would soon overtake Whittle and forge ahead.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{ultimate}} tensile strength of the soldering joint from conventional torch technique and the welding joint from laser technology in three types of alloy, gold-palladium (Au-Pd) alloy, nickle-chrome (Ni-Cr) alloy and cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) alloy using the ISO standard model. Materials and methods Fifty four specimens were prepared in accordance with ISO 6892 from three different alloys, Au-Pd alloy, Ni-Cr alloy and Co-Cr alloy. Six specimens of each alloy were cut and either soldered with gas propane-oxygen torch or welded with laser. The control group was six specimens without cutting (as cast specimens) of each alloy. All specimens were then undergone for thermocycling required for oxidation, opaque layer, dentine layer and glazing before testing. Specimens were tested for {{ultimate tensile strength}} (UTS) using universal testing machine.

40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of three techniques for correction of cast implant bars. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty cast implant bars were fabricated on a metal master model. All cast implant bars were sectioned at 5 mm from the left gold cylinder using a disk of 0. 3 mm thickness, and then each group of ten specimens was corrected by gas-air <b>torch</b> <b>soldering,</b> laser welding, and additional casting technique. Three dimensional evaluation including horizontal, vertical, and twisting measurements was based on measurement and comparison of (1) gap distances of the right abutment replica-gold cylinder interface at buccal, distal, lingual side, (2) changes of bar length, and (3) axis angle changes of the right gold cylinders at the step of the post-correction measurements on the three groups with a contact and non-contact coordinate measuring machine. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were performed at the significance level of 5 %. RESULTS. Gap distances of the cast implant bars after correction procedure showed no statistically significant difference among groups. Changes in bar length between pre-casting and post-correction measurement were statistically significance among groups. Axis angle changes of the right gold cylinders were not statistically significance among groups. CONCLUSION. There was no statistical significance among three techniques in horizontal, vertical and axial errors. But, gas-air <b>torch</b> <b>soldering</b> technique showed the most consistent and accurate trend in the correction of implant bar error.

40|$|PURPOSE. The {{present study}} was {{intended}} to evaluate the effect of soldering techniques with infrared ray and gas torch under different gap distances (0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm) on the tensile strength and surface porosity formation in Ni-Cr base metal alloy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty five dumbbell shaped Ni-Cr alloy specimens were prepared and assigned to 5 groups according to the soldering method and the gap distance. For the <b>soldering</b> methods, gas <b>torch</b> (G group) and infrared ray (IR group) were compared and each group was subdivided by corresponding gap distance (0. 3 mm: G 3 and IR 3, 0. 5 mm: G 5, IR 5). Specimens of the experimental groups were sectioned in the middle with a diamond disk and embedded in solder blocks according to the predetermined distance. As a control group, 7 specimens were prepared without sectioning or soldering. After the soldering procedure, a tensile strength test was performed using universal testing machine at a crosshead speed 1 mm/min. The proportions of porosity on the fractured surface were calculated on the images acquired through the scanning electronic microscope. RESULTS. Every specimen of G 3, G 5, IR 3 and IR 5 was fractured on the solder joint area. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between the test groups (P>. 05). There was a negative correlation between porosity formation and tensile strength in all the specimens in the test groups (P <. 05). CONCLUSION. There was no significant difference in ultimate tensile strength of joints and porosity formations between the gas-oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>soldering</b> and infrared ray soldering technique or between the gap distance of 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm.
