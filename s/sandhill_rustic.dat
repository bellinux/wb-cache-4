50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>rustic</b> (Luperina nickerlii) is a noctuid moth {{found in}} various parts of western, {{southern}} and central Europe with several subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Loe Bar is {{the only}} site in Britain where the {{subspecies}} leechi of the <b>sandhill</b> <b>rustic</b> (Luperina nickerlii) moth is found. Two pupae {{were found in the}} sand by the lepidopterists' Barry Goater and M Leech in September 1974. The larvae of leechi feed on the base of the stems and the roots of sand couch-grass (Elymus farctus), from September to early-July. The moths fly from late-July to September. Four sub-species of the <b>sandhill</b> <b>rustic</b> occur in the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|The site is an {{important}} breeding site for natterjack toads, a breed common in mainland Europe, but rare in the UK. Natterjack toads are confined to the most seaward and brackish areas of the reserve, with common frog, common toad and smooth newt dominating in the freshwater habitats. Common lizard is abundant in the fore dunes. The extremely rare moth, the <b>sandhill</b> <b>rustic,</b> is localised in the fore dunes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ecology of the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Rustic</b> moth Luperina nickerlii leechi and its foodplant Sand Couch-grass Elytrigia juncea.   The {{subspecies}} leechi occurs only at one site, Loe Bar near Helston in Cornwall, and hence is considered to be of high nature conservation concern.   The population of this isolated colony is shown to be variable, with estimates for peak count numbers ranging between 69 (in 1991) and 746 (in 2000).   The total area of Elytrigia juncea on Loe Bar varied {{during the course of this}} study between 11549 m 2 and 13930 m 2; not all of this area is utilised by <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Rustic</b> larvae. A strong female bias is shown (2. 8 : 1 female to male) and the adult females show a clumped distribution. No moth was observed to move more than 349 metres, with females in particular crawling rather than flying; males are more active but rarely fly at wind speeds above 2. 8 m/s. Adult moths appear able to tolerate both high daytime temperatures (over 30 °C) at high salinity levels on the exposed shingle near the sea.   They are associated with the coarser element of sand and shingle present on Loe Bar, perhaps because the larvae can move more easily through the larger sand particles. <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Rustic</b> moths prefer the more vigorous Elytrigia juncea plants that occur near the sea; these plants have a large underground biomass (suitable for the larvae which spend 60 % of their time feeding underground) and grow in large clumps joined together by extensive rhizomes along which the larvae can move. The conservation of Sandhill Rustics on Loe Bar depends in the medium term on controlling visitor pressure, maintaining habitat quality and increasing habitat size.   In the longer term, Sandhill Rustics here are threatened by climate change, in particular sea level rise and an increased number of storm events.
