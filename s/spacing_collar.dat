40|$|We prove {{localized}} energy {{estimates for}} the wave equation in domains with a strictly concave boundary when homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann conditions are imposed. By restricting the solution to small, frequency dependent, <b>space</b> time <b>collars</b> of the boundary, it is seen that a stronger gain in regularity can be obtained relative to the usual energy estimates. Mixed norm estimates of Strichartz and square function type follow as a result, using the energy estimates to control error terms which arise in a wave packet parametrix construction. While the latter estimates are not new for Dirichlet conditions, the present approach provides an avenue for treating these estimates when Neumann conditions are imposed. The method also treats Schrödinger equations with time independent coefficients. Comment: 36 page...|$|R

"Sposalizio del Mar", whose {{reference}} was to {{the most}} important ceremony of the Venetian Republic, the Sposalizio Del Mar: the marriage of the Doge to the sea, floated in the Grand Canal between San Marco and San Giorgio. It was a bright yellow ring, based on the Apollo <b>space</b> capsule's flotation <b>collar,</b> filled with the golden detritus of Venetian history to the present. An audio tape of people talking about living {{in relation to the}} sea accompanied it. The piece was ultimately sold to the Province of Lake Como.|$|R
5000|$|The sample {{selection}} procedure is performed to optimize granularity, sample support, and cost. Samples are usually core samples composited over {{the height of}} the mining bench. [...] For hardness parameters, the variogram often increases rapidly near the origin and can reach the sill at distances significantly smaller than the typical drill hole <b>collar</b> <b>spacing.</b> For this reason the incremental model precision due to additional test work is often simply a consequence of the central limit theorem, and secondary correlations are sought to increase the precision without incurring additional sampling and testing costs. These secondary correlations can involve multi-variable regression analysis with other, non-metallurgical, ore parameters and/or domaining by rock type, lithology, alteration, mineralogy, or structural domains.|$|R
30|$|Abutment {{selection}} {{according to}} collar length index {{is a critical}} mechanical factor; selection of longer abutments leads to an increased vertical cantilever which acts as a force magnifier [8]. Vertical cantilever designs increase forces on screws due to the lever effect and, therefore, should be avoided [17, 18]. Although increased restorative vertical <b>space</b> with longer <b>collar</b> length could {{play a role in}} screw loosening, there is no certain evidence that increase in abutment collar length can affect screw loosening. However, considering the abutment height from implant platform to the top of abutment (including abutment collar), an increase in the collar length might result in an increase in the vertical cantilever. To reduce the possibility of screw loosening, reducing the cantilever length has been recommended [9].|$|R

30|$|Exploring {{materials}} on, {{with and}} through the body in context can allow meaning to emerge directly from interaction with the material if one remains open to the unexpected, looking to perceived “missteps” as inspiration. This approach can allow designers to design for the senses from the senses, opening the door for multisensory interactive qualities and complex interrelations between the senses. In the presented cases, in the shift from iteration 1 to 2, Open Up (which neither used the body nor context to frame the design process) lost its relation to the body entirely, shifting the focus from feeling the air around the wearer to reliance on a sensor that measured proximity to others to activate the nets. Sound Embracers (which used the body’s engagement with materials, not the context, to frame the design process) switched the focus from the touch of the fingers, to the <b>space</b> the knitted <b>collar</b> created between the arms and the body as it is stretched. Whereas, Trailblazer (which used the body in context to frame the design process) enhanced the wearer’s relationship with their running body by shifting the focus from maintaining balance to guiding. This development stemmed from {{an exploration of the}} materials on, with {{and through the}} body in a clear context. The results were experienced as meaningful in ways that the other two cases were not.|$|R

One plaque (sapphire center) has a coin suspended from loop at left and right side of plaque. One of the coins is from Iran, minted before 1980. No visible marks or hallmarks...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{the neoliberal}} {{turn of the}} 1980 s created a gendered, male space around beer {{as a function of}} power and social control designed to subjugate both women and working-class males to the new white-collar hegemonic masculinity {{in the wake of the}} second wave of feminism. Research by the beer industry indicates an abandonment of their market by female consumers, and this study contends that hostile gender portrayals in television series and advertisements steered Generation X and millennial women away from the macroindustry beer market. A recent shift in both the media and beer industry from corporate control to grassroots enterprises allowed women to reengage with beer and the social ritual of its consumption through women-only craft beer enthusiast groups that reject the regressive, sexist advertising messages in the mainstream broadcast media. This project uses feminist critical theory to investigate how beer became gendered in the neoliberal media of the past 30 years and the impact of that gendering on the social ritual of beer drinking for millennials and Generation X. This research uses historical and textural analysis to explore the gendering of beer in the mainstream media. An ethnography of women-only beer clubs and in-depth interviews with club members discerns the characteristics of women beer drinkers and determines the role social media plays in the relationship between the craft beer movement and women beer drinkers. Results of this analysis suggest that the media portrayals surrounding beer and its consumption as a male, and largely blue <b>collar,</b> <b>space</b> and ritual that aired on television during Generation X’s and millennials’ formative years contributed to women’s negative impressions of the products brewed by the corporate beer industry and inspired them to consume other alcoholic products, namely craft beer. In addition, the craft beer industry, heavily-run by Gen Xers and millennials, conducts their business and engages social media in an inclusive and collaborative manner as an oppositional response to the macrobrewing industry’s gendering of beer in the media. This dissertation examines women’s involvement with women-only craft beer enthusiast clubs for intellectual and social engagement with both beer and other women and their need for safe spaces that do not include men in response to the hostile gendering of beer in the media and social ritual over the last three decades. The findings herein point to social media as the link between women and their engagement with craft beer, and show that it helped to create a female beer fandom that functions as a participatory culture online and off. Finally, this work asserts that the craft beer industry, and its inclusion of all genders, is both a millennial and feminist movement in response to years of negative, gendering neoliberal media messages employed by the corporate macrobrewing industry...|$|R
