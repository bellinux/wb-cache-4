25|$|Allied {{intelligence}} did {{not fall}} for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to “cut off the Cambrai salient” (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior to a bigger offensive in Flanders or Champagne. Haig privately thought the Guards Division “our only reliable reserve”. He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he “was only afraid that the Enemy would find our front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily”. The claim {{does not appear in}} the official minutes, which merely warn of a “prolonged” German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had come to the same conclusion in January. Haig thought the Canadians “really fine disciplined soldiers now and <b>so</b> <b>smart</b> and clean” compared to the Australians.|$|E

To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin {{to his chest}} and is said to [...] "let his I.Q. go".

During the episode, Homer sings [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>smart!</b> S-M-R-T... I mean S-M-A-R-T!" [...] while he lights his high school diploma (and the house) on fire. During the recording session, Dan Castellaneta was singing the song and accidentally misspelled [...] "smart". The writers decided that it was much funnier that way, because it seemed like something Homer Simpson would do, so they left the joke in. The song has since become a fan favorite.|$|E

Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden.

500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule.

Howard explained, [...] "He's <b>so</b> <b>smart</b> and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E

[...] The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday considered it [...] "that rare movie that transcends its role as pure entertainment to become something genuinely cathartic, even therapeutic, giving children a symbolic language with which to manage their unruliest emotions." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found it [...] "bold, gorgeous, sweet, funny, [...] sometimes heartbreakingly sad," [...] deeming {{it one of the}} best films of the year. Entertainment Weeklys Chris Nashawathy extolled it as [...] "transcendent and touching [...] <b>so</b> <b>smart</b> and psychologically clever." [...] Times Mary Pols felt it a [...] "nearly hallucinogenic, entirely beautiful" [...] work that [...] "defies the conventions of family movies." [...] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic urged readers to view the picture, calling it [...] "Pixar once again at the top of its game, telling the kind of thoughtful, moving meta-story it's hard to imagine being produced anywhere else." [...] Wai Chee Dimock in the Los Angeles Review of Books compared the film to the work of neuroscientists Antonio Damasio, Dacher Keltner, and Oliver Sacks.
