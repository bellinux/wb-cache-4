5|$|Most of Rachel's {{songs are}} solos, with some being group tracks {{and a few}} being duets. About one song in every episode is led by Rachel. Depending on the theme, her song choice changes from Broadway to Top 40 to '60s music. In college, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> more into Broadway songs, because she was at a musical theater college, but did match mostly with {{whatever}} theme the Glee club was doing that week.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch and Moody {{oversaw the}} {{lowering}} of Boat 15 concurrently with Boat 13 and {{it reached the}} water only a minute later, at 1:41a.m. Fireman Frank Dymond {{was put in charge}} of what was the most heavily loaded boat at launching, with about 65 people aboard. It was so heavily loaded that the gunwales were reported to be far down in the water; one female passenger later said that when <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> against the gunwale her hair trailed in the water. The boat {{was one of the last}} to be recovered by Carpathia, at about 7:30a.m.|$|E

25|$|The rioting largely {{died down}} after a heavy {{thunderstorm}} struck {{the area around}} midnight, and gunfire ended around 1 AM. Joyce Arnett, a 26-year-old African American mother of three, {{was shot in the}} head by an unidentified gunman when <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> out a window. African American man Alton Burks was shot in the hip and African American man Wallace Kelly was shot in the jaw by unidentified gunmen as well. A white man and wife, the Nopwaskis, were hit by rocks while riding a public bus and also suffered minor injuries. Another five civilians were shot (but only lightly injured), and three were injured by rocks or bottles, while 12 policemen were injured (although only slightly). Ten buildings were destroyed by fire, and 53 African Americans—most of them teenagers—were arrested.|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, Harlow was {{shooting}} {{a scene in}} which the character she was playing had a fever.

2500|$|The {{report from}} the Finnish team, however, was kept {{confidential}} by the EU until long after the war, and the team leader, Helena Ranta, issued a press release at the time containing her [...] "personal opinion" [...] and indicating different findings. Ranta stated that [...] "...medicolegal investigations [...] cannot give a conclusive {{answer to the question}} whether there was [...] a battle ...", but <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> towards the victims being non-combatants in part because [...] "...no ammunition was found in the pockets" [...] of the bodies she investigated. The report was widely understood as saying that the Finnish team had disproved the finding released by the Yugoslav and Belarusian pathologists, whose tests had shown a positive for gunshot residue on the hands of 37 out of the 40 bodies.|$|E

2500|$|When Daniel comforted {{an upset}} Imogen, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> in and kissed him. While Daniel {{was shocked by}} the kiss, Imogen tried to {{convince}} him that it was [...] "a brain snap and nothing more". Daniel then had to choose whether to tell Amber about the kiss or not. Following his break-up with Amber, Daniel had to assure Imogen that it was nothing to do with their kiss. She then tried to convince Daniel to work things out with Amber, but his [...] "unwavering confidence in their love" [...] had been knocked. Kaplan expressed her wish for Imogen and Daniel to become a couple, saying [...] "I have wanted them to be together from the start. I think they balance each other out and Daniel brings out the best in Imogen, so I'm always hoping that it happens secretly!" [...] Phillipps later admitted that Daniel and Imogen were better suited than Daniel and Amber. He thought they should get together and hoped the writers had noticed that there was a demand for them to be a couple on social media sites.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E
