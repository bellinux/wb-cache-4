5000|$|The Tapboard is also infamous for {{featuring}} a chrome <b>shower</b> <b>hose</b> (which travels {{from one end}} of the instrument to the other) with an egg-timer at one end. Both of these initially appeared to have been added as a joke and for decoration, reflecting the eccentric nature of the instrument and Dunnery's ambivalent relationship with the more ludicrous aspects of rock performance. (Dunnery fostered this impression by joking that the feature was added [...] "to see how fast I'm going - eight thousand notes in the time it takes to boil an egg"). However, in 2009 Farmiloe revealed that the <b>shower</b> <b>hose</b> [...] "actually provided the solution for cable routing, some electrical shielding and the ability to mess with the wiring without taking the thing apart", although he did confess that [...] "the egg timer was added last to help Francis boil a perfect egg for an It Bites breakfast!" ...|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: Nosocomial infections pose {{a serious}} threat to hospitalized patients. An {{estimated}} 100, 000 people die each year from infections acquired while undergoing treatment, despite current prevention measures 1. One area of concern has been waterborne pathogens in hospital showers 2. Bacteria is generally maintained in low concentrations in the water supply. However, stagnant water may reside in <b>shower</b> <b>hoses</b> for hours or days between uses, acting as a reservoir for already present bacteria to reproduce. Without frequent flushing, protective biofilms can develop and potentially harbor opportunistic pathogens 3. These biofilms are nearly impossible to remove without replacing the affected parts. To prevent bacterial buildup, silver impregnated <b>shower</b> <b>hoses</b> were placed into patient rooms. The hoses release silver ions, a natural antimicrobial, into th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Culture and {{quantitative}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (qPCR) assays {{for the detection of}} Legionella were compared on samples from a residential area before and after two interventions. A total of 84 samples were collected from <b>shower</b> <b>hoses</b> and taps as first flush samples and at constant temperature. Samples were grouped according to the origin of the sample, a) circulation water b) water from empty apartments c) water from <b>shower</b> <b>hoses.</b> The aims were to investigate the usefulness of qPCR compared to culture for monitoring remedial actions for elimination of Legionella bacteria and as a tool for risk assessment. Results In water collected from the apartments Legionella spp were detected by qPCR in the concentration range from LOQ to 9. 6 * 10 5 GU/L while L. pneumophila were detected in a range from LOQ to 6. 8 * 10 5 GU/L. By culturing, the legionellae were detected in the range from below detection limit (> 10 CFU/L) to 1. 6 * 10 6 CFU/L. In circulating water and in first flush water from <b>shower</b> <b>hoses,</b> culture and qPCR showed the same tendencies. The overall correlation between the bacteria number detected by culture and the two developed qPCR assays (L. spp and L. pneumophila) was relatively poor (r 2 = 0. 31 for culture and Legionella spp. assay, r 2 = 0. 20 for culture and L. pneumophila assay). Conclusion Detection by qPCR was suitable for monitoring changes in the concentration of Legionella but the precise determination of bacteria is difficult. Risk assessment by qPCR only on samples without any background information regarding treatment, timing, etc is dubious. However, the rapid detection by qPCR of high concentrations of Legionella - especially Legionella pneumophila - is valuable as an indicator of risk, although it may be false positive compared to culture results. On the other hand, the detection of a low number of bacteria by qPCR is a strong indication for the absence of risk. </p...|$|R
50|$|Export's {{video and}} film work is {{concerned}} with the fragmentation of femininity. In opposition to Muehl and Kren’s rapid montage-like films exhibiting shocking, violent and sexual images of the human body, Export’s videos are slower, focusing on the violence tearing within the female body. In her video Mann & Frau & Animal (1970-73), a nude female body lays in a bathtub. The camera slowly surveys the metallic knobs and snaking hoses of the tube, the water trickles on, and finally Export begins to masturbate with the <b>shower</b> <b>hose.</b> As the orgasmic peak approaches the female moans become animal shrieks or the grunts of a possible male spectator and the vagina is overtaken by blackness, slime, and blood. The finale is the photograph of a vagina and the image of a bloody hand dripping onto the photo. The unadorned body is transformed into an image of a savage beast. Export explicitly comments on the cultural civilizing of female sexuality and, consequently, the construction of female representation.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Miller was living in Hampstead in London with Roland Penrose when {{the bombing of the}} city began. Ignoring pleas from friends and family to return to the US, Miller embarked on a new career in photojournalism as the official war photographer for Vogue, documenting the Blitz. Miller was accredited into the U.S. Army as a war correspondent for Condé Nast Publications from December 1942. She teamed up with the American photographer David E. Scherman, a LIFE correspondent on many assignments. Miller traveled to France {{less than a month after}} D-Day and recorded the first use of napalm at the siege of St. Malo, as well as the liberation of Paris, the battle for Alsace, and the horror of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. A photograph by Scherman of Miller in the bathtub, with a <b>shower</b> <b>hose</b> looped in the center behind her head, recollecting a noose, taken at Adolf Hitler's apartment in Munich is one of the most iconic images from the Miller-Scherman partnership. Being one of the first to arrive at Hitler's secret apartments, Miller admits [...] "I had his address in my pocket for years." [...] After taking the bathtub picture, Miller bathed in Hitler's tub and slept in his bed. During this time, Miller photographed dying children in a Vienna Hospital, peasant life in post-war Hungary, corpses of Nazi officers and their families, and finally, the execution of Prime Minister László Bárdossy. After the war, she continued to work for Vogue for a further two years, covering fashion and celebrities.|$|E
40|$|A {{middle-aged man}} was {{admitted}} to our hospital with abdominal pain and bleeding per rectum. Subsequent laparotomy indicated an established faecal peritonitis in relation to an anterior perforation of the upper rectum. He later volunteered that he had anal intercourse 2 days previously with a vibrator at an erotic party. His partner volunteered further information regarding devient practice such as regular insertion of other foreign objects (e. g. <b>shower</b> <b>hose).</b> Tearing of the rectal mucosa following such practices is a recognised complication. However mortality following foreign body perforation is reported as extremely rare in the medical literature. Surgical repair of rectal perforation and intensive treatment did not prevent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) hence leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. This case report highlights the seriousness of rectal injuries following unusual sexual practices. Death in this case {{can be attributed to}} the late presentation and establishe...|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} report of {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) <b>shower</b> <b>hoses</b> becoming hard and brittle throughout the eastern and middle portion of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. No reason has been identified for this phenomenon. The affected cities are located at the paper industries area. We have collected the stiffed <b>hoses</b> attached to <b>shower</b> faucets and examined them for chemical changes. In addition, we have analyzed the water quality of 11 affected cities in Shizuoka {{in an attempt to}} establish a probable bio-physico-chemical chain reaction that could cause such hose degradation. According to elemental analysis, oxygen-containing carbon-based plasticizers may leach out of the hose. As a result, the hoses lost flexibility after one year of use in Shizuoka. The organic nutrient (1, 4 -dioxane) was identified by GC-MS and the utmost number of the heterotrophic bacteria has been detected by PCR-DGGE in the shower water of Shizuoka. The study concludes that the plasticizer disappeared from the stiffed hose and the special characteristics of water in Shizuoka, consisting of organic nutrients, can be used for heterotrophic bacterial growth as a energy source at the shower water temperature, which allows prompt utilization of the plasticizer by increasing abundant bacteria, causing the brittleness of the PVC hose...|$|R
50|$|Small {{hydrogen}} peroxide spills are easily {{dealt with by}} flooding the area with water. Not only does this cool any reacting peroxide but it also dilutes it thoroughly.

40|$|Additional contributor: Andrew Streifel (faculty mentor). In the United States, {{we often}} {{have the luxury}} to assume that water is {{uncontaminated}} and safe. Most of the time, this is true. However, at least {{a small amount of}} bacteria is present in any water system. In shower hoses, water may sit for hours or days without being used. The stagnant water acts as a reservoir for already present bacteria to reproduce until the water is flushed out with the next use. Certain hospitalized patients are especially susceptible to opportunistic pathogens sometimes found in water. At highest risk are those whose immune systems are greatly compromised or suppressed. At the University of Minnesota Medical Center – Fairview, the patients with the weakest immune systems reside in the bone marrow transplant units. Here, water quality is of the utmost important. Two methods were employed to reduce contamination in hospital showers. First, standard shower hoses were replaced with silver lined shower hoses in patient rooms. Silver ions are a known antimicrobial that are released into the water by the silver lining {{on the inside of the}} <b>shower</b> <b>hose.</b> Second, bacterial levels were measured before and after flushing out stagnant water. Silver ions showed varying success while flushing was consistently effective in reducing contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{routes of}} exposure to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) for the general population are inhalation of contaminated indoor air, ingestion of contaminated water and exposure during medical procedures from plastic medical products. � Consumer products containing DEHP include wall coverings, tablecloths, floor tiles, furniture upholstery, <b>shower</b> curtains, garden <b>hoses,</b> swimming pool liners, rainwear, baby pants, dolls, some toys, shoes, automobile upholstery, packaging film, sheathing for wires, medical tubing and blood storage bags. � As a result of concern for potential health effects associated with DEHP, many manufacturers have discontinued its use in their products. � Medical exposures {{are likely to be}} greater than environmental exposures. � Exposure my also occur through dermal contact with plastic clothing such as raincoats.

50|$|In 1996 {{many of the}} U/19 premiership team {{moved into}} the U/23. They were joined by several {{slightly}} older AHJSA players who had Senior Amateur, State League and Premier League experience. These players included Shane Jones, Simon Dawe, David Buckley, Phil Yeardley and Doug Montgomery. The team was coached by John VanDerveeken Snr. The team made the finals but lost to Cumberland in the semi-final after dominating the first half.During 1997 and 1998 the team was training at Dunn Park in Mount Barker. The venue was a football/cricket oval (with concrete pitch), with a tiny uninsulated shed as a change room, with no <b>showers</b> except a <b>hose</b> outside to wash off the mud before going home or to 'Giovanni's' for pizza. Training conditions didn't dampen enthusiasm and the growing confidence within the team and club, instead it seem to strengthen {{the idea that we}} did deserve to play 'Senior' soccer in the State League, because we were being successful even without great training facilities.|$|R
5000|$|More than 2 {{million tons}} of DEHP are {{produced}} worldwide each year. [...] Products that contain DEHP include tablecloths, floor tiles, <b>shower</b> curtains, garden <b>hoses,</b> rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come {{from the use of}} DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners.The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP {{are more likely to have}} higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water.|$|R
50|$|An aged father {{known to}} {{everyone}} as Old Liu (played by Zhu Xu) and his younger, mentally challenged son Liu Erming (Jiang Wu) run {{and live in}} a traditional bathhouse for men in an old district in Beijing. The bathhouse provides a variety of peripheral services, including haircut, massage, shaving, fire cupping, even old-style pedicure, to a motley group of regular customers, {{many of whom are}} retired old Beijingers. The patrons usually spend their entire day, day after day, in the bathhouse, engaging in a game of Chinese chess or cricket fighting. As such, they have formed close bonds not only with one another, but also with Old Liu, who is manager, staff, mediator in squabbles, and marriage consultant all in one. One of the patrons is a man who sings 'O Sole Mio in the shower, but when he goes to sing it in public he loses his ability, until Erming provides him with a <b>shower</b> from a <b>hose.</b> Another patron is Mr. Zhang, whose marriage has been in trouble ever since his wife ran after a thief while naked, and Old Liu arranges a reconciliation by having the man find his wife in the bath. After the bathhouse closes in the evening, Old Liu and Erming go for their daily jog around the neighbourhood, after which they engage in a contest to hold their breath in water as they bathe. Even simple tasks such as cleaning up the bathhouse are tremendous fun for the duo, both of whom behave like little children at these times.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 214 {{rainwater}} samples from 82 tanks {{were collected in}} urban Southeast Queensland (SEQ) in Australia and analysed for the zoonotic bacterial and protozoan pathogen using real-time binary PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) {{analysis was used to}} quantify the risk of infection associated with the exposure to potential pathogens from potable and non-potable uses of roof-harvested rainwater. Of the 214 samples tested, 10. 7 %, 9. 8 %, and 5. 6 %, and 0. 4 % samples were positive for Salmonella invA, Giardia lamblia β-giardin, Legionella pneumophila mip, and Campylobacter jejuni mapA genes. Cryptosporidium parvum could not be detected. The estimated numbers of viable Salmonella spp., G. lamblia β-giradin, and L. pneumophila genes ranged from 1. 6 × 101 to 9. 5 × 101 cells, 1. 4 × 10 - 1 to 9. 0 × 10 - 1 cysts, and 1. 5 × 101 to 4. 3 × 101 per 1000 ml of water, respectively. Six risk scenarios were considered from exposure to Salmonella spp., G. lamblia and L. pneumophila. For Salmonella spp., and G. lamblia, these scenarios were: (1) liquid ingestion due to drinking of rainwater on a daily basis (2) accidental liquid ingestion due to garden hosing twice a week (3) aerosol ingestion due to showering on a daily basis, and (4) aerosol ingestion due to hosing twice a week. For L. pneumophila, these scenarios were: (5) aerosol inhalation due to showering on a daily basis, and (6) aerosol inhalation due to hosing twice a week. The risk of infection from Salmonella spp., G. lamblia, and L. pneumophila {{associated with the use of}} rainwater for <b>showering</b> and garden <b>hosing</b> was calculated to be well below the threshold value of one extra infection per 10, 000 persons per year in urban SEQ. However, the risk of infection from ingesting Salmonella spp. and G. lamblia via drinking exceeds this threshold value, and indicates that if undisinfected rainwater were ingested by drinking, then the gastrointestinal diseases of Salmonellosis and Giardiasis is expected to range from 5. 0 × 100 to 2. 8 × 101 (Salmonellosis) and 1. 0 × 101 to 6. 4 × 101 (Giardiasis) cases per 10, 000 persons per year, respectively. Since this health risk seems higher than that expected from the reported incidences of gastroenteritis, the assumptions used to estimate these infection risks are critically examined. Nonetheless, it would seem prudent to disinfect rainwater for potable use...|$|R
