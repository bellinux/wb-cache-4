5|$|In 1962, Melbourne {{began the}} year's {{activities}} at the Royal Hobart Regatta, before sailing to her <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> deployment, by way of Adelaide and Fremantle. After <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> duties were completed, the carrier visited Japan, Guam, and Manus Island before returning to Sydney in late July. In September, Melbourne reprised her role {{as the leader of}} Exercise Tuckerbox II. The 10,000th catapult launch from Melbourne occurred in late 1962. The carrier's annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October. At the beginning of 1963, Melbourne again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta, which was immediately followed by a deployment to the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> including involvement in SEATO Exercise Sea Serpent. The 20,000th landing on Melbourne was performed in April by a Gannet, and in September, Melbourne participated in Exercise Carbine near Hervey Bay, Queensland.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division in Palestine was {{initially}} posted {{to the region}} as the Imperial <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve.</b> It was envisioned as a mobile peace keeping force, positioned {{to be able to}} respond quickly to any area of the British Empire. In fact the division became involved in an internal security role between 1945 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Independent Army was {{commanded}} by Armijski đeneral Dimitrije Živković, and was {{originally intended to}} form the <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve</b> for the VKJ. It was deployed around Belgrade and in the Banat region east of the Tisza. It held two infantry divisions in reserve in the lower Morava valley.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 crisis many nations created <b>strategic</b> {{petroleum}} <b>reserves</b> (SPRs), crude oil inventories (or stockpiles) held by the governments of particular countries or private industry, for the purpose of providing economic and national security during an energy crisis. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, approximately [...] of oil are held in <b>strategic</b> <b>reserves,</b> of which 1.4 billion is government-controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. At the moment the US <b>Strategic</b> Petroleum <b>Reserve</b> {{is one of the largest}} <b>strategic</b> <b>reserves,</b> with much of the remainder held by the other 26 members of the International Energy Agency. Recently, other non-IEA countries have begun creating their own <b>strategic</b> petroleum <b>reserves,</b> with China being the largest of these new reserves. Since current consumption levels are neighboring /day, in the case of a dramatic worldwide drop in oil field output as suggested by some peak oil analysts , the <b>strategic</b> petroleum <b>reserves</b> are unlikely to last for more than a few months.|$|R

5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, {{prompted by a}} rise in Malayan Communist guerrillas in Malaya (later Malaysia). Australia, {{as a member of}} the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, first deployed two RAAF squadrons to the region in 1950. In 1955, the Far East <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> was created as a concentration of Commonwealth military forces (primarily British, New Zealand, and Australian) in Malaya for the protection of that nation from communist threats. Australia's commitment included two destroyers or frigates on station at any time, plus an annual visit by an aircraft carrier, and additional ships as needed. Training for the potentiality of war was the main occurrence for ships deployed to the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> with RAN personnel gaining experience in working as part of a larger naval organisation.|$|E
5|$|For the Germans, {{the battle}} was the final {{strategic}} offensive {{that they were able}} to launch on the Eastern Front. As the Allied invasion of Sicily began Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve</b> for the Eastern Front. Germany's extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division {{had been}} named the Imperial <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> and served in Egypt until September 1945, when it moved to Palestine in an internal-security role, to counter the {{activities}} of the Jewish paramilitary movements Hagana, Palmach, Irgun and the Stern Gang. When the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, the 6th became the only airborne division in the British Army.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF squadrons {{remained}} at Butterworth {{as part of}} Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve.</b> Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No.77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No.79 Squadron at Ubon, Thailand. The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance {{that they were not}} drawn from the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos.3 and 77Squadrons continued to rotate through No.79 Squadron on a regular basis. The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with Sidewinder missiles, were responsible for regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place. From 26October until 27November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No.77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No.78 Wing in November 1967, No.77 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, 1960, was a {{bad year}} for the carrier's air group, with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard Melbourne. All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March, with three attributed to aircrew error and one to brake failure. The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide, followed by {{a visit to the}} Royal Hobart Regatta. The carrier's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to Melbournes 1961 deployment to the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> the carrier visited Bombay, Karachi, and Trincomalee. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. Melbourne returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, Melbourne was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the Coral Sea. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve,</b> and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve.</b> It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in {{particular}} the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve.</b> Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E

40|$|An {{objective}} function {{is a key}} component of a strategic portfolio management model used to determine the optimal allocations of assets and, possibly, their associated liabilities over some investment horizon. The author discusses investment philosophies and perspectives for the management of foreign reserves, and investigates how to translate the three common policy objectives for reserves (liquidity, safety, and return) into {{objective function}}s for <b>strategic</b> <b>reserves</b> management. Stochastic programming is identified as an advantageous modelling framework to capture the objectives of foreign reserves management, and a <b>strategic</b> <b>reserves</b> management model is illustrated that trades off expected net returns with costs and liquidity issues related to a potential liquidation of a portion of the portfolio.

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the Second World War in Europe {{the brigade}} saw active service in Italy, the South of France and Greece. At {{the end of the}} European war the brigade {{returned}} to the United Kingdom and was intended to join the 44th Indian Airborne Division in the Far East, for service against the Japanese Empire, but the war ended before they sailed. Instead the brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been named the Imperial <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> and sent to serve in the Mandate of Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne spent {{ten weeks}} at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, Melbourne was {{involved}} in <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the discovery that Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{based at}} the Royal Navy's Ħal Far airfield, in {{south-east}} Malta, the wing moved in June 1953 to the centrally located RAF Station Ta'Kali, command of which was given to Group Captain Eaton. By this time, with plans afoot to form a Far East <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> to contain communist aggression in South East Asia, the British and Australian governments began to discuss withdrawing No.78 Wing from the Middle East when its planned two-year garrison was complete. Eaton handed over command to Wing Commander Geoff Newstead in September 1954. The wing flew its last sorties in December, and returned to Australia the following month.|$|E

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{military}} forces of INTERFET were Australian—more than 5,500 troops at its peak, including an infantry brigade, with armoured and aviation support—while eventually 22 nations contributed to the force which at its height numbered over 11,000 troops. The United States provided crucial logistic and diplomatic support throughout the crisis, while the cruiser USS Mobile Bay protected the INTERFET naval fleet and a US Marine infantry battalion of 1,000 men—plus organic armour and artillery—was also stationed off the coast aboard the USS Belleau Wood to provide a <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve</b> {{in the event of}} significant armed opposition.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the <b>strategic</b> <b>reserve,</b> on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing {{to send troops}} to Borneo in the opening stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia {{as part of the}} Far East <b>Strategic</b> <b>Reserve</b> (FESR) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
