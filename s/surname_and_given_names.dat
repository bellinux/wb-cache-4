5000|$|Foreign wrestlers, {{largely due}} to the {{differences}} in the construction of their names, are from the beginning obliged to take a shikona different from their given <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>names.</b> Much more often than Japanese wrestlers, they are often shikona that give a clue as to their origin: the names of Russian brothers Rohō (露鵬) and Hakurozan (白露山) both contained the character 露, which is an abbreviation for Russia; Kotoōshū (琴欧州), a Bulgarian, the first European to reach the makuuchi (top) division, contains the characters 欧州, meaning Europe. Another notable example is the American Henry Armstrong Miller, who wrestled under the shikona Sentoryū (戦闘竜), which means [...] "fighting war dragon" [...] but is also homophonous with St. Louis, his city of origin. Mongolians are often identifiable as such, because many of them use either the character for eagle 鷲 (read: washi), horse 馬 (read: uma, ma, or ba), wolf 狼 (read: rō), or dragon 竜 or 龍 (read: ryū), which are all venerated in Mongolia.|$|E
