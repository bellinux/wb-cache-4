The retractable <b>sonar</b> <b>dome,</b> located near the bow, was a weak point in the hull.|$|E
500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned <b>sonar</b> <b>dome,</b> the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E

One of the biggest obstacles to widespread adaptation of composite materials {{is a lack of}} complete understanding and simple design rules for these materials, especially under extreme loading conditions. For this reason, the present work looks to expand the current knowledge of composite behavior by examining the problem of implosion. A comprehensive study on the hydrostatic implosion of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite tubes is conducted experimentally to examine the failure and damage mechanisms of collapse. Experiments are performed in a pressure vessel designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure through the collapse. Filament-wound, braided, and roll-wrapped carbon-fiber/epoxy tubes are studied to explore the effect of geometry and reinforcement architecture on the modes of failure. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation technique, which is first calibrated for the underwater environment, is used to capture the full-field deformation and velocities during the implosion event. Dynamic pressure transducers are employed to measure the pressure pulses generated by the event and evaluate its damage potential. The results show that composites with braided fabric reinforcements are found to have more damage potential to adjacent structures than those containing unidirectional reinforcements, as they release pressure waves with significantly greater impulse. The mechanisms and pressure fields associated with the hydrostatic implosion of glass-fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes with varying reinforcement are investigated using high-speed photography. Experiments are conducted in a large pressure vessel, designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure throughout collapse. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is used to capture full-field displacements, and dynamic pressure transducers measure the pressure pulse generated by the collapse. Results show that braided GFRP tubes release pressure waves with significantly greater impulse upon collapse as compared to filament-wound tubes, increasing their damage potential. An experimental study on the underwater buckling of composite and metallic tubes is conducted to evaluate and compare their collapse mechanics. Experiments are performed in a pressure vessel designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure through the collapse. Filament-wound carbon-fiber/epoxy, glass/polyester (PE) tubes, and aluminum tubes are studied to explore the effect of material type on the structural failure. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation technique is used to capture the full-field deformation and velocities during the implosion event. Local pressure fields generated by the implosion event are measured using dynamic pressure transducers to evaluate the strength of the emitted pressure pulse. The results show that glass/PE tubes release the weakest pressure pulse, and carbon/epoxy tubes release the strongest upon collapse. In each case, the dominating mechanisms of failure control the amount of flow energy released. An experimental study on the hydrostatic implosion of carbon-fiber reinforced epoxy composite tubes is conducted to explore unique failure and damage mechanisms of collapse. Experiments are performed in a pressure vessel designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure through the collapse. Filament-wound carbon-fiber/epoxy tubes are studied using high-speed photography to explore the effect of complex damage on the modes of failure. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation technique, which is first calibrated for the underwater environment, is used to capture the full-field deformation and velocities during the implosion event. Fourier Series deformation models are used to extract buckling modes from displacement data. The results reveal that the presence of damage in the structure can cause the mode shape to change as the structure deforms. An experimental study on the underwater collapse of composite tubes with polymeric coatings is conducted in an attempt to mitigate the implosion pressure pulse released. Experiments are performed in a pressure vessel designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure during collapse. Filament-wound carbon-fiber/epoxy tubes are studied with polyurea coatings of different thicknesses on the interior and exterior of the tube to explore the effects of these configurations on implosion pulse mitigation. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique is used to capture the full-field deformation and velocities during the implosion event. Local pressure fields generated by the implosion event are measured using dynamic pressure transducers to evaluate the strength of the emitted pressure pulses. Local pressure data and DIC results are used to obtain a measure of normalized energy released during implosion. Results show that thick interior coatings significantly reduce the energy released in the pressure pulse by slowing the collapse and softening the initial wall-to-wall contact. In contrast, thick exterior coatings increase this energy by suppressing damage, thereby reducing the energy absorption capacity of the structure. A comprehensive investigation on the implosion of composite cylinders subjected to a nearby explosion is performed. Experiments are conducted in a large pressure vessel, designed to provide constant hydrostatic pressure throughout the event. Carbon fiber/epoxy filament-wound tubes are studied with constant hydrostatic pressure and varying charge standoff distances to determine the effect of the explosive loading on the mechanisms of collapse. 3 -D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is used to capture the full-field displacements and velocities during the implosion event, and to characterize the initial dynamic response of the tube. Dynamic pressure transducers measure the shock waves generated by the explosive and also the pressure pulse generated by the collapse. Results show that different magnitudes of explosive loading produce drastic differences in the way implosions are initiated, and in the extent of damage to the structure. Experiments with strong explosive loading show immediate collapse of the tube upon the arrival of shock wave. Relatively smaller explosive loading result in collapses due to the additional bubble pulse loading, or after accumulating damage for extended periods of time...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Kavitasyon lokal basıncın, ortam sıcaklığındaki buhar basıncının altına düşmesi durumunda meydana gelen fiziksel bir olaydır. Sabit sıcaklıktaki bir akışkanın lokal basıncı (p) doymuş buhar basıncının 〖(p〗_v) altına düşmesi durumunda akışkan yapısı parçalanmaya başlar. Bu olaya "kavitasyon" denir. Kavitasyon pervane dümen, {{stabilize}} için bulunan finler, pompa ve türbin kesitlerinde meydana gelebilir. Bu çalışmada sınır elemanları yöntemi ile (Boundary Element Method-BEM) iki boyutlu hidrofoiller üzerindeki basınç dağılımları hesaplanıp kavitasyon kova diyagramları (zarf eğrileri, kavitasyon bukleleri) elde edilmiştir. Her bir durum, kavitasyon başlangıç durumu ve kısmi kavitasyon durumu için ayrı ayrı incelenmiş elde edilen sonuçlar birbirleri ile karşılaştırılmıştır.   Çalışmada iki boyutlu hidrofoil olarak dört basamaklı NACA foil geometrileri ve bir sualtı türbinine ait S 184 geometrisi kullanılmıştır. NACA foil geometrisini temsil eden 4 basamaklı sayı dizisindeki her bir rakam geometrik olarak bir değişkeni temsil etmektedirler. Bu çalışmada mevcut parametreler sistemli olarak değiştirilip farklı geometriler elde edilmiştir. Elde edilen her bir geometri için kavitasyon kova diyagramı hesaplanıp bu parametrelerin bu diyagramlara etkisi analiz edilmiştir. Bu analizler sonucunda hidrofoilin hangi durumda kavitasyon yapıp yapmadığı tayin edilmeye çalışılmıştır.   Kısmi kavitasyon durumu incelenirken kısmi kavitasyon yapmaya müsaade eden bir panel yöntemi PCPAN kullanılmıştır. PCPAN programında kavitasyon boyu girdi olarak tanımlanır ve kavitasyon sayısı iteratif bir şekilde bulunur. Bu kısımda kavitasyon boyu l/c= 0. 5 ve l/c= 0. 7 için incelenmiştir. Kısmi kavitasyon için kavitasyon boyunun kord boyunun 3 / 4 'üne eşit olduğu durum fiziksel olarak özel bir anlam taşır. Kavitasyon sayısı küçüldükçe kavitasyon boyunun arttığı bilinmektedir. Foil için kavitasyon sayısı küçüldükçe kavitasyon boyu artar. Fakat kavitasyon boyunun 3 / 4 'üne yaklaştığında kavitasyon sayısı küçülse dahi kavitasyon boyu artmamaktadır. Bu durum kavitasyon sayısının bir sınırı geçmesine kadar böyle devem eder. Bir değerden sonra yeniden kavitasyon sayısı küçülterek kavitasyon boyu artırılabilir. Fiziksel olarak stabil olmayan bu nokta için kavitasyon kova diyagramı elde edilerek bu özel durum incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Fakat PCPAN programı kavitasyon boyu 0. 75 c tanımlandığında doğru çalışmamaktadır. Bu durumda programın doğru çalıştığı 0. 75 c noktasına en yakın değer olan 0. 7 c için hesaplar yapılmıştır. Son olarak ise bir sualtı türbini kesitine ait olan S 184 geometrisi kavitasyon başlangıç durumu için incelenmiştir. Cavitation {{is defined}} as the process of formation of the vapor phase of a liquid when it is subjected to reduced pressures at constant ambient temperature. Cavitation occurs not only at propellers but everywhere where locally high velocities appear, e. g. at rudders, shaft brackets, struts, <b>sonar</b> <b>domes,</b> hydrofoils, stabilizing fins, pump, turbine. Cavitation {{is a result of the}} pressure reduction. So cavitation can be prevented or the severity reduced with pressure control. Cavitation occurs in areas where pressure values vary sharply. It is an undesirable phenomenon in many engineering application due to the detrimental effects of cavitation such as erosion (in the case of developed cavitation if the velocity difference between the liquid and the solid wall is high enough), noise, alteration of the performance of the system (reduction in thrust of propeller, increase in drag of foil, etc.) and vibration caused by the growth and collapse of vapour bubbles. Vibration and noise arising from cavitation are serious problem especially types of ships where sonar device.   Cavitation may be classified by location (tip cavitation, root cavitation, leading edge or trailing edge cavitation, suction side (back) cavitation, face cavitation etc.), cavitation form (sheet cavitation, cloud cavitation, bubble cavitation, vortex cavitation), dynamic properties of cavitation (stationary, instationary, migrating).   In the present thesis, cavitation was analyzed using bucket diagram. Bucket diagram represent the cavitation behavior of a blade section in a two dimensional sense. This diagram is plotted as a function of section angle of attack (α) versus section cavitation number (σ). The width of the bucket (α) is a measure of the tolerance of the section to cavitation free operations. Whilst useful for design purposes the bucket diagram is based on 2 D flow characteristics and can be therefore give misleading results in areas of strong 3 D flow; for example near the blade tip and root. Four regions that make up the bucket diagram, can be identified; 1. Cavitation free area inside the bucket. 2. Back sheet outside the upper part of bucket 3. Face cavitation outside the lower part of bucket 4. Bubble cavitation outside the side of bucket. In the present thesis, pressure distribution is calculated on two dimensional geometry of hydrofoil through BEM (Boundary element method) and cavitation bucket diagram is plotted. Each case is analyzed for cavitation inception case and partial cavitation case and obtained results were compared with each other. Constant source-dipole panel method is used to calculate pressure distribution at cavitation inception case.   PCPAN programme is used to calculate pressure distribution at partial cavitation case. PCPAN, is the code prepared by the FORTRAN programming language that sheet cavitation on the hydrofoil solves potential based panel method code. Sheet cavitation is solved by low-order potential based boundary element method in non-linear theory. PCPAN solves the 2 D fixed-length partial cavitation problem. In PCPAN, cavity length, angle of attack (α) hydrofoil geometry, maximum iteration number are defined as programme input. The cavity shape, the foil lift and drag and cavitation number are all output. The exact nonlinear solution is found by the iterative method. Some simplifications have been made to create the numerical model. Numerical model of PCPAN results from the following simplifications: Flow is steady an incompressible. All types of cavitation is neglected except sheet cavity. No mass flux between cavity and flow. Cavity height is zero at cavity leading and trailing edges. Cavity length is fixed. Pressure is constant on the cavity surface Inside of cavitation bucket is cavitation free area. Partial cavitation condition has been investigated for two different cavitation length (l = 0. 5 c  and  l = 0. 7 c). In all cases examined; l = 0. 7 c  cavitation bucket curve wider than  l = 0. 5 c  cavitation bucket curve. In the section of partial cavitation, the inner part of curve is safe area for specified length of cavitation. For example; cavity whose length is equal to 0. 5 times chord length inside area of l= 0. 5 c  curve. It is not clear whether occurring shorter cavity inside l= 0. 5 c cavitation bucket. In this study the four-digit NACA foil geometry and a two-dimensional hydrofoil S 184 of marine current turbine geometry is used. In the early 1930 s, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics constructed airfoil series rationally and systematically.  The geometry of the NACA airfoil is defined by means of logical numbering system.  Each digits described parameter of geometry. Maximum camber as percentage of the chord is described first digit.  The distance of maximum camber from the airfoil leading edge in tens of percents of the chord. (For NACA 2412 maximum camber 0, 02 c; location of maximum camber along the chord from the leading edge 0, 4 c; maximum thickness 0. 12 c.) Different geometries are obtained by changing this three parameters in a systematic way.  The effect of three parameters are analyzed by comparing cavitation bucket diagrams for each geometry. As a result of analysis, geometry which whether to occur cavitation or not, is determined. Underwater currents that have potential for power generation. The marine current turbines (MCTs) exploit underwater currents for energy generation. Cavitation is usually seen in each of the turbine blades. It is certainly a case to be considered in the MCT's performance analysis. In this study S 184 's bucket diagram was plotted and analyzed.   The analysis obtained as a result can be listed as follows.   Effect of maximum thickness ratio varies depending on the range of    〖-C〗_P. This result is the same for partial cavitation condition and cavitation inception condition. For cavitation inception condition, risk of cavitation reduced as increasing chamber ratio in positive angle of attack. Conclusion is not reached about chamber ratio for partial cavitation condition. Partial cavitation condition has been investigated for two different cavitation length (l/c= 0. 5 and    l/c= 0. 7). The results are the same features for both cases. When S 184 's geometry is observed, maximum chamber is close to trailing edge. Minimum cavitation risk for marine current turbines is provided by being close to trailing edge. Yüksek LisansM.
