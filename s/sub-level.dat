Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E

25|$|The Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Grasslands Natural Region, one of six natural {{regions in}} Alberta. Within the Grasslands Region, it {{is part of the}} Dry Mixedgrass Natural Subregion, {{characterized}} by the most arid conditions in Alberta, with hot summers, cold winters with little snow cover, and high evaporation leaving a large moisture deficit in the growing season. Annual precipitation averages less than 300mm (12 inches). Soils of the area are primarily solonetzic and brown chernozemic. At the next <b>sub-level,</b> {{it is part of the}} Northwestern Glaciated Plains Ecoregion, the predominant ecoregion throughout the Milk River watershed. With its diverse landscape of grasslands, shrubs, badlands, wetlands, and riparian woodlands, the Milk River Natural Area supports a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species in a relatively small amount of space. Overall, 80% of Alberta's species at risk are concentrated in the Milk River Watershed area as a whole. Fire is a significant ecological process, with the last large wildfire having occurred in August 2007. It was caused by a lightning strike in Montana and crossed the international border, but was quickly suppressed after burning 125 hectares of the natural area and 38 hectares in neighboring Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve. As a relatively large and undisturbed representation of natural mixedgrass containing rare or unique landforms, habitat for focal species, and intact riparian areas, it has been identified as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) with national significance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{aesthetic}} experience {{is defined as}} an experience qualitatively different from everyday experience and similar to other exceptional states of mind. Three crucial characteristics of aesthetic experience are discussed: fascination with an aesthetic object (high arousal and attention), appraisal of the symbolic reality of an object (high cognitive engagement), and a strong feeling of unity with the object of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal. In a proposed model, two parallel levels of aesthetic information processing are proposed. On the first level two <b>sub-levels</b> of narrative are processed, story (theme) and symbolism (deeper meanings). The second level includes two <b>sub-levels,</b> perceptual associations (implicit meanings of object’s physical features) and detection of compositional regularities. Two <b>sub-levels</b> are defined as crucial for aesthetic experience, appraisal of symbolism and compositional regularities. These <b>sub-levels</b> require some specific cognitive and personality dispositions, such as expertise, creative thinking, and openness to experience. Finally, feedback of emotional processing is included in our model: appraisals of everyday emotions are specified {{as a matter of}} narrative content (eg, empathy with characters), whereas the aesthetic emotion is defined as an affective evaluation in the process of symbolism appraisal or the detection of compositional regularities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{identify}} the different human agents and their different activities which cause resource curse – a phenomenon that has plagued Sub-Saharan Africa. In order to do the identification, the paper employed the levels of analysis approach. The approach shows that the relevant agents and factors can be analysed at the micro and macro levels. At the micro level, there are the individual, collective and corporate <b>sub-levels,</b> while at the macro level there are the state and the global institutional order <b>sub-levels.</b> The paper was divided into three parts. The first part explicated the different levels and <b>sub-levels</b> of analyses. The second part dealt with the micro level while the third part dealt with the macro level. The end-result is that despite the complexity of resource curse and the multifaceted nature of the activities that cause resource curse, we can still identify the different causal roles played by different agents, and thus attribute causal responsibility to the agents...|$|R

40|$|Modern Business {{statistics}} often {{faces the}} difficulty that an increasing demand {{of information on}} <b>sub-levels</b> defined by regions or cross-classifications of variables such as industry classes and business size can be observed, eg for measures of competit-iveness by policy makers. In order to enable data producers to provide estimates on those <b>sub-levels,</b> sophisticated stratifications are implemented in the sampling design. These detailed stratifications may produce two difficulties. First, many strata con-tain only very few elements and, hence, {{make it difficult to}} derive optimal sample sizes. Second, statistical model building may suffer from the survey weights derived under these constraints. Additionally, optimization of sampling designs may have a strong impact on the accuracy of different estimation strategies. The aim of the pa-per is to evaluate different sampling designs in the context of estimation on <b>sub-levels</b> by regions and cross-classifications and their impact on these domain estimates. As estimators of interest, the Horvitz-Thompson- and generalized regression estimator as design-based methods as well as the Battese-Harter-Fuller-, the You-Rao-, and the augmented estimators are considered.

30|$|In Japan, {{efforts were}} made by the Japan Language Testing Association (JLTA) to adapt the CEFR to the local context. A Japanese version of the CEFR, the CEFR-J, has been {{developed}} and validated (www.cefr-j.org). The adaptation involves mainly two things: adjusting the difficulty level of SASs (self-assessment statements) and investigating the distribution of learners’ proficiency across the CEFR levels. Major changes to the CEFR include level adjustment, wording of some descriptors, and supplementing descriptors with examples to facilitate understanding. The surveys on Japanese learners’ English proficiency conducted by the Eiken Foundation in Japan among the lower secondary school students in a prefecture and employees of an electronics manufacturer revealed that more than 80 % of Japanese EFL learners are non/basic users (A 1 or A 2), less than 20 % at B levels (independent users) and almost none at C levels (proficient users) (see Negishi 2012 for a report of the surveys). The resultant CEFR-J therefore has a level A with six <b>sub-levels</b> (Pre-A 1, A 1.1, A 1.2, A 1.3, A 2.1, and A 2.2), a level B with four <b>sub-levels</b> (B 1.1, B 1.2, B 2.1 and B 2.2), and a level C with two <b>sub-levels</b> (C 1 and C 2) (see Negishi and Tono 2014).|$|R
