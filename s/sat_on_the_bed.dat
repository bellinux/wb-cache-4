Star said Jackson stayed for two minutes and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> but neither brother spoke a word during that time. According to Gavin, the boys were [...] "just laying there" [...] when Jackson [...] "ran up there and got something and went back downstairs," [...] without saying anything. Gavin did not describe Jackson as having an erection.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1997, Diana visited South Africa, {{where she}} met with President Nelson Mandela. On 2 November 2002, Mandela {{announced}} that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund would be teaming up with the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to help victims of AIDS. They had planned {{the combination of the}} two charities a few months before her death.

In October 2017, the Attitude magazine honoured Diana with its Legacy Award for her HIV/AIDS work. Prince Harry accepted the award on behalf of his mother.|$|E

60|$|Her strange, lifted belly, {{big with}} his child! Had he {{no right to}} be there? He felt his {{presence}} a violation. Yet he had his right to be there. He went and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|He strolled {{out on the}} {{sleeping}} porch and looked at Paula's picture under the barometers. He turned it to the wall, and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and regarded the blankness for a space. Then he turned it back again.|$|E

60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{completely}} dressed, {{but hardly}} daring to move {{for fear of}} waking her aunt.

60|$|Harz <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> again, {{and for a}} {{long time}} stayed without moving, his eyes fixed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. The sight of him, so desperate and miserable, hurt the young doctor.|$|R

60|$|For five minutes, Tommy <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in the dingy {{room next}} door. His {{heart was beating}} violently. He had risked all on this throw. How would they decide?

60|$|Edith, {{before she}} went to bed that night, crept up to her brother's bedroom and seated herself on the bedside.
