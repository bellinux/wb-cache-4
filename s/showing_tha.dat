40|$|Abstract— We {{analyze the}} {{capacity}} scaling laws of clustered ad hoc networks in which nodes are distributed {{according to a}} doubly stochastic shotnoise Cox process. We identify five different operational regimes, and for each regime we devise a communication strategy that allows to achieve a throughput to within a poly-logarithmic factor (in the number of nodes) of the maximum theoretical capacity. I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK The capacity of ad hoc wireless networks has been traditionally studied considering single-user communication schemes over pointto-point links [1].

40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a wide variety of cognitive tasks, such as perception, selective attention, associative learning, and memory. Extensive experimental and theoretical work in tasks involving learning and memory has suggested that ACh reports on unfamiliarity and controls plasticity and effective network connectivity. Based on these computational and implementational insights, we develop a theory of cholinergic modulation in perceptual inference. We propose that ACh levels reflect the uncertainty associated with topdown information, and have the effect of modulating the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processing in determining the appropriate neural representations for inputs. We illustrate our proposal by means of an hierarchical hidden Markov model, <b>showing</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of oligomeric aggregates, {{which is often}} observed {{during the process of}} amyloid formation, has recently attracted much attention because it has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. We provide a description of a sequence-indepedent mechanism by which polypeptide chains aggregate by forming metastable oligomeric intermediate states prior to converting into fibrillar structures. Our results illustrate that the formation of ordered arrays of hydrogen bonds drives the formation of b-sheets within the disordered oligomeric aggregates that form early under the effect of hydrophobic forces. Individual b-sheets initially form with random orientations and subsequently tend to align into protofilaments as their lengths increase. Our results suggest that amyloid aggregation represents an example of the Ostwald step rule of first-order phase transitions by <b>showing</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal control model to analyze reforestations with two different species, including commercial values, carbon sequestration and biodiversity or scenic values. We solve the model qualitatively with general functions {{and discuss the}} implications of partial or total internalization of environmental values, showing that internalizing only carbon sequestration may have negative impacts on biodiversity-scenic values. To evaluate the practical relevance, we compare reforestations in the South-west of Spain with cork-oaks (a slow growing native species) and with eucalyptus (a fast growing alien species). We do the analysis with two different carbon crediting methods: the Carbon Flow Method and the Ton Year Accounting Method. With the. first method forest surface increases more, but using mainly eucalyptus. With the second, additional reforestations are done mainly using cork-oaks. We value the impact on visitors of these reforestations using stated preferences methods, <b>showing</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

This concern has prompted great interest in the mechanisms responsible for the development of obesity. In their review paper, Nedergaard et al. (6) discuss the evidence indicating that the brown adipose tissue plays a significant and contributory role in the patho-genesis of human obesity through the stimulation of the sym-pathetic nervous system. As outlined by Nedergaard et al., the link between the brain and the adipose tissue occurring via the sympathetic nervous system might be critical in the pathogen-esis of obesity. Indeed, recent data complement and corrobo-rate the review of Nedergaard et al. In their recent paper, Kuo et al.

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} linear viscoelastic rheological relation {{constitutes a}} suitable model for describing {{the variety of}} phenomena which occur in seismic wavefields. This rheology, known also as Boltzmann’s superposition principle, expresses the stress as a time convolution of a fourth rank tensorial relaxation function with the strain tensor. The first problem is to establish the time dependence of the relaxation tensor in a general and consistent way. Two kernels based on the general standard linear solid are identified with the mean stress and with the deviatoric components of the stress tensor in a. given coordinate system, respectively. Additional conditions are that in the elastic limit the relaxation matrix must give the elasticity matrix, and in the isotropic limit the relaxation matrix must approach the isotropic-viscoelastic matrix. The resulting rheological relation provides the framework for incorporating anelas-ticity in time-marching methods for computing synthetic seismograms. Through a plane wave analysis of the anisotropic-viscoelastic medium, the phase, group and energy velocities are calculated in function of the complex velocity, <b>showing</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E

THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A MODEL of the term structure of credit spreads on sover-eign bonds that accommodates: (i) Default or repudiation: The sovereign an-nounces that it will stop making payments on its debt; (ii) Restructuring or renegotiation: The sovereign and the lenders ‘‘agree’ ’ to reduce (or postpone) the remaining payments; and (iii) A‘‘regime switch,’ ’ such as a change of government or the default of another sovereign bond that changes the perceived riskof future defaults.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors that lead to successful edu-cational partnerships between school staff and families. The method for this investigation focused on asking parents how and why they were involved in their children’s education and what factors influenced their participation. The study was conducted at the Patrick O’Hearn Elementary School, in Boston, MA, where, according to yearly survey data collected by the school, at least 90 % of the parents participated in one or more of the home- or school-based family engagement activi-ties, despite the school’s urban, low socioeconomic setting. By gathering parents’ own descriptions of their participation in their children’s education, this research study sought to develop a deeper understanding of the parents ’ perceptions of involvement and explored whether their descriptions would match existing typol-ogies or fall outside existing definitions. Another goal of the research was to inves-tigate factors that influenced parents ’ involvement in their children’s education.

The 16 S rRNA gene sequence of strain WA 201 T showed closest similarity to the type strains of Micromonospora carbonacea (98 ? 5 %) and Micromonospora matsumotoense (98 ? 1 %). The chemotaxonomic results confirmed the taxonomic position of the isolate in the genus Micromonospora. DNA–DNA relatedness values supported the classification of this isolate as a novel species. A number of physiological and biochemical tests were able to distinguish strain WA 201 T from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Therefore, it is proposed that isolate WA 201 T (=DSM 44830 T =LMG 22229 T) be considered the type strain representing a novel species, Micromonospora mirobrigensis sp. nov. Representatives of the genus Micromonospora (Ørskov, 1923) are reported to inhabit soil, water, marine environments and sediments (Lüdemann & Brodsky, 1963; Kawamoto, 1989).

Constructing a static quantum computing machine is within the reach of today’s or the foreseeable future’s technology. Such a machine works in the static manner so that dissipation does it no harm but helps. A general computational task is accomplished in two steps.

It is done upon the computer being constructed and the input being set.

Let D(A) denote the set of all directions of A at 0 ∈ R n. Let A, B ⊂ R n be subanalytic set-germs at 0 ∈ R n such that 0 ∈ A ∩ B. We study the problem of whether the dimension of the common direction set, dim(D(A) ∩ D(B)) is preserved by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. We show that although it is not true in general, it is preserved if the images of A and B are also subanalytic. In particular if two subanalytic set-germs are bi-Lipschitz equivalent their direction sets must have the same dimension. 1. Introduction.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{so-called}} holographic principle will obstruct attempts to produce physically realistic models for the unification of general relativity with quantum mechanics, unless determinism in the latter is restored. The notion of time in GR is {{so different from the}} usual one in elementary particle physics that we believe that certain versions of hidden variable theories can – and must – be revived. A completely natural procedure is proposed, in which the dissipation of information plays an essential role. Unlike earlier attempts, it allows us to use strictly continuous and differentiable classical field theories as a starting point (although discrete variables, leading to fermionic degrees of freedom, are also welcome), and we show how an effective Hilbert space of quantum states naturally emerges when one attempts to describe the solutions statistically. Our theory removes some of the mysteries of the holographic principle; apparently non-local features are to be expected when the quantum degrees of freedom of the world are projected onto a lower-dimensional black hole horizon.

The main {{goal of this}} analytical study was focused on extracted compounds and extraction conditions themselves. Soxhlet extractions were performed at three extraction time (6 h, 9 h and 12 h) and with two solvents (n-hexane and methanol). A general full factorial design with two factors (extraction time and types of extractor solvents) was implemented. The Soxhlet extraction method presented a good yield of components in extract. The study shows that methanol extracted almost double yield than n-hexane. The highest yield obtained with methanol was 14. 18 %; while the highest yield obtained by n-hexane was 7. 25 %. The results also indicated that, for methanol extraction, the mass yield percent extracted increased with increasing length of extraction period (up to 14. 18 %); for n-hexane extraction, the mass yield percent extracted was not consistent with increasing length of extraction period. The extracted oil extracted was analyzed by GC-MS. The compounds identified were vitamin E, palmitic acid and syringol.

Harper was instrumental in founding the Western Australian Co-operative Producers ’ Union in 1902 which, among other things, eventually became Wesfarmers Ltd. Harper was also a long standing member of Parliament, a newspaperman, an explorer, a founder of schools, a philanthropist, and an agricultural experimentalist. He was also able to pass his legacy on to his son Walter who led the co-operative movement after Harper senior’s death in 1912 and saw to its integration into the mainstream of Western Australian political and economic systems. In considering Harper’s contribution to the economic and social development of Western Australia, {{it is difficult to determine}} the extent to which his economic thinking in relation to co-operation or other economic questions conformed to such socialistic ideas represented by Owenite Co-operation or Colonial Socialism.
