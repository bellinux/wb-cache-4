40|$|A {{new model}} to {{describe}} the ascent of <b>sounding</b> <b>balloons</b> in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (up to &sim; 30 – 35 km altitude) is presented. Contrary to previous models, detailed account is taken of both the variation of the drag coefficient with altitude and the heat imbalance between the balloon and the atmosphere. To compensate {{for the lack of}} data on the drag coefficient of <b>sounding</b> <b>balloons,</b> a reference curve for the relationship between drag coefficient and Reynolds number is derived from a dataset of flights launched during the Lindenberg Upper Air Methods Intercomparisons (LUAMI) campaign. The transfer of heat from the surrounding air into the balloon is accounted for by solving the radial heat diffusion equation inside the balloon. In its present state, the model does not account for solar radiation, i. e. it is only able {{to describe the}} ascent of balloons during the night. It could however be adapted to also represent daytime soundings, with solar radiation modeled as a diffusive process. The potential applications of the model include the forecast of the trajectory of <b>sounding</b> <b>balloons,</b> which can be used to increase the accuracy of the match technique, and the derivation of the air vertical velocity. The latter is obtained by subtracting the ascent rate of the balloon in still air calculated by the model from the actual ascent rate. This technique is shown to provide an approximation for the vertical air motion with an uncertainty error of 0. 5 m s&minus; 1 in the troposphere and 0. 2 m s&minus; 1 in the stratosphere. An example of extraction of the air vertical velocity is provided in this paper. We show that the air vertical velocities derived from the <b>balloon</b> <b>soundings</b> in this paper are in general agreement with small-scale atmospheric velocity fluctuations related to gravity waves, mechanical turbulence, or other small-scale air motions measured during the SUCCESS campaign (Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study) in the orographically unperturbed mid-latitude middle troposphere...|$|R

Humidity values are determined inside, outside and at the boundary of the circumpolar stratospheric vortex. It is shown that at a height of 20 km, the difference between the mixing ratios of water vapor outside and inside the vortex can attain 1 ppmv and increase with height. It is inferred that the laminae of the vertical humidity profile at the stratospheric vortex boundary is in good agreement with the layering of the potential vorticity profile, which points to a dynamic nature of these layers. It is shown that decreased values of the water vapor content observed in the polar stratosphere are not always controlled by dehydration processes associated with the formation and sedimentation of particles of polar stratospheric clouds...|$|E
40|$|Though the {{presence}} of intermittent turbulence in the stratosphere has been well established, much remains unknown about it. In situ observations of this phenomenon, which have provided the greatest details of it, have mostly been achieved via sounding balloons (i. e., small balloons which burst at peak altitude) carrying constant-temperature hot-wire anemometers (CTAs). The Turbulence and Intermittency Long-Duration Atmospheric Experiment (TILDAE) was developed to test a new paradigm for stratospheric observations. Rather than flying on a <b>sounding</b> <b>balloon,</b> TILDAE was incorporated as an add-on experiment to the payload of a NASA long-duration balloon mission that launched in January 2016 from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Furthermore, TILDAE's key instrument was a sonic anemometer, which (relative to a CTA) provides better-calibrated measurements of wind velocity and a more robust separation of velocity components. During the balloon's ascent, TILDAE's sonic anemometer provided atmospheric measurements up to an altitude of about 18  km, beyond which the ambient air pressure was too low for the instrument to function properly.

MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric <b>Sounding)</b> <b>balloon</b> measurements obtained in northern Sweden on 24 January 2010 and 31 March 2011 inside the polar vortices have provided vertical profiles of inorganic and organic chlorine species as well as diurnal variations of ClO around sunrise over the whole altitude range in which chlorine is undergoing activation and deactivation.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the particulate {{characteristics of a}} haze episode, data from two ceilometers with wavelengths of 532 nm and 910 nm, respectively, were studied intensively. By combining {{the data from the}} ceilometers with data from a <b>sounding</b> <b>balloon,</b> an automatic meteorological station, and a Grimm 180 PM instrument, analyses of the haze process of a short haze event were performed. The results showed that the relatively calm weather conditions were favorable to the occurrence of the haze and that higher relative humidity had a great influence on visibility. The extinction profiles from the ceilometers reflected the existence of an inverted structure of the temperature profiles and demonstrated the extinction differences at two different wavelengths. Because extinction has a positive correlation with relative humidity, the effect of hygroscopic growth was analyzed at the two different wavelengths. As hygroscopic growth of the particles proceeded, the longer wavelength became more sensitive to the large particles, and vice versa. The hygroscopic growth factor and the Angstrom exponent showed a negative correlation, and the correlation coefficients at 532 nm and 910 nm were 0. 54 and 0. 86, respectively. The accumulation mode particles were more stable through time than the coarse mode particles, and the variation of the coarse mode particles coincided well with the variation of the Angstrom exponent from the two ceilometers...|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} spectra {{measured by}} MIPAS-B (Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric <b>sounding,</b> <b>balloon</b> version) during the EASOE (European arctic stratospheric ozone experiment) campaign in winter 1991 / 92 {{are influenced by}} a high aerosol concentration originating in the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991. First, the fundamental relationships are explained which exist between the microphysical and optical parameters for description of aerosol properties and the resulting aerosol continuum in infrared emission spectra. A method was developed by which {{the contribution of the}} aerosol continuum could be separated from the emission lines of the trace gases in high-resolution emission spectra. The method relies {{on the fact that the}} aerosol continuum can be considered locally constant within narrow spectral intervals so that it can be determined individually in many specifically selected spectral intervals which are distributed over the whole spectral range. The advantage associated with this method is that no a priori information is needed about the type of aerosol. By applying this method to MIPAS-B spectra, measured in Kiruna in March 1992, spectral aerosol extinction coefficients were derived in the spectral ranges from 750 to 980 cm"-" 1 and 1180 to 1380 cm"-" 1 for the three lowest tangent altitudes at 11. 3 km, 14. 5 km, and 16. 1 km.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} issue with aerospace workforce development is {{what should be}} done at the university level to attract and prepare undergraduates for an aerospace career. One approach adopted by many institutions is to lead students through the design and development of small payloads (less than about 500 grams) that can be carried up to high altitude (around 30 kilometers) by a latex <b>sounding</b> <b>balloon.</b> This approach has been very successful in helping students to integrate their content knowledge with practical skills and to understand the end-to-end process of aerospace project development. Sounding balloons, however, are usually constrained in flight duration (~ 30 minutes above 24 kilometers) and payload weight, limiting the kinds investigations that are possible. Student built picosatellites, such as CubeSats, can be placed in low Earth orbit removing the flight duration constraint, but the delays between satellite development and launch can be years. Here we present the inexpensive High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) that is designed to carry at least eight student payloads at a time to an altitude of about 36 kilometers with flight durations of 15 to 20 hours using a small zero-pressure polyethylene film balloon. This platform provides a flight capability greater than sounding balloons and can be used to flight-test compact satellites, prototypes and other small payloads designed and built by students. The HASP includes a standard mechanical, power and communication interface for the student payload to simplify integration and allow the payload to be fully exercised. In addition, HASP is lightweight and has simple mission requirements providing flexibility in the launch schedule. In this fashion, a higher education student aerospace payload program can be assured of a flight test opportunity {{at the end of each}} academic year...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since its}} {{inception}} four decades back, Balloon Facility of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Hyderabad has been functioning {{with the needs of}} its user scientists at its focus. During the early nineties, when the X-ray astronomy group at TIFR expressed the need for balloons capable of carrying the X-ray telescopes to altitudes up to 42 km, the balloon group initiated research and development work on indigenous balloon grade films in various thickness not only for the main experiment but also in parallel, took up the development of thin films in thickness range 5 to 6 microns for fabrication of sounding balloons required for probing the stratosphere up to 42 km as the regular 2000 grams rubber balloon ascents could not reach altitudes higher than 38 km. By the year 1999, total indigenisation of <b>sounding</b> <b>balloon</b> manufacture was accomplished. The work on balloon grade ultra-thin polyethylene film in thickness range 2. 8 to 3. 8 microns for fabrication of balloons capable of penetrating mesosphere {{to meet the needs of}} user scientists working in the area of atmospheric dynamics commenced in 2011. Pursuant to the successful trials with 61, 000 cu. m balloon made of 3. 8 microns Antrix film reaching stratopause (48 km) for the first time in the history of balloon facility in the year 2012, fine tuning of launch parameters like percentage free lift was carried out to take the same volume balloons to higher mesospheric altitudes. Three successful flights with a total suspended load of 10 kg using 61, 000 cu. m balloons were carried out in the month of January 2014 and all the three balloons crossed in to the mesosphere reaching altitudes of over 51 km.
