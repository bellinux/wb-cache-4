40|$|To study {{effects of}} Salmonella enteritidis on {{morphological}} and functional changes in chicken jejunal development, we analysed gene expression profiles at seven points post-infection in 1 - 21 day-old broiler chickens. Nine clusters with different gene expression patterns were identified, and the genes in each cluster were further analyzed by a functional annotation clustering method (DAVID). Functional and morphological developmental processes dominated {{in all the}} nine clusters. Salmonella infection caused delays in several intestinal-morphological processes, whereas functional metabolic processes occurred in a similar spatial-temporal frame compared to normal jejunum development. A clear difference between normal developing- and Salmonella disturbed jejunum was the higher expression of genes involved in cell turn-over at early stages in the infected jejunum. Surprisingly, we found no clustered immune related processes in the infected birds. To compare the immunological processes between control and <b>Salmonella</b> <b>infected</b> chickens, the gene expression data was superimposed on known immunological KEGG pathways. Furthermore an in-depth analysis on the immune gene level was performed. As expected, we did find immunological processes in the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>infected</b> jejunum. Several of these processes could be verified by immunohistochemistry measurements of different immunological cell types. However, the well-ordered spatial-temporal development of the immune system, as observed in control non-infected animals, was completely abolished in the infected animals. Several immunological processes started much earlier in time, whereas other processes are disorganised. These data indicate that normal morphological and immunological development of jejunum is changed dramatically by a disturbance due to Salmonella infection. Due to the disturbance, the well-organized spatial-temporal development of morphological processes are delayed, those of the immunological development are scattered, whereas metabolic functional processes are almost not affected. This demonstrates the flexibility of developmental processes in the broiler chicken intestine. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella causes disease {{ranging from}} {{self-limiting}} enteritis to septicemia. To cause disease it must first invade the intestinal epithelium. To invade, it employs a type three secretion system and effector proteins encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI 1). In this work, we investigated {{the effects of}} the intestinal environment on Salmonella pathogenesis using an in vivo mouse model of infection as well as in vitro genetic studies. In our in vivo studies, we characterized the intestinal environment in control, streptomycin-treated, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>infected,</b> and streptomycin-treated, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>infected</b> mice. Using 16 S rDNA clone libraries we found that the microbiota in the ileum is {{different from that of the}} cecum and that streptomycin treatment alters the microbiota in both the ileum and cecum. Upon histopathological examination of the ileum, we also found that pretreatment with streptomycin prior to infection increased Salmonella pathology. We also defined the short chain fatty acids present in both the ileum and cecum using GC-MS and HPLC analysis and found that streptomycin treatment significantly decreased the fatty acid concentrations in the cecum and that this change correlated with an increase in pathology in the cecum. Previous in vitro studies in our lab have shown that the short chain fatty acids propionate and butyrate repress Salmonella SPI 1 invasion genes. In this work, we further confirmed the effects of propionate and butyrate using concentrations of the fatty acids comparable to what we found in the cecum of the mouse. We also found that metabolism of propionate is necessary for the repressive effect on invasion genes and that the metabolic intermediate, propionyl-CoA, is important for this effect. The molecular techniques used to define the microbiota of the intestinal environment are also applicable to the clinical laboratory setting. Use of ribosomal genes for species-level identification has shown promise for both bacteria and yeast. Therefore, we examined the usefulness of these techniques for yeast identification in the clinical veterinary laboratory and found that sequence analysis of the D 1 /D 2 region of the yeast large ribosomal subunit is an effective method of identification...|$|R

40|$|SummarySalmonella Typhimurium causes {{diarrhea}} by infecting the epithelium and {{lamina propria}} of the intestinal mucosa and by secreting various effector proteins through type III secretion systems (TTSSs). However, the {{mechanisms by which}} Salmonella transverses the epithelium and is subsequently released into the lamina propria are poorly understood. Using a murine Salmonella-diarrhea model and in vivo microscopy, we show that epithelial traversal requires TTSS- 1 -mediated invasion and TTSS- 2 -dependent trafficking to the basolateral side. After being released into the lamina propria, the bacterium is transiently extracellular before being taken up by phagocytes, including CD 11 c+CX 3 CR 1 high monocytic phagocytes (MPs), which were found to constitutively sample cellular material shed from the basolateral side of the epithelium.

40|$|Arginine is {{a common}} {{substrate}} for both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase. The competition between iNOS and arginase for arginine contributes to the outcome of several parasitic and bacterial infections. Salmonella infection in macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7 induces iNOS. Because the availability of L-arginine is a major determinant for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, we hypothesize that in the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>infected</b> macrophages NO production may be regulated by arginase. Here we report {{for the first time}} that Salmonella up-regulates arginase II but not arginase I isoform in RAW 246. 7 macrophages. Blocking arginase increases the substrate L-arginine availability to iNOS for production of more nitric oxide and perhaps peroxynitrite molecules in the infected cells allowing better killing of virulent Salmonella in a NO dependent manner. RAW 246. 7 macrophages treated with iNOS inhibitor Aminoguanidine reverts the attenuation in arginase-blocked condition. Further, the NO block created by Salmonella was removed by increasing concentration of L-arginine.
