40|$|SUMMARY • Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{increased}} amounts of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may increase resistance or after the clinical response of man to respiratory viral infections. To examine this question in a nonhuman primate, ascorbic odd {{was added to the}} diet of cotton-topped marmosets (<b>Saguinus</b> <b>oedipus).</b> Along with controls, these animals were inoculated intranasally with a strain of parainfluenza type III virus of marmoset origin. Increased amounts of vitamin C did not prevent virus infection or primary immunologic response in the animals, but it did delay onset of the disease, reduce clinical responses, and decrease mortality (57 % v * 36 %). Studies on the microbial flora of marmosets by ourselves and others have identified some of the bacteria and viruses to which these animals are susceptible (1, 2). The suscep-tibility of the marmoset to various respira-tory viruses of presumed human origin sug-gested that these animals may be used to study nutrition-infection interactions. Pauling (3) has hypothesized that elevated blood levels of ascorbic acid in humans may be associated with a decreased susceptibility to respiratory illness of viral etiology.

Using playback experiments, we show that tamarins discriminate between bisyllabic items that start with a specific ‘prefix’ syllable and those that end with the same syllable as a ‘suffix’.

In accord with predictions drawn from ecological psychology, capuchins discovered affordances of canes through exploratory actions with these objects, whereas tamarins did not. Ecological theory predicts these differences on the basis of species-typical manipulative activity, and it provides a useful approach for the study of species differences in tool-using behavior.
