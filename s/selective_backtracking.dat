40|$|Backtracking is {{necessary}} when design alternatives are explored or dead ends are reached. Unfortunately, current approaches support chronological backtracking only (undo or version control), where the designer {{is forced to}} undo intermittent changes {{even if they are}} not related to what should be backtracked. This work introduces an approach for <b>selective</b> <b>backtracking</b> during software modeling where previously discarded design changes are recovered without having to undo intermittent changes. <b>Selective</b> <b>backtracking</b> is a challenge because during multi-view modeling, we must understand how changes across multiple views are connected â€“ in order to undo them together and thus avoid undesired inconsistencies. Our approach automatically discovers dependencies among design changes and is thus able to guide the designer during <b>selective</b> <b>backtracking.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a planning method applicable to agents with great perception and decision-making capabilities {{and the ability}} to communicate with other agents. Each agent has a task to fulfill allowing for the actions of other agents in its vicinity. Certain simultaneous actions may cause conflicts because they require the same resource. The agent plans each of its actions and simultaneously transmits these to its neighbors. In a similar way, it receives plans from the other agents and must take account of these plans. The planning method allows us to build a distributed scheduling system. Here, these agents are robot vehicles on a highway communicating by radio. In this environment, conflicts between agents concern the allocation of space in time and are connected with the inertia of the vehicles. Each vehicle made a temporal, spatial, and situated reasoning in order to drive without collision. The flexibility and reactivity of the method presented here allows the agent to generate its plan based on assumptions concerning the other agents and then check these assumptions progressively as plans are received from the other agents. A multi-agent execution monitoring of these plans can be done, using data generated during planning and the multi-agent decision-making algorithm described here. A <b>selective</b> <b>backtrack</b> allows us to perform incremental rescheduling...|$|R
