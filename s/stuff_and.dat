5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

25|$|The mind–body {{problem in}} {{philosophy}} examines {{the relationship between}} mind and matter, {{and in particular the}} relationship between consciousness and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains {{that there is only one}} kind of <b>stuff,</b> <b>and</b> that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, and was famously addressed by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism. Descartes believed that humans only, and not other animals have this non-physical mind.|$|E

These included agriculture, keeping of domesticated animals, collecting of wild plant food <b>stuff,</b> <b>and</b> making use of their position close to the coast by exploiting marine flora and fauna. The site illustrated nearly 1600 years of such strategies.|$|E

25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt.

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real <b>stuff</b> <b>and</b> what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
