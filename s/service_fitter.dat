40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>fit,</b> {{defined as}} {{consistency}} between {{mental health services}} judged needed and services received was measured for {{a random sample of}} service recipients in a public mental health system (N = 6588). A variant of small area analysis was used to measure the relationship between catchment area mortality rates from natural causes, suicide, and medicolegal causes and area fit scores for a variety of services. We tested the theory-based hypothesis that <b>service</b> <b>fit</b> would predict interarea variations in mortality better than simple measures of amount of service prescribed and received. We also tested the hypothesis that, controlling for relevant demographic and clinical factors, fit would be protective for mortality from all causes. Findings supported the first hypothesis. With respect to the second, <b>service</b> <b>fit</b> for only certain services was protective. Housing and clubhouses services were particularly protective, suggesting the importance of services providing social support...|$|R

In the countryside of China, most of the mobile phone users can not access the Internet. For this reason, We developed General Agriculture Mobile Service Platform. The Platform is designed to make these information <b>services</b> <b>fit</b> to be accessed by mobile users, and to make those mobile phone users can use these services without Internet connection. To achieve that, a descriptive language is designed to describe the services’ inputs and outputs, used to passing requests and responses between the platform and the mobile client software. With those descriptions, client software can generate user interface on the client mobile device. Using that interface, user can manipulate service. The communication between client side and the platform can be carried by SMS, MMS as well as TCP, so that the devices which don’t have Internet connection can access those services...|$|R

Person-centeredness is also considered a core element of integrated care. Yet typologies of integrated care mainly describe how patients <b>fit</b> within integrated <b>services,</b> rather than how <b>services</b> <b>fit</b> into the patient's world. Patient-centeredness has been commonly defined through physician's behaviors aimed at delivering patient-centered care. Yet, it is unclear how 'person-centeredness' is realized in integrated care through the patient voice.

The service compatibility problem is to answer the question, whether two Web <b>services</b> <b>fit</b> together, i. e. whether the composed system is sound. We study complementarity of service produced/consumed resources, that is {{a necessary condition for}} the service compatibility. Resources, which are produced/consumed by a Web service, are described as a multiset language. We define an algebra of multiset languages and present an algorithm for checking the conformance of resources for two given structured workflow modules. ...|$|R
