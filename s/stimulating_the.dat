25|$|Hormonal {{therapy for}} {{prostate}} cancer targets the pathways the body uses to produce DHT. A feedback loop involving the testicles, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary, adrenal, and prostate glands controls the blood levels of DHT. First, low blood levels of DHT <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> testicles to produce testosterone. Finally, testosterone from the testicles and dehydroepiandrosterone from <b>the</b> adrenal glands <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> prostate to produce more DHT. Hormonal therapy can decrease levels of DHT by interrupting this pathway at any point.|$|R
5000|$|The way we {{perceive}} our body and our surroundings {{is a function}} of the way our brain interprets signals from our various sensory systems, such as sight, sound, balance and touch. Special sensory pick-up units (or sensory [...] "pads") called receptors translate stimuli into sensory signals.

25|$|Transduction {{involves}} chemical messages {{sent from}} the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one ganglion cell. There {{are two types}} of ganglion cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neuron cells constantly fire—even when not <b>stimulated.</b> <b>The</b> brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the rate of firing of these neurons alters. Red light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red cone, which in turn <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red/green ganglion cell. Likewise, green light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> green cone, which <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red/green ganglion cell and blue light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> blue cone which <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> yellow/blue ganglion cell. The rate of firing of the ganglion cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color {{in the name of the}} ganglion cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green ganglion cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green ganglion cell. This is an opponent process. If the rate of firing of a red/green ganglion cell is increased, the brain would know that the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain would know that the color of the light was green.|$|R

5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples.

5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E

Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured {{a number of}} unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
