50|$|Keim {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the success of Keimfarben in 1878 with KEIM Purkristalat, a two-component pure <b>silicate</b> <b>paint.</b> The second generation of Keim paints followed in 1962 with Keim Granital, the first silicate emulsion paint; in contrast to Purkristalat, this is a one-component paint which makes it easier to apply. In 2002, Keimfarben then launched Keim Soldalit, a sol-silicate or colloidal <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> (binding agent: colloidal silica and water glass), which makes it much easier to apply silicate paints so that they are suitable for universal use.|$|E
50|$|Since 2002 a third {{category}} of silicate paints is known: sol-silicate paint. The binder {{is a combination}} of silica sol and water glass. The organic fraction is limited to 5 mass percent similar to dispersion <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> allowing for chemical setting and retaining of the silicate specific advantages. The sol <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> allows use on non-mineral plaster. For these the bonding occurs chemically and physically. The sol-silicate paint has revolutionized the field of application of silicate paints. These paints can be applied easily and safely to nearly all common substrates.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 20th century the first single-component <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> was developed. The {{addition}} of up to 5 mass percent of organic additives (e.g. acrylate dispersion, hydrophobisers, thickeners or similar) makes ready-to-use paint in containers possible. These are also called [...] "dispersion silicate paints" [...] (DIN 18363 Painting and coating work Section 2.4.1). The range of application for such silicate paints is significantly higher than for pure silicate paints as the dispersion allows coats for less solid substrates and/or organic composition. Above that handling and processing is simpler than pure <b>silicate</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicate</b> <b>paints</b> {{are based}} upon mineral raw materials. They are {{environmentally}} compatible in manufacture and effect. Their high durability helps to preserve resources and their contaminant-free composition preserves health and environment. For this reason <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> have gained popularity especially in the segment of sustainable construction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silicate</b> <b>paints</b> require {{siliceous}} substrate for setting. For this reason {{they are highly}} suitable for mineral substrates such as mineral plasters and concrete. They are only of limited use for application on wood and metal, though. The permeability for water vapor of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> is equivalent {{to that of the}} substrate. This effectively means that <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> do not inhibit the diffusion of water vapor. Moisture contained in parts of a structure or in the plaster may diffuse outward without resistance. This keeps walls dry and prevents structural damage. This addition helps avoid condensation water on the surface of building materials. This reduces the risk of infestation by algae and fungi. The high alkalinity of the binding agent water glass adds to the inhibitive effect against infestation by microorganisms and completely eliminates the need for additional preservatives.|$|R
50|$|Lime paints (aside of Fresco-technique) {{are only}} {{moderately}} weather resistant, so people apply them primarily in monument preservation. Mineral colors are commonly {{understood to be}} <b>silicate</b> <b>paints.</b> These paints use potassium water glass as binder. They are also called water glass paints or Keimfarben (after the inventor).|$|R
50|$|Silicate paints {{are highly}} color-tone stable. As they are solely dyed with mineral {{pigments}} {{that do not}} fade with exposure to UV radiation, the <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> coats remain constant in color for decades.|$|E
50|$|Keimfarben {{produces}} {{paint systems}} for {{external and internal}} use, mineral renders and fillers, natural stone repair systems and thermal insulation composite systems, together with concrete repair and surface protection systems. A new item in the product range is <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> for wooden substrates.|$|E
5000|$|Mineral <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> coats are {{considered}} durable and weather resistant. Lifetimes exceeding {{a hundred years}} are possible. The city hall in Schwyz and [...] "Gasthaus Weißer Adler" [...] in Stein am Rhein (both in Switzerland) received their coats of mineral paint in 1891, and facades in Oslo from 1895 or in Traunstein, Germany from 1891.|$|E
50|$|Company founder Adolf Wilhelm Keim {{is seen as}} the {{inventor}} of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> (mineral paints), which revolutionised the builders' and painters' trade {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Basic limewash can be {{inadequate}} {{in its ability}} to prevent rain-driven water ingress. Additives are being developed but these have the potential for affecting free vapour permeability; for this reason <b>silicate</b> <b>paints,</b> more common in Germany, are gaining popularity in the UK over limewash.|$|R
50|$|Keim {{depended}} on V. van Baerle {{as the source}} of water glass. Keim also attempted to manufacture <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> himself. His experiments took years to mature, but he finally achieved good results. The Silinwerk van Baerle in Gernsheim near the Rhine river and Keimfarben in Diedorf near Augsburg are well-known manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{three types}} of {{silicate}} paints are distinguished: Pure <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> consisting of two components, a color powder in dry or water-paste form and the liquid binder water glass. (DIN 18363 Painting and coating work Section 2.4.1). The processing of pure silicate paints require great experience and know-how. These are especially common for the historic area.|$|E
50|$|Haas {{created a}} three-sided mural on the Edison Brothers Stores building, St. Louis, Missouri, in 1984. Description: Keim <b>silicate</b> <b>paint,</b> 110000 sq ft. A three-sided mural with eight obelisks at its corners, a painted {{sculpture}} of Peace {{on the west}} facade, and a painted equestrian stature of St. Louis on the south facade. The 13-story building is now a Sheraton Hotel and Edison Condominiums.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the eastern}} end of the station there is a three storey office building. On the eastern wall of the {{reception}} building is a colourful metal relief in <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> and wrought iron made in 1958 by Peter Jakob Schober, called [...] "Travel by train—Heilbronn and the world" [...] (Reisen mit der Bahn—Heilbronn und die Welt), which includes symbols of Heilbronn and the world.|$|E
50|$|KEIMFARBEN GMBH is a {{medium-sized}} {{company based in}} Diedorf near Augsburg. It belongs to the Leonhard Moll AG Group {{and is one of}} the world's leading manufacturers of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints.</b> Buildings such as the White House, Buckingham Palace, Sydney Opera House and the Bolshoi Theatre are painted with Keimfarben paints.|$|R
5000|$|As mineral paint coats are not {{prone to}} static {{charging}} and thermo-plasticity (stickiness developing under heat), which {{is common for}} surfaces coated with dispersion or silicone resin, soiling takes place to lesser extent [...] For this reason fewer dirt particles cling {{to the surface and}} are far easier to wash off. <b>Silicate</b> <b>paints</b> are incombustible and free of organic additives or solvents (DIN 18363 Painting and coating work Section 2.4.1).|$|R
40|$|Upotreba silikatnih boja za završnu obradu uglavnom vanjskih, ali i unutarnjih površina povijesnih građevina općeprihvaćena je u konzervatorskoj praksi već dugi niz godina, usprkos tome što se time dovode u pitanje dva temeljna konzervatorska načela: autentičnost i reverzibilnost. S obzirom na to da su silikatne boje primijenjene i prilikom obnove historicističke kapele sv. Antuna Padovanskog na Hršak Bregu kod Krapinskih Toplica, izneseni su osnovi podaci o kapeli te opisan tijek njezine cjelovite obnove 2014. i 2015. godine, posebno završna koloristička obrada površina. Nadalje tekst donosi osvrt na zastupljenost problematike bojenja vanjskih i unutarnjih površina povijesnih građevina u stručnoj literaturi. U zaključnom dijelu razmatraju se načela autentičnosti i reverzibilnosti te opravdanost i prihvatljivost primjene silikatnih boja u obnovi povijesnih građevina, koje nisu bilo izvorno njima obojene. The use of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> for {{the final}} {{treatment}} of mostly exterior but also interior surfaces of historical buildings has widely been accepted in conservation practice for many years, {{despite the fact that}} it brings into question two conservation principles – authenticity and reversibility. Given that <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> were used in the renovation of the Historicist chapel of St. Anthony of Padua in Hršak Breg near Krapinske Toplice, some basic information about the chapel is given here, with an account of its comprehensive restoration in 2014 and 2015 and special emphasis on the final colouristic treatment of exterior and interior surfaces. The first part of the text brings an account of the historical continuity of the chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, as according to historical and topographical sources, an older chapel once stood at the site of the existing Historicist one. This is followed by a description of the chapel architecture and furnishings. A valorization is made of the chapel in the context of the great wave of Historicist renovations of church buildings, which swept across Hrvatsko Zagorje after the devastating earthquake of 1880 that brought down many historical buildings. A description is given of the poor condition in which the chapel was found during field trips in the period from 2010 to 2014 because of the damage caused by harmful workings of the atmosphere and a lack of maintenance. An account is given of the course of its comprehensive restoration in 2014 – 2015. Special emphasis is put on the final colouristic treatment of exterior and interior wall surfaces, where <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> were used for the fa軋des and sodium silicate for the inner walls. This is continued with a review of how the subject of the painting of exterior and interior surfaces of historical buildings is represented in professional literature, including the views of leading scholars in the field of cultural heritage protection. The use of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> {{for the final}} treatment of mostly exterior but also interior surfaces of historical buildings has been widely accepted in conservation practice for many years, owing to its comparative advantages in terms of durability, endurance, and consequently efficiency, and is therefore applied with almost no exception in the Krapina-Zagorje County, as argued by the examples mentioned. As a conclusion, the principles of authenticity and reversibility are examined, and weather it is justifiable and acceptable to use <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> when renovating historical buildings, if these were originally not used...|$|R
50|$|The mural {{will be a}} {{permanent}} feature of the amphitheatre. The artist used Keim Mineral Paints, invented in 1878. The system is a liquid <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> which comprises a potassium silicate binder with inorganic fillers (feldspar) and natural earth oxide colour pigments. When applied onto a mineral substrate the binder is absorbed and forms a micro-crystalline silicate structure. This crystalline structure allows the substrate to breathe but prevents the ingress of driven rain.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{was born}} in Toxteth, Liverpool, UK. After {{completing}} study at Liverpool School of Art (Liverpool College of Art) and the Royal College of Art in London, Walker became a prolific and outstanding painter of public murals in London through the 1970s until his untimely death in 1984. A large memorial retrospective exhibition of the artist's paintings {{was held at the}} Royal Festival Hall, London in 1985. The Hackney Peace Mural was designed by Ray Walker but the painting (in Keimfarben <b>silicate</b> <b>paint)</b> was executed in 1985 by his colleague and friend, Mike Jones, and Ray's wife, Anna Walker, following his death. The mural is dedicated to the memory of the artist and also features a portrait of the artist.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of the conducted researches on modifying traditional construction materials like cement concrete, anhydrite binders, <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> and fire-retardant coating based on liquid glass. Modification was due to multi-walled carbon nanotubes dispersions uniformly distributed in binding matrices while preparing materials, which led to modification of the structure and the properties of materials and products...|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicate</b> mineral <b>paints</b> or mineral {{colors are}} paint coats with mineral binding agents. Two {{relevant}} mineral binders {{play a role}} in the field of colors: Lime and silicate.|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} a highly durable {{connection}} between paint coat and substrate. Above that the binding agent water glass is highly resistant against UV light. While organic binders such as dispersions based on acrylate or silicone resin under UV over the years tend to grow brittle, chalky and develop cracks which finally result in damage to paint coats, the inorganic binder water glass remains stable. The chemical fusion with the substrate and the UV stability of the binder are the fundamental reasons for the extraordinarily high lifetime of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{paintings}} {{are made of}} a permanent pigment called potassium silicate. This same material has been used on exterior architecture in Western Europe since the mid-19th century {{and around the world}} in the past half-century. Very few American artists create paintings with potassium silicate mineral coatings, but these are the only pigments that can be applied to a stone or concrete substrate that will last indefinitely without fading or lifting from the surface. The Potassium <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> used on the Hudson River Way were produced by a German company called Keimfarben.|$|R

40|$|Restoration of monuments of {{architecture}} is a {{sphere of activity}} which places particularly high demands on technical specialists and experts. It is necessary, depending on the objectives of restoration and finishing of a monument {{of architecture}} and its damages and defects, to select appropriate technologies and materials. Mineral substances as fillers, and inorganic (mineral) colouring pigments, along with liquid potassium glass form an ultrastrong combination of materials. It gives to paints made of these mineral substances, an extremely high weather resistance and durability. The functional concept of <b>silicate</b> <b>paints</b> {{is the ability to}} silicify with other mineral construction materials. <b>Silicate</b> <b>paints</b> are the only colouring system which enters into chemical compound with the base due to the liquid potassium silicate properties. Also, bonds between quartzitic elements in its fillers are formed. As a result, it provides yet greater wear resistance and resistance to chalking. In ICA MGSU bachelors-technologists are given the "Facade Materials in the Modern Architecture of Buildings” course, in which special attention is paid to decorative coatings of various types; also, scientific research for improvement of paintwork material application technologies is performed. Cooperation of the higher school entities with technical assistance centres of construction firms makes it possible to enhance the quality of training and competence of graduates, as well as create favorable conditions for development of modern domestic technologies including those in the sphere of execution of architectural facades using innovative systems...|$|R
50|$|Fresco-secco (or a secco or fresco finto) is a wall {{painting}} technique where pigments {{mixed with}} an organic binder and/or lime are applied onto a dry plaster.

40|$|Materials {{that contain}} a {{photocatalyst}} have a semipermanent capacity for removing harmful gases from the ambient air. It {{is the purpose}} of this study to investigate the photocatalystic activity of commercial paints containing TiO 2 nanoparticles towards NO and NO 2. Experiments were carried out in a stainless steel (30 m- 3) walk-in type environmental chamber (Indoortron), under "real world setting" conditions of temperature, relative humidity, irradiation and pollutant concentrations. Two types of nanoraticleTiO 2 -containing paints were tested for their depolluting properties: a mineral <b>silicate</b> <b>paint</b> and a water-based styrene acrylic paint. The result showed a significant effect of TiO 2 -materials in reducing NOx. It was found that up to 74 % of NO and 27 % of NO 2 where photocatalytically degraded by the mineral <b>silicate</b> <b>paint,</b> while degradation percentage using the styrene acrylic paint reached 91 % and 71 % for NO and NO 2, respectively. The photocatalytic rate of NO on the mineral and styrene acrylic paint was calculated to 0. 11 mg m- 2 s and 0. 18 mg m- 2 s, respectively, indicating higher photocatalytic performance of the organic based material. The effect of relative humidity (RH) was also investigated. An increase of RH from 20 % to 50 % inhibited the NOx photocatalysis in the surface of the samples. JRC.
