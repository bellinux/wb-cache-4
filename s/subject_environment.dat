40|$|Why {{has there}} been so little {{progress}} in the quantitative evaluation of those quality attributes concerned with software design? This paper seeks to provide an answer by arguing that progress {{is dependent on the}} adoption of a programme of cumulative empirical research. Such a programme consists of original empirical research, independent replication to investigate and verify original results, and, critically, recipe-improvement replication in an attempt to produce more generalized results. Furthermore, a programme of cumulative empirical research is dependent upon quality attributes being communally defined and soundly related to appropriate measures. Empirical research is necessary to demonstrate that quality attributes, and their quantification, are well-founded. Replication is necessary to investigate and con rm original results.

Relative efficiency measurement models such as DEA, since always introduce some units efficient, do not offer any improvement suggestions for those units or any benchmark. In this paper, a practical DEA model considering the environmental and practical constraints was proposed by using the concept of artificial DMUs. The proposed nonlinear model was converted to a linear one by using the proper transformations. In comparison with the model proposed by Sowlati and Paradi (2004), the process of obtaining the artificial DMUs and efficiency scores of real DMUs is simultaneous. Also as {{the advantages of the}} model, the feasibility of the model and bounded efficiency scores can be mentioned. Practical efficiency scores can be used for the ranking of efficient DMUs as a proper practical ranking method, which has some advantages in comparison with AP model. Considering the vagueness and <b>subject</b> <b>environment</b> of practical constraints, uncertain approaches such as robust, fuzzy and stochastic can be applied for further research suggestions.|$|E

We discuss a number of emergent issues and critical incidents that appeared instrumental in shaping the teachers' journey towards a shared understanding of what constitutes an effective learning environment. In order to facilitate the full realisation of this ideal, we propose a model of team leadership for expediting the school's continuing transformation towards a fully integrated curriculum...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} undergraduate Education and Commerce students’ perceptions of learning within a distributed learning environment at the Loftus Education Centre (LEC), University of Wollongong (UOW). The LEC was established in 2003 {{as part of a}} distributed learning environment comprising regional campuses and centres to enable UOW to deliver tertiary education opportunities to regional students. It offers both undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. The distance of Loftus from the hub campus requires that, for reasons of economy and efficiency, studies often involve a blended learning approach. Also, the campus is small in size (an enrolment of 286 in 2009), which is a feature that allows for the development of cohesive on-campus learning communities. Thus, its size and its distance from the main campus are features which influence both the nature of the teaching and the learning that takes place. An open-ended questionnaire, based on the instrument used by Calder and Daly (2007) at James Cook University, asked students to identify strategies used by Loftus lecturers that assisted students’ learning. They were also asked which features of their <b>subject</b> <b>environment</b> contributed to their learning. The findings revealed differences between this study and the James Cook University study, raising questions about student engagement and highlighting possibilities for the effective use of blended learning in a distributed learning environment.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} that arise when a human is involved into a complexly training systems and the environment. A theoretical analysis of the infl uence of consciousness on the training mechanisms {{within the framework of}} post non-classical conceptions of human psyche functioning was conceived. We argue that consciousness is not intended to refl ect the objective reality and acquire knowledge, and solves the problem of the construction of the subjective world, which is the sum of compromises between the subject and the dynamic environments of his experience. In contrast, consciousness selects and harmonizes the information useful for human life. The role of consciousness in training is largely contradictory and confusing. It is also the source of the new information. The information is distorted {{in order to create a}} world view, which tends to objectively contradictive to the outside observer and consistent for refl ective being. We stressed the important role of human’s multimodal sensory experience in the process of interaction between conscious and unconscious forms of knowledge creation and processing. We consider the qualitative difference between physical reality and the model presented in the subjective world. We postulated the existence in the mind of a human dynamic virtual model. According to this model, the natural world is delimited by person and opposed to it being a source of events that make up the content of his life. The border which was built in the consciousness divides constructed reality into the inner and outer worlds. These worlds have different significance for the subject, defining the nature of its activities. We analyzed models the structure of reality and reality as a world’s refl ection offered by Karl Popper, K. K. Kolin, R. Redfield, G. Roth. The attention was paid to the neurobiological model of subjective reality by V. Sergin, which proposed a hypothesis of automatic identification postulating a secondary to human sensory categories. These processes occur cyclically, and their frequency determines the speed of subjective time. The authors of this article propose a mechanism of generating a <b>subject</b> <b>environment</b> (the world of reality) according to which the environment is perceived by man. It is organized element of subjective reality constructed by the body in the process of analyzing the essential relationship of the body and physical reality. It is presented in the form of coordination with other autopoietic systems that allow for the integration of the body and the subject in a niche of individual existence. It is a complex structural evolutionary self-organizing system, resulting from the interaction and coordination of autopoietic systems of the body. Subjective reality is the result of a reduction in the physical reality organization of the human psyche. We show the infl uence of the mind on the mechanisms of human integration with artificial learning environments. It is concluded that in order to improve the effectiveness of complex training ergonomics systems must take into account the properties of conscious regulation of the subject, its dependence on the context. To protect against the destructive mechanisms of action of consciousness training we advise to restrict the user’s intervention in critical modes of operation created a complex training system. </p...|$|E
