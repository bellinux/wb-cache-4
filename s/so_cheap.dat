The life of men and women is <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> and property is so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.|$|E
25|$|Johnson bought oysters for his cat. In modern England, oysters are an {{expensive}} {{food for the}} well-to-do, but in the 18th century oysters were plentiful around the coasts of England and <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> {{that they were a}} staple food of the poor. Johnson refused to send Francis Barber to buy Hodge's food, fearing that it would be seen as degrading to his servant, so he would personally buy the food for Hodge.|$|E
25|$|The Model T was {{introduced}} on October 1, 1908. It had {{the steering wheel}} on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> at $825 in 1908 ($ today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.|$|E
50|$|Blinds {{can be made}} in {{a variety}} of materials, some expensive, and some less <b>so.</b> <b>Cheaper</b> blinds are usually made in polyester, aluminum, or PVC. These are {{inexpensive}} materials that are all easily accessible and durable at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Refinancing of PFI deals is common. Once {{construction}} is complete, the risk {{profile of a}} project can be lower, <b>so</b> <b>cheaper</b> debt can be obtained. This refinancing might in the future be done via bonds — the construction stage is financed using bank debt, and then bonds for the much longer period of operation.|$|R
50|$|Low-end {{restaurants}} and street vendors {{are the biggest}} end users of gutter oil, as they operate with lower profit margins than bigger restaurants. Oil {{is one of the}} largest kitchen supply costs for restaurants, <b>so</b> obtaining <b>cheaper</b> oil can allow a marginal restaurant to reduce its overall expenses. Chinese food is generally heavily dependent on oil due to most foods being fried, <b>so</b> <b>cheaper</b> meal prices for many price-sensitive consumers are possible if gutter oil is used instead of virgin oil. The situation becomes more serious because it is hard to distinguish reprocessed gutter oil from legitimate oil. Bleach is used to transform gutter oil's dark color into a more natural-looking one, and alkali additives are used to neutralize the abnormal pH caused by containing high concentrations of animal fats.|$|R
25|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} modules {{have dropped}} about 75 per cent in price. Current {{scientific and technological}} advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. Concentrated solar thermal power (CST) with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still {{has the potential for}} further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.|$|E
25|$|What {{is there}} that any man desires,—any man or any woman,—that does not lose half its value when it {{is found to be}} easy of access and easy of possession? Wine is valued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to Jones and Smith, and Jones and Smith will not care to enter them. Shut your doors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all their little {{diplomacy}} to effect an entrance. Captain Aylmer, when he heard the hearty tone of the girl’s answer, already began almost to doubt whether it was wise on his part to devote the innermost bin of his cellar to wine that was <b>so</b> <b>cheap.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{starts with}} Polka, {{a young girl}} that has magic, which means {{she is going to}} die soon. One day, after being {{rejected}} by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she wants to do something with her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo thinks of the plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the words}} of Tony DiGiulian, the 120/50 Mark XI gun was perhaps the finest {{destroyer}} gun made by British during World War II, {{but it was also}} heavy and costly, as were the ships equipped with it. Wartime production required a much greater production of ships and guns, <b>so</b> <b>cheaper</b> weapons were installed in many other classes, like the 'O' and 'P' (102 mm) and furthers (with the old 120 mm), until the 113 mm (4.5 in) started to replace them, as the first, powerful dual purpose destroyer gun.http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_45-45_mk1.htm ...|$|R

500|$|A gradual {{reversal}} in trade policy {{culminated in the}} military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment, lifting protectionist barriers and opening the economy to the world market. This new policy boosted some exports, but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> that local industry declined, and many exports were priced out of the market. The Ministry of Economy {{put an end to}} the exchange rate policy of previous governments. The currency underwent a 30% devaluation. In 1970, the [...] "peso moneda nacional" [...] (one of the longest-lived currencies in the region) was replaced by the [...] "peso ley" [...] (100 to 1).|$|E
500|$|Four of Sharpe's {{earliest}} churches– StSaviour, Bamber Bridge (1836–37); [...] StMark, Witton (1836–38);. [...] Christ Church, Chatburn (1837–38); and StPaul, Farington, near Leyland (1839–40)– {{were in the}} Romanesque style, {{which he}} chose because [...] "no style can be worked <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> as the Romanesque". [...] They [...] "turned out to {{be little more than}} rectangular 'preaching boxes'... with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged". [...] The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements were the chapel of All Saints, Marthall, near Knutsford (1839); StMary, Conistone in Wharfedale (1846); and StPaul, Scotforth in south Lancaster (1874), the last built towards the end of his life.|$|E
500|$|Sharpe's {{first three}} churches were in Romanesque style, as {{according}} to Sharpe [...] "no style {{can be worked}} <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> as Romanesque". [...] He then started to include Gothic features, which often did not accurately reflect the features {{to be found in}} medieval churches, being an approximation rather than an accurate (or [...] "correct") representation. [...] Influenced by A.W.N.Pugin (1812–52) and the Cambridge Camden Society (later named the Ecclesiological Society), of which Sharpe was a member, he introduced more [...] "correct" [...] Gothic features into his designs, which he continued to use throughout the rest of his career. [...] In 1844 he was praised by the society for his design of the new steeple at StMichael, Kirkham (1843–44), which was described as being [...] "beautiful and correct".|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{outcomes}} of gear shifting in motor vehicles. In {{the case of}} vehicle noise emissions, there are higher sound levels emitted when the vehicle is engaged in lower gears. The design life of the lower ratio gears is shorter, <b>so</b> <b>cheaper</b> gears may be used, which tend to generate more noise due to smaller overlap ratio and a lower mesh stiffness etc. than the helical gears used for the high ratios. This fact {{has been used to}} analyze vehicle-generated sound since the late 1960s, and has been incorporated into the simulation of urban roadway noise and corresponding design of urban noise barriers along roadways.|$|R

Since it was cheaper to replace the Monk than to repair it, the Monk was cast out in the wilderness to believe whatever it liked. The Monk also owns a somewhat cynical horse, which he was allowed to keep because [...] "horses were <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> to make". Upon his arrival on Earth, the Monk has several humorous misadventures.|$|E
2500|$|Email spam exemplifies {{a tragedy}} of the commons: spammers use {{resources}} (both physical and human), without bearing the entire cost of those resources. [...] In fact, spammers commonly do not bear the cost at all. This raises the costs for everyone. In some ways spam is even a potential threat to the entire email system, as operated in the past. Since email is <b>so</b> <b>cheap</b> to send, a tiny number of spammers can saturate the Internet with junk mail. Although only a tiny percentage of their targets are motivated to purchase their products (or fall victim to their scams), the low cost may provide a sufficient conversion rate to keep the spamming alive. Furthermore, even though spam appears not to be economically viable {{as a way for}} a reputable company to do business, it suffices for professional spammers to convince a tiny proportion of gullible advertisers that it is viable for those spammers to stay in business. Finally, new spammers go into business every day, and the low costs allow a single spammer {{to do a lot of}} harm before finally realizing that the business is not profitable.|$|E
