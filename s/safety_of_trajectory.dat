In this paper, a new global path planning algorithm named HYBRID-Visibility-QuadTree-Voronoi-WaveFront method (HYBRID-VQVW) is presented where these four methods are integrated in a single architecture. After constructing these global <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> C-space, the best trajectory among four is selected in every sampling distance by several criterions.

In order to achieve the necessary efficiency of computation, the dynamics of traffic participants is abstracted into Markov-chains.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} selecting from a choice of possible grasps, so that impact forces will be minimised if a collision occurs while the robot is moving the grasped object along a post-grasp trajectory. Such considerations are important for safety in human-robot interaction, where even a certified "human-safe" (e. g. compliant) arm may become hazardous once it grasps and begins moving an object, which may have significant mass, sharp edges or other dangers. Additionally, minimising collision forces is critical to preserving the longevity of robots which operate in uncertain and hazardous environments, e. g. robots deployed for nuclear decommissioning, where removing a damaged robot from a contaminated zone for repairs may be extremely difficult and costly. Also, unwanted collisions between a robot and critical infrastructure (e. g. pipework) in such high-consequence environments can be disastrous. In this paper, we investigate how the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the post-grasp motion can be considered during the pre-grasp approach phase, so that the selected grasp is optimal in terms applying minimum impact forces if a collision occurs during a desired post-grasp manipulation. We build on the methods of augmented robot-object dynamics models and "effective mass" and propose a method for combining these concepts with modern grasp and trajectory planners, to enable the robot to achieve a grasp which maximises the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the post-grasp <b>trajectory,</b> by minimising potential collision forces.

Counter to the racial-proxy hypothesis (Harris 1999, 2001), we argue that race, per se, continues to be influential when Whites make housing decisions. Using a survey-based experiment, we ask: Does information about neighborhood racial composition influence how Whites judge the quality of that neighborhood, quite apart from the actual characteristics of the homes located in it? A random sample of adults aged twenty-one and older in the Chicago and Detroit metropolitan areas watched videos embedded in a face-to-face interview. These videos portrayed neighborhoods ranging from lower working class to upper class. All respondents saw the same neighborhoods but were randomly assigned to see either (1) White residents, (2) Black residents, or (3) a mix of both White and Black residents. Respondents then evaluated the neighborhoods in terms of housing cost, property upkeep, <b>safety,</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> housing values, and quality of the schools.
