5|$|The KONUS-B instrument, {{designed}} by the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10keV to 8MeV energy. They consisted of NaI(Tl) <b>scintillator</b> crystals 200mm in diameter by 50mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 microjoules per square meter (510 to 510 erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum and rise time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8s.|$|E

500|$|The {{positron}} {{would soon}} be annihilated by an electron and produce two 0.51 MeV gamma rays, while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a 2.2 MeV gamma ray. This would produce a distinctive signature that could be detected. They then realised that by adding cadmium salt to their liquid <b>scintillator</b> to enhance the neutron capture reaction, resulting in a 9 MeV burst of gamma rays. For a neutrino source, they proposed using an atomic bomb. Permission for this {{was obtained from the}} laboratory director, Norris Bradbury. [...] Work began on digging a shaft for the experiment when J. M. B. Kellogg convinced them to use a nuclear reactor instead of a bomb.

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Bagnères-de-Bigorre conference, Rossi had already turned his {{attention}} toward the astrophysical implications of cosmic ray phenomena, particularly extensive air showers. [...] After Rossi's recognition, in Eritrea, that these events exist, they were extensively studied by Pierre Auger, and by Williams. [...] At this time, the extremely fast response of the newly developed scintillation counters offered a new way to study the structure of air showers. [...] To do this, Rossi enlisted his student, George W. Clark, who completed a PhD in 1952, and Piero Bassi, who was a visitor from the University of Padua. [...] Because solid scintillating material was unavailable, they decided to use terphenyl dissolved in benzine, which is an efficient liquid <b>scintillator.</b> [...] With the aid of three counters deployed {{on the roof of the}} MIT Physics building during the winter of 1952/53, they found that shower particles arrived within only one or two meters of a disk, which travels at nearly the speed of light in the direction of the shower axis.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, various {{detection}} {{methods have been}} used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by photomultiplier tubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a solid plastic <b>scintillator</b> coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene <b>scintillator</b> also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the NOνA detector uses liquid <b>scintillator</b> watched by avalanche photodiodes. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory uses [...] of the Antarctic ice sheet near the south pole with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the volume.|$|E

However, given the low cost of a gamma camera and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated PET scanner, this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a PET scanner cannot be justified.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between astrometric stability and astrophysical properties in flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars making up the celestial reference frame. We use position determinations from geodetic VLBI measurements, and develop a new metric for source position stability. We then compare this quantity to two measures of source compactness: structure index, which probes structure on milliarcsecond scales; and the presence of interstellar scintillation associated with the quasar, which probes scales of tens of microarcseconds. We find that persistent <b>scintillators</b> have greater position stability than episodic <b>scintillators,</b> which are in turn more stable than non-scintillators. <b>Scintillators</b> {{are also more likely to}} be compact on milliarcsecond scales, as measured by the structure index. Persistent <b>scintillators</b> are therefore excellent candidates for inclusion in any future realisation of the celestial reference frame. A list of these sources is presented in the Appendix. We find that slow (characteristic timescale > 3 days) <b>scintillators</b> have more stable positions than rapid <b>scintillators,</b> suggesting they are more compact. High-cadence, long term monitoring is therefore required to identify other members of this population of compact, high brightness temperature quasars. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figures, 1 table.

2500|$|The {{same issue}} occurs with {{radiation}} protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument {{may be affected}} by the background radiation. An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring. In an elevated gamma background the <b>scintillator</b> material will {{be affected by the}} background gamma, which will add to the reading obtained from any contamination which is being monitored.

2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or <b>scintillator</b> positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the <b>scintillator</b> to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E

The first LEDs were red and yellow, and higher-frequency diodes have been developed over time. All LEDs produce incoherent, narrow-spectrum light; [...] "white" [...] LEDs are actually combinations of three LEDs of a different color, or a blue LED with a yellow <b>scintillator</b> coating.
