If an alkaline detergent is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild acetic acid solution will restore neutral fiber pH.

40|$|This work {{belongs to}} a {{research}} trend which studies, in experimental way, {{the effects of a}} vegetated bottom on the hydrodynamic features of the current flowing over it. In previous works about this topic the authors experimentally studied, through an LDA system, the effects on the hydrodynamic behaviour of a boundary layer current developing at the inlet of a rectangular channel fed by a big tank, with different types of vegetated bottom, finding a non dimensional “universal” velocity distribution law. The aim of this work is to extend the experimental study of this current to its whole developing in the channel, in the case of almost rigid submerged vegetation, made by a <b>synthetic</b> <b>carpet,</b> yet using the same model proposed in previous works. The main device of the experimental plant is a channel 4 m long and 15 cm large, ending through a weir, with variable slope. The experimental surveys have been carried out in logical connection with the previous ones, keeping some fundamental hydraulic parameters unchanged. Local mean velocity measurements in numerous points of verticals located along the axis of the current, in test sections suitably chosen, have been performed. The velocity distributions show that the whole current is characterized by four types of flow: boundary layer, transition flow, uniform flow, and accelerated flow towards the weir. In order to produce a peculiar non dimensional velocity distribution for each test section, the collected experimental data are processed, starting from two characteristic velocity values: ue, relative {{to the top of the}} vegetation carpet, and umax, relative to a real or virtual maximum, on the outside of the vegetation. The data processing provided 26 non dimensional velocity distributions. It was perceived that it is possible to unify the distributions relative to boundary layer in a first specific law, and the distributions relative to either uniform flow or accelerated flow in a second specific law. The distributions relative to the transition flow show a trend from the first law to the second one. The whole processing was peculiar for currents with submerged vegetation and can be considered as the starting point of a more general experimental survey aimed to obtain other possible “universal” distribution laws...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] traction forces produced between an athlete’s footwear and the playing surface are a crucial factor influencing a player’s performance. Four primary factors affecting traction have been identified from literature: the sports specific movement, the footwear, the playing surface, and the environment. Many authors have investigated traction behaviour mechanically, using a variety of shoe and surface types, concluding that the traction generated at the shoe–surface interface is dependent on each shoe–surface combination (see work by Gheluwe et al., Cawley et al., and Villwocket et al., details given in main text). There has been little attempt in the literature, however, to try and explain the behaviour of the surface from the traction resistance measurements that were observed, perhaps owing to the complex number of variables involved. Furthermore, the variety of methodologies used in past research makes it difficult directly to compare datasets. This paper presents datasets comparing the traction behaviour of several carefully prepared surface systems and states, using three mechanical test procedures, and investigates the factors influencing traction resistance. Results highlight that properties of <b>synthetic</b> turf <b>carpets</b> (fibres and tuft spacing) and the density state of the crumbed rubber infill component and the stud size and configuration influence the maximum traction forces generated at the shoe–surface interface. The magnitude of stud penetration under controlled vertical loading is also presented. The findings of this study further demonstrate the importance of understanding the detail of the surface system under test, and that the infill state has a measurable effect. The design and operation of mechanical traction measurement equipment also demonstrates influences on the traction values measured, and the largest influence is the normal load applied. The FIFA standard test is shown to be less sensitive to infill state than other tests. Recommendations are made for more robust testing methods for future research...|$|R
40|$|In Latvia, since regaining the {{national}} independence, {{there are not}} any traces of organized textile waste collection (just opposite the collection {{of other types of}} used materials, for example, solid waste). The development of a separate (shared) textile waste collection would promote a possibility to re-use and recover the waste and therefore reducing amount of the waste in its deposit areas, incl. landfills on continued basis. The textile waste collection system should use the existing resources and proved already successful methods of similar systems. In order to establish a textile waste collection system it is necessary to perform a social advertising campaign to inform citizens on textile waste transfer possibilities and its operational efficiency; provide the schools (i. e., with Eco-school program), housing estates (newly developed dwelling districts), super-markets and used clothes (textiles) sorting places (points) with special containers (textile banks); locate the most appropriate solution for the used clothes (textiles) collection and sorting place, taking into account the already existing real estate market supply; sort the used clothes (textiles) by quality, fiber and output of the manufactured article; process (recycle) the used clothes (textiles) in raw materials. As a result, a part from the existing textile waste in the territory of Latvia will be delivered to the collection and sorting place and new job vacancies will be created as well. The sorting will have the following benefits: almost new clothes or clothing without great defects will be passed to municipal (social) services and non-governmental organizations that deal with aid program intended for the citizens (for example, in 2008, 1 / 4 of the Latvian population was exposed to the risk of poverty); items from wool and wool mixtures, cotton, cellulose, <b>synthetic</b> and <b>carpets</b> should be passed to the textile recycling in raw materials; the remaining textile waste would be delivered to incineration for thermal energy or waste deposit areas.

40|$|This {{research}} project has investigated the mechanical properties and behaviour of third generation synthetic turf surfaces used for football and rugby, {{with a focus}} on the traction behaviour produced at the shoe-surface interface. The physical characteristics and mechanical properties of the component materials used in the construction of third generation surfaces were examined. The bulk density of the rubber infill material was found to be a key variable. This was shown to be influenced by compaction and the resulting compression of the rubber infill material under an applied load. Increasing the compactive effort and/or compression under loading increased the bulk density. Shear strength of the rubber infill material was shown to be influenced by bulk density, increasing with a higher bulk density. The composite surface system behaviour of third generation synthetic turf surfaces was investigated. Several surface variables were measured including; shockpad thickness, <b>synthetic</b> turf <b>carpet</b> construction, infill thickness, infill bulk density and infill material type. Shockpad thickness, rubber infill thickness and bulk density were found to influence the impact behaviour, with a thicker rubber layer (shockpad and/or rubber infill layer) reducing the hardness of a surface system. Increasing the bulk density of the rubber infill with compactive effort increased the surface system hardness. Traction behaviour of composite surface systems was explored using three traction test methods to measure both rotational and translational traction. Rubber infill bulk density was shown to be a primary influencing variable from the playing surface variables investigated. Several further traction variables were explored to provide a fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in the production of traction at the shoe-surface interface including; vertical stress, stud configuration, stud dimension, stud penetration, water and temperature.

Limited information is known about the appearance and behavior of blood or semen stains collected from fire scenes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to observe the effects of high temperatures and flame exposure on blood and semen stains using current traditional presumptive (phenolphthalein, AP Spot test and ALS fluorescence) and confirmatory (ABAcard® Hematrace®, microscopic identification of spermatozoa and RSIDTM-Semen) testing methods. Liquid blood and semen was applied to swatches of denim, <b>synthetic</b> leather and <b>carpet,</b> and allowed to dry. In Part I of this study, the stains were exposed for various amounts of time to 130 °C, 150 °C, 170 °C and 190 °C using a laboratory oven. When bloodstains were exposed to high temperatures,   reaction times using phenolphthalein increased and only bloodstains on denim were undetected within one minute at the most extreme conditions. Scraping was determined to be a better collection method than swabbing to test samples exposed to higher temperatures, and some samples required longer than the typical 10 - 15 second time frame used by most forensic labs to yield a positive reaction. Detection of human hemoglobin using ABAcard® Hematrace® was not possible after 1 hour at 130 °C, making it a less sensitive test for bloodstains exposed to high temperatures than phenolphthalein. Semen stains exhibited fluorescence using an alternate light source after limited exposure to all temperatures, but more successfully on denim and synthetic leather than on carpet. AP Spot test was successful on all semen stains on synthetic leather, and on a number of samples on denim and carpet. Microscopic identification of sperm was most successful on denim but became impossible at higher temperatures and exposure times. Semenogelin testing was most successful on carpet and could be detected even under the most extreme conditions. Additionally, as temperature increased, semen stains darkened in color and appeared visually similar to bloodstains. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the developed instrumentation and measurement techniques {{suitable for use}} in a submillimetre wave compact antenna test range (CATR) for testing high-gain antennas and the quiet-zone quality of the CATR, but also {{for use in a}}ntenna testing with planar near-field scanning at submillimetre wavelengths. The thesis work is focused on improving the phase measurement accuracy and the dynamic range of a commercial submillimetre wave vector network analyser. The full angular scattering properties of radiation absorbing materials (RAM) suitable for the CATR are also analysed in the thesis. A CATR can be used for testing of electrically large antennas at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. These high-gain dish antennas are required for spaceborne astronomy and limb sounding of the Earth atmosphere. The most common CATR configuration at millimetre waves uses a reflector as the collimating element. However, the surface accuracy requirement of the reflector becomes very stringent at frequencies over 200  GHz, and the manufacturing of the reflector thus very expensive. An alternative collimator to the reflector is the binary amplitude hologram which is studied in this thesis. The hologram is a planar transmission type device, which is realised as a slot pattern on a metallised dielectric film. The surface (pattern) accuracy requirement of the hologram is less stringent than that of a reflector and it is potentially of lower cost. The amplitude and phase ripples of the CATR quiet-zone field need to be below ±  0. 5  dB and ±  5 °. The hologram CATR operating at 310  GHz discussed in this thesis is shown to be able to achieve these limits even at submillimetre wavelengths. The amplitude and phase measurement accuracies of a vector network analyser largely depend on the strength of the detected signal. The quiet-zone tests of planned large hologram CATRs require larger dynamic range than is possible with the standard solid-state source configuration, so a phase-lock system for submillimetre wave backward-wave oscillators (BWO) had to be developed. The powerful phase-locked BWO source described in this thesis can improve the dynamic range and the accuracy of the measurement system considerably. The improvement in dynamic range over the standard source based on a frequency-multiplied Gunn oscillator is 16 - 40  dB over the frequency range of 300 - 700  GHz. Problems in the phase measurement accuracy arise when the receiver is moved across the quiet-zone area with microwave cables connected to it. The flexing of the cables causes phase errors reaching tens of degrees due to changes in their electrical lengths. The novel phase error measurement and correction system described in this thesis is based on the use of a pilot signal to track changes in the electrical length of a microwave cable. The error analysis shows that phase correction of the detected submillimetre wave signal is possible down to a level of 2 ° with the constructed system. Accurate operation has also been verified by measurements. The CATR facility needs large quantities of high-performance absorbers. In order to select suitable absorbers, the specular and non-specular reflectivities of several commercially available, state-of-the art absorber materials have been measured between 200 - 600  GHz. Selected wool and <b>synthetic</b> floor <b>carpet</b> materials were also included in the tests. The results show that specular reflectivities between − 40 …− 50  dB are possible over a considerable angular range when the materials are oriented properly. The best floor carpet materials have reflectivities below − 15  dB over a wide angular range and are useful in the less critical areas by reducing backscatter. The published report is the first in the open literature showing the full angular performance of these materials across a wide frequency range. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Damage to wool {{is derived}} from the {{modification}} of its constituent proteins, as the dry matter of wool is principally made up of protein. A significant component of protein damage consists of modifications to the amino acid side chains. In wool, these modifications can lead to lowered quality in the form of reduced strength and elasticity (phototendering), and to undesirable colour changes (photobleaching and photoyellowing). These limitations hinder the competitiveness of natural wool fibres against <b>synthetic</b> counterparts in <b>carpet</b> and apparel manufacture and consumer appeal. Better approaches to resolving these limitations will arise from an increased understanding of the process of protein damage in wool at the molecular level. Wool damage occurs during on-farm production, processing, and over the product lifespan with the consumer. During processing, elevated temperatures and chemical treatments are applied to the fibre, while the primary degradative influences experienced during subsequent product life are abrasion and light exposure. This study used novel proteomic techniques to investigate the heat- and light-induced degradation of synthetic model peptides and of intermediate filaments derived from wool. Electrospray ionisation (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometric techniques were used to comprehensively characterise the degradation of model peptides containing tryptophan and tyrosine. A total of sixteen residue side-chain degradation products were detected and confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry and detailed de novo sequencing. The relative abundance of parent peptides and their degradation products was determined using two mass spectrometric approaches: a label-free approach, based on observed parent ion abundance, and an isobaric-labelling approach, based on the abundance of the reporter fragment ions of a commercially available isobaric tag (iTRAQ) in tandem mass spectra. The influence of reactive oxygen species was apparent by the UVA-, UVB-, and hydrothermallyinduced modifications observed in the model peptides. The deduced oxidative degradation pathways shed light into the mechanisms behind protein damage under these conditions. In the UVA and UVB-irradiated proteins, the modifications observed were consistent with the hydroxyl radical playing a key role, as well as the involvement of peroxynitrite. The observation of reactive oxygen species-generated modifications in the hydrothermally-damaged peptides was particularly noteworthy, as the heat-induced generation of reactive oxygen species is not well recognised or reported. When wool-derived intermediate filament proteins were exposed to hydrothermal insult, the formation of residue-level modifications was also observed after reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and MALDI mass spectrometric analysis. The presence of oxidative modifications confirmed the involvement of reactive oxygen species. Using quantitative isobaric iTRAQ labels, the degradation of a number of marker peptides and the formation of selected modified products was monitored. Such molecular-level markers of damage provided sensitive and specific evaluation of the type and extent of protein damage experienced. It is anticipated that utilisation of these markers will provide a sensitive and effective tool for determining and tracking protein damage at the molecular level, as well as facilitating validation and optimisation of protection or repair strategies for wool and other protein fibres. Although this research focussed on understanding protein degradation in wool, the understandings gleaned from the work on model peptides and the molecular damage marker approach may be extended to a variety of other substrates in which protein degradation is a concern. These include a number of living tissues, in which protein damage plays a {{role in the development of}} disease states, and other protein-based substrates such as skin, hair, leather, and protein-based foods...|$|R
