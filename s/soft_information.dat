50|$|NPML and {{its various}} forms {{represent}} the core read-channel and detection technology used in recording systems employing advanced error-correcting codes that {{lend themselves to}} soft decoding, such as low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. For example, if noise-predictive detection is performed {{in conjunction with a}} maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection algorithm such as the BCJR algorithm then NPML and NPML-like detection allow the computation of soft reliability information on individual code symbols, while retaining all the performance advantages associated with noise-predictive techniques. The <b>soft</b> <b>information</b> generated in this manner is used for soft decoding of the error-correcting code. Moreover, the <b>soft</b> <b>information</b> computed by the decoder can be fed back again to the soft detector to improve detection performance. In this way it is possible to iteratively improve the error-rate performance at the decoder output in successive soft detection/decoding rounds.|$|E

30|$|Significant bit-planes {{that are}} SW coded but fail to decode {{properly}} due to channel rate underestimation introduce large reconstruction errors, even when subsequent bit-planes of lesser significance are successfully decoded. Additionally, {{the generation of}} the soft-input information to initialize the LDPCA-decoder for decoding a particular bit-plane supposes that all previous bit-planes have been correctly restored. Erroneously decoded bits distort the <b>soft</b> input <b>information,</b> that is, the LLRs are calculated from erroneous data, which could result in failure to decode even though the assigned channel rate would prove sufficient when the <b>soft</b> input <b>information</b> were derived under error-free conditions.|$|R
50|$|However, sub-optimal {{techniques}} {{based on}} iterative belief propagation decoding give excellent results {{and can be}} practically implemented. The sub-optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the LDPC as an independent single parity check (SPC) code. Each SPC code is decoded separately using soft-in-soft-out (SISO) techniques such as SOVA, BCJR, MAP, and other derivates thereof. The <b>soft</b> decision <b>information</b> from each SISO decoding is cross-checked and updated with other redundant SPC decodings of the same information bit. Each SPC code is then decoded again using the updated <b>soft</b> decision <b>information.</b> This process is iterated until a valid code word is achieved or decoding is exhausted. This type of decoding {{is often referred to}} as sum-product decoding.|$|R
