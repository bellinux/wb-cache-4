25|$|Tolkien <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valar (including the Maiar) {{that they}} can change their shape at will, and move unclad in the raiment of the world, meaning {{invisible}} and without form. But it seems that Morgoth, Sauron, and their associated Maiar could lose this ability: Morgoth, for example, was unable to heal his burns from the Silmarils or wounds from Fingolfin and Thorondor; and Sauron lost his ability to assume a fair-seeming form after his physical body was destroyed in the downfall of Númenor.|$|E

Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2017, Reinhart {{was arrested}} for battery after {{allegedly}} punching a bouncer. Reinhart's lawyer, Dina LaPolt, <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident that Reinhart was assaulted by bouncers at Lamplighter Inn in Palatine, Illinois without provocation and forcefully removed from the establishment while a friend in her party was violently beaten, sustaining multiple injuries. LaPolt expressed plans to take legal action against the bouncers involved in the incident. An active investigation into the event is underway, with police confirming on July 12, 2017, that a person was injured during the altercation, without revealing {{the identities of the}} injured person or their attacker. Reinhart appeared in court on August 2, 2017, and plead not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery. Her next court date is scheduled for October 6, 2017, at which time the case may go to trial. During the hearing, Reinhart's lawyer, Carmine Trombetta, described Reinhart as a victim, not a perpetrator in this case, and stated he is working on obtaining security footage to corroborate witness statements he already obtained in regards to the incident.|$|E

500|$|Gunn was {{influenced}} in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager Mike Walker.
