50|$|In chemistry, the sulfonamide {{functional}} group (also spelt <b>sulphonamide)</b> is -S(=O)2-NH2, a sulfonyl group connected to an amine group.

Because of the rigidity of the {{functional group}}, sulfonamides are typically crystalline.

The requirement of a detection level of 0. 1 ppm was met for five <b>sulphonamides</b> added singularly or in combination to pork, beef and veal.

5000|$|The {{cause of}} V. M. Grayburn's death was controversial.

There was a medical examination when his body was returned to Stanley Camp, but the doctors refused to reach a verdict because of the advanced state of decomposition. Dr. Talbot, the last doctor to see him before his death told the war crimes trial that Grayburn died of septicaemia as there were no <b>sulphonamide</b> (anti-bacterial) drugs were administered which could have saved him.

In 1941 he was awarded an exhibition scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he achieved a first classdegree in Chemistry. He had also taken a special biochemistry course. His final examination involved research on the adaptation of bacteria to unfavourable environments and, {{supported by a grant from}} the Medical Research Council plus a Studentship from Balliol (which the MRC deducted from his grant), he spent a year reading Microbial Chemistry before doing research for a doctorate on aspects of how bacteria adapt to resist <b>sulphonamide</b> drugs. [...] Sulfomamide drugs had been shown by D D Woods, his supervisor, to block the enzyme assimilating the metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA for short), a precursor of folic acid, by blocking the enzyme's active site. A substantial excess of a sulfonamide needed to put a complete stop to PABA assimilation. [...] Postgate's research was to study sulfonamide action on a species of bacteria that required PABA from the environment as a vitamin; it gave him valuable experience of competition in enzymology.|$|E

The most active compound was the sulphonyl-hydrazone 10 which showed an activity of around 72. 02 % at 60 mg/kg, it thus being more active than imipramine (10 mg/kg, ip), a commercial antidepressant. Other important results were obtained for the benzylnaphthalimide derivatives, the <b>sulphonamides</b> 21 and 22 showing activity of 64 % at 10 mg/kg, also being more active than imipramine.
