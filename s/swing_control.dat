The amputees changed their knee joint to one with pneumatic <b>swing</b> phase <b>control</b> (the Tehlin knee joint) at random either after the first or second assessment. The amputees were asked for their preference at the second and third assessments. The energy expenditure while walking at speeds of 2 and 3 km/h was measured at each assessment. After having tried both knee joints, 19 patients preferred the Tehlin knee, 6 patients preferred the Otto Beck 3 R 20, and 3 patients had no preference. The energy expenditure measurement showed that walking with the Tehlin knee required more energy than walking with Otto Beck 3 R 20. Because of the limited number of patients included in the study and the fact that a double-blind design was impossible to achieve, conclusions should be drawn with caution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Swing leg {{placement}} {{is vital}} to dynamic stability in legged robots and animals. The most common approaches to generating swing leg motions in robotics use either position or impedance tracking of defined joint trajectories. While these approaches suffice in humanoids, they severely limit swing leg placement under large disturbances in prosthetic limbs, for which stabilizing reactions cannot be planned centrally. Rather than careful central planning, animals and humans seem to rely on local feedback <b>control</b> for reliable <b>swing</b> leg placement. Motivated by this observation, we here present an alternative for generating swing leg motions. We develop a local <b>swing</b> leg <b>control</b> that takes advantage of segment interactions to achieve robust leg placement under large disturbances while generating trajectories and joint torque patterns similar to those patterns observed in human walking and running. The results suggest the identified control as a powerful alternative to existing <b>swing</b> leg <b>controls</b> in humanoid and rehabilitation robotics. I...|$|R

40|$|The Problem: In {{order for}} a trans-femoral (above-knee) amputee to walk {{in a variety of}} circumstances, a {{prosthetic}} knee must provide stance control to limit buckling when weight is applied to the prosthesis. In addition, it must provide aerial <b>swing</b> <b>control</b> so that the knee reaches full extension just before heel strike. Unlike a biological knee, a prosthetic knee must accomplish both stance and <b>swing</b> <b>control</b> without direct knowledge of its user’s intent or of the environment. Rather, a prosthetic knee must infer whether its user desires stance or swing behavior and predict when future stance/swing transitions should occur. It must also determine when changes occur in the environment such as when an amputee lifts a suitcase or walks down a slope. Further, an external knee prosthesis must not only be safe for the patient to use but should also help the patient walk in a smooth, non-pathological manner. Conventional prosthetic knees often force the amputee to walk with an awkward gait. As an example many prosthetic knees now being sold on the market lock up during ground contact, not allowing the amputee to go through normal knee flexion and extension motions found in early stance. The amputee is therefore forced to roll over a perfectly straight leg, resulting in large vertical fluctuations in the amputee’s center of mass and diminished shock absorption. Using state-of-the-art prosthetic knee technology, a prosthetist must pre-program knee damping values until a knee is comfortable, moves naturally, and is safe to use. However, these adjustments are not guided by biological gai...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Understanding the neuromuscular control under-lying human {{locomotion}} has {{the potential}} to deliver practical controllers for humanoid and prosthetic robots. However, neu-rocontrollers developed in forward dynamic simulations are seldom applied as practical controllers due to their lack of robustness and adaptability. A key element for robust and adaptive locomotion is swing leg placement.

These initial results highlight the potential of the identified robust <b>swing</b> <b>control.</b> We plan to generalize it to a range of human locomotion behaviors critical in rehabilitation robotics.

40|$|Abstract—Stability {{control for}} walking bipeds has been consid-ered a complex task. Even {{two-dimensional}} fore-aft stability in dy-namic walking {{appears to be}} difficult to achieve. In this paper we prove the contrary, starting from the basic belief that in nature sta-bility control must be the sum of a number of very simple rules. We study the global stability of the simplest walking model by deter-mining the basin of attraction of the Poincaré map of this model. This shows that the walker, although stable, can only handle very small disturbances. It mostly falls, either forward or backward. We show that it is impossible for any form of <b>swing</b> leg <b>control</b> to solve backward falling. For the problem of forward falling, we de-vise a simple but very effective rule for swing leg action: “You will never fall forward if you put your swing leg fast enough in front of your stance leg. In order to prevent falling backward the next step, the swing leg shouldn’t be too far in front. ” The effectiveness of this rule is demonstrated with our prototype “Mike. ” Index Terms—Legged locomotion, passive dynamic walking, re-flex, <b>swing</b> leg <b>control.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{along the}} spinal cord contribute substantially to generating locomotion behaviours in humans and other legged animals. However, the neural circuitry involved in this spinal control remains unclear. We here propose a specific circuitry that emphasizes feedback integration over central pattern generation. The circuitry is based on neurophysiologically plausible muscle-reflex pathways that are organized in 10 spinal modules realizing limb functions essential to legged systems in stance and swing. These modules are combined with a supraspinal control layer that adjusts the desired foot placements and selects the leg that is to transition into <b>swing</b> <b>control</b> during double support. Using physics-based simulation, we test the proposed circuitry in a neuromuscular human model that includes neural transmission delays, musculotendon dynamics and compliant foot-ground contacts. We find that the control network is sufficient to compose steady and transitional 3 -D locomotion behaviours including walking and running, acceleration and deceleration, slope and stair negotiation, turning, and deliberate obstacle avoidance. The results suggest feedback integration to be functionally more important than central pattern generation in human locomotion across behaviours. In addition, the proposed control architecture {{may serve as a}} guide in the search for the neurophysiological origin and circuitry of spinal control in humans...|$|E

A mechanism for the design of a fully passive, low-cost prosthetic knee device, which aims to facilitate able-bodied kinematics at a low metabolic cost is presented.

40|$|An {{improved}} controller for {{the energy}} management system of a power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is developed with the objectives of minimizing fuel consumption and improving drivability. Considering the specific application of vehicles plying on scheduled trips such as public transport, this paper assumes that the controller is privileged with a priori knowledge of the estimated total tractive energy requirement and {{the duration of the}} journey. In comparison to a recently introduced constant high-efficiency region (CHER) -based controller, this paper demonstrates that further reductions in fuel consumption can be achieved under certain driving cycles by limiting the internal-combustion-engine (ICE) operation to a dynamically varying high-efficiency region and adopting state-of-charge (SOC) <b>swing</b> <b>control</b> for battery energy storage. The frequency of engine on/off is therefore directly decided {{by the size of the}} energy storage, allowable swing of the SOC, and the tractive energy required.

Therefore, to minimize fuel consumption while improving drivability under all driving scenarios, this paper proposes to combine the CHER controller with the DHER controller such that the best features of both controllers can be utilized...|$|E
