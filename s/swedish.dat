5|$|A 800–1,000-strong <b>Swedish</b> Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of Tampere and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the <b>Swedish</b> Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through <b>Swedish</b> territorial waters. The <b>Swedish</b> socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a <b>Swedish</b> art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million <b>Swedish</b> kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an unsurpassed masterpiece of <b>Swedish</b> art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E

5|$|Besides the two UEFA Cup titles, {{they have}} won 18 <b>Swedish</b> {{championship}} titles, second most in <b>Swedish</b> football after Malmö FF, and have the third most national cup titles with seven. The team has qualified for four group stages of the UEFA Champions League, and reached the semi-finals of the 1985–86 European Cup. IFK Göteborg is the only <b>Swedish</b> club team in any sport to have won the Radiosportens Jerringpris—an award for best sports performance of the year voted by the <b>Swedish</b> people—for the 1982 UEFA Cup victory. IFK {{is the most popular}} football club in Sweden, with diverse country-wide support.|$|E
5|$|By 1675 the <b>Swedish</b> fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the <b>Swedish</b> ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced {{a larger proportion of}} its vessels with more modern warships. The <b>Swedish</b> side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. <b>Swedish</b> crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the <b>Swedish</b> Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} <b>Swedish</b> Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of <b>Swedish</b> forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his <b>Swedish</b> ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the <b>Swedish</b> Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both <b>Swedish</b> and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at <b>Swedish</b> class pride and <b>Swedish</b> disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{significant}} military advantage {{the allied}} armies encountered immediate setbacks. Denmark–Norway was quickly {{knocked out of}} the war by a bold <b>Swedish</b> landing on Humlebæk resulting in the Peace of Travendal. After this development, the <b>Swedish</b> army under Charles XII was free to sail east across the Baltic sea to tackle the remaining opponents, Russia and Saxony. In response to this threat, Augustus lifted the siege of Riga and marched back across the Düna river in order to observe the <b>Swedish</b> movements. Charles then decided to march against Peter I of Russia, who was besieging Narva, with the aim of saving the city. Shortly later the two armies met in the battle of Narva. This ended in a decisive <b>Swedish</b> victory which greatly crippled the Russian army, forcing them to abandon their campaign in <b>Swedish</b> territory and withdraw to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden {{from the}} 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. <b>Swedish</b> was the sole {{administrative}} language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of <b>Swedish</b> speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with <b>Swedish</b> being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where <b>Swedish</b> is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. <b>Swedish</b> is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.|$|E
5|$|Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 – but {{in direct}} contradiction of its terms – the <b>Swedish</b> {{government}} in 1683 {{demanded that the}} leading social groups of Skåneland accept <b>Swedish</b> customs and laws. <b>Swedish</b> became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be <b>Swedish.</b> However the last Danish bishop, Peder Winstrup remained {{in charge of the}} Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further <b>Swedish</b> assimilation, the University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in Copenhagen University until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, {{the small}} <b>Swedish</b> {{community}} was well treated. Municipalities with a <b>Swedish</b> majority, mainly found along the coast, used <b>Swedish</b> as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden {{before the end}} of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in <b>Swedish,</b> known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast of}} the Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian <b>Swedish</b> speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old <b>Swedish</b> Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak <b>Swedish</b> and observe the holidays of the <b>Swedish</b> calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|G.

5|$|He {{was well}} {{regarded}} in Sweden for his studies on Linnaeus, and possessed a good {{grasp of the}} language. In addition to his honorary doctorate from Uppsala, the Royal <b>Swedish</b> Academy of Sciences awarded him their Linnaeus Medal in 1972, he was granted the title of Commander of the <b>Swedish</b> Order of the Star of the North (Polar Star) in 1980 and admitted to membership of the Royal <b>Swedish</b> Academy of Sciences in 1983. Stearn was also elected to membership of the <b>Swedish</b> Linnaeus Society.|$|E
5|$|Her {{successful}} amateur career {{included a}} {{win in the}} St. Rule Trophy played at St. Andrews and a runner-up finish in the <b>Swedish</b> national mother/daughter golf tournament. As {{a member of the}} <b>Swedish</b> National Team from 1987 to 1992, she played in the 1990 and 1992 Espirito Santo Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships, becoming World Amateur champion in 1992. While waiting to start college in Sweden, Sörenstam worked as a personal assistant at the <b>Swedish</b> PGA and played on the <b>Swedish</b> Ladies Telia Tour, winning three tournaments during 1990/1991.|$|E
5|$|IFK Göteborg play in {{the highest}} <b>Swedish</b> league, Allsvenskan, where they have played for the {{majority}} of their history. They have played in the <b>Swedish</b> first tier continuously since 1977, which is the longest ongoing top-flight tenure in Sweden. The club won its first <b>Swedish</b> championship in 1908, four years after the founding, and has won at least one championship title in all decades since, except the 1920s, 1970s and 2010s. IFK Göteborg's most successful period was from 1982 to 1996, when the team prospered in European football and won 10 out of 15 <b>Swedish</b> championships.|$|E
5|$|In 1561, <b>Swedish</b> forces {{arrived and}} the noble {{corporations}} of Harrien–Wierland and Jerwen (Järva) yielded to Sweden {{to form the}} Duchy of Estonia. Reval, similarly, accepted <b>Swedish</b> rule. Denmark dominated the Baltic, and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic. Doing so would help Sweden control the West's trade with Russia. This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years' War since in 1561, Frederick II had already protested against <b>Swedish</b> presence in Reval, claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia. When Erik XIV's forces seized Pernau in June 1562, his diplomats tried to arrange <b>Swedish</b> protection for Riga, which brought him into conflict with Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|In 1626 the {{southern}} {{threat to the}} Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by <b>Swedish</b> forces reignited the Polish–Swedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gdańsk (Danzig). Having taken Piława and Braniewo, <b>Swedish</b> forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, Elbląg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starograd, while other <b>Swedish</b> forces landed near Puck—the main port of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet—and captured it. The major city of Gdańsk, however, refused to surrender {{even in the face}} of lightning <b>Swedish</b> advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 near the village of Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements from other parts of the country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the <b>Swedish</b> incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia.|$|E
5|$|In 1655, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded and {{occupied}} western Poland–Lithuania, {{the eastern half}} of which was already occupied by Russia. The rapid <b>Swedish</b> advance became known in Poland as the <b>Swedish</b> Deluge. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a <b>Swedish</b> fief, the Polish–Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia initially supported the estates in Royal Prussia, but allied with Sweden in return for receiving the Duchy of Prussia as a <b>Swedish</b> fief. Exploiting the hurt religious feelings of the Roman Catholic population under Protestant occupation and organizing Polish–Lithuanian military leaders in the Tyszowce Confederation, John II Casimir Vasa managed to regain ground in 1656. Russia took advantage of the <b>Swedish</b> setback, declared war on Sweden and pushed into Lithuania and <b>Swedish</b> Livonia.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the club}} marked their 100th anniversary with many celebratory {{events at the}} {{beginning}} of the season. On the day of the club's 100th anniversary in 2010, the <b>Swedish</b> football magazine Offside declared Malmö FF to be the greatest football club in <b>Swedish</b> history. The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became <b>Swedish</b> champions for the sixteenth time. Unlike in 2004, these successes were achieved without any major transfers before the season, and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In <b>Swedish,</b> however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only <b>Swedish</b> terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} <b>Swedish</b> blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the <b>Swedish</b> words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in <b>Swedish</b> heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In June 1658 it {{was decided}} that the <b>Swedish</b> forces would attack. On August 6, 1658 a fleet of 70 ships with 5,700 men and 18 pieces of light {{artillery}} embarked upon a journey to Denmark. Since the previous war, Jylland was still occupied by <b>Swedish</b> troops and there were troops on Fyn. In addition to this, Field Marshal Gustav Otto Stenbock had assembled reinforcements in Scania in Southern Sweden. The plan was for the <b>Swedish</b> army to march on Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Jean Abraham Grill (21July 173612March 1792), {{sometimes}} called Johan Abraham Grill, was a <b>Swedish</b> merchant, supercargo, {{director of the}} <b>Swedish</b> East India Company (SOIC) and ironmaster at Godegård with several factories.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the <b>Swedish</b> {{flagship}} Kronan sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the <b>Swedish</b> navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the <b>Swedish</b> side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the <b>Swedish</b> fleet fled in disorder.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 1990s, the <b>Swedish</b> group Narnia made {{contributions}} to Christian power metal history, having signed with Nuclear Blast Records, Germany, and Pony Canyon Records, Japan. Later there appeared more notable European {{groups such as}} the German bands Chrystyne and Lightmare, and the <b>Swedish</b> groups XT, Divinefire, Harmony, and Heartcry.|$|E
5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the <b>Swedish</b> soldiers. However, the <b>Swedish</b> force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The <b>Swedish</b> commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the <b>Swedish</b> soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in <b>Swedish</b> hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
5|$|People {{saved by}} Wallenberg include {{biochemist}} Lars Ernster, who was {{housed in the}} <b>Swedish</b> embassy, and Tom Lantos, later {{a member of the}} United States House of Representatives, who lived in one of the <b>Swedish</b> protective houses.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt even {{extended}} {{an invitation}} to the <b>Swedish</b> Trade Union Confederation, traditional supporter of the Social Democrats and opponent of the Moderate Party. He also changed the Moderate Party's traditional stance towards the <b>Swedish</b> Labour and employment laws, stating that he prefers small changes instead of any radical reform.|$|E
5|$|Rinkeby <b>Swedish</b> (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of <b>Swedish</b> spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård <b>Swedish</b> (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the <b>Swedish</b> linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby <b>Swedish</b> speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby <b>Swedish</b> whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg kept a {{close bond}} to his <b>Swedish</b> origin. He visited Sweden every so often, {{and his family}} were members of the <b>Swedish</b> Pemer Genealogical Society, a family {{association}} open for every descendant of the Pemer family, a <b>Swedish</b> family with German origin, from which Seaborg was descended on his mother's side.|$|E
5|$|Standard <b>Swedish</b> is the {{language}} used by virtually all Swedes and most Swedish-speaking Finns. It is called rikssvenska or standardsvenska ("Standard Swedish") in Sweden. In Finland högsvenska ("High Swedish") {{is used for the}} Finnish variant of standard <b>Swedish</b> and rikssvenska refers to <b>Swedish</b> as spoken in Sweden in general. The word högsvenska is seldom used in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swedish</b> {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. <b>Swedish</b> heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. <b>Swedish</b> and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, <b>Swedish</b> heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only <b>Swedish</b> terminology.|$|E
