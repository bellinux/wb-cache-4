NextWorth {{was founded by}} business students at Babson College in 2005.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{supplier}} performance impact of governance structures involving different modes of formal control (i. e., output and behaviour) and informal control, individually and in combination under varying conditions of <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> (i. e., mass or professional). Hypotheses are developed and tested on {{a sample of}} 132 buyer-supplier relationships. Analyzing the control modes individually, results indicate that when the buyer relies on high output control, supplier performance improves only in mass <b>services</b> <b>exchanges.</b> On the other hand, when the buyer relies on high informal control, supplier performance improves in both types of <b>services</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Studying the performance impact of the control modes in a combined form, results indicate that {{in a context of}} mass <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> and (already) high output control, there is no additional impact of behaviour control on supplier performance, nor of informal control. However, in a context of professional <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> and (already) high informal control, we find that behaviour control further improves supplier performance, while output control deteriorates supplier performance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} formal control on supplier performance in interfirm <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Whereas some research suggests that formal control can enhance supplier performance, {{there is also evidence}} showing that formal control can actually have no or even a negative effect on supplier performance. We propose that the actual effect of formal control depends on (1) the mode of formal control being used (output versus behavior), and its relationship with (2) service type (mass versus professional) and (3) informal control. Hypotheses are developed and tested on a sample of 253 buyer-supplier relationships. Results indicate that output control interacts with service type in determining supplier performance. Buyers’ reliance on high output control has a positive effect on supplier performance in mass <b>service</b> <b>exchanges,</b> whereas this effect becomes negative in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The interaction effect of behavior control and service type, on the other hand, is dependent on the presence of informal control. Buyers’ reliance on high behavior control has a more positive effect on supplier performance in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges</b> than in mass <b>service</b> <b>exchanges,</b> but only in the presence of informal control. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Control {{offers a}} {{critical}} differentiator between successful and failed interfirm <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The application of informal control to improve supplier performance {{has been well}} established, but the effect of formal control appears profoundly equivocal. This study proposes that the actual effect of formal control depends on its mode (output vs. behavior) and {{its relationship with the}} service type (mass vs. professional) and informal control. With survey data from 252 service buying organizations, the results indicate that output control interacts with service type to determine perceived supplier performance (PSP). Buyers’ reliance on high output control has a positive effect on PSP in mass service exchanges; this effect becomes negative in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The effect of the interaction of behavior control and service type also depends on the presence of informal control. Buyers’ reliance on high behavior control exerts a more positive effect on PSP in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges</b> than in mass <b>service</b> <b>exchanges,</b> but only in the presence of informal control. These findings have key implications for both theory and practice. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInformation systems {{urbanization}} {{is among}} the most well-known approaches defined in the recent years to build agile information systems. This approach links enterprise architecture and information systems governance. It is based on the “Information City” framework and two architecture principles: strong consistency and loose coupling. Nevertheless, the implementation of the loose coupling principle in urbanized information systems still faces numerous difficulties related notably to <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> governance. In this paper, we propose a framework – called the four spaces model – for the governance of services in the case of application of the SOA architecture style to urbanized information systems. In particular, we focus on the operational aspects of <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> governance either within the same information system or between different information systems. This framework has many important contributions. First, it standardizes the exchanges between the organizational actors involved in the services governance process. Second, it facilitates <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> traceability. Third, it promotes loose coupling both within the same information system and between different information systems...|$|R

50|$|At {{the core}} of S-D logic is the idea all exchanges can be viewed in terms of service-for-service exchange, the {{reciprocal}} application of resources for others' benefit (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). Focus on service (singular) steers attention to the process, patterns, and benefits of exchange, rather than the units of output that are exchanged (e.g., goods). S-D logic argues {{that in order to}} create value, that is to maintain and increase wellbeing and viability, actors engage in interdependent and reciprocally beneficial <b>service</b> <b>exchange</b> (Lusch and Vargo, 2014). Hence, value creation occurs in networks in which resources are exchanged among multiple actors and is therefore more accurately conceptualized as value cocreation (Vargo and Lusch, 2008, Vargo, Maglio and Akaka, 2009). Recently, S-D logic has moved toward a dynamic, systems orientation in which value cocreation is coordinated through shared institutions (norms, symbols, and other heuristics), often massive-scale resource integration and <b>service</b> <b>exchange</b> processes (Lusch and Vargo, 2014, Vargo and Lusch 2016).|$|E
