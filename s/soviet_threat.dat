5|$|On January 24, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front led by General Chernyakhovsky, {{surrounded}} {{the capital city}} of East Prussia, Königsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians were trapped inside the city. In response to this, General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat,</b> but the Führer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in Königsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without knowing that the town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.|$|E
5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February, Hausser's SS Panzer Corps {{was ordered}} to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army's attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt {{was ordered to}} contain the {{continuing}} Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north {{in an attempt to}} cut off and destroy Popov's Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence on Soviet strength which allowed the Wehrmacht to pick and choose their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20–23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army's flank, eliminating the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to the Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov's Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.|$|E
25|$|There was {{virtually}} no further flying at Westonzoyland until {{the summer of}} 1952 when, to meet the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat,</b> {{an increase in the}} RAF's strength and a demand for more aircrews found Meteors and Vampires operating in a training role.|$|E

25|$|General Ma Buqing was {{in virtual}} {{control of the}} Gansu {{corridor}} at that time. Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was great, Chiang changed Ma's position, in July, 1942, by instructing Ma to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. Chiang named Ma as Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten Sheng Shicai's southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> {{certainly}} {{formed an}} important component of ASIO’s activities, but threats from other sources of foreign interference and politically motivated violence have been important to ASIO for some time, and will remain so. However, the implications for ASIO of the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are more far-reaching than for the other agencies. The Government has therefore decided that while ASIO’s capacity to meet its responsibilities must be maintained, there is scope for resource reductions.|$|E

5000|$|As {{equipment}} capability increased, and {{the perceived}} <b>Soviet</b> bomber <b>threat</b> diminished, the requirement for numbers decreased, and the nine CF-100 squadrons were replaced by five CF-101 squadrons, which later fell to three. The auxiliary squadrons also lost their air defence role. At the same time, the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line radar stations, largely operated by the RCAF, were built across Canada because of the growing <b>Soviet</b> nuclear <b>threat.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Czech coup, the PCF's failed {{policy of}} {{sabotage}} and the Marshall Plan's likely passage were all beginning to sway French public opinion. 70% of French people now believed the U.S. {{would do more}} than any other country to help France, compared to 7% who thought the USSR would do more. Despite French concern about Germany, it was becoming increasingly clear that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was greater than the German. France would still seek an advantageous power position vis-à-vis Germany, but it was becoming reconciled to the prospect of a rehabilitated Germany as part of postwar Europe.|$|E
25|$|For the Germans, {{the effects}} were bigger. Although the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was {{eliminated}} {{and the position}} of the 18th Army re-established, the 11th Army had suffered serious losses in men, equipment and ammunition. The 18th Army also suffered losses, especially the 223rd Infantry Division, which was opposing the 8th Army {{on the first day of}} its offensive. Heavy casualties led to the OKH Operations Order No. 1, which ordered Army Group North to defense during the winter. In November, the German reinforcements and other units were stripped from Army Group North to deal with a major Soviet offensive at Stalingrad and Operation Northern Light was aborted.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Korean War (June 1950) led to U.S. calls for the rearmament of West Germany in order to defend western Europe from the perceived <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b> But the memory of German aggression led other European states to seek tight control over the West German military. Germany's partners in the Coal and Steel Community decided to establish a European Defence Community (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed {{of the armed forces}} of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.|$|E

5000|$|As a Senator, Denton {{was most}} outspoken on {{issues related to}} the {{preservation}} of the nuclear family, a goal that he sought to pursue through a $30 million bill to push chastity among teenagers. [...] Denton also chaired a subcommittee on internal security and terrorism, which focused on communist and <b>Soviet</b> <b>threats.</b> By the mid-1980s, he told Time magazine {{at the outset of the}} decade, [...] "We will have less national security than we had proportionately when George Washington’s troops were walking around barefoot at Valley Forge." ...|$|R
5000|$|The SKP {{received}} substantial {{financial support}} from the Soviet Union during the Cold War [...] Internally, SKP was divided, with a Eurocommunist mainstream and a hardline Pro-Moscow minority, called the Taistoists after their leader, Taisto Sinisalo. The word [...] "taisto" [...] also means [...] "battle" [...] or [...] "fight"; the double connotation made this slur, originally launched by the largest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, stick. <b>Soviet</b> <b>threats</b> to withdraw support were the main reason why reformists didn't expel the Taistoists from the party leadership or membership.|$|R
25|$|By {{that moment}} in time, he was {{publicly}} voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, {{he was concerned about}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, Sfaturi pe întuneric ("Advice at Dark", soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor ("Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians"), the polemical essay Lupta mea contra prostiei ("My Fight against Stupidity"), and the first two volumes of the long planned Istoria românilor.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike nuclear capacity. The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> to justify a new American antiballistic missile system, publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} {{stages of the}} Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{aircraft}} carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also mine countermeasures and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf War against Iraq, with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking {{a large proportion of}} the Iraqi Navy. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1991. The RN also carried out many mine countermeasures operations. However, the end of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> brought about a very large reduction in the strength of the Navy. All its diesel-electric submarines were decommissioned in 1992 and more surface combatants left the fleet.|$|E
50|$|This {{conflict}} {{was one of}} the first episodes of the Cold War outside Europe, and was a factor in the evolving and increasingly contentious political relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which followed their joint victory in World War II. According to Lenczowski, U.S. President Truman's actions laid the foundations of US relations with Iran, and were based on his understanding of the nature of the Soviet system and its expansionist proclivities, as well as on his conviction that <b>Soviet</b> <b>threats</b> and aggression should be contained, with force if necessary.|$|R

25|$|During the Second World War, Gale applied these {{principles}} {{to the development}} of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one's military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on the disproportionate effect that surprise manoeuvre had on a 'demoralised or unprepared enemy', as opposed to a 'well-trained opposition', from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in the nuclear age. Still an advocate of manoeuvre and high-quality forces, Gale was to stress the importance of achieving mobility and flexibility {{in the face of the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat,</b> foreshadowing in many ways the evolution of the AirLand battle doctrine of the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, the British {{government}} {{purchased the}} privately owned copra plantations and closed them. Over {{the next five}} years, the British authorities forcibly and clandestinely removed {{the entire population of}} about 2,000 people, known as Chagossians (or Ilois), from Diego Garcia and two other Chagos atolls, Peros Banhos and Salomon Islands, to Mauritius. In 1971, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a treaty, leasing the island of Diego Garcia to the US military for the purposes of building a large air and naval base on the island. The deal was important to the UK government, as the United States granted it a substantial discount on the purchase of Polaris nuclear missiles in return {{for the use of the}} islands as a base. The strategic location of the island was also significant at the centre of the Indian Ocean, and to counter any <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> in the region.|$|E
25|$|Whipple also {{discloses}} that Japan {{has retained}} its militarism, {{with reference to}} its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have moved towards a closer military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan and the United States {{are the only two}} major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b> Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of Lord of the Swastika, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken the systematic genocide of all Jews in Europe—and since this is perpetrated by the Soviets, there is no power left whose armies might stop it and save at least a remnant of the Jews from this version of the Holocaust.|$|E
50|$|Fukuyama {{received}} his Bachelor of Arts degree in classics from Cornell University, {{where he studied}} political philosophy under Allan Bloom. He initially pursued graduate studies in comparative literature at Yale University, going to Paris for six months to study under Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, but became disillusioned and switched to political science at Harvard University. There, he studied with Samuel P. Huntington and Harvey Mansfield, among others. He earned his Ph.D. in political science at Harvard for his thesis on <b>Soviet</b> <b>threats</b> {{to intervene in the}} Middle East. In 1979, he joined the global policy think tank RAND Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|Representatives {{of these}} three governments, along with the Benelux nations, met twice in London (London 6-Power Conference) {{in the first half}} of 1948 to discuss the future of Germany, going ahead despite <b>Soviet</b> <b>threats</b> to ignore any {{resulting}} decisions. [...] Eventually the London Agreement on German External Debts, also known as the London Debt Agreement (German: Londoner Schuldenabkommen), was concluded. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.|$|R
25|$|The {{space program}} of the People's Republic of China is {{directed}} by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). Its technological roots {{can be traced back}} to the late 1950s, when the People's Republic began a ballistic missile program in response to perceived American (and, later, <b>Soviet)</b> <b>threats.</b> However, the first Chinese crewed space program only began several decades later, when an accelerated program of technological development culminated in Yang Liwei's successful 2003 flight aboard Shenzhou5. This achievement made China the third country to independently send humans into space. Plans currently include a permanent Chinese space station in 2020 and crewed expeditions to the Moon.|$|R
