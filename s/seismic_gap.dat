5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring {{in less than}} two weeks, each with mild to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred off the coast of Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern California coast occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern San Andreas Fault system that has been designated a <b>seismic</b> <b>gap,</b> and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same <b>seismic</b> <b>gap</b> theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.7(Mw) earthquake occurred inland {{near the}} southern coast of Mexico {{at a depth of}} 24km (14.9mi), with a duration of nearly one minute and an epicenter about 55km (34mi) west of Ometepec, Guerrero. In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero <b>seismic</b> <b>gap,</b> which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap to rupture. Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E
500|$|Strong motion {{stations}} at the Long Valley Dam and an instrumented {{building in}} Bishop captured light to moderate readings from the event. The faulting reached {{the surface of}} the ground, but the maximum amount of measurable slip was limited to about [...] of strike-slip motion along the White Mountain Fault Zone. Other destructive and surface-rupturing earthquakes, as well as large volume volcanic eruptions, have occurred in the area. Although the series of shocks occurred within the White Mountain <b>seismic</b> <b>gap,</b> the region continues to have potential for a very large earthquake.|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} ocean bottom seismographic {{observations in}} 2008 and estimated 851 hypocenter {{locations around the}} south part of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. We found several <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> and the most remarkable one is positioned {{near the edge of}} the PHS. The aftershocks are segmented spatially and there are some <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> among segmentations. We infer that the <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> have strong heterogeneity resulting from strong deformations. Various subduction processes such as intervened PHS between NA and PAC, seamount chains and variations in physical properties have the ability to cause the deformations.|$|R

Before the main-shock, several <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> {{near the edge of the}} Philippine Sea plate were found (Yamada et al., 2011). In the aftershock distribution of the 2011 mainshock, we also see low seismic activities in the region where <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> existed before the mainshock. It is inferred that the seismicity in this region is related to heterogeneity.|$|R
500|$|Earthquakes {{in southwestern}} Yunnan, {{such as the}} 1970 Tonghai event, are less {{frequent}} than {{in other parts of}} the province. The Red River Fault, the fault line on which this quake is alleged to have occurred, has lacked seismological activity as a whole. Red River temblors generally rise at high angles, as shown in a 1962 Ministry of Geology report. Marking in sedimentary rocks indicate that several large earthquakes formed on the fault during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Until this quake, no earthquake above magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale had occurred on this fault since about 1700, and the fault was believed to be [...] "dead". Since the 1970 Tonghai rupture, it is believed that the Red River fault is instead experiencing a long <b>seismic</b> <b>gap</b> similar to that of the Japan Median Tectonic Line, on which no major temblor has formed since 700 but produced massive ones during the Holocene epoch.|$|E
500|$|As no large {{earthquake}} {{has occurred}} between the southern {{extent of the}} 1932 Cedar Mountain earthquake's rupture and the northern extent of the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake's rupture in the south (a distance of [...] ), the zone has been labeled the White Mountain <b>seismic</b> <b>gap.</b> The 1934 M6.3 Excelsior Mountains earthquake and the 1986 Chalfant Valley event were several smaller earthquakes that have occurred within the gap, and both generated limited surface faulting and some surface cracking in the Volcanic Tableland, which was created [...]7 million years ago from a major volcanic eruption that also formed the Long Valley Caldera northwest of Bishop. An estimated 500 cubic kilometers of material (tephra) produced in the event covers the northern Owens Valley as a rocky landform. The surface of the layered plateau is known as Bishop Tuff and features fumarole mounds and hundreds of north-south oriented fault scarps, {{many of which are}} visible on topographic maps, via aerial photography, and satellite imagery.|$|E

[...] But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the <b>seismic</b> <b>gap</b> model the [...] "next big quake" [...] should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest. This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was {{the basis of a}} series of circum-Pacific (Pacific Rim) forecasts in 1979 and 1989–1991.|$|E
2500|$|The 1989 Loma Prieta {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} Northern California on October 17 at [...] local time. The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately [...] northeast of Santa Cruz on {{a section of}} the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a <b>seismic</b> <b>gap)</b> until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{earthquake}} investigations in California {{has been largely}} focused on the San Andreas Fault System, due to its strong influence in the state as {{the boundary between the}} Pacific Plate and the North American Plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth. Andrew Lawson, a geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, had named the fault after the San Andreas Lake (prior to the occurrence of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of [...] during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its aftershocks occurred within a recognized <b>seismic</b> <b>gap)</b> but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered oblique-slip reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} gravity {{tectonics}} {{is applied to}} reveal the major clue as to the conditions which result in the correspondence of <b>seismic</b> and tectonic <b>gaps</b> in the mantle. An asymptotic theory is developed for the calculation of the thrust and moment when a descending lithospheric plate encounters resistance to its downward motion in the mesosphere. Dynamic analysis falls into two parts: (1) deriving equations for forces in the descending lithosphere, (2) deducing moment distribution which causes the detachment of lithosphere. For the analysis of forces a mathematical theory of shells is given. In {{order to determine the}} detachment mechanism, solutions of equations are obtained by asymptotic integration. It is found that a thrust N sub phi coupled with a moment M sub phi due to gravitational forces generated by density contrast may {{play a key role in}} the initial detachment of a piece of descending lithosphere. The results are in agreement with the observed <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps</b> beneath South America, Toga-Fiji, New Zealand and New Hebrides regions...|$|R
30|$|The {{fault plane}} {{of a large}} {{earthquake}} is one of most fundamental pieces of seismological information required to understand the mechanism of the occurrence of the earthquake and the seismo-tectonics of the source area, {{as well as for}} evaluating the prospect of future earthquakes. The source area of the Niigata earthquake is located at the main tectonic boundary of the eastern margin of the Japan Sea (Taira, 2002). <b>Seismic</b> <b>gaps,</b> in which large earthquakes are expected to occur in the near future, exist in areas adjacent to the Niigata earthquake (Ohtake, 2002). To evaluate the potential occurrence of future earthquakes and their source mechanisms, the fault plane of the Niigata earthquake should be identified as accurately as possible.|$|R

2500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast of}} the Mexican state of Michoacán, a distance of more than 350km (217mi) [...] from the city, in the Cocos Plate subduction zone, specifically in a section of the fault line known as the Michoacán <b>seismic</b> <b>gap.</b> The Cocos Plate pushes against and slides under the North American Plate, primarily along the coasts of the states of Michoacán and Guerrero in Mexico. Volatile trenches along the Cocos plate generally have had seismic events 30 to 70 years before 1985. This subduction zone outside the Michoacán gap was the source of 42 earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or stronger in the 20th century prior to the 1985 event. However, this particular section of the subduction zone had not had an event for a much longer time. Shockwaves from the earthquake hit the mouth of the Río Balsas on the coast at 7:17am and hit Mexico City, 350km (217mi) away, two minutes later at 7:19am. The 19 September quake was a multiple event with two epicenters and the second movement occurring 26 seconds after the first. Because of multiple breaks in the fault line, the event was of long duration. Ground shaking lasted more than five minutes in places along the coast and parts of Mexico City shook for three minutes, with an average shaking time of 3–4 minutes. It is estimated the movement along the fault was about three meters. The main tremor was foreshadowed by a quake of magnitude 5.2 on 28 May 1985, and was followed by two significant aftershocks: one on 20 September 1985 of magnitude 7.5 lasting thirteen seconds and the third occurring seven months later on 30 April 1986 with magnitude 7.0 lasting ten seconds. However, at least twelve other minor aftershocks were associated with the seismic event.|$|E

30|$|This {{earthquake}} sequence raises several questions: Why {{were these}} faults ruptured {{not by a}} single large earthquake but by three successive ones? What caused the <b>seismic</b> <b>gaps?</b> Toward addressing these questions, phenomenological understanding of this earthquake sequence is essential. This paper presents following seismological observations: the underground fault geometry of the Hinagu and Futagawa fault systems inferred from distribution of aftershocks refined by an earthquake relocation analysis; {{the relationship between the}} Aso gap and the rupture process of the largest shock, event γ, inferred from a finite fault slip inversion using strong-motion data; and a detection and quantification of a dynamic triggering event in the Yufuin–Beppu area, Oita prefecture. Based on these observations, we will show a perspective to solve the abovementioned questions.|$|R

We compare the platelike (nonorogen) regions of model PB 2002 (Bird, 2003) with the centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog to select apparent boundary half-widths and then assign 95 % of shallow earthquakes to one of these settings. A tapered Gutenberg-Richter model of the frequency/moment relation is fit to the subcatalog for each setting by maximum likelihood. Best-fitting b values range from 0. 53 to 0. 92, but all 95 % confidence ranges are consistent with a common value of 0. 61 – 0. 66. To better determine some corner magnitudes we expand the subcatalogs by (1) inclusion of orogens and (2) inclusion of years 1900 – 1975 from the catalog of Pacheco and Sykes (1992).
