60|$|He {{pointed to}} a wide ditch {{extending}} from the swamp towards the river. It had been cut to within a few yards of the latter, and all {{the men of the}} place were busily engaged with primitive picks, <b>spades,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovels,</b> in that harmonious unity of action of which the captain had expressed such a high opinion.|$|E
60|$|When the {{flooding}} {{of the lake}} has reached its climax, the millers, who are the principal sufferers by the overflow, prepare to cut a passage through the Bar for the superabundant waters of the Pool. Before they can do this, however, they must conform to a curious old custom which has been practised for centuries, and is retained down to the present day. Procuring two stout leathern purses, they tie up three halfpence in each, and then set off with them in a body to the Lord of the Manor. Presenting him with their purses, they state their case with all due formality, and request permission to cut their trench through the sand. In consideration of the threepenny recognition of his rights, the Lord of the Manor graciously accedes to the petition; and the millers, armed with their <b>spades</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovels,</b> start for the Bar.|$|E
60|$|Harold {{pushed the}} door open and entered, {{shutting}} it behind him. It was, if anything, more disagreeable in the empty silence of the wide place than it had been outside, for the space roofed over was considerable, and the question at once arose in his mind, what was he to do now that he had got there? If the treasure was there at all, probably it was deep down {{in the bowels of the}} great mound. Well, as he was on the spot, he thought that he might as well try to dig, though probably nothing would come of it. In the corner were a pickaxe and some <b>spades</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovels.</b> Harold got them, advanced to the centre of the space and, half laughing at his own folly, set to work. First, having lit another lantern which was kept there, he removed with the sharp end of the pickaxe a large patch of the encaustic tiles exactly in the centre of the depression. Then having loosened the soil beneath with the pick he took off his ulster and fell to digging with a will. The soil proved to be very sandy and easy to work. Indeed, from its appearance, he soon came to the conclusion that it was not virgin earth, but worked soil which had been thrown there.|$|E
6000|$|Let it be {{remarked that}} [...] "the lad Tom" [...] had {{that very day}} [...] "come back with the Minister." [...] The Fiend then offered terms. [...] "Give me a <b>spade</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovel,</b> <b>and</b> depart from the house for seven days, and I will make a grave, and lie down in it, and trouble you no more." [...] Hereon Campbell, with Scottish caution, {{declined}} to give the Devil {{the value of a}} straw. The visitors then hunted after the voice, observing that some of the children were in bed. They found nothing, and then, as the novelists say, [...] "a strange thing happened." ...|$|R
60|$|And this {{put me in}} {{mind that}} I wanted many things {{notwithstanding}} all that I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a <b>spade,</b> pickaxe, <b>and</b> <b>shovel,</b> to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "In one {{somewhat}} elevated {{position a}} number of men were set to work with <b>spades,</b> picks, <b>and</b> <b>shovels,</b> to throw up an earthwork. When it had assumed sufficiently large dimensions {{to attract the attention}} of the French, a body of men, with blue jackets, and caps with bits of red flannel hanging down the sides, were marched up behind it at the double, and posted there.|$|R
50|$|The corn mill {{was burned}} down {{during the middle}} years {{of the nineteenth century}} but was rebuilt as a factory for making <b>spades</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovels.</b> The lint mill was later adapted as an {{auxiliary}} of the shovel works.|$|E

With the first drove of cattle of the season, the party piloted the herd over the new trail and across the Arkansas River, thus opening it to the many thousand herds that followed in the months and years afterward." ...|$|E
50|$|Reams {{sold the}} land in 1922 to two {{brothers}} from Dayton, Ohio, Allen and Ira Smith, who hired {{an unknown number of}} workers to help them excavate the rest of the caverns. The team spent {{three and a half years}} digging with an array of <b>spades</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovels</b> to remove mud left in the tunnels by the underground river that eroded the tunnels. As they went, the Smith team strung 60-watt light bulbs from the walls and ceilings to help them see. These lights were powered by a Fordson tractor on the surface, as the area did not get electricity until the mid-1930s.|$|E
50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Bescot was {{dominated}} by the Forge Works which were owned by Edward Elwell. The works featured a tall, tapered chimney and a pool from which was extracted, called Elwell's Pool.

6000|$|... "For all that, Sir Duncan," [...] {{answered}} the persevering commander, [...] "I would premonish you, as a friend, to trace out a sconce upon that round hill, {{with a good}} graffe, or ditch, whilk may be easily accomplished by compelling the labour of the boors in the vicinity; it being the custom of the valorous Gustavus Adolphus to fight as much by the <b>spade</b> <b>and</b> <b>shovel,</b> as by sword, pike, and musket. Also, I would advise you to fortify the said sconce, not only by a foussie, or graffe, but also by certain stackets, or palisades."--(Here Sir Duncan, becoming impatient, left the apartment, the Captain following him to the door, and raising his voice as he retreated, until he was fairly out of hearing.)--"The whilk stackets, or palisades, should be artificially framed with re-entering angles and loop-holes, or crenelles, for musketry, whereof it shall arise that the foeman--The Highland brute! the old Highland brute! They are as proud as peacocks, and as obstinate as tups--and here he has missed an opportunity of making his house as pretty an irregular fortification as an invading army ever broke their teeth upon.--But I see," [...] he continued, looking own from the window upon {{the bottom of the}} precipice, [...] "they have got Gustavus safe ashore--Proper fellow! I would know that toss of his head among a whole squadron. I must go to see what they are to make of him." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} to suppose but that the preceeding {{relation}} of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable and no less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who heard it: now were these people less pleased with those necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the knives, scissars, <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels,</b> <b>and</b> pick-axes, with which they now adorn their habitations.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will we, lad," [...] said Bryan, {{shouldering}} a <b>spade</b> <b>and</b> proceeding {{towards the}} chimney of the hall; {{while the rest}} of the party, breaking up into several groups, set to work, with <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels,</b> <b>and</b> such implements as were suitable, to cut passages through the square of the fort towards the doors of the several buildings. As Massan had said, it proved to be no light work. The north-west gale had launched the snow upon the exposed buildings of Fort Chimo until the drift was fifteen or sixteen feet deep, so that the mere cutting of passages was a matter of considerable time and severe labour.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{brought them}} out all my store of tools, and gave every man a digging <b>spade,</b> a <b>shovel,</b> <b>and</b> a rake, for {{we had no}} harrows or ploughs; and to every {{separate}} place a pickaxe, a crow, a broadaxe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out, they should be supplied, without grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.|$|R
50|$|Churchill Forge Mill is a water powered forge mill. It is {{situated}} {{in the village of}} Churchill, which is near Hagley, in the English county of Worcestershire. Until the early 1970s was operated as a working business, producing metal tools such as <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels</b> <b>and</b> ladles. It {{is one of the last}} water powered forge mills remaining in an intact state in the UK and as such is an important example of the industrial heritage of the West Midlands.|$|R

From 1878 {{he worked as}} an engineer at Lesjöfors (Lesjöfors Bruk) in Värmland, Sweden, and represented the company in Christiania (now Oslo) from 1881. After settling in Christiania he founded a trade company which came {{to be one of}} Norway's largest companies in the construction business. The business included sales of wire, <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels</b> <b>and</b> hand tools. The company imported iron and steel products from Swedish producers. [...] The company he founded merged with Stormbull AS in 1978 to form Aspelin-Stormbull AS, now Aspelin Ramm Gruppen AS.|$|R
50|$|There {{followed}} {{three months}} of bitter winter in appalling trench conditions, <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels</b> <b>and</b> picks more in use than weapons. New young recruits began arriving, but in the relative inactivity, sixty five men were hit by harassing random fire. Forty went down with frostbite and trench fever in the Arctic weather. In May the 2RMF received many of the personnel from the disbanded 9RMF, bringing it up to strength for the summer campaign. The first noteworthy operation was the Liévin raid on 25 June into which much preparation had been put, a VC. being awarded to Lieutenant Arthur Batten-Pooll, though losses were heavy with 5 officers and 60 other ranks (2 and 12 resp. killed).|$|R
60|$|I {{divided the}} tools among {{them in this}} manner: to every man I gave a digging <b>spade,</b> a <b>shovel,</b> <b>and</b> a rake, as having no harrows or ploughs; and to every {{separate}} place a pickax, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw, with a store for a general supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left them also nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, {{and all sorts of}} tools and iron work; & {{for the use of the}} smith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron, for a supply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even to profusion; or at least to equip a sufficient little army against all opposers whatsoever.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Murmansk on August 2, 1933, the {{steamship}} {{managed to}} get {{through most of the}} Northern Route before it was caught in the ice fields in September. After that it drifted in the ice pack before sinking on February 13, 1934, crushed by the icepacks near Kolyuchin Island in the Chukchi Sea. The crew managed to escape onto the ice and built a makeshift airstrip using only a few <b>spades,</b> ice <b>shovels</b> <b>and</b> two crowbars. They had to rebuild the airstrip thirteen times, until they were rescued in April of the same year and flown to the village of Vankarem on the coast of the sea. From there, some of the Chelyuskinites were flown further to the village of Uelen, while fifty-three men walked over 300 miles to get there.|$|R
60|$|The shower being now over, we {{went out}} upon the {{beautiful}} lawn before his house, where there were a good many trees of various kinds, {{many of which have}} been set out by persons of great or small distinction, and are labelled with their names. Thomas Moore's name was appended to one; Maria Edgeworth's to another; likewise Fredrika Bremer's, Jenny Lind's; also Grace Greenwood's, and I know not whose besides. This is really a pleasant method of enriching one's grounds with memorials of friends, nor is there any harm in making a shrubbery of celebrities. Three holes were already dug, and three new trees lay ready to be planted, and for me there was a sumach to plant,--a tree I never liked; but Mr. Hall said that they had tried to dig up a hawthorn, but found it clung too fast to the soil. So, since better might not be, and telling Mr. Hall that I supposed I should have a right to hang myself on this tree whenever I chose, I seized a <b>spade,</b> <b>and</b> speedily <b>shovelled</b> in a great deal of dirt; and there stands my sumach, an object of interest to posterity! Bennoch also and Dr. ------ set out their trees, and indeed, it was in some sense a joint affair, {{for the rest of the}} party held up each tree, while its godfather shovelled in the earth; but, after all, the gardener had more to do with it than we. After this important business was over, Mr. Hall led us about his rounds, which are very nicely planned and ordered; and all this he has bought, and built, and laid out, from the profits of his own and his wife's literary exertions.|$|R

5000|$|The 183 {{prisoners were}} taken by boat to the Great South Road, then marched to Auckland. They were {{initially}} held on the Marion, an old coal hulk in Waitemata Harbour before being moved to the disused copper mine smelter on Kawau Island, north of Auckland. The prisoners were allowed the use of fishing boats to supplement their diet. Premier Frederick Whitaker and Colonial Secretary William Fox, meanwhile, debated bringing charges of high treason against all or some of them but disagreed on whether they should be tried by the Supreme Court or by court martial under the Suppression of Rebellion Act, {{a piece of legislation}} passed in late 1863 that authorised the Governor to arrest and detain indefinitely anyone suspected of complicity in the [...] "rebellion". The Act provided for punishment by death, imprisonment or corporal punishment such as whipping. The prisoners were never charged nor tried by any tribunal. On the night of 11 September 1864 the 200 prisoners on Kawau seized all boats on the island and paddled to the mainland using <b>spades,</b> <b>shovels</b> <b>and</b> pieces of board they had fashioned into paddles. The group landed at Waikauri Bay and set up camp on a ridge overlooking Omaha and Matakana. They refused pleas by the prison keeper to return to Kawau and were eventually permitted by the government to make their way back to the Waikato. Auckland newspapers at the time reported that it had cost the vast sum of ₤9000 to look after the escapees and therefore no effort should be made to bring them back.|$|R
