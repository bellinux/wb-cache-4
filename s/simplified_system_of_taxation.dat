In this regard, the urgent task consists in the formation of accounting and information database for analyzing and evaluating tax revenues from small and medium enterprises in the Russian regions. The article examines the contribution of certain types of special tax regimes in the formation of tax revenues by the total revenue in the regional budgets.

It was found that the simplified taxation system is the most attractive one among all special regimes, while the unified agricultural tax remains less promising from the fiscal point of view in a number of regions.
