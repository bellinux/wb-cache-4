25|$|The {{graduate}} study {{is focused on}} <b>systems</b> <b>neuroscience,</b> cognitive neuroscience, perception and cognition, personality and social psychology, and physiological psychology. It is a preparatory program for a Ph.D., which takes approximately five years to complete, and a career of scholarship in psychology. Every year, six doctoral degrees and eight master's degrees are awarded on average. Students in the university's M.D./Ph.D. program, run jointly with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, are also able to pursue their doctoral degree in the department.|$|E
25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in <b>systems</b> <b>neuroscience</b> include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? How does the somatosensory system process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology {{address the question of}} how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E

30|$|Plexon is a {{commercial}} tool for <b>system</b> <b>neuroscience</b> research. It collects signals from microelectrodes {{implanted in the}} brain of a live subject and provides MATLAB APIs for user software {{to connect with the}} Plexon system and to retrieve signals from it. The signals consist of channel number, unit number, signal type (e.g., event or spike), timestamp, and waveforms. The Plexon MAP server pulls signals from a data acquisition device and makes the signals available periodically (e.g., 10 ms). A user software can get the signals synchronously or asynchronously depending on APIs used (available at www.plexon.com). In the prototype implementation, DIM retrieves spikes from the Plexon MAP server by means of the synchronous API such that the Plexon MAP server notifies the DIM that spikes are available. The DIM then retrieves spikes as a chunk.|$|R

50|$|<b>Systems</b> <b>{{neuroscience}}</b> is a subdiscipline of neuroscience {{and systems}} biology that studies {{the function of}} neural circuits and systems. It is an umbrella term, encompassing {{a number of areas}} of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural networks. At this level of analysis, neuroscientists study how different neural circuits analyze sensory information, form perceptions of the external world, make decisions, and execute movements. Researchers in <b>systems</b> <b>neuroscience</b> are concerned with the relation between molecular and cellular approaches to understanding brain structure and function, {{as well as with the}} study of high-level mental functions such as language, memory, and self-awareness (which are the purview of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience). Systems neuroscientists typically employ techniques for understanding networksof neurons while they function in vivo (e.g. electrophysiology (single or multi-electrode recording), in vivo imaging, fMRI, PET). The term is commonly used in an educational framework: a common sequence of graduate school neuroscience courses consists of cellular/molecular neuroscience for the first semester, then <b>systems</b> <b>neuroscience</b> for the second semester. It is also sometimes used to distinguish a subdivision within a neuroscience department at an academic institution.|$|E

50|$|A {{key element}} to {{successfully}} understanding {{the nervous system}} is the integration of neuroscience with information sciences. The field that studies the nervous <b>system,</b> <b>neuroscience,</b> has responded to the fantastic challenge of understanding how our brain works {{with the use of}} the most sophisticated technologies, from studies on the genome to those on brain imaging of behaviour in humans and other species, under different functional states, and at all intervening analytical levels. This effort has resulted in large quantities of data, which are ever increasing at higher levels of complexity. The data produced are heterogeneous, coming from different levels of study and modalities of analysis. To rise to this challenge of integration, and to ensure efficient and maximum use of these data, it is now necessary to develop and create these shared resources: (i) neuroscience data and knowledge databases; (ii) analytical and modelling tools; and (iii) computational models. This challenge is being met through the merging of neurosciences with information science - the field of Neuroinformatics.|$|R
