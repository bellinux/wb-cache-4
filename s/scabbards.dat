25|$|Scabbard: The scabbard, {{also known}} as the sheath, is a {{protective}} cover often provided for the sword blade. Over the millennia, <b>scabbards</b> have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather <b>scabbards</b> is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which on both leather and metal <b>scabbards</b> is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.|$|E

25|$|The dress sword for Heavy Cavalry {{officers}} was a {{much smaller}} and lighter weapon, having a knucklebow, ovoid pommel and boat-shell guard in gilt brass or gunmetal. The blade was much shorter and narrower than the service sword's, and usually double edged with a short narrow central fuller each side. The dress sword usually had a leather scabbard with gilt brass mounts, however, a number of examples exist of swords with iron service <b>scabbards,</b> suggesting that some officers may have employed the dress sword in the field.|$|E

In 1777, a factory manufacturing paper cartridges for muskets was relocated to Allentown from nearby Bethlehem. That same year, a shop of sixteen armorers was established along the Little Lehigh Creek and was employed in the repair of weapons and the manufacture of saddles and <b>scabbards.</b>|$|E

The sword which belonged to the <b>scabbard</b> was found by the little boy sticking out of the ground in the garden, and every day he pulled it up to see if it would go into the <b>scabbard.</b> But though it was plainly becoming longer and longer, it was some time before the two would fit.|$|R

Sotheby's returned the objects; which included cutlery, coins, sword hilts and <b>scabbards,</b> a powder flask, and various ship fittings.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{attack on}} rank and {{hierarchy}} dominates the Rights of Men. She chastises Burke for his {{contempt for the}} people, whom he dismisses as the [...] "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably Marie Antoinette. In a famous passage, Burke had written: [...] "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their <b>scabbards</b> to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone." [...] Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the Rights of Men into larger social and political contexts.|$|E
500|$|The {{culture that}} built the brochs is unknown, {{but by the}} late Iron Age the Northern Isles were [...] part of the Pictish kingdom.

The St Ninian's Isle Treasure was discovered in 1958. The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approximately 800 AD. [...] O'Dell (1959) stated that [...] "the treasure is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period" [...] and that [...] "the brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal".|$|E

500|$|Frank McLaury {{was also}} {{armed with a}} Colt Frontier 1873 {{revolver}} which was recovered by laundryman Fallehy on the street about [...] feet from his body with two rounds remaining in it. Fallehy placed it next to Frank's body before he {{was moved to the}} Harwood house. Dr. Mathews laid Frank's revolver on the floor while he examined Billy and Tom. Cowboy witness Wes Fuller said he saw Frank {{in the middle of the}} street shooting a revolver and trying to remove a Winchester rifle from the scabbard on his horse. The two Model 1873 rifles were still in the <b>scabbards</b> on Frank and Tom McLaury's horses when they were found after the gunfight. If, as was customary, Frank carried only five rounds, then he had fired only three shots.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} monarchy and hereditary privilege {{but also the}} language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections, Burke had lamented: [...] "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their <b>scabbards</b> to avenge even a look that threatened her [...] with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone." [...] Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was {{at the expense of}} the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language. By redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burke's readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had {{observed}} German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just [...] across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, {{heard the sound of}} bayonet <b>scabbards</b> flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running {{along the top of the}} embankment, saw German troops of II/229 RIR advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the ungarrisoned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He hosed them down with the gun, then as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.|$|E
