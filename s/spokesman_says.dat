500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media. Philippe Dauman, the president and CEO of Viacom, contradicted the notion saying he did not think [...] "the limited amount of Nick library content on Netflix [...] has had a significant impact". [...] A Nickelodeon <b>spokesman</b> <b>says</b> SpongeBob is performing consistently well and remains as the number one rated animated series in all of children's television. He added [...] "there is nothing that we have seen that points to SpongeBob as a problem." [...] Dauman blamed the drop on [...] "some ratings systemic issues" [...] at Nielsen, citing extensive set-top-box data that [...] "does in no way reflect" [...] the Nielsen data.|$|E
