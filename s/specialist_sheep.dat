40|$|Sheep losses {{each year}} are high in all types of rearing systems {{throughout}} the United Kingdom. Losses could well be reduced by a closer relationship between the sheep owner and the veterinarian. A closer relationship should involve {{the development of a}} simple disease preventive programme requiring a number of regular farm visits each year. Any such programme could attempt to control disease mainly by preventive methods, establish a complete parasite control programme and incorporate a high degree of instruction. There is probably a need for many veterinarians to attend <b>specialist</b> <b>sheep</b> courses, and suggestions are offered whereby the situation could be improved...|$|E
40|$|Lameness is the {{greatest}} health and welfare concern in sheep flocks in the U. K. This thesis presents research on epidemiology of lameness in sheep Most previous studies quantifying lameness and its causes {{are based on the}} premise that farmers can identify the causes of lameness and recognise lame versus sound sheep. In 2005, a postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of English sheep farmers to investigate whether farmers could correctly name six common foot lesions in sheep (interdigital dermatitis (ID), footrot (FR), contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD), shelly hoof, foot abscess and toe granuloma) from a characteristic picture and a written description. The same questionnaire of six lesions was presented at a meeting of <b>specialist</b> <b>sheep</b> advisors, primarily veterinarians. Approximately 20...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the cost {{efficiency}} of Scottish farms is determined, variables that explain the relative cost efficiency by farm type are identified and implications discussed. A cost efficiency approach {{was selected as}} it can deal with farms producing multiple outputs (in contrast to production frontiers), and second because it can accommodate output constraints imposed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). To estimate the stochastic cost frontier, a generalised multi-product translog cost function was estimated for five farm types: dairy, cereals and general cropping, cattle and sheep, <b>specialist</b> <b>sheep</b> and mixed farms. Eight farm outputs and four inputs were considered. The data for the estimation were drawn from the Farm Accounts Scheme (FAS) survey for the period 1997 - 2004, which allowed {{the construction of an}} unbalanced panel dataset for 358 farms. Cost efficiency was measured as a fixed effect term and this was used to construct an indicator of relative cost efficiency by farm type. Further analysis, to explain the efficiency results, indicated the presence of important farm size and regional effects. However, other variables used in the analysis, whilst statistically significant, did not produce a consistent effect across the different farm types.

40|$|Background: Epidemiological {{studies have}} used farmer {{estimates}} of the prevalence of lameness in their flocks. This assumes that farmers can identify lame sheep. Eight movie clips of sheep with locomotion from sound to moderately lame were used to investigate the ability of farmers and <b>sheep</b> <b>specialists</b> to recognise lame sheep. Each participant was {{asked to complete a}} form and indicate, for each movie clip, whether they thought the sheep was lame and whether they would catch it if it was the only lame sheep or if 2 – 5, 6 – 10 or > 10 sheep were equally lame. The farmers' responses were compared with their estimates of flock lameness prevalence and the interval between observing a lame sheep and catching it. Results: 178 farmers and 54 <b>sheep</b> <b>specialists</b> participated. Participants could identify even mildly lame sheep but made a separate decision on whether to catch them. This decision was dependent on the severity of lameness and the number of sheep lame in a group.

50|$|In September 1877 Juho and Helena Vohlonen {{had a son}} in Vohloja ranch, Orimattila. Later {{they had}} four more children, sons Kelpo Hyvä (surveyor, wrestler) and Oiva Lahja (officer) and daughters Sievä Maria a.k.a. Maija (agronomist, <b>sheep</b> <b>specialist,</b> author) and Oma Eeva (agronomist), but this son was {{nominated}} Tuomas, with only one first name. Parents called him Tommo, and that nomination was used through his life. Only {{a few years before}} his death Tuomas could be seen in official patent papers. During the siblings’ childhood the family moved to Lappeenranta for a short while, then to Kekäleenmäki, Ruokolahti. There Juho Vohlonen worked as smith and also did some farming. Helena and Juho Vohlonen weren’t highly educated, but they had decided their children will get the highest education possible. Including daughters, which wasn’t very typical of that time. Earlier stages of school were done in Ruokolahti, later stages in Lappeenranta. Tuomas went to college in Vyborg. After that Tuomas studied in Finnish polytechnic to become a surveyor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} used farmer {{estimates}} of the prevalence of lameness in their flocks. This assumes that farmers can identify lame sheep. Eight movie clips of sheep with locomotion from sound to moderately lame were used to investigate the ability of farmers and <b>sheep</b> <b>specialists</b> to recognise lame sheep. Each participant was {{asked to complete a}} form and indicate, for each movie clip, whether they thought the sheep was lame and whether they would catch it if it was the only lame sheep or if 2 – 5, 6 – 10 or > 10 sheep were equally lame. The farmers' responses were compared with their estimates of flock lameness prevalence and the interval between observing a lame sheep and catching it. Results 178 farmers and 54 <b>sheep</b> <b>specialists</b> participated. Participants could identify even mildly lame sheep but made a separate decision on whether to catch them. This decision was dependent on the severity of lameness and the number of sheep lame in a group. Those who said they would catch the first lame sheep in a group {{were significantly more likely to}} catch mildly lame sheep (farmer-reported median prevalence of lameness 5 % (IQR: 2 %– 6 %)). In contrast, farmers who waited for several sheep to be lame indicated that they would only catch more severely lame sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 11 % (IQR: 9 %– 15 %)). Approximately 15 % of farmers did not catch individual lame sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 15 % (IQR: 10 %– 15 %)). The flock prevalence of lameness increased as time to treatment increased and time to treatment was positively correlated with only catching more severely lame sheep. Conclusion If movie-clips are similar to the flock situation, farmers and specialists can recognise even mildly lame sheep but vary in their management from prompt treatment of the first lame sheep in a group to no individual sheep treatments. The former practices would be appropriate to minimise transmission of footrot, a common, infectious cause of lameness and so reduce its incidence. The analysis also suggests that farmers estimate lameness prevalence relatively accurately because farmers who treated the first mildly lame sheep in a group also reported the lowest prevalence of lameness in their flock. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Australian wool {{industry}} has endured {{several years of}} low profitability and, despite the short-term recovery in prices in 1997, the longer-term prospects are presently not encouraging. There are two primary sources for the problem; one has been the low rate of on-farm productivity growth over several decades and the second has been the comparatively low prices paid for wool by the global textile industry. On farm productivity For {{the purpose of this}} contract, productivity is defined in terms of the total output relative to all inputs employed in its production. Since 1977 / 78, annual productivity growth on <b>specialist</b> <b>sheep</b> farms has been estimated at 1 % per annum, compared to corresponding estimates of 4. 6 % for cropping farms and 3. 2 % for mixed crop/livestock farms (Knopke et al. 1995). Of even more importance, wools productivity gains have been outstripped by technological improvements in cotton and man-made fibres contributing to an erosion of the terms of trade of wool producers. As one analyist put it without a significant improvement in the terms of trade, a significant exodus of growers from the industry can be expected (Swan Consultants, 1995 p. vii). Textile demand Spinners demand for textile fibres generally has been significantly eroded during the 1990 s by three important factors...|$|E
40|$|Organic systems seek {{to reduce}} {{reliance}} on external inputs, and develop sustainable methods of production which balance output with {{high standards of}} animal welfare. The standards for organic production emphasise preventive control strategies based on grazing management, appropriate breeding and good nutrition. The {{ultimate goal is to}} eliminate dependence on anti-parasitic drugs, however this is rarely achieved in practice. The overall objective of this research was to develop organic farming systems, which do not rely on pharmaceutical control of roundworm parasites. Focussing on management and nutrition, the approach was to combine on-farm epidemiological studies, with replicated experiments, in order to develop and demonstrate better systems of control applicable to UK organic farms. The project was a collaborative study involving ADAS, Institute of Rural Science (IRS), Moredun Research Institute (MRI) and Scottish Agriculture Colleges (SAC). Specific objectives: 1. To study the epidemiology of parasitic gastro-enteritis (PGE) on selected 'focus' farms, representing a range of organic systems 2. To quantify the effect of dietary manipulation, novel crops, and drenching with tannins, on the development of PGE in organic sheep and cattle systems 3. To evaluate the role of crop type and pasture larval ecology on the development of PGE 4. To develop the application of alternative approaches on 'focus' farms, under best management practice 5. To ensure effective technology transfer Five commercial organic farms, reflecting a range of production systems (specialist hill sheep, upland beef and sheep, lowland <b>specialist</b> <b>sheep,</b> specialist dairying, and lowland mixed arable / livestock) were selected for detailed epidemiological study. The aim was to assess the level and pattern of parasite challenge, critical points for disease control, and the degree of success achieved with current management practices. The study combined the use of standard epidemiological techniques, with close collaboration of the researchers, participating farmers and their veterinary advisers. Comprehensive epidemiological data were collected over two contrasting seasons (2002 and 2003). Without recourse to routine anthelmintic, control was generally underpinned by grazing management, within the constraints of land/crop resources and diversity of enterprises available for each farm. Role of nutrition: Previous studies, using tightly controlled nutritional protocols and a known parasite challenge, developed a nutritional hypothesis for understanding nutritional influences on the host response to parasites. A replicated experiment was set up to test whether this framework could be extended to organically managed ewes carrying a mixed naturally-acquired infection. Novel crops: A series of experiments were undertaken to determine the potential of several novel crops for parasite control. Parasite pasture ecology: Nematode larvae populations have also been shown to differ between herbage species, potentially due to differences in crop morphology or microclimate beneath the sward (which may affect larval development and survival, or the number of coprophagous or nematophagous organisms at soil level). Several small plot and pot experiments were undertaken to assess the effect of crop type on larval survival, rates of faecal degradation, and soil dwelling invertebrates. Overall, the results from this study indicate that with sufficient diversity of cropping and stocking, it is possible to virtually eliminate anthelmintic usage. However, many farms still face significant difficulties, particularly those systems dominated by sheep. The extent to which control can be achieved by management alone, depends on the farming system, with the greatest opportunity for control in the more mixed, or very extensive production systems. Many of the issues faced by the organic sector are increasingly relevant to conventional farmers where anthelmintic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent. More integrated strategies are required, not only for organic producers, but also to prolong the life of drenches currently used in conventional farming. Practical recommendations have been derived from this research, and promoted to organic and conventional farmers, based around key messages of system planning, parasite monitoring and maintaining biosecurity...|$|E
40|$|A {{postal survey}} was {{conducted}} of 80 sheep farmers in the Kojonup and Esperance districts of Western Australia to establish what they wanted from a veterinary service. Twenty five of the farmers surveyed used a sheep consultant, 25 did not, and 30 were interested in employing one. Farmers were asked questions about themselves and their attitudes to private veterinarians who provide <b>specialist</b> services to <b>sheep</b> farmers. Data reported here showed that farmers wanted a veterinarian {{who lived in the}} district, was well trained in sheep management and production, was enthusiastic and had good communication skills. The service provided should be whole-farm and available to members of the consultant's group only. Regular newsletters and field days were necessary, but the provision of contract services, such as mulesing, lamb-marking, drenching, pregnancy testing and sheep classing, and 'fire-brigade' services for sick animals, were not rated as important. Most farmers were unwilling or unable to give a dollar value for the likely benefits of a consultancy service. Non-financial benefits included keeping farmers up to date with new technical developments and information. The survey also showed that a veterinarian specialising in services to sheep farmers could be confident of employment...|$|R

Researches were carried out in a commercial farm from Timis county, on a number of 48 crossbreed F 1 German Blackheaded Mutton x Turcana (GBMT) lambs, the control group was represented by purebreed Turcana (TU) lambs, both males and females (33 heads). The lambs were weighed at birth, at 28 days and at 8 months of age. During first 28 days, F 1 GMBT registered an average daily gain of 229. 46 g, compared to Turcana lambs witch registered an average of 194. 12 g, differences being very significant statistically (p< 0. 001). Total growth gain at the age of 240 days was registered 40. 51 kg in crossbreed lambs, and of 33. 35 kg in purebreed Turcana lambs, differences were very significant statistically between the two groups (p< 0. 001). German Blackheaded Mutton rams could be used as crossing sires for indigenous Turcana breed in order to substantially improve growth rates in F 1 lambs...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, historians and archaeologists have become {{increasingly}} aware that the Mid Saxon period in England (7 th- 9 th centuries AD) witnessed a transformation in agricultural practices. According to the emergent consensus, {{in contrast to the}} heavily pastoral, broadly subsistence-based mode of agriculture characteristic of the Early Saxon period (5 th- 7 th centuries), Mid Saxon agriculture was geared towards higher levels of surplus production and placed a greater emphasis upon arable farming. The increased cultivation of bread wheat and the <b>specialist</b> production of <b>sheep’s</b> wool have been identified as particularly important innovations of this period. This thesis represents the first attempt to explore agricultural development in Mid Saxon England on a systematic archaeological basis. It considers settlement, zooarchaeological, and archaeobotanical evidence in detail, with a special emphasis on charred plant remains. The analyses utilize data gathered from excavation reports, published and unpublished, covering two case study regions: (i) the Upper/Middle Thames valley and environs, and (ii) East Anglia and Essex. In addition, a sub-assemblage of charred plant remains from a Mid Saxon monastic site at Lyminge (Kent) is studied at first hand. In this way, a series of agricultural innovations is identified in the archaeological record, including in particular: specialized pastoralism, an increased emphasis on sheep in some regions, an expansion of arable production, growth in fibre production, growth in cereal surpluses, a consequent investment in specialist storage and processing facilities, and a general diversification of crop spectra. These innovations were contingent upon, and adapted to, local environmental factors. The process of agricultural development is thought to have begun in the 7 th century and continued through the 8 th and 9 th centuries, facilitated and stimulated by newly consolidated élite landholdings and, probably, a growing population. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Professor. E. K. Faulkner, Extension <b>Sheep</b> <b>Specialist</b> {{from the}} University of Wyoming, stated that fencing the range was too {{expensive}} to be practical. He indicated that flares, pop-guns, color painting on sheep, and dogs {{have been used to}} cut down losses to coyotes but these methods have not been nearly so effective as the use of cyanide guns and 1080. He also indicated that losses to coyotes along with labor problems are the number 1 and 2 reasons for 200 sheepmen going out of the business the past 5 years in the range country. He said that shed lambing or lambing in confinement would cut losses to predators but this involved a large investment in buildings which would be questionable from the standpoint of economics handling large bands of ewes from 3, 000 to 5, 000 head. Professor Faulkner indicated that when the food supply for coyotes becomes short and they get hungry, they will kill and eat. Dr. Robert Hyde, Extension Specialist in Range Management at Colorado State University indicated that fencing was effective in cutting coyote damage to flocks but it was expensive. He indicated that the coyote population has been increasing at a rapid rate in Colorado and with the decrease in sheep numbers, the coyotes have turned to cattle. The main losses in cattle were in the calving season when the cow {{was in the process of}} calving or the calf was extremely young and was not able to protect itself at that age. He also indicated that losses to coyotes were higher from first-calf heifers which were not as protective of their offspring as older cows. He indicated that trappers were a help in reducing coyote population and, also, certain areas have given some sheep producers relief but the cost of trappers and the availability of experienced trappers was a problem. He also indicated that when the reduced natural food supply for coyotes occurred, they had turned to cattle in the State of Colorado. He pointed out that coyotes travel great distances in search of food and that the rotation of pastures or areas was not practical from the standpoint of the rancher indicating that the cost involved in transporting livestock to another range, even though it would be effective in helping to control predator losses, is not economically feasible...|$|R
