40|$|When private {{goods are}} {{publicly}} provided at subsidized prices, government authorities {{have to determine}} the distribution of services on recipients. Such distributions are commonly based on legal regulations and professional guidelines. Thus governments are assumed to develop <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> that are incorporated in the preferences for allocation of services. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the behavior of local governments when they are allocating home-care services on elderly and disabled clients. Based on Norwegian data it is demonstrated that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> as well as economic constraints have an impact on the supply of home-care. As expected the supply to individual clients increases with the degree of disablement. The model estimates also show that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> vary substantially between different client groups. For instance, service levels for mentally retarded are rather high compared to elderly clients in non-single households. Individual <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> are derived from observed behavior by means of model simulation, where the standards are defined for an average level of municipal incomes and prices. The results are used to evaluate the degree of mismatch between service supply and common <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> in different local communities.
