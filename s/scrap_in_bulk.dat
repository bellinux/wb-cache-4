50|$|Most {{artisans}} {{are trained}} by their elders with no formal training or formal degrees in chemistry or engineering, although some have abroad for training {{as well to}} promote products. Artisans buy ingredients in local chemical supply shops and local markets, which are then mixed by hand in family owned workshops and small factories. Everything is made from scratch, with cartridges made of packing tape and <b>scrap</b> paper purchased <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Often, the fireworks are packaged in nothing but old cornmeal and dog food bags. Most artisans are not formal employees, but rather work in the family business. The formulas used by each workshop are individual and guarded by the families that own them. Workshops are ranked with the best artisans receiving the “maestro” (master) title, able to produce elaborate products such as castillos, bombas, toritos and synchronized fireworks/light/music shows.|$|R
