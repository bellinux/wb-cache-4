Although that <b>Sender</b> <b>type</b> mostly lies in the experiments, the Receiver tends to believe the Sender's messages. This confirms "truth bias" reported in communication theory in a oneshot, anonymous environment without nonverbal cues. These results cannot be explained by existing refinement theories, while a bounded rationality model explains them under certain conditions. We claim that the theory {{for the evolution of}} language should address why truthful communication survives in the environment in which lying succeeds. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} private sender {{information into}} a sender-receiver game of Bayesian persuasion with monotonic sender preferences. I derive properties of increasing differences {{related to the}} precision of signals and use these to fully characterize the set of equilibria robust to the intuitive criterion. In particular, all such equilibria are either separating, i. e., the sender's choice of signal reveals his private information to the receiver, or fully disclosing, i. e., {{the outcome of the}} sender's chosen signal fully reveals the payoff-relevant state to the receiver. Incentive compatibility requires the high <b>sender</b> <b>type</b> to use sub-optimal signals and therefore generates a cost for the high <b>sender</b> <b>type</b> in comparison to a full information benchmark in which the receiver knows the sender's type. The receiver prefers the equilibrium outcome over this benchmark for large classes of monotonic sender preferences...|$|E
40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to boast about good news? When {{messages}} are verifiable, the standard result from disclosure games {{is that good}} news should be disclosed or the receiver will infer that the sender has nothing favorable to report. We reconsider this conclusion when the receiver has private information about <b>sender</b> <b>type.</b> Because better senders expect the receiver to have more favorable private information about them, {{we find that the}} worst <b>sender</b> <b>type</b> with good news has the most incentive to disclose it. Therefore reporting good news can paradoxically make an unfavorable impression. If the good news is sufficiently rare a unique disclosure equilibrium exists in which good news is disclosed. But if the good news is attainable even by mediocre types then two understatement equilibria always exist: a nondisclosure equilibrium in which all types withhold good news and a countersignaling equilibrium in which mediocre types report good news but the best types withhold it. When such equilibria exist, the sender has a legitimate fear of looking overly eager to reveal good news. Having a third party disclose the news, or mandating that the sender disclose the news, eliminates this problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Modern SMTP servers apply {{a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} to stem the volume of spam delivered to users. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: preacceptance approaches, which apply prior to a message being accepted (e. g. IP reputation), and post-acceptance techniques which apply after a message has been accepted (e. g. content based signatures). We argue that {{the effectiveness of these}} measures varies based on the SMTP <b>sender</b> <b>type.</b> This paper focuses on the most light-weight pre-acceptance filtering mechanism – IP reputation. We first classify SMTP senders into three main categories: legitimate servers, end-hosts, andspam gangs, andempirically study the limits of effectiveness regarding IP reputatio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of bounded memory in a strate-gic context. In particular, we look at a model with a bounded memory receiver in a repeated cheap talk game with incomplete information on the <b>sender’s</b> <b>type.</b> We find that there are multiple equilibria in this game, including many equilibria in which the receiver “wastes” memory sets. We describe necessary conditions for equilibrium and find that the receiver’s memory will have some intuitive properties. Namely that the receiver never updates to a lower belief after a true signal, he stops updating after he is sufficiently convinced about the <b>sender’s</b> <b>type</b> and he will never ignore lies, unless he is sure about the <b>sender’s</b> <b>type.</b> There are, however, some important differences in this reputation game with a bounded memory receiver from the standard version with a Bayesian receiver. In particular, {{we find that the}} bounded memory receiver might test the sender before updating, in contrast to a Bayesian receiver that will always update as long as he is not certain of the <b>sender’s</b> <b>type.</b> Finally, the bounded memory receiver might choose (given his memory constraint) to stop updating at a point where he is still not sure about the <b>sender’s</b> <b>type.</b> In this case, he will never entirely believe the sender, even after an arbitrarily long sequence of good signals. ∗I am very grateful to Ben Polak and Stephen Morris for their guidance and advices.

40|$|In {{the classic}} Crawford-Sobel (CS) model of {{strategic}} communication between an informed Sender and uninformed Receiver, perfect information transmission is never achieved as an equilibrium outcome. I present {{a modified version}} of the CS cheap talk game with the following two innovations: (i) both players take actions, and (ii) actions are strategic substitutes. In contrast to the CS setup, the modified game can facilitate perfect information revelation. I characterize the conditions under which a full information revelation equilibrium exists. When these conditions are violated, only partial revelation equilibria exist. Under partial revelation, the Sender reveals information up to a threshold state and pools beyond this threshold, resulting in some loss of information. Welfare analysis suggests that partial revelation equilibria with a higher threshold pareto dominate those with lower thresholds. Crucially, a higher threshold equilibrium is also interim efficient – every <b>Sender</b> <b>type</b> at least weakly prefers this over a lower threshold equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|In {{signaling}} environments {{ranging from}} consumption to education, high quality senders often shun the standard signals that should separate themselves from lower quality senders. We find that allowing for additional, noisy information on <b>sender</b> <b>type</b> can radically alter {{the predictions of}} signaling models, potentially explaining why those with the greatest ability to signal might choose not to. We examine equilibria where medium types separate themselves from low types by signaling, but high types then differentiate themselves from medium types by not signaling, or countersignaling. High types not only save the cost of signaling by relying on the additional information to stochastically separate them from low types, but in doing so they separate themselves from the signaling medium types. Hence they may countersignal even when signaling is a productive activity.

40|$|Using {{a network}} {{approach}} we provide a characterization of a separating equilibrium for standard signaling games where the sender's payoff function is quasi-linear. Given {{a strategy of}} the sender, we construct a network where the node set and the length between two nodes are {{the set of the}} <b>sender's</b> <b>type</b> and the difference of signaling costs, respectively. Construction of a separating equilibrium is then equivalent to constructing the length between two nodes in the network under the condition that the response of the receiver is a node potential. We show that, when the set of the <b>sender's</b> <b>type</b> is finite, the collection of separating signaling functions forms a lower bounded lattice. We describe an algorithm to compute separating equilibrium strategies. When the set of the <b>sender's</b> <b>type</b> is a real interval, shortest path lengths are antisymmetric and a node potential is unique up to a constant. A strategy of the sender in a separating equilibrium is characterized by some differential equation with a unique solution.

40|$|Equilibrium {{outcomes}} in signalling games {{can be very}} sensitive to the specification of how receivers interpret and thus respond to deviations from the path of play. We develop a micro-foundation for these off-path beliefs, and an associated equilibrium refinement, in a model where equilibrium arises through non-equilibrium learning by populations of patient and long-lived senders and receivers. In our model, young senders are uncertain about the prevailing distribution of play, so they rationally send out-of-equilibrium signals as experiments to learn about receivers' behavior. Differences in the payoff functions of the <b>types</b> of <b>senders</b> generate different incentives for these experiments. Using the Gittins index (Gittins, 1979), we characterize which <b>sender</b> <b>types</b> use each signal more often, leading to a constraint on the receiver's off-path beliefs based on "type-compatibility" and hence a learning-based equilibrium selection...|$|R

The epistemic requirement that information be transmitted through the literal meaning of the message uttered leads to an equilibrium concept distinct from a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, ruling out informative equilibria where language is not used in its ordinary sense.

The key intuition is that in a two-player game with incomplete information randomization is used as a memory saving device and also as a strategic element: to test the opponent and give incentives for types to be revealed early in the game.

Equilibrium can involve full or partial pooling when grades are informative and converges to the least cost separating outcome as grades decrease in informativeness. The equilibrium precisely characterizes the tradeoff the high type faces when deciding how much {{to rely on the}} costly signal and how much to rely on the grade. The presence of informative grades yields a Pareto improvement. The high type’s welfare increases and his costly (but unproductive) signaling decreases. Grades never hurt the low type’s welfare, and actually increase it when the prior puts sufficient weight on the high type. We derive conditions under which equilibria converge to full pooling at the lowest signal as the prior’s weight on the high type tends to one—offering a resolution to a long-standing paradox in the signaling literature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a simple and}} basic {{signaling}} game is studied in an experimental environment. First, we check whether we can replicate some of the findings in the literature concerning equilibrium selection and the use and impact of costly signals. Second, and foremost, the comparative statics implications of the game are studied. The experimental results {{are related to the}} predictions of two competing behavioral models: a game model, in which subjects are assumed to behave in line with (refined) sequential equilibrium theory, and a decision model, in which subjects are assumed to behave as non-strategic decision makers. The experimental outcomes replicate the finding in the literature that costly messages are sent more frequently by 'higher' <b>sender</b> <b>types</b> (whose information is such that persuasion is also profitable to the responder), and that such messages {{have an impact on the}} behavior of the responder. These results are consistent with (versions of) both the game model and the decision model. The comparative statics results, however, clearly point in the direction of the decision model. Play is most strongly affected by 'own' payoff parameters, as predicted by the decision model, and less so by opponent's payoff parameters, as predicted by the mixed strategies of the refined sequential equilibrium. Particularly, a decision model in which players are assumed to adapt beliefs about opponents' choice probabilities in response to experience in previous play, appears to succeed best in organizing the data. ...|$|R
