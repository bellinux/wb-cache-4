Even under the hot conditions of the Kalahari Desert, many different species survive; in fact the country has more than 2500 species of plants and 650 species of trees.

50|$|With {{the above}} topographic, climatic and soil settings, the {{vegetation}} types which cover the park are categorized under five broad types of open combretaceous <b>shrub</b> <b>savanna,</b> anogeissus leiocarpus woodland, lannea humilis open grass savanna, acacia seyal tree savanna and Yaéré floodplains with perennial grasses. In the desert conditions, with no perennial streams {{flowing through the}} park area, there are no perennial grasses in the park. The water holes are created for animals. The combretaceous <b>shrub</b> <b>savanna</b> consist of Sclerocarya birrea tree savanna, Combretum and Terminalia shrubs and the doum palm Hyphaene thebaica. The Anogeissus leiocarpus woodland is in sandy soils with Mitragyna inermis in pockets near temporary water bodies. Lannea humilis are open grass savanna combined with short annual grasses. Patches of trees and stands of Mitragyna inermis are also reported from small islands near temporary water bodies. In this condition, vegetation reported are in the formations of compact clay. However, the area is very saline due to high evaporation. The fourth category of vegetation comprises Acacia seyal tree savanna growing in black clay soils which gets highly saturated during the rainy months; grasses in these conditions spread very slowly or may even dry up. The last type of vegetation is reported in the Yaéré flood plains, an important area to maintain perennial grasses in the park. The grasses reported are: Vetiveria nigritana, Oryza barthii, Echinochloa pyramidalis and Echinochloa stagnina and a few herbaceous legumes with Sesbania pachycarpa. However, in these conditions, {{where there are no}} trees, forest fires are common. A particular feature in the central and western parts of the park was that substantial areas were of annual grasses and herbs, interspersed by Acacia seyal shrublands. They were subject to seasonal flooding before the construction of the Maga dam.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Africa, {{protected}} areas {{can play an}} important role in mitigating the effects of climate change through carbon sequestration but they are threatened due to increasing land degradation and deforestation (LDD). The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country’s refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p < 0. 05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17. 55 %, 18. 79 % and 21778. 79 %, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, <b>shrub</b> <b>savannas</b> and water bodies decreased by 22. 02 %, 5. 03 %, 40. 08 % and 31. 2 %, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14. 33 %, tree savannas by 22. 30 % and <b>shrub</b> <b>savannas</b> by 5. 14 %, while agricultural lands increased by 167. 87 % and woodlands by 3. 21 %. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area...|$|R

The main mountains are the Wassarai, Yahore, Komoa and Kaiawakua, with elevations up to about 1200 metres above sea level. Except for its flora, the biology of the Kanashen district is relatively unstudied. Botanically, the area has many species found only in the area and is covered by four general vegetation types, which have remained almost completely intact. The main vegetation types are tall evergreen highland forest and tall/medium evergreen lower montane forest. There are also small areas of tall evergreen flooded riparian forest and lowland <b>shrub</b> <b>savanna.</b> Species such as Manyokinaballi (Geissospermum spp.) and Kakaralli (Eschweilera) are the most common of the 192 species recorded. The area also contains important fauna such as giant river otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), the cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola), the giant harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and other animals that support the livelihood of the Wais-Wais. Three globally threatened species inhabit the COCA: the Giant Armadillo (Priodontes maximus), one of the Harlequin Toads (Atelopus spumarius) and the Brazilian Tapir (tapirus terrestris). The Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguars (Panthera onca), labba (Agouti paca), peccary (Tayassu spp.) and forest deer (Mazama spp.) are also known to occur in the area.

In this study, fire frequency and fire return intervals were modelled over a 12 -year time series (1997 – 2008) for the Jalapão State Park, a protected area in the north of the Cerrado, based on burned area maps derived from Landsat imagery. Burned areas were classified using object based image analysis. Fire data were modelled with the discrete lognormal model and the estimated parameters were used to calculate fire interval, fire survival and hazard of burning distributions, for seven major land cover types. Over the study period, an area equivalent to four times the size of Jalapão State Park burned and the mean annual area burned was 34 %. Median fire intervals were generally short, ranging from three to six years. <b>Shrub</b> <b>savannas</b> had the shortest fire intervals, and dense woodlands the longest.

A relationship between LAI and Crown Diameter was also investigated at these two sites. Digital hemispherical photography was used for the LAI estimation.

Overall results revealed that LAI ranged from 0 - 1. 33 and the CD was recorded in the range of 0. 46 - 11. 01 m. The gallery forests recorded the highest mean LAI 1. 33 ± 0. 32 as well as the highest mean CD 7. 69 ± 1. 90 m. The LAI for the vegetation types were at their lower ends as the study was conducted in summer season, higher values are therefore expected in the wet season, as a significant correlation between LAI and precipitation has been emphasized by various studies.
