40|$|Both {{climate change}} and water safety are {{textbook}} examples of wicked problems. Due to the ambiguous knowledge bases and contested values characterising these problems, frame differences among stakeholders and participants often result in severe political debate and not seldom evolve into controversies at and between different levels of governance, domains and scientific disciplines. An interesting exception {{appears to be the}} Dutch Second Delta Committee. In 2008 the committee presented twelve recommendations to the Dutch government on how to secure the Netherlands for severe flooding due to climate change. Despite the wicked nature of both {{climate change and}} water safety and the expensiveness of the recommended measures the committee succeeded surprisingly well in getting the new water management frame on the policy agenda without serious opposition or debate. In this paper we try to show how the dominant frame concerning water-safety issues in the Netherlands was influenced by the emerging climate change frame in the international media, policy and politics. By focussing on three different critical discourse moments we indicate how the existing Dutch water <b>safety</b> <b>frame</b> absorbed the climate change frame evolving into a new perspective on water safety which was successfully employed by the Second Delta Committee in tackling a classical wicked problem. Subsequently we show that with the recent fall of the climate change issue, this specific water <b>safety</b> <b>frame</b> evolved into a perspective disregarding climate change but remaining a wider timeframe indicating more political room to manoeuvre in times of budget cuts and increasing climate scepticism...|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is one potential {{arm of the}} much-heralded regenerative medicine. We use the concepts of technological zone, risk framing and regulatory jurisdiction to analyse what risks are formulated in the zone of tissue engineering and whether those risks are reflected in emerging regulatory policy in Europe. In the regulatory jurisdictions of the European Union, public health risks have become increasingly important. Tissue engineering challenges preexisting regulatory frameworks. Scientific–industrial actors formulate the risks of tissue engineering in three primary frames: technological safety risk; therapeutic efficacy risk; and economic risk. Study of the prevailing configuration of European Commission institutions and the EU process of regulatory regime-building for tissue engineering shows that risk frames are mobilized selectively. Whilst the technological <b>safety</b> <b>frame</b> and the economic frame are strongly mobilized, therapeutic efficacy—especially comparative efficacy—is not. Additionally the regime avoids any Europe-level position on the so-called ethics of sourcing and engineering tissues and cells. Efficacy and ethics are defined as the jurisdiction of national authorities, underpinned by the subsidiarity principle. Outcomes include the likely banning of certain therapeutic technologies by European countries that have objections to products deriving from controversial materials and processes, and the prevention of adoption of products due to efficacy concerns, so creating new imbalances in the European therapeutic marketplace. Consequently, the tissueengineered medical products that European societies consume, {{at least in the}} near term, will reflect the medically defined needs of the European population to a limited and patchy extent...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} rise in {{the prison}} population in the United States {{has resulted in a}} severe shock to the correctional system. Specifically, from 1980 to 2004, the population of offenders incarcerated in state and federal prisons has increased almost five-fold from 315, 974 to 1, 494, 216. As a result, 650, 000 prisoners are released back into society each year, placing additional stress on already distressed communities. The ability of released prisoners, or ex-offenders, to successfully reintegrate into society depends to a large degree on the programming made available to them prior to and after their release. However, the cadre of programming offered by prison systems is constrained by the frames that policymakers use to talk about the issue of prisoner reentry. Understanding the frames that people construct are the key to grasping the philosophical foundations underlying current legislation as well as to proffering new policy solutions that are relevant to all stakeholders. This thesis documents both the historical and current frames surrounding the issue of prisoner reentry in Illinois corrections policy, particularly {{as it relates to the}} city of Chicago, which takes in 20, 000 ex-offenders each year from the Illinois prison system. (cont.) The dominant policy discourse in Illinois is moving away from the crime control frame, which emphasizes punishment and incapacitation of offenders, to what I call the public <b>safety</b> <b>frame,</b> which paints rehabilitation as a mechanism for reducing crime. This re framing has allowed advocates of ex-offenders to gain support for reentry initiatives from Illinois legislators and criminal justice professionals. Yet, with the value of reentry initiatives being tied to crime reduction, advocates of rehabilitation will be under pressure to produce results in the performance-driven environment of the Illinois criminal justice system. The political tenability of rehabilitation as a policy response may very well depend on its ability to align with other frames present in the Illinois discourse. by Jonathan R. Harris. Thesis (M. C.

40|$|The Rollover {{of heavy}} {{vehicles}} {{operating in the}} construction, mining and agricultural sectors is a common occurrence that may result in death or severe injury for the vehicle occupants. Safety frames called ROPS (Rollover Protective Structures) that enclose the vehicle cabin, {{have been used by}} heavy vehicle manufacturers to provide protection to vehicle occupants during rollover accidents. The design of a ROPS requires that a dual criteria be fulfilled that ensures that the ROPS has sufficient stiffness to offer protection, whilst possessing an appropriate level of flexibility to absorb some or most of the impact energy during a roll. Over the last four decades significant research has been performed on these types of safety devices which has resulted in the generation of performance standards that may be used to assess the adequacy of a ROPS design for a particular vehicle type. At present these performance standards require that destructive full scale testing methods be used to assess the adequacy of a ROPS. This method of ROPS certification can be extremely expensive given the size and weight of many vehicles that operate in these sectors. The use of analytical methods to assess the performance of a ROPS is currently prohibited by these standards. Reasons for this are attributed to a lack of available fundamental research information on the nonlinear inelastic response of <b>safety</b> <b>frame</b> structures such as this. The main aim of this project was to therefore generate fundamental research information on the nonlinear response behaviour of ROPS subjected to both static and dynamic loading conditions {{that could be used to}} contribute towards the development of an efficient analytical design procedure that may lessen the need for destructive full scale testing. In addition to this, the project also aspired to develop methods for promoting increased levels of operator safety during vehicle rollover through enhancing the level of energy absorbed by the ROPS. The methods used to fulfil these aims involved the implementation of an extensive analytical modelling program using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in association with a detailed experimental testing program. From these studies comprehensive research information was developed on both the dynamic impact response and energy absorption capabilities of these types of structures. The established finite element models were then used to extend the investigation further and to carry out parametric studies. Important parameters such as ROPS post stiffness, rollslope inclination and impact duration were identified and their effects quantified. The final stage of the project examined the enhancement of the energy absorption capabilities of a ROPS through the incorporation of a supplementary energy absorbing device within the frame work of the ROPS. The device that was chosen for numerical evaluation was a thin walled tapered tube known as frusta that was designed to crush under a sidewards rollover and hence lessen the energy absorption demand placed upon the ROPS. The inclusion of this device was found to be beneficial in absorbing energy and enhancing the level of safety afforded to the vehicle occupants...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigated}} two {{explanations for}} the variability in levels of partner violence found by large community surveys. In Study 1, I examined the effect of how questions about partner violence are introduced (question framing: conflict, violence-in-relationships, or attacks) on reports of partner violence. Although {{there was not a}} reliable effect of question framing, the pattern of findings was consistent across 3 of 4 analyses. Counter to predictions, an attacks question framing yielded highest reported levels of violence and a conflict framing yielded lowest levels. In Study 2, I examined the effect of the overall nature of the survey (survey framing: family life and relationships, personal safety, or crime) on reports of partner violence. There was a significant effect of survey framing; however, the direction of effects was counter to predictions with reported levels highest using a personal <b>safety</b> survey <b>framing.</b> To clarify these findings, in Study 3, I investigated the effect of survey form on reports of partner violence, with survey and question framing paired as typically seen in community surveys (family life and relationships survey framing with conflict question <b>framing,</b> personal <b>safety</b> survey <b>framing</b> with violence question framing, crime survey framing with attacks question framing). Although there was not a reliable effect of survey form, the pattern of rates and means was consistent across analyses. Participants reported highest levels of violence with the personal safety-violence form and lowest levels with the family life-conflict form. Overall, the findings suggest that although the nature of the survey used appears to influence reports of partner violence, other contextual factors likely also play a role...|$|R
