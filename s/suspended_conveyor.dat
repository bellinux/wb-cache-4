500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also <b>suspended</b> <b>conveyor</b> baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor's {{thesis is}} to design a feeding belt {{conveyor}} {{which is part of}} the firewood processor. The thesis discusses: concepts of designed solutions, choice of conveyor's construction parts of the conveyor, calculations of its functioning, driver design, calculations of the firmness of the tensing device and the design of <b>suspending</b> the <b>conveyor</b> to a machinery...|$|R
40|$|This paper re-examines a part {{orienting}} {{technique that}} orients polygonal shaped parts {{with a series}} of fences <b>suspended</b> above a <b>conveyor</b> belt. We examine the effect of uncertainty in the coefficient of friction as well as the typical size of the final assembly. The search technique in the original work although resolution complete, was inefficient, so we offer a heuristic search method that offers good performance. Several fence sequences generated by our algorithm were tested on real polygonal objects...|$|R
50|$|Ionizing {{bars are}} most {{commonly}} <b>suspended</b> above a <b>conveyor</b> belt or other apparatus in a production line where the product can pass below it; the distance is usually calibrated {{for the specific}} application. The bar works by emitting an ionized corona onto the products below it. If then a product on the line has a positive or negative static charge, as it passes through the ionized aura created by the bar, it will attract the correspondingly charged positive or negative ions and become electrically neutral.|$|R
40|$|Issue: Ferrous metal {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste supplies. Ferrous metal are found in crates, pallets, and construction and demolition debris in the form of nails, screws, staples, or other hardware. These contaminants can create problems for the processor and end user alike. High value manufacturing feedstock specifications require that wood waste products be essentially free of ferrous metal contaminants. Removing ferrous metals from wood waste is critical to wood waste recovery. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using magnetic separators to remove ferrous metals from recovered wood waste. The following types of magnetic separation devices are described below: Stationary, Non Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: These are large permanent plate or electro-magnets designed to be <b>suspended</b> over a <b>conveyor</b> belt. These stationary, non self-cleaning magnets pull tramp metal out of wood waste as it passes underneath. To avoid excessive clean-up, the suspended magnets should be installed in areas where tramp metal volume is relatively small. So, they are generally inefficient for most applications at a wood waste processing facility. Since the overhead magnets work against gravity, they must be stronger than magnets underneath material flow. Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: A large permanent plate or electro-magnet. The self-cleaning varietie...|$|R
