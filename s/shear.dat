5|$|Wind <b>shear</b> affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind <b>shear</b> can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind <b>shear</b> may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind <b>shear,</b> for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|Wind <b>shear</b> {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind <b>shear</b> to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind <b>shear</b> for aircraft. Low level wind <b>shear</b> can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind <b>shear</b> (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind <b>shear</b> accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind <b>shear</b> is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind <b>shear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wind <b>shear,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind <b>shear</b> can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind <b>shear</b> seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical <b>shear</b> typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
50|$|A {{specialized}} type of hair-cutting <b>shears</b> {{known as}} texturizing <b>shears</b> {{are used to}} reduce hair thickness, to create special texturizing effects, or to blend layered hair. Texturizing <b>shears</b> have a pair of pivoted blades {{in the same way}} as normal <b>shears,</b> but one or both blades have teeth on the edge like a comb. Texturizing <b>shears</b> may also be called thinning <b>shears</b> or chunking <b>shears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blade <b>shears</b> {{are similar}} to scissors, {{although}} most have the hinge {{at the back of}} the <b>shears</b> rather than the center but some still have the hinge in the center e.g. Jakoti <b>shears.</b> Conventional blade <b>shears</b> can come with a single bow, double bows or inverse bows. Double bow <b>shears</b> are by far the most common as they are the most versatile. Single bow <b>shears</b> and inverse bowed <b>shears</b> offer more resistance and are mostly only used for tough <b>shearing</b> sheep. They come in varying lengths from about 10 cm(4inches) to 18.5 cm(7.25inches).|$|R
50|$|Snips and <b>shears</b> {{are used}} for cutting metal. Various types of snips and <b>shears</b> {{are used for}} {{different}} metals and thicknesses. Some <b>shears</b> allow longer or shorter cuts depending on the <b>shear's</b> style. Certain types of snips and <b>shears</b> are recommended for aviation metalworking.|$|R
5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the flow is that <b>shear</b> stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the <b>shear</b> stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind <b>shear</b> kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as <b>shear</b> levels varied. More than once, <b>shear</b> cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, <b>shear</b> lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto √Ångel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong <b>shear.</b> The wind <b>shear</b> disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the <b>shear,</b> the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind <b>shear</b> won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind <b>shear</b> detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind <b>shear</b> directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind <b>shear</b> has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind <b>shear</b> has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind <b>shear</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind <b>shear</b> than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a <b>shear</b> line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed <b>shear</b> can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind <b>shear</b> can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong southwesterly {{vertical}} <b>shear,</b> Henri continued intensifying while moving eastward, {{and reached}} a peak strength of 60mph (95km/h) later on September 5. Shortly thereafter, though, the <b>shear</b> greatly weakened the storm, {{and it was}} downgraded to a tropical depression. Henri {{was not able to}} recover its intensity, and made landfall near Clearwater, Florida on September 6 as a 35mph (55km/h) tropical depression, and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast. Despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower <b>shear,</b> Henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on September 8 off the coast of North Carolina.|$|E

40|$|The daily {{voluntary}} {{food consumption}} (VFC), water intake and urinary excretion of water, sodium and potassium of eight sheep were studied {{before and after}} <b>shearing.</b> The extracellular volume of each sheep was measured twice before and three times after <b>shearing.</b> VFC was significantly higher for the first 3 weeks after <b>shearing</b> than for the 3 weeks immediately before <b>shearing.</b> There was a decreased excretion of Na in the urine and a smaller Na/K ratio for the first 2 weeks after <b>shearing,</b> although the extracellular volume was not significantly increased until 4 weeks after <b>shearing.</b> Within, but not between, the 3 -week periods before and after <b>shearing,</b> there was a close linear relationship between VFC and water intake, the latter being significantly less for the same VFC after <b>shearing.</b> During weeks 4 and 5 after <b>shearing,</b> there was an increased loss of Na in the urine and a higher Na/K ratio, and the linear relationship between VFC and water intake was intermediate between that shown before and after <b>shearing.</b> The VFC of the sheep before <b>shearing</b> and in week 5 after <b>shearing</b> were similar...|$|R

5|$|Downbursts. When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to {{a shallow}} layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind <b>shear</b> can result {{at the leading edge}} of the three dimensional boundary.

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong wind <b>shear.</b> Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind <b>shear.</b> The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind <b>shear</b> to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind <b>shear</b> through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind <b>shear</b> weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone soon {{moved on}} a northwestward course and {{encountered}} wind <b>shear.</b> Bret weakened into a depression on August 23, {{due to the}} wind <b>shear</b> over the system.

50|$|Blade <b>shearing</b> as a {{sport has}} been through some ups and downs since the 1980s {{but in the last}} 2 or three years, it has {{increased}} in popularity. In the last 30 years many blade <b>shearing</b> competitions have been discontinued but now, with a resurgence of interest, the number of blade <b>shearing</b> competitions seems to be increasing. There were only 3 blade <b>shearing</b> competitions in Australia 25 years ago but that number has recently increased to at least 14 this year. In the UK this year a show was created specifically for blade <b>shearing</b> and to promote the blade <b>shearing</b> circuit in the UK. This month (October 2016) the Boort show held a blade <b>shearing</b> competition with $3000 for first place, the largest prize for a blade <b>shearing</b> event in the world.The next big blade <b>shearing</b> competition is the world <b>shearing</b> championships in New Zealand, February 2017. Blade shearers from at least 13 countries will be competing including Australia, South Africa, Japan, USA, France, Germany, Ireland, England and more. For the last 20 years, South Africa and Lesotho have dominated the world blade <b>shearing</b> championships.|$|R
5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind <b>shear</b> connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams.

5|$|Weather fronts. Significant <b>shear</b> is {{observed}} {{when the temperature}} difference across the front is 5¬∞C (9¬∞F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal <b>shear</b> can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind <b>shear</b> above warm fronts {{is more of an}} aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|E
5|$|When {{stationary}} fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind direction changes over a short distance, they become known as <b>shear</b> lines. If the <b>shear</b> line becomes active with thunderstorms, it may support formation of a tropical storm or a regeneration of the feature back into a stationary front.
