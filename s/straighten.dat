However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>straightening</b> of curved slab {{results in}} a greater <b>straightening</b> strain. During the process of {{multi-point}} <b>straightening,</b> the peak value of the <b>straightening</b> strain rate will appear at each <b>straightening</b> point. If the strain rate is too large, the <b>straightening</b> cracks will appear. Solidification and heat transfer of a slab is analyzed and the generation of the solidified shell and the three-dimension temperature field of the slab are calculated by using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). Based on the finite element analysis of five-point <b>straightening</b> of the curved slab, the strain and strain rate of each <b>straightening</b> point were obtained, which is a base of the analysis of <b>straightening</b> cracks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to determine <b>straightening</b> stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> machines. The existing calculation method of <b>straightening</b> stroke is based on <b>straightening</b> curvature equation. Because the initial curvature is obtained by curve fitting method, the method is inconvenient to use and its accuracy is not well. In this paper, a method to calculate <b>straightening</b> stroke based on <b>straightening</b> process model is put forward. So the mathematic load-deflection model of <b>straightening</b> process must be established at first. The <b>straightening</b> process model for shafts is developed according to the elastic-plastic mechanics theory. By using the model, the <b>straightening</b> stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. It is advantageous to use and to decrease errors. Comparing with FEM results and experimental results, the calculation results by the model are exact and the errors are small. So the validity and the accuracy of the method are verified.

By nightfall, the 49th Division had failed to reach the Rauray leaving the terrain dominating the right flank of VIII Corps in German hands. Martlet forced the I SS Panzer Corps to commit the remaining tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Division against the XXX Corps front, for a counter-attack the following day.

5|$|The {{entirety}} of NY448 was originally designated {{as part of}} NY117 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. In 193233, John D.

The state expressed similar sentiments in 1949, deeming the stretch unsafe for commercial traffic. By the 1960s, the annual average daily traffic count along NY117 had grown to 5,000 vehicles per day, {{far more than the}} 1,800 that the road had originally been built to serve. This led the New York State Legislature to approve plans for a new alignment for NY117 in 1965. The new road would be located north of the existing road, relieving traffic congestion on the Albany Post Road (US9) and NY117 and providing access to NY9A, US9, the Taconic State Parkway and the proposed Hudson River Expressway in the North Tarrytown area.|$|E

40|$|Impacts between over-height {{vehicles}} and steel bridges are common throughout North America {{and the resulting}} bridge damage is unpredictable and sudden. Heat <b>straightening</b> is an alternative to replacing steel members and mechanical <b>straightening</b> for repairs. In many cases, bridges remediated using heat <b>straightening</b> require fewer disruptions to traffic and lower repair costs compared to repairs replacing steel members. Heat <b>straightening</b> limitations and practices have been developed with American steel grades and climates in mind. Often heat <b>straightening</b> is described as an art {{as much as a}} science; this repair method has relied on experienced practitioners using heat <b>straightening</b> patterns designed to cause rotations or shortening in members. Heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges can be modelled with finite element analysis (FEA). Heat <b>straightening</b> is a thermo-mechanical process. Existing studies modelling heat <b>straightening</b> with FEA do not fully explain the modelling techniques and material parameters used. A workflow defining steps and material parameters can be used to facilitate modelling of impact and heat <b>straightening</b> on bridges. This study proposes a workflow using FEA to model the heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges. The proposed workflow will be used to study heat <b>straightening</b> of CSA 350 W steel – a commonly used Canadian steel grade. The workflow is developed by investigating modelling techniques for impact and heat <b>straightening</b> separately. The developed finite element models include material parameters accounting for work hardening, thermal effects and strain-rate sensitivity of steel. The presented research demonstrates that the proposed workflow is viable for modelling impact and heat <b>straightening</b> of steel bridges. Although this study involved the application of the developed modelling techniques for a hypothetical bridge, the exercise has provided valuable insight into methods of expediting heat <b>straightening</b> repair and the modelling process. For instance, it has provided insight into the following: the introduction of jacking forces without causing mechanical <b>straightening,</b> the removal of plastically deformed stiffeners to reduce deformations, and the treatment of residual stresses from heat <b>straightening...</b>|$|R

The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (<b>straighten),</b> nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm.

5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to <b>straighten</b> their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
