It exploits physical characteristics of the solar magnetic field to enable robust extraction from noisy images.

40|$|Current-sheet {{formation}} and magnetic reconnection {{are believed to}} be the basic physical processes responsible for much of the activity observed in astrophysical plasmas, such as the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> <b>corona.</b> We investigate these processes for a magnetic configuration consisting of a uniform background field and an embedded line dipole, a topology that is expected to be ubiquitous in the corona. This magnetic system is driven by a uniform horizontal flow applied at the line-tied photosphere. Although both the initial field and the driver are translationally symmetric, the resulting evolution is calculated using a fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3 D MHD) simulation with adaptive mesh refinement that resolves the current sheet and reconnection dynamics in detail. The advantage of our approach is that it allows us to apply directly the vast body of knowledge gained from the many studies of 2 D reconnection to the fully 3 D case. We find that a current sheet forms in close analogy to the classic Syrovatskii 2 D mechanism, but the resulting evolution is different than expected. The current sheet is globally stable, showing no evidence for a disruption or a secondary instability even for aspect ratios as high as 80 : 1. The global evolution generally follows the standard Sweet- Parker 2 D reconnection model except for an accelerated reconnection rate at a very thin current sheet, due to the tearing instability and the formation of magnetic islands. An interesting conclusion is that despite the formation of fully 3 D structures at small scales, the system remains close to 2 D at global scales. We discuss the implications of our results for observations of the solar corona. Subject Headings: Sun: corona Sun: magnetic fields Sun: reconnectio...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} two solar aspects related to flight dynamics. These are the solar dynamo and {{long-term}} solar activity predictions. The {{nature of the}} solar dynamo is central to solar activity predictions, and these predictions are important for orbital planning of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO). The {{reason is that the}} solar ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral irradiances inflate the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth, forming the thermosphere and exosphere through which these satellites orbit. Concerning the dynamo, we discuss some recent novel approaches towards its understanding. For solar predictions we concentrate on a solar precursor method, in which the Sun s polar field {{plays a major role in}} forecasting the next cycle s activity based upon the Babcock- Leighton dynamo. With a current low value for the Sun s polar field, this method predicts that solar cycle # 24 will be one of the lowest in recent times, with smoothed F 10. 7 radio flux values peaking near 130 + 30 (2 4, in the 2013 timeframe. One may have to consider solar activity as far back as the early 20 th century to find a cycle of comparable magnitude. Concomitant effects of low solar activity upon satellites in LEO will need to be considered, such as enhancements in orbital debris. Support for our prediction of a low solar cycle # 24 is borne out by the lack of new cycle sunspots at least through the first half of 2007. Usually at the present epoch in the solar cycle (- 7 + years after the last solar maximum), for a normal size following cycle, new cycle sunspots would be seen. The lack of their appearance at this time is only consistent with a low cycle # 24. Polar field observations of a weak magnitude are consistent with unusual structures seen in the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> <b>corona.</b> Polar coronal holes are the hallmarks of the Sun s open field structures. At present, it appears that the polar coronal holes are relatively weak, and there have been many equatorial coronal holes. This appears consistent with a weakening polar field, but coronal hole data must be scrutinized carefully as observing techniques have changed. We also discuss new solar dynamo ideas, and the SODA (Solar Dynamo Amplitude) index, which provides the user with the ability to track the Sun s hidden, dynamo magnetic fields throughout the various stages of the Sun s cycle. Our solar dynamo ideas are a modernization and rejuvenation of the Babcock-Leighton original idea of a shallow solar dynamo, using modem observations that appear to support their shallow dynamo viewpoint. We are in awe of being able to see an object the size of the Sun undergoing as dramatic a change as our model provides in a few short years. The Sun, however, has undergone changes as rapid as this before! The weather on the Sun is at least as fickle as the weather on the Earth...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that small impulsive energy bursts called nanoflares are responsible {{for at least some}} of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> hot <b>corona,</b> but whether they are the explanation for most of the multi-million degree plasma has been a matter of ongoing debate. We here present evidence that nanoflares are widespread in an active region observed by the X-Ray Telescope on-board the Hinode mission. The distributions of intensity fluctuations have small but important asymmetries, whether taken from individual pixels, multi-pixel subregions, or the entire active region. Negative fluctuations (corresponding to reduced intensity) are greater in number but weaker in amplitude, so that the median fluctuation is negative compared to a mean of zero. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that only part of this asymmetry can be explained by Poisson photon statistics. The remainder is explainable with a tendency for exponentially decreasing intensity, such as would be expected from a cooling plasma produced, e. g., from a nanoflare. We suggest that nanoflares are a universal heating process within active regions...|$|R

40|$|Large scale flows {{within the}} solar {{convection}} zone {{are the primary}} drivers of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> magnetic activity cycle. Differential rotation can amplify the magnetic field and convert poloidal fields into toroidal fields.

The effects of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> rotation on convection produce velocity correlations that can maintain the differential rotation and meridional circulation.
