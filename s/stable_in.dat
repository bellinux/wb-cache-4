5|$|ATP is <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> aqueous {{solutions}} between pH6.8 and 7.4, but it {{is rapidly}} hydrolysed at more extreme pH's. ATP hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate.

5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, mendelevium(I) was {{reported}} to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium(II). It was found to be <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium(I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent alkali metals. Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.|$|E
5|$|In {{reducing}} conditions, mendelevium(III) can {{be easily}} reduced to mendelevium(II), which is <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solution. The standard reduction potential of the E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential Studied with Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V. Mendelevium(II)'s elution behavior has been {{compared with that of}} strontium(II) and europium(II).|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> numbers. It is therefore classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under Fijian law.|$|E
5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> the absence of moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E

5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining <b>stable.</b> <b>In</b> the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels. Recovery varies regionally, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.|$|E
