6000|$|... "Thompsontown was a seaside resort, {{and rather}} a lively {{place in the}} season. There was a large hotel for summer {{visitors}} who could afford to pay good prices, and several smaller houses of entertainment, such as the <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>Boom,</b> where people of moderate means were made very comfortable.|$|E

It's easy so far, but in a minute the circus will begin. You want two pairs of hands to set a spinnaker in a breeze of wind." ...|$|E

"There {{was that}} {{matter of the}} deck-calking, the bronze rudder-irons, the {{overhauling}} of the engine, the new <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> the new davits, and the repairs to the whale-boat. You OKd the shipyard bill. It was four thousand one hundred and twenty-two francs. By the regular shipyard charges it ought {{not to have been}} a centime over twenty-five hundred francs-" ...|$|E
60|$|Ten {{years ago}} all the bawleys were clinker-built--that is, with the streaks {{overlapping}} each other, as in boats; {{but the new}} bawleys are now all carvel-built, the planks being placed edge to edge, so as to give a smooth surface, as in yachts and large vessels. They now {{for the most part}} carry <b>spinnakers,</b> <b>boomed</b> out when running before the wind, and balloon foresails, thereby greatly adding to their speed in light winds. One peculiarity of the bawleys is that, when at anchor, the mainsail, instead of being stowed with its spars parallel to the deck, is made up on its gaff, which is then hoisted with the throat seven or eight feet up the mast, while the peak rests on the stern.|$|R
5000|$|Ketch or Sloop rig with {{aluminum}} spars {{and stainless steel}} standing and running rigging. Main (24m) mast has double aluminum in line spreaders and mizzen mast is with single spreaders. Standing rig with stainless steel wire rope with Norseman swageless terminals and consists of headstay, main backstay, the mizzen forward support is done using intermediate shrouds or a triatic stay, mizzen backstay, single upper shrouds and double lowers on main, single uppers and lowers on mizzen. Main, mizzen and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>booms</b> are aluminum. The original winches were manufactured by Lewmar and Barlow. Swan 65 has two spinnaker poles because gybeing large spinnakers by dipping the pole is considered too dangerous. With only one spinnaker pole operational ADC Accutrac performed gybes by lowering the spinnaker, repacking it and hoisting it up again on the other side. (Clare Francis 1978) ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the term}} Bermuda sloop {{is applied to}} refer {{specifically}} {{to the type of}} small sailing ships discussed above, the term also was used to describe the small working boats used for moving freight about Bermuda's islands, for fishing, and other coastal activities, and is today widely used for all single-masted, Bermuda-rigged yachts. Motor vehicles were banned in Bermuda until after the Second World War, and the roads were few and poor until the requirements of that war advanced their development. Boats, as a consequence, remained the primary method of moving people and materials around Bermuda well into the 20th century. The Bermuda rig had begun its development in such small boats in the 17th century, before being adapted to ships, and by the 19th century the working boats of the island conformed to an almost pure design, with high, raked masts, long bowsprits, and vast areas of sail. They were, in appearance, scale models of the seagoing sloops. Although such small sloops are rare today (the one pictured at right is a 19th-century survivor), the design was further scaled down to produce the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, a class of racing vessel used in traditional competition between Bermudian yacht clubs. The term Bermuda sloop has come to be used outside Bermuda, today, to describe any single masted, Bermuda rigged boat, also known as Marconi sloops, although most are far less extreme in their design than was once the norm in Bermuda, with bowsprits omitted, masts vertical and shortened, and <b>booms</b> similarly shortened. <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>booms</b> and multiple jibs are rarely seen. The reduced sail area makes modern boats much more manageable, especially for small or inexperienced crews.|$|R
6000|$|... "Toward {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} they reached Thompsontown, where the young clergyman said he was going to stop for the night, and go on by train the next day. Sam Twitty was glad to hear this, and advised him to stop at the <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>Boom,</b> where he and Captain Abner intended to stay until they finished the business which brought them to Thompsontown.|$|E
6000|$|... "The honeymoon of Mr. and Mrs. Twitty {{was spent}} in Thompsontown, and lasted three days; for {{at the end of}} that time the bride's brother demanded to be {{released}} from the care of the toll-gate, having other duties which were incumbent upon him. But when Sam and his wife spoke of leaving the <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>Boom,</b> Captain Abner was perfectly willing to go with them. His face bore an expression of contented resignation.|$|E
60|$|Marston {{looked at}} the high topsail and bending <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom.</b> He {{would have liked to}} haul the topsail down, but his comrade's voice had a strange gay note that he had heard before. Harry meant to carry on; he would drive the boat until {{something}} broke. Then Marston looked ahead. The big promontory was not far off and moonlight touched the towering crags. The sea was all white, for the current, setting strongly round the head, ran in angry combers against the wind.|$|E
60|$|He beckoned {{the paid}} hand and they crawled along the deck. Red Rose rolled savagely and main boom and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> tossed their ends aloft. The spars {{must be kept}} down, lest they swing across, and Marston, {{clasping}} the varnished pole with arms and legs, crawled {{out as far as}} he dared. Sometimes he swung high above the combers that rushed past below; and sometimes swung down until his body was wet by the foam. He could hold on if Harry kept her straight, but if she swerved much the big sails would lurch across and he and Charley would hardly escape with broken bones. He looked aft. Wyndham's figure cut against the light; it was tense and his head was motionless, as if his glance was fixed. Marston knew he meant to bring Red Rose in on her time allowance or sail her under.|$|E
60|$|Scrambling forward, {{he crawled}} {{out along the}} <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> to which he clung precariously, lifted up high one moment and the next swung down until his feet were just above the foam. Sometimes they splashed in, and Frank, bracing himself until every nerve was strung up, felt horribly uneasy. In spite of that, the wild rush through the {{glittering}} water which boiled about the boat was wonderfully exhilarating. She seemed a mass of straining sail which swayed in the moonlight above an insignificant strip of hull half buried in snowy foam. Over her black mainsail peak dim wisps of clouds went streaming by, and from all around there was a tumult of stirring sound--the clamor at the bows, the swish of water as the canoe came charging up to her, and the splash of tumbling seas. Everything ahead, however, was hidden by the sail, and he was wondering where the other boat was when Harry called to him.|$|E
60|$|He floundered {{forward to}} the foot of the mast, and when he came back the {{spinnaker}} was drawing steadily and the sloop had changed her mode of progress. She no longer rolled viciously or screwed up to windward as she lifted on a sea, but swayed from side to side with a smooth and easy swing, and Frank could steer her with a touch upon the tiller. In spite of that, steering was ticklish work, for the mainboom and the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> went up and came down until they raked the glittering brine alternately, and Frank realized that it would be singularly easy to bring one crashing over upon the other. There was no doubt that the boat was sailing very fast, and he hazarded one swift glance over his shoulder at the canoe. She was surging along astern, hove up with her forward half out of the water, and a seething mass of foam hiding the rest of her. Harry, however, glanced forward somewhat anxiously.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{was very}} {{cautious}} as he eased the rope out around a cleat, after which, when the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> had drawn forward, {{he found that}} he could luff the boat. When she had swerved from her course a trifle {{he could see the}} other boat close ahead, and it gave him some idea how fast both craft were traveling. She seemed nothing but sail. Indeed, except for the torn-up track of foam that marked her passage, she looked much less like a boat than some wonderful phantom thing flying at an astonishing speed across the sea. Swiftly as she sped, however, there was no doubt that the sloop was creeping up on her, and Frank felt himself quivering all through as the distance between them lessened yard by yard. Then suddenly the contour of her canvas changed and she swung around from leeward across the sloop's bows. Frank's heart gave a sudden leap as he wondered what he must do and his nerve almost deserted him, until Harry called again.|$|E

50|$|Britannia's 51' long gaff, the king’s chair, tiller, some mast hoops, {{blocks and}} rigging, anchor chain and clock are {{preserved}} in the Sir Max Aitken Museum in Cowes High Street {{and the remains of}} her <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> are at Carisbrooke Castle, also on the Isle of Wight. The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> was given for use as a flag pole on the keep (where it twice suffered lightning damage), and the present flagpole is a fibreglass replica. In an episode of Antiques Roadshow from Pembroke Castle, broadcast in April 2017, a relative of a crew member brought photographs, and a damask tablecloth and some cutlery from the yacht, to be appraised.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} its performance even further, the Tornado was modified in 2000, {{with a new}} sail-plan which included a Spinnaker and <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> {{as well as an}} increased sail area of the existing sails. An additional trapeze was also added, and the jib was made self tacking.|$|E
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the boats from the 1883 race have remained the standard ever since. Despite the small hulls, the dinghies carried substantial rigging. Although square topsails were reportedly in use in the 1880s, the form used today soon developed, basically scaled down from the larger sloops. One early example, the Reckless, was fitted with a 28 ft mast, 28 ft boom, 14 ft bowsprit, and 20 ft <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom.</b> She carried 70 square yards of canvas going upwind, while the spinnaker increased this to 92 square yards running downwind.|$|E
50|$|The {{foot of a}} Bermuda sail may be {{attached}} to the boom along its length, or in some modern rigs the sail is attached to the boom only at its ends. This modern variation of a Bermuda mainsail is known as a loose-footed main. In some early Bermudian vessels, the mainsails were attached only to the mast and deck, lacking booms. This is the case on two of the three masts of the newly built Spirit of Bermuda, a replica of an 1830s British Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Additional sails were also often mounted on traditional Bermudian craft, when running down wind, which included a spinnaker, with a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> and additional jibs.|$|E
50|$|Originally named Plaisance, this estate {{included}} a huge mansion surrounded by 10 acre of grounds {{and was the}} home of Sir Bertram Falle. It {{was put on the}} market in 1937 for the sum of £25,000. At the time Davis was seeking a suitable site to erect a statue of King George V. He purchased the site and employed Mr. J. A. Colledge, a famous landscape gardener, to lay out the grounds {{in the form of a}} park. Early in 1938 the landscaping of the park began. By August 1939 the work was so well advanced it was decided to prepare everything for an early public opening of the Park. The Park was officially handed over as a gift to the people of Jersey in September 1939. A statue of King George V by William Reid Dick was erected within the main entrance and the flagstaff was made from the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> of Davis's racing yacht Westward. A Hall of Remembrance was also established in the grounds.|$|E
50|$|The Bermuda sloop {{is a type}} of fore-and-aft rigged {{sailing vessel}} {{developed}} on the island of Bermuda in the 17th century. In this sense, the term is applied to small ships, rather than boats. In its purest form, it is single-masted, although ships with such rigging were built with as many as three masts. Its original form had gaff rig, but evolved to use what is now known as Bermuda rig, making it the basis of nearly all modern sailing yachts. Although the Bermuda sloop is often described as a development of the narrower-beamed Jamaica sloop, which dates from the 1670s, the high, raked masts and triangular sails of its Bermuda rig are rooted in a tradition of Bermudian boat design dating from the early 17th century. Part of that tradition included long, horizontal bowsprits and large jibs. Three jibs were commonly used on Bermudian ships. Triangular sails appeared on Bermudian boats early in the 17th century, a development of the Dutch bezaan, or leg-of-mutton rig, itself derived from the Lateen rig. This became the Bermuda rig, and was appearing on Bermudian ships by the early 19th century. A large spinnaker was carried on a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> when running down-wind.|$|E
