5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the fragment appears to have been intentionally cut, most likely in modern times.

5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|During the 14th century, {{however, the}} castle had {{declined}} and became abandoned. In 1398 Richard II had the lead {{taken from the}} castle roofs for reuse at Portchester Castle. In 1660, visitors' accounts imply that the stonework had all been dismantled, and 18th-century accounts <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was reused for construction work in the town below, which had prospered from the wool and later linen trade.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave.

5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species bred further south in Europe {{in the cool}} periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae. Some accounts <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> ray {{may be able to}} survive out of water for up to a day.|$|E

5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} {{important}} component of the commercial gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> fishery does not currently pose a threat to U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Anarchy, {{the number}} of small towns in England began to {{increase}} sharply. By 1297, 120 new towns had been established, and in 1350 – by when the expansion had effectively ceased – there were around 500 towns in England. Many of these new towns were centrally planned: Richard I created Portsmouth, John founded Liverpool, and successive monarchs followed with Harwich, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, Royston, Baldock, Wokingham, Maidenhead and Reigate. The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes in mind, rather than defence, and the streets were laid out to make access to the town's market convenient. A growing percentage of England's population lived in urban areas; estimates <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> rose from around 5.5% in 1086 to up to 10% in 1377.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{the couple}} moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon {{took a job}} at the Office of Price Administration. In his {{political}} campaigns, Nixon would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier. He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy. As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.|$|E
