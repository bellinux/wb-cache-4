25|$|The {{technique}} of adding sugar to grape must {{has been part}} of the process of winemaking since the Romans added honey as a <b>sweetening</b> <b>agent.</b> While not realizing the chemical components, Roman winemakers were able to identify the benefits of added sense of body or mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a special}} role of sucrose in the {{formation}} of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable <b>sweetening</b> <b>agent.</b> Widespread replacement of sucrose by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet, such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a <b>sweetening</b> <b>agent.</b> Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been}} {{recommended}} in position statements and consensus documents for procedural pain management in neonates; however, {{it is not}} clear if this has resulted in widespread adoption in clinical practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate unit-specific protocols for the use of <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents.</b> Methods: Structured telephone survey with qualified personnel in special care (level II) nurseries and neonatal intensive care (level III) units across Canada. The frequency and pattern of recommended use of <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> was documented. Results: Eighty-six of 92 units (93. 5 %) participated. Sixty-four percent recommended sucrose and 2. 3 % recommended glucose for procedural pain management; 87. 7 % had a guideline. <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> were most commonly recommended for venipuncture/ venous cannulation (91. 2 % for both), lumbar puncture (87. 7 %), and heel lance (82. 5 %). Dosing guidelines ranged from 0. 05 mL of 24 % sucrose solution to 3 mL of 25 % sucrose solution. Sweeteners were not recommended for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (77. 2 %) or those who were nil per os (75 %). Conclusions: <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> were recommended for procedural pain management in two-thirds of special care nurseries and neonatal intensive care units across Canada with extensive variability in specific dosing guidelines. Audits of pain management practices should therefore account for unit-specific practice guidelines. This study was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) research studentship to Ms A Yiu, a CIHR New Investigator Award to Dr A Taddio, and a CIHR Canada Research Chair in Health Psychology to Dr J Katz. The funding did not include any input into the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of data; preparation, review, or approval of manuscript.

500|$|The term [...] "plum cake" [...] and [...] "fruit cake" [...] {{have become}} interchangeable. Since dried fruit {{is used as}} a <b>sweetening</b> <b>agent</b> and any dried fruit used to be {{described}} as [...] "plums", many plum cakes and plum puddings do not contain the plum fruit now known by that name. (Plum pudding is a similar, richer dish prepared with similar ingredients, cooked by steaming the mixture rather than baking it.)

2500|$|To enhance flavor, {{white wine}} might age on its lees, and chalk or marble dust was {{sometimes}} added to reduce acidity. Wines were often exposed to high temperatures and [...] "baked," [...] a process {{similar to that}} used to make modern Madeira. To enhance a wine's sweetness, a portion of the wine must was boiled to concentrate the sugars in the process known as defrutum and then added {{to the rest of the}} fermenting batch. (Columella's writings suggest that the Romans believed boiling the must acted as a preservative as well.) Lead was also sometimes used as a <b>sweetening</b> <b>agent,</b> but honey could also be added, as much as [...] recommended to sufficiently sweeten [...] of wine to Roman tastes. Another technique was to withhold a portion of the sweeter, unfermented must and blend it with the finished wine, a method known today as süssreserve.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{safety of}} {{patients}} with epilepsy consuming <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents,</b> which is becoming increasingly prevalent for various reasons, is a topic that should be emphasized as sensitively {{as it is for}} other diseases. Patients with epilepsy consume <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> for different reasons such being diabetic or overweight. They can occasionally be exposed to <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> unrestrainedly through consuming convenience food, primarily beverages. This study aimed to investigate the effects of rebaudioside A (Reb-A), which is a steviol glycoside produced from the herb Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni), on epileptic seizures and convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Forty-eight male rats were used. Twenty-four rats were administered 35  mg/kg PTZ to trigger epileptiform activity; the remaining 24 rats were administered 70  mg/kg PTZ to trigger the convulsion model. The epileptiform activity was evaluated by spike percentage, whereas convulsion was evaluated by Racine's Convulsion Scale and the onset time of the first myoclonic jerk. Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in the Racine's Convulsion Scale score and increase in the latency of first myoclonic jerk in a dose-dependent manner for the rat groups in which PTZ epilepsy had been induced and Reb-A had been administered. For the groups that were administered Reb-A, the spike decrease was apparent in a dose-dependent manner, based on the spike percentage calculation. These results indicated that Reb-A has positive effects on PTZ-induced convulsions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Children’s {{beverage}} {{consumption patterns}} have received increased attention {{in light of}} the obesity epidemic in this group. In day care centers (DCCs), children spend up to 10 h a day, and typically consume half to three quarters of their daily food intake. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate what beverages are typically served to children in preschools in Poland, and to evaluate the practices associated with adding sugar and other <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> to beverages. Methods: Direct interviews with preschools staff were conducted with a questionnaire regarding offered beverages and adding sugar and other <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents.</b> The menu of 10 consecutive days and inventory reports were analyzed to verify information. Results: A total of 720 preschools were included in the study. Cocoa and milk coffee substitute were served in 95 % of preschools, followed by compote (92 %), tea (84 %), fruit/herbal tea (73 %) and water (69 %). Water was the only beverage available between meals (93 % DCCs). 86 % of preschools added sugar to tea/cocoa/coffee substitute drinks, and 74 % to compote. Conclusions: In the majority of preschools, beverages which are not recommended were offered. Such an assortment of beverages and common practice of sweetening can increase the amount of added sugar in a children diet. Nutrition education and legal regulations concerning the assortment of beverages served in preschools are urgently needed...|$|R
