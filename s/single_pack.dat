500|$|The single-seat fighter {{versions}} of the Hunter were armed with four [...] ADEN cannon, with 150 rounds of ammunition per gun. The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a <b>single</b> <b>pack</b> that could {{be removed from the}} aircraft for rapid re-arming and maintenance. Unusually, the barrels of the cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed. In the two-seat version, either a single 30mm ADEN cannon was carried or, in some export versions, two, with a removable ammunition tank. Later {{versions of}} the Hunter were fitted with SNEB Pods; these were [...] rocket projectiles in 18-round Matra pods, providing an effective strike capability against ground targets.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the fall}} and winter of 1902, word of the gold strike and the new {{settlement}} spread throughout Alaska and the Yukon. Printer George M. Hill, who had been working in Dawson City, packed up his small press and traveled to Fairbanks in early 1903. On September 19, 1903, he printed the first newspaper in the new settlement: Volume I, Issue I of the Weekly Fairbanks News. Little is known about Hill's operation, but he likely used either a Washington Hand Press or an [...] "Army" [...] press — both were small machines designed for transport on a <b>single</b> <b>pack</b> horse or pack mule. Single copies of the first editions of the paper were [...] $0.25 each, or $10 for a year's subscription. The paper was 10pages and had multiple advertisements, including one proclaiming that an election would be held on November 10 of that year for the purpose of incorporating the town. On the front page was a statement of policy: ...|$|E

The Blu-ray Disc contains deleted scenes and four featurettes: My Least Favorite Career, Surviving a Horrible Boss, Being Mean Is So Much Fun, and The Making of the Horrible Bosses Soundtrack. Both the theatrical and extended cuts are presented in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 with DTS-HD Master Audio sound. Beginning with the Blu-ray Disc release of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern, Warner Bros. included a code that allows the owner to access {{a version of the}} film via UltraViolet, a cloud storage service which allows streaming or downloading to a variety of devices.|$|E
2500|$|Scream, Scream 2 and Scream 3 {{remained}} unreleased {{in foreign}} territories including Europe and Japan until 2001 {{where they were}} simultaneously released on February 26 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

Additionally, the three films were collected together in a <b>single</b> <b>pack,</b> again released on February 26 and released as [...] "Scream Trilogy".|$|E
60|$|We {{had many}} fine-weather diversions to beguile the time. There {{was a single}} chess-board and a <b>single</b> <b>pack</b> of cards. Sometimes as many as twenty {{of us would be}} playing dominoes for love. Feats of dexterity, puzzles for the intelligence, some arithmetical, some of the same order as the old problem of the fox and goose and cabbage, were always welcome; and the latter, I observed, more popular as well as more conspicuously well done than the former. We had a regular daily {{competition}} to guess the vessel's progress; and twelve o'clock, when the result was published in the wheel-house, came to be a moment of considerable interest. But the interest was unmixed. Not a bet was laid upon our guesses. From the Clyde to Sandy Hook I never heard a wager offered or taken. We had, besides, romps in plenty. Puss in the Corner, which we had rebaptised, in more manly style, Devil and four Corners, was my own favourite game; but there were many who preferred another, the humour of which was to box a person's ears until he found out who had cuffed him.|$|E

50|$|The release reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1980.
