40|$|Abstract: A {{simple and}} {{practical}} hydraulic {{deep drawing test}} tooling is developed to investigate metal sheets formability. It is composed of two parts including the forming die and hydraulic control system. Experiments with varied material and dimensional sheets of hydraulic deep drawing and mechanical deep drawing can be fulfilled by the tooling on a <b>Single-Action</b> <b>Press</b> without complicate external hydraulic system, blank holder system and oriented system for punch, respectively. The tooling is testified to be simply, facile and reliable, which can perfectly perform the sheets forming in hydraulic deep drawing, and the formability of sheets was improved effectively with hydraulic deep drawing...|$|E
50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of rubber pad forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, <b>single-action</b> <b>presses</b> are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of processing variables on the porosity and fractography of Cr and Cr-Mo PM steels. The measurements were performed on sintered steels made from commercial Höganäs pre-alloyed powders: Astaloy CrA, Astaloy CrL and Astaloy CrM with two different carbon concentrations (0. 2 % and 0. 6 %) added in the form of ultra fine graphite powder grade C-UF. Following mixing in Turbula mixer for 30 minutes, green compacts were <b>single-action</b> <b>pressed</b> at 660 MPa according to PN-EN ISO 2740 standard. Sintering was carried out in a laboratory horizontal tube furnace at 1120 °C and 1250 °C for 60 minutes, in an atmosphere containing 5 %H 2 and 95 %N 2. After sintering, the samples were tempered at 200 °C for 60 minutes in air. For porosity evaluation computer software was employed. Hitachi S- 3500 M SEM equipped with EDS (made by Noran) was employed for fracture analysis. The steel based on Astaloy CrM pre-alloyed powder is characterized by fine pores and good mechanical properties. When sintered at 1250 °C, it had area of pores approx. 7. 12 μm 2, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) about 679 MPa and elongation about 4 %. The steels were characterized by ductile/cleavage and ductile fractures...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the clamping force in the technique {{used in this study}} to stretch-bend low carbon steel samples was investigated to support the subsequent changes in the microstructure and properties of the formed material with regard to parent material. Although plastic deformation by cold working is known to induce texture or preferred orientation to the grains of a formed material while decreasing its ductility and increasing the strength, as well as inducing residual stress, it is not known how the different directions (rolling, transverse and oblique/ 45 °) of the sheet steel will respond to this stretch bending technique. The first part of the research work involved a thorough literature review on sheet metal forming processes and their effect on the formed material with interest on the above mentioned directions of the sheet. It became clear from the literature overview that cold working of a material will induce strain-hardening which varies with the magnitude of cold work, resulting in changes in the strength and ductility of the material. Besides, when plastic deformation is not uniform (e. g., tensile and compressive) throughout the entire cross section of the formed part, residual stresses remain in the material with the grains been elongated along the direction of the maximum strain. The main parameters that were considered and controlled in this study are as follows: strain experienced / stress induced into the form sample, the sample direction, the stroke length and the clamping torque, the generated radius of curvature. The chapters that follow the literature review, deal with the set-up of the different equipment used in this study, the specimen preparation as well as the recording, the calculation and interpretation of the results. It was found that the stress magnitude that generated the different radii of curvature (120 mm, 150 mm and 185 mm) was between 1 percent & 13 percent higher than the parent material’s yield strength with the lower stress been associated to the smaller radius of curvature and the higher stress to the higher radius. The stress induced into the sample during forming was not only proportional to the stroke length but also to the distance between the punch’s tip and the sample and the sample to the die’s nadir. The clamping torque adopted was restricted to the manual capacity of the operator who used a preset torque wrench to fasten the plate sample into the jig. Plate samples of low carbon steel were cut to angles of 0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° to the rolling direction of the sheet material and stretch-bent on a <b>single-action</b> mechanical <b>press</b> to 120 mm, 150 mm, and 185 mm radii of curvature. The preliminary results indicate that stretch-bent samples had increased hardness to the parent plate, in particular below the surface layers up to around 1. 1 mm depth. Since there is a well established relationship between hardness, yield and tensile strengths for steel, the yield and tensile strengths of the formed material were estimated using the Nobre et al [34] incremental relation, which relates the linearity between relative increments of hardness and yield strength. Changes were not noticeable at the microstructural level of the formed samples. Meanwhile, samples from which higher plastic deformation stress values were calculated were not those absorbing higher impact energy when Charpy specimen cut from plate and stretch-bent samples were tested. The maximum relieved residual stress in the parent material was predominantly compressive and represents in magnitude approximately 12 percent (average for the three directions) of its original yield strength. In the stretch-bent samples, the relieved residual stress was compressive in the outer curved section with a magnitude about 50 percent of the parent material yield strength and tensile in the inner curved section with a magnitude approximately 25 percent of the parent material yield strength...|$|R
