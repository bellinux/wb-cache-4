Influence of nitrite was evaluated on the basis of acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> tests results on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The effects of nitrite were also observed in wels catfish { [...] } albino (Silurus glanis). On the basis of the results of acute toxicity tests, values of lethal concentration of nitrite for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (96 hLC 50 = 11. 2 mg. l- 1 NO 2 -) and for wels catfish { [...] } albino (Silurus glanis) (96 hLC 50 = 15. 8 mg. l- 1 NO 2 -) were calculated. Using results of acute toxicity test for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and with respect to legislative requirements, concentrations of nitrite for <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> test were selected. The results of <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> test showed that nitrite concentration of 3 mg. l- 1 NO 2 - during 28 -day exposition caused 65 % fish mortality.

In addition, its acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicities</b> were assessed. Eight compounds were isolated from this plant and identified as β-sitosterol, β-sitosterol glucoside, chryasophanol, 7 -hydroxy- 2, 5 dimethyl chromen- 4 -one, quercetin, Aloe emodin glucoside, rutin and Patuletin- 3 ′-O-methyl- 3 -O-rutinoside. The structure elucidation was based on 1 H and 13 C NMR, proton–proton correlation spectroscopy (1 H– 1 H Cosy), distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT), Heteronuclear Multiple-Quantum Correlation (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlations spectrum (HMBC). Hepatotoxicity induced with CCl 4 was evidenced by elevation of liver marker enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP and LDH) and TB content in serum. In addition, antioxidant enzymes were drastically inhibited with significant reduction of GSH and increased LPO in liver homogenate of CCl 4 -intoxicated rats. Pre-treatment with F. ingens (200 and 400 mg/kg) and silymarin (50 mg/kg) avoided the changes observed in CCl 4 -intoxicated rats.

40|$|The world-wide {{occurrence}} of harmful cyanobacteria blooms “CyanoHAB” in fresh and brackish waters creates problems for all life forms. During CyanoHAB events, toxic cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins {{at high levels}} that can cause chronic and <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicities</b> to animals, plants and humans. Cyanotoxicity in eukaryotes has been mainly focused on animals, but during these last years, data, related to cyanotoxin (mainly microcystins, MCs) impact on both aquatic and terrestrials crop plants irrigated by water containing these toxins, have {{become more and more}} available. This last cited fact is gaining importance since plants could in a direct or indirect manner contribute to cyanotoxin transfer through the food chain, and thus constitute a potent health risk source. The use of this contaminated irrigation water can also have an economical impact which appears by a reduction of the germination rate of seeds, and alteration of the quality and the productivity of crop plants. The main objective of this work was to discuss the eventual phytotoxicity of cyanotoxins (microcystins) as the major agricultural impacts induced by the use of contaminated water for plant irrigation. These investigations confirm the harmful effects (ecological, eco-physiological, socio-economical and sanitary risk) of dissolved MCs on agricultural plants. Thus, cyanotoxin phytotoxicity strongly suggests a need for the surveillance of CyanoHAB and the monitoring of water irrigation quality as well as for drinking water...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the toxicological effects of cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B using <b>sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing in rodents. Method: Cleistanthins A and B were {{isolated from the}} leaves of Cleistanthus collinus. Both the compounds were administered orally for 90 days at the concentration of 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, and the effects on blood pressure, biochemical parameters and histology were assessed. The dose for sub-chronic toxicology was determined by fixed dose method according to OECD guidelines. Result: <b>Sub-chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> study of cleistanthins A and B spanning over 90 days at the dose levels of 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg (once daily, per oral) revealed a significant dose dependant toxic effect in lungs. The compounds {{did not have any}} effect on the growth of the rats. The food and water intake of the animals were also not affected by both cleistanthins A and B. Both the compounds did not have any significant effect on liver and renal markers. The histopathological analysis of both cleistanthins A and B showed dose dependent morphological changes in the brain, heart, lung, liver and kidney. When compared to cleistanthin A, cleistanthin B had more toxic effect in Wistar rats. Both the compounds have produced a dose dependent increase of corpora amylacea in brain and induced acute tubular necrosis in kidneys. In addition, cleistanthin B caused spotty necrosis of liver in higher doses.

Therefore, the additive is safe for these target species at the recommended dose. The conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons provided that the same dose applies. The fermentation product used for the preparation of the additive gave negative results for mutagenicity. The results obtained in a <b>sub-chronic</b> oral <b>toxicity</b> study raised no concerns regarding the product. Therefore, the additive gives rise to no concern for consumer safety. No risks to the environment are expected from the use of the product as a feed additive. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy trials provided in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, it is concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at the recommended dose. These conclusions can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. The Panel proposes a recommendation to modify the specifications of the additive...|$|R
40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of nanoparticles influence their environmental fate and toxicity, and studies investigating this are vital for a holistic approach towards a comprehensive and adequate environmental risk assessment. In this study, we investigated {{the effects of}} size, surface coating (charge) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) - a most commonly-used nanoparticle-type, on the bioaccumulation in, and toxicity (survival, growth, cocoon production) to the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. AgNPs were synthesized in three sizes: 20, 35 and 50 nm. Surface-coating with bovine serum albumin (AgNP_BSA), chitosan (AgNP_Chit), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (AgNP_PVP) produced negative, positive and neutral particles respectively. In a 28 -day <b>sub-chronic</b> reproduction <b>toxicity</b> test, earthworms were exposed to these AgNPs in soil (0 - 250 mg Ag/kg soil DW). Earthworms were also exposed to AgNO 3 at concentrations below known EC 50. Total Ag tissue concentration indicated uptake by earthworms was generally highest for the AgNP_BSA especially at the lower exposure concentration ranges, and seems to reach a plateau level between 50 and 100 mg Ag/kg soil DW. Reproduction was impaired at high concentrations of all AgNPs tested, with AgNP_BSA particles being the most toxic. The EC 50 for the 20 nm AgNP_BSA was 66. 8 mg Ag/kg soil, with exposure to AgNP_PVP (neutral) > Chitosan (positive). Size had an influence on uptake and toxicity of the AgNP_PVP, but not for AgNP_BSA nor AgNP_Chit. This study provides essential information {{on the role of}} physicochemical {{properties of}} AgNPs in influencing uptake by a terrestrial organism L. rubellus under environmentally relevant conditions.

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that OECD guidelines do not exist for safety assessment of GM crops. Typically, regulators have allowed industry to adapt OECD guidelines for toxicity testing of chemicals, in particular OECD guideline 408 (<b>sub-chronic,</b> 90 -day, <b>toxicity</b> protocol) [37], for animal feeding studies assessing GM crop safety. Séralini et al. [2, 3] was designed as a follow-on study to Hammond et al. [4], and therefore is consistent with the same adaptation of OECD guideline 408 used by Hammond et al. [4]. However, Séralini et al. [2, 3] added rigor in three ways. (a) They used three doses of NK 603 and Roundup. OECD 408 requires 3 doses, but most industry GM crop studies, including Hammond et al. [4], have used only two. Regulators have accepted studies that follow this model, despite this shortcoming. (b) Séralini et al. [2, 3] systematically report observations on 34 organs and 56 blood parameters analyzed at 11 time points, which is a much broader dataset than that recommended in OECD 408 and reported by Hammond et al. [4]. (c) They extended the time scale of the study from 90  days to 2  years. However, Séralini et al. [2, 3] included n =  10 animals in each treatment and control group, while Hammond et al. [4] included n =  20 animals in each group, but analyzed only 10 for blood parameters. Thus, the two studies generated biochemical data from equal numbers of animals. It should be pointed out, however, that Hammond et al. [4] did not disclose the criteria that they used to select for analyzing 10 animals from among the 20 in each group.|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to their}} small sizes, {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) exhibit completely different and novel characteristics {{compared to their}} bulk counterparts of the same chemical composition. These novel properties include increased reactivity due to large specific surface area, fluorescence and colour changes, increased biological barrier crossings and increased material strengthening combined with light-weight. Virtually all fields of human endeavours are exploiting nanotechnology to combat different challenges. This {{has led to an}} increase in the production and potential release of NPs into the environment. The novel properties of these NPs however, mean an enhanced potential for interactions with biological systems that are different from the interactions of known conventional chemicals, thus raising environmental and public health/safety concerns. Available literature has reported NP uptake in different organisms along with associated hazards. Therefore, to safeguard human and environmental health and safety, regulatory measures are necessary. Such measures must be based on sound scientific evidence and be risk-based rather than hazard-based. As such, the need to understand the fate of NPs after environmental release and their potential to pose hazards and risks to the environment is critical for a proper risk assessment and further development of policy strategies on the future regulation of the use of NPs. Some studies have demonstrated different and sometimes conflicting effects of NP properties on their uptake in different organisms. Given that exposure determines whether hazards will turn into risks, there is a critical need for further systematic evaluation of the physico-chemical properties of engineered or manufactured NPs that influence uptake in terrestrial organisms, and also of how soil properties may affect these processes. The objective of this project was to determine the influence of size and surface coating (charge), two important physico-chemical properties of NPs, on their bioavailability, uptake and toxicity. The red earthworm Lumbricus rubellus, common in most parts of Europe, was used as a model soil organism. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been identified {{as one of the most}} commonly used NPs in many products, and their production is expected to continue to increase. Therefore, we selected AgNPs as our model NPs. For our investigations, we applied an integrated in vitro - in vivo approach, utilising high throughput in vitro methods as well as well-established in vivo toxicity end-points in the earthworm. A systematic experimental approach was developed for which AgNPs were synthesized in three sizes: 20, 35 and 50 nm. Surface-coating with bovine serum albumin (AgNP_BSA), chitosan (AgNP_Chit), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (AgNP_PVP) resulted in negative, positive and neutral particles respectively. Firstly, macrophage cells (RAW 264. 7) were exposed to AgNPs at 0 – 200 µg/mL (nominal concentrations) and uptake dynamics, cell viability, as well as induction of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed (Chapter 2). Generally, the adverse effects of exposure to the tested AgNPs resulted in reduced overall viability of the cells, which was similar for all AgNPs tested. On adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and specific mechanisms of toxicity (TNF-α and ROS production) however, we observed that the AgNPs differed significantly, with the negatively charged AgNP_BSA being the most toxic. Significant ROS induction was only observed after exposure to the 20 nm positively charged AgNP_Chit. Effect of size was less prominent than that of surface coating, showing mostly limited differences that were not statistically significant under our experimental conditions. Live confocal imaging of exposed cells allowed the monitoring of the uptake dynamics and subcellular cytoplasmic accumulation of AgNPs. We observed fast uptake of AgNPs within 2. 5 hours which is essential in case of exposure durations of 6 and 24 hours, as applied in our experiments. However, similar uptake did not always result in similar effects. With the insights obtained from the in vitro assessments, we investigated the effects of size and surface coating (charge) of AgNPs on the bioaccumulation in, and toxicity (survival, growth, cocoon production) to the earthworm L. rubellus. Currently, metal engineered NPs in tissues are generally quantified based on total metal concentrations after acid destruction of samples. Such destructive methods are limited in providing information on the speciation and the forms of NPs which is essential for characterising the fate of NPs. In the present thesis, we developed a method using a combination of enzymatic tissue processing and single particle inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) to characterise and quantify AgNPs in tissues of earthworms (Chapter 3). Subcellular fractionation of tissues was also applied to investigate potential association of AgNPs with the cellular metallothionein (MT) containing fraction of the earthworm tissues. This study provided, to the best of our knowledge, the first estimates of tissue Ag concentrations in both particulate and ionic forms in earthworms exposed in vivo to AgNPs via soil. The results obtained showed fairly low uptake of AgNPs, with earthworms exposed to a commercially obtained PVP-coated AgNP showing approximately 34 % of their total Ag tissue burden being in particulate form. This indicates that although AgNPs accumulated in tissues of earthworms in their primary form, the dissolution of Ag in the soil, organism, or both played an important role in determining the ultimate fate of the AgNPs. Although the biological uptake of AgNPs was generally low, the method described in Chapter 3 was still capable of extracting NPs in quantities sufficient for identification, quantification and characterisation. It should be noted however, that the lower size detection threshold for the ICP-MS instrument used for these analyses is approximately 30 nm. Consequently, information on NPs smaller than 30 nm was not available. With the increasing optimisation of analytical systems that combine sp-ICP-MS, or other detection methods with, for example, asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4) which pre-sort different particle sizes, the potential for application of methods described in this thesis will be even greater. Having developed a method for extracting Ag from tissues, we exposed earthworms to all nine synthesized AgNPs as well as to AgNO 3 at two concentrations below known EC 50 s to control for ionic effects of Ag in a 28 -day <b>sub-chronic</b> reproduction <b>toxicity</b> test in soil in Chapter 4. Uptake was observed to be generally highest for the negatively charged AgNP_BSA especially at the lower exposure concentration ranges. Total Ag concentrations in earthworm tissues reached a plateau level of about 80 mg Ag/kg dry weight (DW) for exposure concentrations between 15 – 100 mg Ag/kg soil DW. Reproduction was impaired at high nominal soil concentrations of all AgNPs tested, with AgNP_BSA particles being the most toxic. Size had an influence on uptake of the AgNP_PVP, showing both uptake and effect on reproduction of the 20 nm sized group to be significantly more than those of the 35 and 50 nm AgNP_PVP. This size effect however, did not hold for AgNP_BSA nor AgNP_Chit. Higher uptake from the soil may consequently lead to a higher potential for toxicity in organisms. Interestingly, internal total Ag tissue concentrations measured after 72 hour exposure were better at predicting the effect on reproduction than tissue concentrations after 28 days exposure. It is likely therefore, that reproduction was affected already in the 72 hour exposure window. In order to further elucidate the likely mechanisms by which these AgNPs were exerting their effects, we conducted a toxicogenomic study in Chapter 5. Although AgNPs have been increasingly investigated, information regarding their effect on the gene expression profile of especially soil organisms is yet inadequate. Using RNAseq, we investigated the transcriptome and gene expression profiles of the earthworm L. rubellus, following exposure to the nine AgNPs. Overall, exposure to medium sized AgNPs at a concentration close to the EC 50 for effects on cocoon production caused most pronounced responses at the transcriptional level. There was a correlation however, between the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and internal Ag concentrations in the earthworms. Within the medium size AgNPs, AgNP_BSA caused extensive transcriptional responses, with 684 genes affected. In contrast ionic silver (AgNO 3) did not affect gene expression at low as well as higher exposure levels. Only one gene was regulated by all AgNP and Ag+ treatments, indicating that there was hardly any functional overlap between the responses of the organisms to AgNPs with different coatings. Remarkably, this gene was metallothionein, a cysteine-rich peptide known to strongly bind free metal ions for chelation and detoxification, which was strongly up-regulated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis for 35 nm AgNP_BSA exposures revealed a total of 33 significantly enriched gene ontology terms related to biological processes. These included responses to pH, proton transport, cell differentiation, microtubule organisation, and and MT induction. Surface coating (BSA) was important in triggering the AgNP-induced differential gene expression profiles in earthworms. The importance of physicochemical properties of NPs in influencing their fate and toxicity is thus elucidated in the current study. The studies reported in the current thesis showed that within the range of 20 to 50 nm, effects of the size of AgNPs on toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics are limited. However, effects of surface coating were consistent over the different levels of biological integration. Generally, the negatively charged AgNP_BSA accumulated to a higher extent in the earthworms, especially at lower concentrations. The in vitro uptake was fast for all NPs, but also showed the highest uptake of AgNP_BSA. The negatively charged AgNPs were also the most toxic, likely related to their increased uptake. This was evident at all levels: gene expression, cellular, and individual (population dynamic parameters) levels. At the in vitro level, this applied mostly to effects on specific modes of action (TNF-α induction, ROS production). For more general cytotoxic effects, the effects of surface coatings were less evident. Except in cells exposed to AgNP_Chit 20 nm, where there was a slight increase in ROS production, this set of AgNPs under the experimental conditions applied, did not appear to induce the production of ROS. This was supported by the lack of expression of any ROS-related gene in the gene expression profile analyses. Based on the results of the current research, it can be concluded that the physico-chemical properties of NPs do influence their environmental fate and toxicity. It should be noted however that general predictions on the outcome of exposure to NPs are difficult to make, and NPs should be evaluated on a case by case basis. Our research supports the use of in vitro models to limit and prioritize further in vivo studies. Studies investigating the fate and effects of NPs for soil organisms are vital for a holistic approach towards a comprehensive and adequate environmental risk assessment (ERA). The studies described in this thesis contribute to this knowledge, thereby improving our understanding of the hazards and risks due to exposure to AgNPs, thus enabling their adequate and comprehensive ERA...|$|R
