40|$|Abstraet [...] A {{procedure}} for structural investigations by X-ray diffraction of mixed-layer structures incor-porating swelling layers has been developed. For each sample, specimens saturated with different cations (Na, Mg, and Ca), are analyzed both as air-dried and as glycolated. One structural model fitting all the observed patterns then provides {{the structure of}} the sample. Samples tested include: Illite-smectite (I-S) minerals from Kazachstan (a rectorite), Dolna Ves in Slovakia, Kinnekulle in <b>Sweden,</b> the <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> and Scania in Sweden. The fitting of the patterns of the Kazachstan rectorite demonstrated that the instrumental parameters applied in the modeling were correct. For the I-S minerals from Slovakia and Kinnekulle the observed patterns were fitted with one two-component I-S model. However, the Ca-saturated and air-dried specimen of the Kinnekulle bentonites had two types of swelling interlayers. For the Slovakian I-S with Reichweite = 2, an alternative two-phase I-S plus I-V (V = vermiculite) model fitted the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns equally well. The I-S mineral from Scania is in fact a three-component I-T-S (T = tobelite) and the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> sample is a four-component I-S-V-V', one type of the swelling layers having swelling characteristics intermediately between smectite and vermiculite. In addition to layer types and distribution, interlayer compositions, uch as the amount of interlayer glycol and water and of fixed and exchangeable cations, were determined...|$|R

40|$|During {{the first}} years after the {{re-opening}} of the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> herring fishery in 1983, a relatively high proportion of the catches in early summer was taken in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> After 1986, {{the proportion of the}} catch in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> gradually declined. It is assumed that the high catches in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> in the early 1980 s were due to a delayed migration of the herring from the eastern to {{the western part of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> This delayed departure of the herring from the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> could have been caused by favourable food conditions in this area. Data on Calanus finmarchicus from the Continuous Plankton Recorder show that the seasonal cycle of this copepod in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> was delayed during the period 1976 – 1984, which resulted in an prolonged food supply for the herring in this area. It is likely that this extension of the feeding season induced the herring to delay their departures from the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> When the Calanus season shortened after 1985, the herring advanced their departure from the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> There was a delay of one or two years between the shortening of the feeding season and the earlier departure of the herring from the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> This suggests the existence of a certain conservatism in the migrations of the herring.
