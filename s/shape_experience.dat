A perceptual set, also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. [...] Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.

A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem. It can be shaped by habit or by desire. Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.|$|E

50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump <b>shape.</b> <b>Experience</b> has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we empirically analyse {{the role}} of {{experience}} {{and its relation to}} knowledge by working through a case study of a website for people with incontinence. The term "knowledge by experience" may be confusing if experience is framed as "situations someone has lived through" which then come to function as the foundation for experiential knowledge. Foundationalist framing of experiential knowledge leads to problems of "indistinctness", "incontestability" and "authenticity" of experiential knowledge. The analysis shows how participants structure and process their experiences, for example by collecting, relating and reviewing individual moments and actively interpreting them. Not every experience counts as valid input for "knowledge". We suggest that in relation to knowledge "experience" is better understood as "having experience with" rather than as "having lived through" something. Experience as "being experienced" is then not something that "grounds" experiential knowledge, but takes the shape of know-how, interpretive possibilities and skills that are not exclusively tied to a particular subject. Interpreting experiential knowledge like this specifies it as a form of practical knowledge that may be contested by (more) experienced others and can be transferred to others still trying to master skills.

Background: Genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility aims to identify individuals {{at high risk of}} cancer and facilitate risk-reducing interventions. Risk-reducing surgery (RRS) reduces cancer risk and is the principle primary preventive intervention. Despite this, some women make what appear to be ‘anti-health’ decisions by refusing RRS. Aim: To advance an understanding of why BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers say no to RRS. Methods: Denzin’s (1989) interpretive biography was combined with Dolby-Stahl’s (1985) literary folkloristic methodology to provide a contextualised narrative of the life experiences of six high risk women who said no to RRS. Results: Different understandings of risk underpinned the decision to say no. RRS was perceived as damaging the body and hence was a greater risk to self than cancer risk. Breasts and ovaries were treasured as vital body parts which could not be given up or replaced on the basis of risk. Participants shared a genetic pessimism of regret and uncertainty as they were transformed into perpetual patients awaiting their fate. Discussion: The decision to say no to RRS must be understood within social, cultural and historical contexts which <b>shape</b> <b>experience.</b> The dominant medical model for dealing with cancer risk may marginalise high risk women and paradoxically expose them to greater risk. The relationship between genetic testing and cancer prevention is not straightforward and genetic information has the potential to harm as well as help. Conclusions: The findings from this study are relevant to all nurses given the prominence of genetics in contemporary health care. It is important health care providers approach this area from the viewpoints of those directly involved since without understanding; interventions and supportive strategies may be ineffective...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to address the {{relative}} effectiveness and usefulness of intersectionality as an elastic concept which can span more than the theoretical arena. To do this, the prevailing social problem of violence against ethnicised women is examined in all its complexities. Intersectionality works on two strategic levels – firstly, the framework recognises that individuals are comprised of numerous identity markers and that these characteristics take on a multiplicative relationship, and secondly, that structural systems of power exist within society to reinforce hierarchical privileges and oppressions that are predicated on identity. This thesis presents intersectionality as a possible way of framing the various interactions of social divisions, and the regimes of inequality which cut-across them, {{in the context of}} violence against ethnicised women. This violence is analysed through theoretical, policy and practical responses with particular attention being paid to how the three spheres deal with difference on a variety of analytical levels. A content analysis of New Labour government policy adopts intersectionality as a lens with which to ascertain how valuable this frame is as a methodological tool. Ten interviews with service providers from the violence against women field are conducted in order to gain experiential insight into how identity is seen to <b>shape</b> <b>experience</b> and appropriate responses. This thesis demonstrates that competing perceptions of identity, which are contextually and historically contingent, create a series of specific problems for ethnicised women that are frequently rooted in discourses of marginality, difference and homogeny. Intersectionality is a useful way of creating increased fluidity between theory, policy and practice, and of heightening an understanding of the heterogeneity of women’s experiences.

40|$|In the mid twentieth century, {{thousands}} of non-offending Anglo-Australian children {{were placed in}} Homes and foster ‘care’. The government, churches, and charities of the day saw this as a socially acceptable {{solution to the problem}} of what to do with children who were either unwanted or whose parents could not cope. These places were Dickensian, and all these children suffered. I was one of these children; I had no authority over my own life but was subject to the authority of others. As an adult, my experience gives me the authority to write about the damaging childhood. But this counts for nothing if I cannot convey the child’s agony and the horror of the situation to the reader; it is not enough to simply tell my story. Jane Taylor McDonnell says ‘self-revelation without reflection or understanding is merely self-exposure’ and such a work ‘will quickly lose [the reader’s] interest’ (quoted in Phelan 66). So as a writer, through reflection and maturity, I can regain authority of my childhood. How does a writer establish literary authority of the damaging childhood experience? For the writer, establishing literary authority means being able to persuade the reader that the narrative is poetically true, and that what they are reading contains truth, and that the point of view is valid. Vivien Gornick writes: ‘Memoir writing shares with fiction the obligation to lift from the raw material of life a tale that will <b>shape</b> <b>experience,</b> transform an event, deliver wisdom’ (quoted in Phelan 66). Writing with authority means gaining the reader’s attention and trust; David McCooey says ‘the production of truth and authority... is not so much an exercise in capturing the self as capturing the reader’; and ‘the notion of authority suggests a public domain within which to be authoritative’. He adds that genres that deal with literary and extra-literary forms of authority make the ‘following assumptions: that an individual’s experience is communicable, and that personal experience occurs within a public context. Even the most private and intimate experiences occur within the horizon of public understanding’...|$|E
40|$|This thesis utilises {{the direct}} {{memories}} of combat veterans to, explore {{the importance of}} issues such as culture and combat arena and role {{to the experience of}} combat and killing. By utilising oral history, in conjunction with retrospective memoirs and contemporary documentary sources, I have compiled and collated a variety of experience in order to illustrate how war impacts at the personal level, and the social bonds and processes that become essential in combat. The thesis explores the role of men in combat, how they related to the act of killing, and how that experience differed in various combat arenas, be it land, sea or air. It is a comparative study of the social and cultural forces present in the British armed forces, and how they mediated and dictated the combat and killing, by comparing the experiences of soldiers, sailors and airmen. The variety of experience has allowed one to analyse and identify salient trends in military culture, and the long-term consequences and enduring nature of these aspects of military life on the individual. The conflict analysed in this study is the Falklands War of 1982. While short in duration, as the last war fought by the British outside of an international coalition, it was a truly British conflict, and as such the attitudes and reactions to the experience of war were not clouded by external cultures. It also involved all three branches of the armed forces in direct combat, providing the opportunity to analyse how combat environments and weapons <b>shape</b> <b>experience.</b> Significantly, the war was also fought by professionals, who had joined the military in a time of peace. While considerable work has been done in analysing combat experience, it is predominately dedicated to the First and Second World Wars, instances where the majority of participants were civilians in uniform. Yet the experiences of professional servicemen at war were remarkably different and merit further study. This dissertation seeks to continue the trend of analysis of individual combat experience, but in contrast this research seeks to place the experience of the professional British serviceman in its proper context, alongside his historical predecessor, in order to help chart how the cultural responses to combat have changed over the twentieth century for those who have experienced it in all of the combat arenas.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{two main}} sections. The first section, comprising Chapters 2 and 3, addresses the methodological problems with seeking to understand Buddhist ethics through categorizing {{it into a}} Western ethical system. Since Buddhist ethics has often been interpreted as either a type of consequentialism or a type of virtue ethics, Chapter 2 is devoted to addressing the problems with a consequentialist reading of Buddhist ethics, and Chapter 3 to highlighting the structural differences that inhibit a faithful reading of Buddhist ethics {{as a type of}} virtue ethics. In the second section, consisting of of Chapters 4 and 5, I argue that when Buddhist ethical writings are considered on their own terms, there emerges a recurrent and dominant emphasis on the phenomenology of moral acts. Chapter 4 draws on Buddhist psychological texts to elucidate the Buddhist explanation of the foundational components of experience {{and the way in which}} these are ethically significant. Chapter 5 looks at Buddhist ethical texts to demonstrate that mental states are prioritized in ethical discussions and that both the Buddhist moral problem and moral solution pertain to the way we see and experience the world. Since Goodman has argued most extensively that Buddhist ethics is best understood as a kind of universalist consequentialism, Chapter 2 begins with an examination of Goodman’s methodology and arguments. Goodman identifies an agent-neutral approach as the central characteristic of a consequentialist ethical system, the characteristic that differentiates it from systems of virtue ethics, which are agent-relative. He interprets themes within Buddhist texts such as the promotion of self-sacrifice and the dedication of merit as evidence of the agent neutral approach of a consequentialist ethical system. I aim to demonstrate that these examples should be read as moral instructions for the agent’s motivational state rather than evidence supporting that Buddhist ethics is a type of consequentialism. In doing so, I intend to demonstrate that Goodman’s methodology of confining the inquiry into Buddhist ethics to its categorization as one of two Western ethical systems based on the criteria of Western ethical thought limits the possibility for a comprehensive understanding of Buddhist ethics. I then turn to arguments made by Goodman, Williams, and Siderits specifically in regard to Śāntideva. These scholars each contend that Śāntideva’s metaphysical position commits him to a universalist consequentialist ethics and point to his discussion of the ethical meditative practice of equalizing and exchanging self and other in Chapter 8 of How to Lead an Awakened Life as evidence. I will contest the claim that the Buddhist doctrine of selflessness entails the agent neutrality that characterizes consequentialism. I will argue that Śāntideva’s use of the metaphysical doctrine of selflessness within an ethical context does not aim to demonstrate a moral obligation based on agent neutrality, and thus is not a form of consequentialism. Instead, I will argue that he uses it to effect a psychological shift in the agent for the purposes of moral development. I argue that, in Chapter 8, Śāntideva is simply pointing out the irrationality of distinguishing pains based on their owners, together with the possibility for taking on the concerns of others as our own, because of the malleable boundaries of the conception of identity. I contend that, in this section of his treatise, Śāntideva is instructing the practitioner to harness the powerful psychological forces that already exist within our experience, such as the aversion to our own pain or attachment to our future selves, and extend their scope through expanding the conception of self, transforming our experience and moral conduct from one motivated by selfconcern to one centered on concern for others. After arguing that the emphasis on the mental domain of the agent fatally undermines a consequentialist interpretation of Buddhist ethics, in Chapter 3, I address the virtue ethics interpretation. While it might seem that an emphasis on the mental states of the agent could accord with a form of virtue ethics, I argue that there are structural differences between the two systems that preclude this classification. It is Keown who offers the most detailed account of this position, so using his arguments I engage in a comparative analysis of the structures of virtue ethics and Buddhist ethics. I identify five critical structural features of virtue ethics and argue that they do not characterize Buddhist ethics. I will argue that neither the Buddhist account of the relationship between virtues and nirvana nor the Buddhist explanation of moral choice and agency are consistent with a virtue ethics. In the second section, I begin the inquiry into Buddhist ethical writings on their own terms. To argue that moral phenomenology is foundational to Buddhist ethical thought, in Chapter 4, I turn first to the Buddhist psychological treatises of Vasubandhu, Asaṅga, and Buddhaghosa, highlighting the fundamental mental processes that <b>shape</b> <b>experience</b> with the intention of demonstrating that these Buddhist psychology texts provide the foundation for understanding that the way we construct our experience of the world is ethically significant. In Chapter 5, I turn to Mahāyāna Buddhist ethical texts to demonstrate how this psychological foundation is used in these texts in the formulation of a moral phenomenology. I use primarily the works of Āryadeva and Śāntideva; I call attention to the fact that these texts prioritize mental states in their ethical discussions and present a division of two types of moral perception: the confused way of seeing the world that is characterized by vice and the accurate way of seeing the world that characterizes virtue. These texts identify the moral problem with confusion about reality, and the moral solution as a transformation of the way we experience the world through the cultivation of a metaphysically accurate understanding. In the final stage of making the case for moral phenomenology as central to Buddhist ethical thought, I turn to the Prajñāparamitā literature, focusing on the Heart Sūtra and Diamond Cutter Sūtra to demonstrate that in these sūtras we can find the seeds of the ethical system of Āryadeva and Śāntideva since they also stress the importance of a transformation of vision as the basis of ethical activity...|$|E
