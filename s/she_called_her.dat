500|$|Her {{success was}} {{sometimes}} clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists. Heyer {{chose not to}} file lawsuits against the suspected literary thieves, but tried multiple ways of minimizing her tax liability. Forced to put aside the works <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> [...] "magnum opus" [...] (a trilogy covering the House of Lancaster) to write more commercially successful works, Heyer eventually created a limited liability company to administer the rights to her novels. She was accused several times of providing an overly large salary for herself, and in 1966 she sold {{the company and the}} rights to seventeen of her novels to Booker-McConnell. Heyer continued writing until her death in July 1974. At that time, 48 of her novels were still in print; her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously.|$|E

Nadhiya was selected to play Asha Sarath's role of a police officer from the original.

500|$|In 1931, Heyer {{released}} The Conqueror, {{her first}} novel of historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events. She researched the life of William the Conqueror thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England.

The novel's publication coincided {{with the birth of}} her only child, Richard George Rougier, whom <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> [...] "most notable (indeed peerless) work". Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting Footsteps in the Dark, saying [...] "This work, published simultaneously with my son... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while I was, as any Regency character would have said, increasing. One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in it, and I do not claim it as a Major Work." ...|$|E
