The hydrogen activation is considered the rate determining step for the overall hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction. Understanding the hydrogen activation thermodynamically is important to determine the energy required for the hydrogen activation on the Co 9 S 8 /MoS 2 catalyst interface. The <b>stacking</b> <b>height</b> dependency and catalytic activity on the catalyst sites were found by calculating the transition states and energy of barrier for the hydrogen activation via linear synchronous transit and quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) methods integrated in a density functional theory (DFT) program such as DMol(3).
