This study formulates {{a model for the}} formation and evolution of three-dimensional longshore sand ridges on the continental shelf. The model is based on the interaction of interfacial, weakly nonlinear waves in a stratified ocean with the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottom</b> topography. 1 1 Introduction Longshore sand ridges are underwater barlike features composed of loose granular sediment. Sand ridges hundreds of meters long and up to a few meters high are usually found in groups, arranged in more or less parallel rows separated from each other by hundreds of meters oriented normal or at some small angle to the direction in which the overlying water waves propagate [McBride & Moslow 1991]. Shallow-water, weakly nonlinear interfacial waves appear as highly coherent groups having well-defined wavelength and are observed propagating shoreward on a density stratification, such as [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Species {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} marine benthic communities from La Herradura (Alboran Sea, western Mediterranean) are described to characterise its rocky and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> bionomically. Rocky bottoms were studied by means of several underwater transects and soft bottoms with fixed stations along a bathymetric gradient. The study of the floristic and faunistic composition of the rocky benthic communities highlights depth as the main axis of variation. Factorial Correspondence Analysis segregates deep-water communities below 25 m depth (circalittoral communities) from shallower communities (axis I), and communities thriving between 5 and 25 m depth (lower infralittoral communities) from communities thriving {{close to the surface}} (shallow infralittoral communities) (axis II). The study of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> also suggests that depth, together with physical sedimentary properties, is the main axis of variation in species distribution. Floristic and faunistic records show the particular composition of La Herradura benthic communities, compared to Mediterranean and Atlantic ones. Mixing of Mediterranean and Atlantic waters, together with deep water upwelling episodes typical of this area, probably determine the peculiar composition of the benthic communitie...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of sediment {{in the mouth}} of Villaviciosa estuary (NW Spain) is becoming an obstaclefor the safe navigation in this estuary. One sector of its outer inlet is characterised by a broad shoal linkedwith a longshore bar of a beach, whose erosion is causing the silting of this area. On this basis, this paperaims to describe the processes that occurred in {{the lower part of the}} estuary due to the anthropogenicactivities in the channel and inlet. For this purpose, several measurements were made in the watercolumn and in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> to characterise the processes that occur in this area. Based onthese results, a dynamic and morpho-sedimentary model was developed to examine the interactionsbetween the lower estuary and the exposed part of the confining barrier beach, which allows to establishthe evolutionary trends of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> linked to the marina of El Puntal. Different managementmeasures are carried out to reduce the impact of the sediment accumulation on the navigability, such asperiodically dredging in the inlet of the estuary, and the subsequent dumping of the sediments in areasnear to the closure depth.

These data were used for developing multiple regression models with substrate types and SSS data to interpret the expansion of Dreissena assemblages across the central and western basins of Lake Erie from 1994 to 1998. The 1994 – 1996 GIS model predicted the 1997 SSS measurements of Dreissena coverage correctly in 84 % of the cases (n 5 50). Similarly, the 1994 – 1997 GIS model predicted the 1998 SSS measurements of Dreissena coverage correctly in 80 % of the cases (n 5 20). These models indicated that Dreissena coverage ranged from, 1 % on muds in 1994 to 67 % on sands and gravels in 1997. Based on all of the substrates, the 1994 – 1997 model indicates that Dreissena beds have been expanding since 1994 at 1, 000 6 6 km 2 yr 21 and presently occupy 5, 484 6 32 km 2 of the 25, 734 km 2 <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottom</b> of Lake Erie.

40|$|The <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> off {{the northeastern}} {{coast of the}} Maltese Islands are {{important}} inshore fishing grounds. Between depths of 45 m and 80 m, these bottoms are characterized by accumulations of unattached calcareous rhodophytes, forming maerl beds. The complex structure of these free-living thalli (rhodoliths) introduces heterogeneity to the otherwise homogenous <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms,</b> thus increasing biotic diversity. Maerl deposits may take hundreds of years to accumulate and their development is strongly correlated with the current and sedimentary regimes and with bottom disturbance, making such beds susceptible to anthropogenic disruption. Two fishing techniques in particular used locally may {{have an impact on}} maerl bottoms: parit fishing (bottom-set gill-nets) and bottom trawling using an otter trawl. We investigated the effect of the former by experimental fishing on maerl, and that of the latter by studying rhodolith structure, sediment granulometry, and benthic biodiversity of a 20 km 2 maerl bed, part of which is regularly trawled. Parit fishing may remove the larger rhodoliths but its impact depends greatly on the strength of the bottom current. The trawled site had more abundant rhodoliths and coarser sediments than the non- trawled site, but a lower sediment organic content. Rhodolith morphology was also different at the two sites. Both sites had a high species richness but low abundance and biomass. Differences in species composition were also noted. These results are discussed in relation to the different environmental characteristics of the two sites, including the role of disturbance, but the relative importance of anthropic activities and natural perturbations is not yet clear. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Crab and dredge samples were {{collected}} from depths of 21 - 75 tn from an area of approximately 48 km 2 off Comino, Mellieha Bay and St. Paul's Bay. Below ctr. 40 m the bottorn was predominantly sandy with meadows of Posidonia oceanica, giving way to bare sand it 1 the lower infralittoral. Between 45 rn and 75 r 11, the bottom consisted of organogenic gravel with abundunt free-living culcureous rhodophytes, predominantly the corallines Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides. Such bot~oms, known as maerl, have not been reported previously from the Maltese Islands. 19 species of macroalgae, I phanerogam, and 108 species of macrofaunu were recorded, the bulk of these from the maerl bottom. An additional 122 species of molluscs occurred as etnpty shells. Maerl bottoms support a high species richness, even if abundance is low.

These results suggest that movements between the two habitats are much more frequent than suggested in previous studies. In the coastal food web, two main trophic compartments were identified according to their organic matter source: one based on plankton and seaweeds (rocky habitats), and one based on sedimentary particulate organic matter (sandy bottoms). By means of the model of Phillips and Gregg (2003), it was found that juveniles of Maja brachydactyla from both habitats consumed approximately two thirds of the preys in rocky habitats and one third in sedimentary habitats.

Coralline algae produce growth bands with a morphology and chemistry that record environmental variation. Rhodoliths are hard but often fragile, and growth rates are only {{on the order of}} mm/yr. The hard, complex structure of living beds provides habitats for numerous associated species not found on otherwise entirely <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms.</b> Beds are degraded locally by dredging and other anthropogenic disturbances, and recovery is slow.

Observations, collections, and experiments by divers have revolutionized taxonomic studies by allowing comprehensive, detailed collection and by showing the large effects of the environment on rhodolith morphology.

These are firstly seabed type, topography and exposure, but in the more inshore areas also include water transparency, salinity, temperature etc. Some relations have been established in a top-down approach between adequate combinations of these variables and the higher levels of the Eunis (European Nature Information System) habitat classification which is currently being used to harmonise seabed habitat mapping throughout Europe. These levels have {{been referred to as}} "Marine landscapes", as they are aggregations of a number of lower Eunis habitats from levels 4 to 6. More elaborate variables that are thought to have a bearing on habitat types can be computed from the initial basic ones through comprehensive use of GIS functions. The depth provides slope and orientation. An aggregation of currents and wave action on the seabed provides exposure. Sediment grain size along with currents and slopes allow bedforms on <b>sedimentary</b> <b>bottoms</b> to be predicted. Adequate binning of these quantities and their cross-tabulation leads to a number of landscape types which usually pertain to level 3, but also 4 at times. That raises the question: to which extent could assimilating of biological samples (by way of, e. g., a point–to-polygon method) allow a holistic habitat map at a lower typology level to be produced? The notion of marine landscape can be further exploited to describe any particular habitat, provided that the distribution laws of this habitat with respect to the geophysical parameters are established on the basis of adequate field data sets. This is a bottom-up approach of habitat modelling adapted to mapping individual priority habitats for which field samples are available. ...|$|R

The main organisms that constitute the diet of spider crab juveniles in rocky and sandy habitats and the different organic matter sources in coastal food webs were analysed too. The isotopic ratios of C and N did not show any difference between habitats. The use of carapace colour and epibiosis {{as an indicator of}} habitat use was not supported by our data. These results suggest much more frequent movements between both types of habitats than those suggested by former studies (carried out using behavioural observations and sampling distributions) that hypothesized seasonal and ontogenetic changes. In the coastal food web, two main trophic compartments were identified according to the organic matter source: one based in plankton and seaweeds, that corresponds, mainly, with rocky habitats, and another based in sedimentary particulated organic matter that correspond with sandy bottoms. The relationships observed between the C and N isotopic ratios and the proportions of lipids and proteins in muscle and hepatopancreas seem to indicate a clear relation between the trophic origin of the food consumed by the spider crab juveniles and its energetic condition, and the individuals that spent more time feeding in sandy areas would show a better energetic condition. Juveniles of Maja brachydactila, independently of the habitat of capture, would consume in average approximately two thirds of the preys in rocky habitats and a third in sedimentary habitats.

A sediment process map of the Northwest African continental margin illustrates the relative roles of different sedimentary processes acting across the entire margin. Fine-grained pelagic and hemipelagic sedimentation is dominant across a large area of the margin, and is considered to result from background <b>sedimentary</b> processes. Alongslope <b>bottom</b> currents smooth and mould the seafloor sediments, and produce bedforms such as erosional furrows, sediment waves and contourite drifts.

The overall distribution of sedimentary facies and morphological elements on the Northwest African margin is characteristic of a fine-grained clastic slope apron. However, the presence of numerous volcanic islands and seamounts along the margin leads to a more complex distribution of sedimentary facies than is accounted for by slope apron models.

On the Gulf of Valencia (GoV) continental slope several intermediate (INL) and bottom (BNL) nepheloid layers were observed, focussed where the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) interacts with the seafloor. Additionally, direct observations of internal waves have been recently recorded on the GoV slope. The present study has the intention to improve the understanding on the hydrographic structure and the regional circulation of the GoV and discuss the relation with the sediment dynamics on the continental slope. Two instrument moorings were deployed from February to June 2011 and from October 2011 to March 2012, on the GoV continental slope, at 450 m and 572 m water depth, respectively. The slope morphology was considered to locate the mooring lines, which were deployed on structural heights to avoid interfering with the bottom trawling activities from the local fishing fleets. Direct observations of current velocity components and temperature allowed detecting several water mass types on the sampled water column. The interface between the LIW and the Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) was observed on the two mooring lines and appear {{to be controlled by}} 5 - 11 day oscillation linked to the passage of topographic waves. Several intrusions of cold Western Mediterranean Intermediate Water (WIW) mass were observed in both records, coinciding with changes in the current speed and direction. During the second deployment, the near-bottom currents were affected by a strong Ekman veering, contributing to the off-margin sediment transport near the sea floor. Observations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) showed multiple increases, up to 5 mg/l, in the near-bottom turbidity throughout the records. However, these SSC variations were poorly correlated with changes in velocity magnitude and direction or with temperature oscillations. In addition, no resuspension peaks were observed linked to the presence of internal waves. These results suggest that other potential sediment resuspension mechanism unrelated with current fluctuations might play an important key in the present-day <b>sedimentary</b> dynamics. <b>Bottom</b> trawling appears to be the most plausible mechanismPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Bottom {{trawling}} {{leads to}} recurrent sediment resuspension events over fishing grounds. Recent {{studies have shown}} how bottom trawling can drive seascape reshaping at large spatial scales and enhance sediment transport in submarine canyons, which subsequently impacts deep-sea ecosystems. Present knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of sediment flows triggered by bottom trawling is based on localized and infrequent measurements whilst a more complete picture of the process is needed. The present work focuses on the modeling of sediment transport and accumulation resulting from trawling activities in La Fonera submarine canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, thus contributing to an improved assessment of trawling impacts. Based on mooring data within a canyon gully, we use an inverse model to retrieve the unknown time series of resuspension due to trawling over the fishing grounds. This resuspension is later used as forcing for the direct problem: we simulate trawling-induced flows through the canyon and provide a 3 D visualization of potential trawling impacts on sediment dynamics, including {{the identification of the}} propagation patterns of sediments resuspended by trawling. Flows coming from shallower fishing grounds are funneled through canyon flank gullies towards the canyon axis, with part of the resuspended sediment reaching the continental rise out of the canyon across the open continental slope. Trawling-induced sediment flows promote sediment accumulation beyond the canyon mouth. Given the wide geographical distribution of bottom trawling, our results have far-reaching implications that go much beyond La Fonera submarine canyon.

40|$|The initial {{transgressive}} phase at the Leg 144 Guyots {{is characterized}} by a typical association of <b>sedimentary</b> facies (from <b>bottom</b> to top) : in situ weathered volcanic rocks; variegated clays, partly pyritic; gray clay, pyritic, homogeneous, or mottled; black clay, peaty, laminated, or bioturbated; and marine argillaceous limestone. Site 877 at Wodejebato Guyot represents the typical development of the initial transgressive phase. The black clay is rich in organic carbon (up to 40 %) and sulfur (up to 25 %). The organic matter is dominantly of terrestrial origin, but it has a significant marine, algal input. The variegated clays consist of a red, lower, sulfur-free part and a blue to gray-blue, sulfur-containing upper part. Organic carbon is not observed in this facies. The sulfur occurs as pyrite and organically bound sulfur. The isotope composition of pyrite varies from - 50 ‰ to 0 %e, which clearly points to bacterial sulfate reduction as the origin for the high sulfur content. Pyrite formation was limited by availability of reactive iron. Because of the origin of the clays as lateritic weathering products, the amount of reactive iron was high, and pyritization proceeded to high values. The following model is suggested for sulfur enrichment in the sediments at the initial transgressive phase: (1) marine flooding of an organic-rich back-reef mangroval swamp; (2) intense bacterial reduction of marine sulfate within the black clay; and (3) downward diffusion of H 2 S into the underlying clays, reduction of red iron oxides to blue-gray iron sulfides, and growth of pyrite...|$|R

Seismic profiles showed that high backscatter areas reflected emergent glacial surfaces while low backscatter areas indicated modern estuarine mud deposition.

40|$|Due to the {{anthropogenic}} {{loading of}} nutrients {{since the beginning}} of the 1900 ’s, eutrophication related hypoxia has become a problem in the Baltic Sea. Efforts have been made to significantly reduce the anthropogenic loading but internal feedback mechanisms in the phosphorus cycle prevent a recovery to pre-industrial conditions. In recent years, several studies have been made into phosphorus cycling in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea to understand and tackle the details of this feedback mechanism. In particular, phosphorus burial in deep basin sediments has recently been better characterized. However, phosphorus burial in sediments close to the halocline has been less intensively studied. This study investigates phosphorus burial in the Gulf of Finland, a shallow and highly eutrophied subbasin of the Baltic Sea. A large area of the sediments of the Gulf of Finland underlie halocline waters, making them susceptible to variable redox conditions. We focus on the impact of inter-decadal redox changes on sedimentary chemistry during the late 20 th century, which strongly influence phosphorus burial. Bulk sediment analysis, pore water and phosphorus speciation was done on three cores taken along a transect near the halocline, where oxic to seasonally hypoxic conditions prevail. Sediment age dating (210 Pb) was done to couple <b>sedimentary</b> signals to <b>bottom</b> water oxygen data over the past 50 years. Furthermore, bottom water oxygen data from the Gulf of Finland were compared to the evolution of bottom water oxygen concentrations in the deep Baltic Proper. By doing so we link the dynamics of the shallow Gulf of Finland to the better studied deep basins of the Baltic Sea. Although Fe-oxide bound P in the surface sediments is high, confirming large seasonal PO 42 - release into the water column due to reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides, we also found high background Fe-P concentrations at these sites, which we interpret as vivianite. We found the rate of vivianite formation to be coupled to Corg¬ concentrations, and therefore peaks in Fe-P occurred during periods of increased hypoxia. Similar background Fe-P concentrations have so far only been found at permanently anoxic sites. Our findings show that, not only in the deep basins but also in shallow areas close to the halocline, Fe-P can be an important long-term burial phase for phosphorus. Hence this is significant information for Baltic Sea nutrient budget calculations and models...|$|R
40|$|The late Quaternary {{sedimentology}} of the Mediterranean {{is controlled}} primarily by fluctuations in global climate and sea level, and by an overriding compressive regime between the Eurasian and African plates. Local variations in this convergence {{have led to}} marked differences in the two regions studied for this thesis, as reflected in their dominant sedimentological processes, sediment distribution and architecture. This present research assesses the sedimentology of the deep (> 3000 m) Herodotus Basin situated between the Nile Cone and the deformed Mediterranean Ridge, focusing on sediment sources and influences on emplacement of the many turbidity current deposits (turbidites) noted in the stratigraphy. Radiocarbon dating and geochemical fingerprinting of turbidite muds has allowed construction of an accurate stratigraphy and correlation for the Herodotus Basin, with the recognition of climatically-controlled cyclic patterns of sedimentation (cyclothems). The Sicilian-Tunisian Platform of the Central Mediterranean has a contrasting late Quaternary sedimentology, due to complex uplift and rotation of the region. Deep troughs (> 1000 m) incise the broad, shallow platform creating smaller, localised <b>sedimentary</b> environments. Climate-controlled <b>bottom</b> currents scour the region, creating sediment drifts (contourites) with heightened sedimentation rates via a process herein termed 'bottom current flow lofiing and interaction with downslope processes. Local volcanism, relatively undisturbed hemipelagic sediment accumulation and sapropel formation provide dateable horizons, allowing calculation of sedimentary budgets and insights into controls and influences on the many sedimentary processes noted in this region. Across the Mediterranean, distinctive, thick turbidites with large volumes (megaturbidites) are noted as acoustically transparent layers (ATLs) on shallow seismic profiles and as graded sand and mud beds in long-piston cores. Of particular interest are 1) the Herodotus Basin Megaturbidite (HBM), dated at approximately 27, 000 years and with a volume {{in the order of}} 400 km 3 and 2) the bi¬ partite Pantelleria Trough Megabed of the Central Mediterranean, emplacing circa 30 km 3 of volcanic and carbonate material approximately 35, 000 years before present. This study analyses these events and other global occurrences of megaturbidites, evaluating their recorded geometries, seismic and sedimentologic characteristics, proposed triggering mechanisms, flow properties and the interaction between sea floor and flow during mega-turbidity current flow. A new classification, using all case studies cited in the geological literature, has been constructed to characterise megaturbidites by their mode of deposition and their association with other mass flow deposits...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the first marine gas hydrate {{drilling}} expedition of Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS- 1) in northern continental slope of the South China Sea revealed a variable distribution of gas hydrates in the Shenhu area. In this study, comparisons between the eight sites with gas-hydrate petroleum system were used to analyze and re-examine hydrate potential. In the Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area, all the sites were located in a suitable low-temperature, high-pressure environment. Biogenic and thermogenic gases contributed {{to the formation of}} hydrates. Gas chimneys and some small-scale faults (or micro-scale fractures) compose the migration pathways for gas-bearing fluids. Between these sites, there are three key differences: the seafloor temperatures and pressures; geothermal gradient and sedimentary conditions. Variations of seafloor temperatures and pressures related to water depths and geothermal gradient would lead to changes in the thickness of gas hydrate stability zones. Although the lithology and grain size of the sediments were similar, two distinct sedimentary units were identified for the first time through seismic interpretation, analysis of deep-water sedimentary processes, and the Cm pattern (plotted one-percentile and median values from grain-size analyses), implying the heterogeneous <b>sedimentary</b> conditions above <b>Bottom</b> Simulating Reflectors (BSRs). Based on the analyses of forming mechanisms and sedimentary processes, these two fine-grained sedimentary units have different physical properties. Fine-grained turbidites (Unit I) with thin-bedded chaotic reflectors at the bottom acted as the host rocks for hydrates; whereas, finegrained sediments related to soft-sediment deformation (Unit II) characterized by thick continuous reflectors at the top would serve as regional homogeneous caprocks. Low-flux methane that migrated upwards along chimneys could be enriched preferentially in fine-grained turbidites, resulting in the formation of hydrates within Unit I. However, overlying fine-grained sediments related to soft-sediment deformation would hinder the further migration of gases/fluids, causing the extremely low methane concentration in Unit I. Three of the eight sites with hydrates from recovered core samples were located within sedimentary Unit I, and the other five sites were not. Because, the most significant difference between the eight sites is the nature and type of sedimentary deposits above the BSRs, it is suggested therefore that sedimentary conditions are the crucial factor controlling the formation and occurrence of gas hydrates in the Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area, northern South China Sea...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{sedimentary}} {{architecture and}} characteristics of Antarctic shelves provide clues of past ice sheet advance-retreat cycles and help improve constraints for paleo-ice dynamic models since early glacial periods. A first seismostratigraphic analysis of the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf and slope of West Antarctica reveals insights into the structural architecture of the continental margin and shows stages of sediment deposition, erosion and transport history from pre-glacial times to early glaciation and {{to the most recent}} glacial periods. The shelf geometry consists of a large pre- and syn-rift basin in the middle shelf region between outcropping basement of the inner shelf and basement ridges and highs beneath the outer shelf. A middle shelf sub-basin exists which may have formed as a result of motion along an early West Antarctic Rift System branch. At least 4 km of pre-glacial strata has been eroded from the present inner shelf and coastal hinterland by ice sheet advances since the onset of glaciation. Some of the eroded sediments were deposited as a progradational wedge extending the outer shelf by 25 to 65 km oceanward of the pre-glacial shelf-break. Comparing the observed seismic characteristics with those of other Antarctic shelf sequences, we assign an Early Cretaceous age for <b>bottom</b> <b>sedimentary</b> unit ASS- 1, a Late Cretaceous to Oligocene age for unit ASS- 2, an Early to Mid-Miocene age for unit ASS- 3, a Mid-Miocene age for unit ASS- 4, a Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age for unit ASS- 5, and a Pliocene to Pleistocene age for the top unit ASS- 6. The survival of buried grounding zone wedges in the upper part of unit ASS- 5 of the outer shelf is consistent with the onset of a long warming phase and a retreated ice sheet in the early Pliocene as observed for the Ross Sea shelf and reconstructed from paleo-ice sheet models. Our data also reveal that the paleo-ice flow paths of the central Pine Island Trough system have remained stationary across the middle and outer shelf since early glacial advances. This study and its stratigraphic constraints will serve as a basis for future drilling operations required for an improved understanding of processes and mechanisms leading to West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreats, such as the rapid ice retreat presently observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. ...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current {{is one of}} the key {{components}} of ocean circulation, and a knowledge of its isotopic composition is essential to the use of neodymium (Nd) isotopes to trace circulation now and in the past. Here we present 57 new analyses of the Nd isotopic composition of the water column in the eastern Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, documenting both the variation in three dimensions as well as the controls on that variability. Nd isotopic data for the middle of the water column demonstrate the homogeneity of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) at an εNd value of − 8. 7 ± 0. 1. This homogeneity reflects the large Nd inventory in the ACC flow, and the degree to which this large inventory buffers the Nd characteristics of the ACC against extra-oceanic inputs from the continents, either via dust from the atmosphere or through dissolved and particulate material from the adjacent continents. CDW upwells onto the Amundsen Sea shelf and, even here, its Nd isotopic properties are close to conserved in the middle of the water column (εNd = − 8. 0 ± 0. 2 at 600 m). At the top and bottom of the shelf water column, however, the Nd isotopic and concentration characteristics are strongly modified (to εNd as high as − 4. 5). All the shelf water column data obtained here are consistent with net addition of Nd to bottom and surface waters with a contrasting isotopic composition that is matched by local sediment (εNd = − 1 to − 2), followed by conservative mixing of that water into intermediate levels. Mixing with this shelf composition also leads to significant modification of open ocean surface water (Nd isotopic shift around 1 epsilon unit) in the ACC as it flows eastwards. Modification of open ocean bottom waters by interaction with sediment is more subtle, but there is marked non-conservative removal of Nd accompanied by significant changes in isotopic composition in waters within 10 m of the seabed. The new data demonstrate the conservativity of Nd in the middle water column, especially for such large volume flows as the ACC. Though boundary exchange-type processes are clearly important in this region, and their imprint on both the shelf and open-ocean surface water is significant, there is no observable impact on the main core of CDW. This finding augurs well for the use of Nd isotopes as a conservative water-mass tracer now and in the past. For example, these data suggest that the only likely control on the temporal variability of southern-component deep water exported northwards into the Atlantic through the last glacial cycle is variations in the input of North Atlantic Deep Water in the Atlantic sector. On the other hand, the data also suggest caution in the use of <b>sedimentary</b> archives of <b>bottom</b> water Nd as records of deep water Nd isotopic characteristics, given the dramatic modification of bottom waters on the shelf and the more subtly non-conservative behaviour in the open ocean bottom water that are both suggestive of modification of the Nd characteristics of bottom waters by sediment...|$|R
