Many of Henson's co-stars and directors from Sesame Street, the Muppets and other works also shared their thoughts on Henson's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire started}} at about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1845, {{on the third}} floor of J. L. Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> to {{adjoining}} buildings. The City Hall alarm bell began to ring at about 3:00 a.m., summoning firefighters.|$|E

5|$|Word of the {{incident}} <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> upon Chesapeakes return to Norfolk, where the British squadron that included Leopard was provisioning. Mobs of angry citizens destroyed twohundred water casks destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened. President Jefferson recalled all USwarships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation: all British warships were banned from entering USports and those already in port were to depart. The incident {{eventually led to the}} Embargo Act of 1807.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death <b>spread</b> <b>quickly,</b> and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Aggressive {{lymphoma}} {{is a type}} of lymphoma {{that grows}} and <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly,</b> and has severe symptoms. It is seen frequently in patients who are HIV-positive (AIDS-related lymphoma). Also called intermediate-grade lymphoma and high-grade lymphoma.|$|R

5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to <b>spread</b> <b>quickly.</b> The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's death {{triggered}} a global outpouring of grief. The news <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> online, causing websites {{to slow down}} and crash from user overload, and putting unprecedented strain on services and websites including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Overall, web traffic ranged from 11% to at least 20% higher than normal. MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos. Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, airing hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.|$|E
5|$|Netball {{emerged from}} early {{versions}} of basketball and evolved {{into its own}} sport {{as the number of}} women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets. Naismith's game <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women. The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Mortality can {{be up to}} 100%, {{with death}} {{occurring}} around 18-30 days after the initial attachment of infected ticks, because the incubation required is around 10-25 days, and the parasite <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> and is rather aggressive.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{religion}} is Buddhism. Roman Catholicism has considerable influence {{in education and}} social welfare in Macau. However, adherents only count for about six percent of the population. Protestantism is <b>spreading</b> <b>quickly,</b> especially among the younger demographic groups.|$|R
5|$|News of the {{incident}} <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> through Japan. The following day the television station that had originated the lone broadcast of that episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese people, suspended the program, {{and said it would}} investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers from Atago Police stations were ordered by Japan's National Police Agency to question the anime's producers about the show's contents and production process. An emergency meeting was held by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in which the case was discussed with experts and information collected from hospitals. Video retailers all over Japan removed the Pokémon anime from their rental shelves.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story <b>spread</b> <b>quickly.</b> Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
50|$|Although the shallow-rooting {{tendency}} of dewberry makes it susceptible to damage by fire, it <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> over a site by rhizomes, and {{can become an}} important component of ground cover after low and moderate-intensity disturbance, thereby reducing soil water loss from evaporation.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} plant {{self-incompatibility}} alleles. When two plants {{share the same}} incompatibility allele, {{they are unable to}} mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> through the population [...]|$|R
50|$|A tossed {{cigarette}} {{from a patient}} causes fire to break out after midnight in a multi-storey hospital, cutting the top floors off from escape. It <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> and despite the prompt action of the Fire Department, lack of fire safety training results in several fatalities.|$|R
5|$|The fire <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> in {{the high}} wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before {{he had to get}} out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus, which {{includes}} all extant equines, {{is believed to}} have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> into the Old World, with the similarly aged E. livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern equines (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles <b>spread</b> <b>quickly</b> in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
50|$|Cancer is {{very common}} in hedgehogs. The most common is {{squamous}} cell carcinoma. Squamous cell <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> from the bone to the organs in hedgehogs, unlike in humans. Surgery to remove the tumors is rare because it would result in removing too much bone structure.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 water soldier {{plant was}} {{reported}} found {{along the shore}} line. The plant is imported from Europe. It is a common pond plant, purchased in garden stores. It has sharp leaves and is a possible concern as the plant <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly</b> using asexual reproduction.|$|R
50|$|This plant prefers partial or full {{exposure}} to sunlight. Allium oleraceum tends {{to grow in}} slightly moist, heavy clay-like soil, although it will grow just fine in other soils. This plant <b>spreads</b> <b>quickly,</b> much like a weed, and {{can be difficult to}} get rid of.|$|R
