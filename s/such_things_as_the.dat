5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, {{the amount of water}} coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of}} the country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

The new system involves a six-tier scale to indicating <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> level of risk and activity of the fire. This standardised Fire Danger Rating (FDR) was subsequently adopted by all Australian states in late 2009. Every day during the fire season the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecasts an outlook of the Fire Danger Index (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation. On the highest risk days, residents are advised to leave the potentially affected areas.|$|E

Pomeroy of Kansas who four years later in 1884 would seek the White House as the presidential candidate of the American Prohibition National Party. In the 1880 race, the Phelps/Pomeroy ticket garnered only 1,045 votes nationwide. They ran on an eleven-point platform calling for <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> prohibition of alcoholic beverages, the prohibition of all secret lodges, justice for Indians, demanding the Bible be a required text in all educational institutions; and {{the abolition of the}} electoral college.|$|E

A strong-willed and shrewd businessman, de Rothschild amassed a fortune that made him one of the richest men in the world. Although his papers have never been disclosed, evidence suggests that in today's money, de Rothschild's personal fortune (not including the wealth of his other family members) must have been at least five times the fortune accumulated by Bill Gates.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. A thoughtful moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment of <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able to raise questions about Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams came home and moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law. He was also the acting Postmaster at Georgetown, from May 6, 1937, until his death.|$|E
25|$|Competitiveness between {{boats in}} the class is {{maintained}} by requiring the boats to be {{in compliance with the}} 12 Metre formula. Designers and builders are required to take into account <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> sail area, the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth (the measurement around the boat from one sideboard, under the keel, and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side). The measurements are then weighted in the formula. For example, the present formula takes the square root of the sail area rather than total area. The combination of weighted measurements must be {{less than or equal to}} 12 metres. Designers are free to change any of the component variables, as well as other details, such as the size of the rudder and keel, so long as the corresponding changes elsewhere produce an ultimate sum of 12 metres and the resulting boat is both seaworthy and safe. Though disparity between boats are minimized by the rule, enough variation exists so that races are as much about design and construction as they are about seamanship and tactics.|$|E

500|$|The {{carbon in}} typical steel alloys may {{contribute}} up to 2.14% of its weight. Varying {{the amount of}} carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. [...] These qualities include <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hardness, quenching behavior, need for annealing, tempering behavior, yield strength, and tensile strength of the resulting steel.
