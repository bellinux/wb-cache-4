With an export oriented economic model, highly supported by FDI, mostly from developed countries, China is, since 2002, the most attractive developing country for FDI flows, both at short and long terms, becoming not only the world's factory, but also its number one exporter, after surpassing Germany in 2009. With the biggest current account <b>surplus</b> <b>balance,</b> China has been able to achieve a foreign exchange reserve of US$ 2. 2 trillion [...] the world's largest reserve currency. Around 50 % of this huge reserve is being applied in American bonds, while the remaining supports Chinese health and social security systems, Chinese banks' solvability, internationalization of the Chinese economy, investment in geostrategic positioning to guarantee energy independence and making foreign aid available to other developing countries. During 2008 's global crisis, China was able to resist better than the major world economies even benefitting from this downturn to implement policies to reduce its economic imbalances. One of these imbalances is the gap between Chinese FDI and OFDI which is now progressively narrowing. In fact, in the near future, OFDI is expected even be larger than FDI. Mostly two types of Chinese OFDI can be distinguished: trade-oriented investment and resource-seeking investment. Governmental backing, including official developments assistance (ODA) has been crucial for the resource-seeking investment. Although the Chinese investment is nowadays more oriented to mature economies, its bulk is mainly directed to the other developing countries mainly to Latin American countries and now also to African countries. Following the Beijing Consensus, Chinese planners are pushing partnerships with African countries and within those, the Chinese government identified one strategic group worth to cooperate and invest, the Portuguese Speaking African Countries which are linked through a network of language and culture between themselves and also to other geostrategic economic spaces; to Europe via Portugal, to Latin America via Brazil and to Asia via Macau.

This {{dissertation}} {{on the environmental}} liability of agriculture first provides information about the circumstances and specific nature of the agriculture as an occupation and as elementary production, {{as well as its}} connection to certain basic human rights, and generally looks at rural law and environmental law and their intertwined relationship in current agricultural policy in addition to the relationship between agri-environmental liabilities and property rights. The study then concentrates on the legislative environmental directing of agricultural activities especially within cultivation and the various relevant principles represented in the agri-environmental sector of law. The last part is comprised of the main results of the study with some de lege ferenda proposals for addressing obvious shortcomings in the efficiency of current agri-environmental legislation. The dissertation adopts a broad concept of agricultural environmental liability that includes both compulsory and voluntary based legal obligations to prevent and minimize pollution, and to compensate for environmental damage or restore contaminated or polluted environments. Elements of the environment subjected to pollution include surface and ground water and soil, as well as air and even climate. Agricultural activities causing pollution are mainly fertilizing, manure spreading and storage, cattle pasturing and the use of pesticides. For watercourses it is mostly a diffuse type of pollution, appearing as eutrophication, and for ground water and soil it is usually point source pollution and contamination. Environmental protection has since 1980 s and 1990 s significantly modified the Common Agricultural Popolicy (CAP) of the EU and its legislation. The CAP was strongly shaped by the Uruguay Round with its WTO Agricultural Agreement, and is still {{under the influence of the}} prolonged Doha Round, which aims to renegotiate that agreement for the further liberalization of trade. The latest reform of the CAP created the Single Payment System (SPS) by Council Regulation (EC) 1782 / 2003, with the aim of decoupling the CAP supports from production. The SPS includes additional aid conditions the purpose of which are to ensure that fields are kept in good condition with regard to the environment and further cultivation. In addition, special agri-environmental supports – also of a voluntary nature, though based on legislation – have alongside LFA aid and special national support allowed to Finland after joining the EU in 1995, played a central role in the national adaptation to the CAP. The compulsory agri-environmental legislation, based on the targets and principles of article 174 of the EC Treaty, is mainly comprised of the measures of Directive 91 / 676 /EEC that concerns the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. It is implemented nowadays in pursuance to the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000, EPA) by Government Decree 931 / 2000, which stipulates that the actions in it, including instructions for good agricultural practices, refer to the Nitrate Directive´s action programme. The programme is being put into effect throughout the country. Finland thus chose to free itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones in accordance with article 3 (5) article of the directive. The provisions of the Nitrate Decree concern the volume and other conditions for storage of animal manure, and the use of manure and nitrogen fertilizers having seasonal, areal and quantitative restrictions. For instance, animal manure may be applied on a field as fertilizer equivalent to a maximum of 170 kg/ha/year of nitrogen. The use of maximum amounts of nitrogen on fields as fertilizer, contained in mineral fertilizer, animal manure and organic fertilizers, is allowed, for example, as follows: for grassland and pasture, silage and horticultural plants, 250 kg of nitrogen/ha/year (highest); for winter cereals, up to 200 kg of nitrogen/ha/year, of which normally 30 kg are used in the autumn and 170 kg in the spring; and for spring cereals, sugar beet, oilseed crops and other crops, up to 170 kg /ha/year. In addition, Annex 3 of the decree makes some special recommendations on procedures related to the use of animal manure. The Nitrate Directive is now connected to the water policy framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (with its planning system and action programmes) which is implemented mainly by the Act on Arrangement of Water Management (1299 / 2004). This system does not hinder the developing and tightening of the rules of the nitrate legislation also separately, if needed. The role of private law measures is restricted in the agricultural sector mainly to the Act of Compensation for Environmental Damage (737 / 1994) and the Adjoining Properties Act (26 / 1920). Both of these are based on objective liability. The principles in the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000) are not understood quite in the same way as the environmental principles in article 174 (2) of the treaty. This particularly concerns the principle of caution and care in section 4. 1. 2 of the act compared to the precautionary principle of the treaty with its heavier weight and larger area of application, as conventionally interpreted in the European Court of Justice. Environmental principles, in any case, work very much towards common goals. From a systematic point of view it would be reasonable in Finnish law to combine the principle of prevention together with that principle of caution and care into a larger main principle, a “principle of prevention and precaution”, for instance. The results from agri-environmental measures in Finland have been insufficient. Although the use of nitrogen fertilizing has generally decreased – the average balance of nitrogen in fields been reduced from 80 kg to 50 kg per hectare and the nitrogen flow potential for watercourses has decreased especially in eastern and middle Finland – the least and most insufficient decrease has occured in the coastal areas, where in many rivers and especially in the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland no reductions in the nitrogen load has been found. The reason is due to national circumstances, the overly high maximum amounts of nitrogen fertilizing allowed in the Nitrate Decree, actually already in the Nitrate Directive, and the fact that Finland by choosing to establish and apply the action programme relating to article 5 of the directive throughout its national territory exempted itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones. Additionally, the Nitrate Directive and Decree do not regulate or directly affect the use of phosphorous fertilizers. Therefore, reaching more concrete results in the protection of watercourses against eutrophication caused by agriculture is left to be managed by the agri-environmental aid scheme, which covers over 90 per cent of all active farms in Finland but has not in this respect been effective enough. Neither the polluter pay- principle and the precautionary principle nor the principle of prevention have sufficiently materialized for Finnish farming in terms of the protection of surface waters. Instead of the polluter pays principle prevails, through the scheme of agri-environmental aid the so-called provider gets principle. On the other hand, the ground water and soil situation is good, thanks to the ground water pollution and soil contamination prohibitions in section 7 and 8 of the EPA, as well as the prohibitions, warnings and measures prescribed for the use of plant protection and bioside products in accordance with the harmonized legislation in these areas. Still, a lack of harmony is noticeable between environmental aid payed on the basis of the “agreements for cultivation of ground water areas” and the groundwater pollution prohibition in the EPA. The recommendations forming part of the Nitrate Decrees regulations should be transformed into regulations. Limits for maximum nitrogen fertilization should be lowered in watercourse zones especially vulnerable to pollution, as well as to those parts of the country from which the heaviest loads still issue into the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland. Conditions for all agri-environmental aid should include more onerous conditions for phosphorous fertilization. The aid should also be based more on agreements tailored and negotiated to fit the activities and special characteristics of each farm. There are also grounds for lowering the limits of livestock installations requiring environmental permits for their establishment or enlargement, and for placing on these permits – in accordance with the principle that damage should as a priority be rectified at the source, and to enhance agricultural structure – the condition of having in one´s possession, by ownership or long-term lease, sufficient field area for the application of manure near enough to the installation. One possible economical measure to alleviate the diffuse pollution into waters could be a payment system that would be based on the arable land area under active cultivation and each farm´s number of livestock and thus on the farm´s estimated yearly <b>surplus</b> <b>balance</b> of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization. In general, it would be reasonable in terms of achieving a more genuine application of the polluter pays principle and also the principles of prevention and precaution to put more weight on using the compulsory legal measures and additional conditions in the CAP as well as national agri-aid instead of special agri-environmental aid. The trend of rising cereal prices, as well as possible increasing demand for other agricultural products, could help in the adoption of these measures. Agri-environmental aids should in the long run be mainly used temporarily and as an incentive during transitional periods for the implementation and adaptation of new and stricter legal environmental obligations...|$|E

The central focus of the paper is on the comparison of two types of fiscal rules: a balanced budget and a target for the primary <b>surplus.</b> <b>Balanced</b> budget rules (or, more generally, numeric ceilings to the overall budget deficit) are criticized because they may dictate higher taxes in periods of weak economic activity. The primary surplus rule, in contrast, has a less pro-cyclical nature, given {{that it does not}} require higher fiscal austerity in periods when the cost of servicing public debt is higher. In a nutshell, it allows a higher degree of tax smoothing. It is not clear, however, if (inevitable) fiscal adjustments should be postponed. These issues are investigated {{in the context of a}} dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that describes an open economy, with capital accumulation, and where nominal rigidities are present. The model shows that previous findings drawn from open economy models—in particular with respect to the characteristics of optimal monetary policy—do not hold once the implications of certain fiscal regimes are taken into account, and once different scenarios concerning the degree of capital mobility are considered.

We extend the earlier studies by applying the Shiller lag model to the first differences of the variables that are subject to a unite root process. The empirical findings support the J-curve effect for Japan and also illustrate that it take 13 quarters before the full effect of an exchange rate change on the trade balance is realized. The results also suggest that in 1985 (I), for example, a once-and for -all real currency appreciation of 36. 2 percent would remove the average quarterly real trade <b>balance</b> <b>surplus</b> of 2. 5 trillion yen in 13 quartets, ceteris paribys.

Political stability has {{an important role in}} determination of healthy of balance of payment than economic freedom. This study focus on selected 10 Asian countries of various income levels and test the factor of political stability and economic freedom in stability of balance of payment by using a simple econometric model with various techniques. Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing balance of payment. Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level of favorable balance of payment. Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve <b>surplus</b> of <b>balance</b> of payment hence exchange rare stability. <b>Surplus</b> of trade <b>balance,</b> foreign direct investment and higher international reserves hence appreciation of Yuan in china mostly depends on its long term political stability under one party political system rather than pure theoretical determination of balance of payment.

40|$|Surface {{nitrogen}} (N) balances for China's {{crop production}} systems were estimated using statistical {{data collected from}} 1980 to 2004 at the national and provincial scale and from 1994 to 1999 at the county level. There was a <b>surplus</b> N <b>balance</b> throughout these periods, but the surplus was nearly stable in recent years. Projections using nonseasonal Box-Jenkins model or exponential models show that the N surplus for the total cultivated land in China was likely to increase from 142. 8 kg ha¿ 1 in 2004 to 168. 6 kg ha¿ 1 in 2015. The N <b>balance</b> <b>surplus</b> in the more developed southeastern provinces was the largest, and was slightly less in the central region, which caused the nitrate {{pollution in the ground}} water. The N surplus was much less in the western and northern provinces because of lower synthetic fertilizer inputs. The region with high N risk includes Beijing Municipality and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, and Shandong provinces for 2002 ¿ 2004. The projections suggested that 15 provinces (or municipalities) in the middle and southeastern part of China except Jiangxi and Shanxi provinces would become the high-risk region by 2015. The level of economic development, transportation, and labor force condition had an important efiect on the N <b>balance</b> <b>surplus</b> at the county level, but the last two factors showed remarkable impact at the provincial level. To decrease the nonpoint pollution (Npp) risk from crop production, the authors suggested to reduce the target level for national grain self-sufficiency to 90 %¿ 95 % and change the regional structure of grain production by moving some of the future grain production from the high Npp risk areas of eastern China to parts of the central and western provinces where the Npp risk was much less...|$|R
40|$|In {{his control}} balance theory Charles Tittle {{maintained}} that under favorable conditions unbalanced control ratios {{will lead to}} different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued {{to depend on the}} degree of the control imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this study examined if different types of control balance ratios were associated with hard and soft drug use. The findings revealed that control <b>balance</b> <b>surpluses</b> and control <b>balance</b> deficits were both related to hard and soft drug use but that these relationships were significantly stronger for hard drug use. Further, provocation and self-control were significant predictors of hard but not soft drug use while drug using peers predicted soft drug use but not hard drug use. Parental drug use, perceptions of risk, and values supportive of illegal behavior predicted both forms of drug use. Results are discussed and directions for further research and theoretical refinement are offered. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a model {{where there}} is {{uncertainty}} about the future power of two ex-ante symmetric elites to appropriate surplus, and ex-ante surplus sharing agreements are not binding. We show that in an oligarchy, the stronger elite appropriates the entire available surplus, whereas a democracy results in a more <b>balanced</b> <b>surplus</b> allocation between the two elites. In a democracy, the newly enfranchised non-elite organize to act collectively, so that the weaker elite can credibly threaten to form a coalition with the organized non-elite against the stronger elite. Such a threat ensures that the more <b>balanced</b> <b>surplus</b> sharing proposal chosen by majority voting is renegotiation-proof. Therefore, sufficiently risk-averse elites unanimously choose democracy {{as a form of}} insurance against future imbalances in relative power. We emphasize that franchise extension to, and low cost of organizing collective political activity for, the non-elite are both necessary features of a democracy. Our formal analysis can account for the stylized facts that emerge from a comparative analysis of Indian and Western European democracie...|$|R

The model is calibrated and simulated for the case of Brazil, a country that since 1999 has targets for inflation and for the primary surplus. The main finding is that a fiscal regime characterized by a target for the primary surplus delivers superior economic performance, a property captured by the shape of the efficient policy frontier.
