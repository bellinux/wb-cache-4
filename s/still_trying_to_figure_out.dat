25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher quality wines, there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> which sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E

Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an [...] "old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others" [...] for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying [...] "We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat." ...|$|E

The disguises of Oswald and the girl beagle, however, fail to keep them covered for long as their backs are partially exposed. The wolf notices this and goes after them.|$|R

While Mugi and Yuu <b>still</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how <b>to</b> advance their relationship they see their friends hooking up: Sayuri gets married, Tetsu and Aoi agree to sign a marriage certificate, and even Mako and Mugi's father sign one.|$|R
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

50|$|As Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a {{complete}} free {{run of the}} mansion and is therefore usually {{the only one with}} total knowledge {{of what is going on}} in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with violin noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks.|$|R
2500|$|NME blogged {{that the}} song's most {{significant}} lyric read, [...] "I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy", while {{stating that the}} accompanying music video may be produced solely by Del Rey, as the videos for [...] "Carmen" [...] and [...] "Video Games" [...] were. In a separate review for the same publication, Eve Barlow was critical of the song, writing that Del Rey sounded like [...] "an oversexed frog being dragged against a washboard." [...] Pitchfork Media opined aforementioned lyric was a rare moment of raw emotion by Del Rey. Billboard wrote: [...] "Ride' is a long, dreamy ballad that swells into full view during the chorus, when the singer declares, 'Been trying' hard not to get into trouble/But I, I've got a war in my mind… so I just ride." [...] MTV called [...] "Ride" [...] a [...] "slow burn" [...] and [...] "as mellow and languorous...as on her debut." [...] Another MTV review said: [...] "On 'Ride,' Rey sings what she knows best: loneliness, some daddy issues and day-drinking. All of this is probably a metaphor for something, but honestly, we’re <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what those 'Born To Die' tigers mean." [...] A third review by MTV dubbed the single the number one [...] "Must Hear" [...] song of the week, saying, [...] "Heaven is truly a place on Earth with you, Miss Lana." [...] Similarities were drawn between [...] "Ride" [...] and work by The Killers frontman, Brandon Flowers, on his solo debut, Flamingo.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, [...] "he flying {{action has}} a casual flip buoyancy, {{and the movie}} does get you rooting for Peter. The appeal of this {{particular}} Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, and he keeps getting up." [...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's light tone and performances, writing: [...] "Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date. That does come with a caveat that Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man 2 are going for different things and both are great. But, tonally, I just love this incarnation of a Peter Parker who just loves being Spider-Man." [...] The New York Timess Manohla Dargis stated, [...] "Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more of a kid than a man. Even with his budding superpowers, {{he still has the}} impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> this world." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a [...] "mixed" [...] review, praising the stunt work and calling Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture [...] "one of the strongest, most sympathetic villains of the entire series," [...] but criticizing the direction by Jon Watts as [...] "unevenly orchestrated".|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the series}} {{as part of}} the DVD release in 2002, Marc Bernardin for Entertainment Weekly said of season one, that it was [...] "almost hard to believe... just how bad much of it was". He thought that the first season was too similar {{to the end of the}} [...] "cheesy" [...] {{original}} series but said that it [...] "succeeded where it needed to: It introduced viewers to the characters who would carry the torch through six more seasons", and gave it a score of B+. Tor.com reviewer Keith DeCandido was less positive, feeling that it [...] "earned" [...] its reputation as the poorest of The Next Generation seven seasons because [...] "the episodes were uneven, poorly plotted, ineptly scripted, and acted by actors who were <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> their characters out". He gave it a score of 5 out of 10. The season has been given an 80% [...] "fresh" [...] rating by review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.|$|R
