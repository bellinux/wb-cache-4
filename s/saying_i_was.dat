500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Sharp was a jockey from 2004 to 2005, riding {{mostly at}} Canterbury Downs in Minnesota, {{but also in}} West Virginia and Maryland. Sharp was an {{assistant}} trainer to Mike Stidham for four years, and then for three years an assistant to Mike Maker, where he ran Maker's operations in New York, Kentucky and New Orleans. Napravnik and Sharp sometimes competed against each other when a horse Sharp trained was running against one Napravnik was riding, but the two were a trainer-rider team for Ramsey's three-year-old colt, Vicar's In Trouble, who won the Louisiana Derby and contested the 2014 Kentucky Derby. [...] In August 2014, Sharp left Maker's barn to begin an independent horse training stable, with {{the full support of}} both Maker and Napravnik. He scored his first graded stakes win on May 16, 2015 on the Preakness undercard with the Ramsey's horse Sandbar in the Grade III Maryland Sprint Handicap. In 2017, Sharp won the Louisiana Derby with Girvin, a colt who was Sharp's first starter in the 2017 Kentucky Derby. [...] Napravnik was the exercise rider for the colt at Sharp's training stable, and commented, [...] "I thought about putting out something on Twitter [...] [...] [...] <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to ride Girvin, as an April Fool’s joke, but I was worried people might take it seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E

2500|$|As {{of the end}} of the 2017 season, Sabathia has {{acquired}} 25 hits in 124 plate appearances, making him one of the more successful pitchers from a hitting standpoint. On one occasion, Sabathia hit a 440-foot home run on June 21, 2008, off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park. He commented later, saying [...] "I told everybody I was trying to hit homers today because I had two singles last year and everybody was all over me, <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a singles hitter. It was awesome." [...] On July 13, 2008, in his second game with the Brewers, Sabathia hit his second home run of the season off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey, becoming the third pitcher in history to homer in both leagues in the same season and the first since Earl Wilson did it in 1970 with Detroit and San Diego.|$|E

2500|$|An area of {{questioning}} involved {{the book of}} Genesis, including questions such as if Eve was actually created from Adam's rib, where did Cain get his wife, {{and how many people}} lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, [...] "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion." [...] Bryan's declaration in response was, [...] "The reason I am answering is not {{for the benefit of the}} superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby", [...] "Trapped", and [...] "If My Homie Calls".|$|E
2500|$|Zhirinovsky has {{expressed}} {{admiration for the}} 1996 United States presidential election contender Pat Buchanan, referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the United States Congress [...] "Israeli-occupied territory." [...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist." [...] Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky says with tears in his eyes: [...] "All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... And I was able to achieve a certain position in life, even without the support of my father." ...|$|E
