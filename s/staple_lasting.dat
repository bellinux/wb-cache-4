5000|$|In early October 2008 {{after a long}} break Randall and Brammer got {{together}} to write new Solemn Camel Crew material. Introducing 8-bit chip sounds and focusing on an upbeat, up tempo style, Solemn Camel Crew found its feet and its sound. The Citrus Jaboree called Camelnected By Camelepathy [...] "an anthem". The record paid homage to earlier records with track eight [...] "The Ballad of Steven Hawking (Episode 2)" [...] and [...] "Exit Music For A Bear" [...] revisiting older themes. The album became a popular electro <b>staple</b> through <b>Last</b> FM Internet Radio.|$|R
50|$|Initial Boardroom: Trump {{considered}} firing Tana but she defended {{herself of}} her career capabilities that she can work for Trump. And also, she defended herself with her better 2-1 PM record & 9-5 team record than Alex's. Trump grilled Alex of {{how many times he}} won & lost as Project Manager and Alex stated that he won once and lost once. Trump viewed Alex's statement dishonest because he lost twice from being the PM three times. Trump mentioned that he lost from Task 11 (Wearable Technology) & Task 13 (<b>Staples).</b> The <b>last</b> time he won as PM was the PlayStation task from the graffiti billboard, which was eight weeks ago.|$|R
5000|$|The tour {{commenced}} after {{a two-month}} break, for another 21 shows in North America. Tour premieres in this {{leg of the}} tour included the song [...] "Avalanche", while [...] "Coming Back to You" [...] was dropped from the setlists, after having received only little attention on the previous leg, in favor of [...] "If It Be Your Will", a concert <b>staple</b> on the <b>last</b> tour. The Old Ideas songs [...] "Anyhow" [...] and [...] "Show Me the Place" [...] were featured in most shows on this leg, while [...] "Different Sides" [...] was only played twice. [...] "Choices", made famous by George Jones was played {{in honor of his}} recent passing, making it the third cover version being played on this tour. 39 different songs were played on this leg of the tour.|$|R
5000|$|Former {{sex crimes}} {{prosecutor}} Allison Leotta, writing for The Huffington Post, gave the episode a B+. She branded the episode [...] "a gut-wrenching story" [...] and observed that it [...] "showcased the dramatic chops {{that have made}} Law and Order: Special Victims Unit a television <b>staple</b> for the <b>last</b> 14 years. I teared up - twice." [...] However, Leotta chastised the show for cutting [...] "legal corners" [...] in regards to Hoda, who she called [...] "an unlikely revenge kidnapper", and thought that the story about him kidnapping Wyatt out of revenge was [...] "far-fetched". TV Guides Matt Roush gave the episode a positive review, saying it was [...] "less sordid than the SVU norm" [...] and that it benefited from [...] "a tangible understanding of life in this city and how a community (and police department) can be haunted for years by a senseless crime." ...|$|R
2500|$|Raisin Weekend {{celebrates the}} {{relationship}} between the Bejants/Bejantines (First-Year students) and their respective Academic Parents who, in St. Andrews' tradition, guide and mentor them in their time at the University. It is traditionally said that students went up to study with a sack of oatmeal and a barrel of salt-herring as <b>staple</b> foods to <b>last</b> them a term and that therefore anything more exotic was seen as a luxury. In return for the guidance from academic parents a further tradition sprang up of rewarding these [...] "parents" [...] with a pound of raisins. Since the 19th century the giving of raisins was steadily transformed into the giving of a more modern alternative – such as a bottle of wine. In return for the raisins or equivalent present the parents give their [...] "children" [...] a formal receipt – the Raisin Receipt – composed in Latin. Over time this receipt progressively became more elaborate and often humorous. The receipt can be written on anything and is to be carried everywhere by the Bejant/Bejantine on the morning of Raisin Monday until midday.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the food {{security}} situation in three most deprived and poverty-stricken regions in the Northern parts of Ghana and examines how farmer households cope during food insecure periods. The study concludes that although farmers in these regions cultivate purposely for household consumption and sell the surplus, food was not available throughout {{the year in the}} farmer households interviewed. On the average <b>staple</b> foods produced <b>lasted</b> for seven months. Coping mechanisms during months of inadequate household food provision included migration to southern Ghana for wage labor, support from relatives and friends outside the regions, sales from livestock and household valuables as well as reduction of food intake and consumption of less preferred food. Erratic rainfall patterns, high cost of agrochemicals, lack of knowledge on improved farming and post harvest practices as well as lack of production credit and markets for farm produce were some of the constraints militating against increased production and improvement in food security. Measures to remove these constraints will therefore {{go a long way to}} improve the household food security situation in Northern Ghana...|$|R

50|$|By 1943, the estate, {{stripped}} of its furnishings and its lands largely sold off, was virtually bankrupt. Sir Robert Ponsonby Staples' eldest son, Sir Robert George Alexander Staples, 13th Baronet, discovered that {{he could no longer}} afford to live at Lissan. He thus hired a distant relative, Harry Radclyffe-Dolling, as estate manager and settled in England where he could find work. Harry Dolling had the house divided into apartments, and from 1943 until the late 1960s the house was home to over a hundred people living in self-contained flats and tenements carved out of the once elegant public rooms and bedrooms. Many of the remaining contents (including the remnants of John Staples' Library) were sent to Springhill House for safekeeping and were not returned. Sir Robert George Alexander feared that he would be the <b>last</b> <b>Staples</b> owner of Lissan. He had only two daughters as issue. The younger, Elizabeth, had settled with her own family in England whilst the elder, Hazel, (following a spell in the WRNS) had settled into a life on the seas with the Cunard Line as purser on the Queen Mary and RMS Caronia. Neither had any interest in the now crumbling, rundown, and bankrupt estate.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesMinimally {{invasive}} esophagectomy with a chest anastomosis has advantages. We present technical {{lessons learned}} and early results. MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. ResultsOver 10 months, 22 patients (19 men) underwent laparoscopic gastric mobilization, with robotic esophagectomy. All had the thoracic portion completed robotically and 21 had the stomach mobilized laproscopically. All had esophageal cancer and 20 received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. All had R 0 resection {{with a median}} of 18 lymph nodes removed and a blood loss of 40 mL. The first 6 patients underwent a stapled posterior and hand-sewn anterior anastomosis; five of these patients experienced a major morbidity, including 1 anastomotic leak and 1 leak from the gastric <b>staple</b> line. The <b>last</b> 16 patients had a 2 -layered completely hand-sewn anastomosis, {{and there were no}} anastomotic leaks or major morbidities. There were no 30 - or 90 -day mortalities. Technical improvements included placing a loop around the esophagus in the abdomen for third arm retraction, advancing the gastric conduit into the chest using nonrobotic instruments, using 10 -cm nonabsorbable interrupted sutures for the outer layer, and a running 22 -cm long absorbable suture for the inner layer. ConclusionsRobotic thoracic esophagectomy using ports only is feasible, safe, and affords R 0 resection with thorough thoracic lymph node dissection. It also allows the sewing of a 2 -layered chest anastomosis with good early results...|$|R
40|$|The Staples rug is a remarkable, oversized, two-faced Navajo weaving, {{from the}} Transi-tion Period, that survives {{today in the}} Navajo textile {{collection}} at the Museum of North-ern Arizona (MNA) in Flagstaff, Arizona. The rug was woven between 1885 and 1890 {{at the behest of}} pioneering trader Juan Lorenzo Hubbell at Hubbell’s Trading Post in Ganado, Arizona. C. N. Cotton, himself a noted trader and former Hubbell partner, ac-quired the rug and used it on the floor of his dining room in Gallup, New Mexico. Later, Cotton sent the rug to his friend and fellow trader Berton Staples to have a hole repaired. For unknown reasons, Staples retained the rug at his trading post in Coolidge, New Mexico, on the floor of his living room, until his death in 1938. Staples friend, archaeologist Winifred Gladwin, acquired the rug after Staples death for partial settle-ment of incurred debts. The rug was used on the floor of Gladwin’s Gila Pueblo head-quarters in Globe, Arizona. After dissolution of the Gila Pueblo in 1950, Mrs. Gladwin gifted the Staples rug to the Arizona State Museum (ASM) at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In 1958, following the donation of her valuable textile collection to the MNA, Mrs. Gladwin requested that the Staples rug be transferred to Flagstaff to join the rest of her collection. The ASM agreed to permanently loan the Staples rug to MNA and the rug was transferred on February 17, 1959, where it remains today. The <b>Staples</b> rug was <b>last</b> exhibited at the MNA in 2004. ...|$|R
5000|$|The shows {{themselves}} {{followed the}} structure of previous legs on this tour very closely, although noticeably shorter in length and with less songs performed. So featured the first concert in Berlin in 2012 29 songs {{and had to be}} cut short due to curfew contraints, whereas the second concert in 2013 featured only 26 songs, with a full length encore block."Different Sides" [...] and [...] "Show Me the Place" [...] went unplayed during this leg, which meant that the latter one has not been performed on Europe to this date. All three cover songs were played, with [...] "Save the Last Dance for Me" [...] being performed 16 times. [...] "Avalanche", [...] "Night Comes On" [...] and [...] "Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye" [...] were rarities that received only little attention. The song [...] "Anyhow" [...] was performed at a few venues in the United Kingdom.A noticeable change in the setlist occurred during {{the early part of the}} leg when [...] "Anthem" [...] was dropped from the show. It had been a <b>staple</b> during the <b>last</b> tour and this tour until that point, having been performed at all shows, usually closing the first set. It was played only 6 times during the last 23 shows of this leg. Its place was taken over by the song [...] "Lover Lover Lover". Similar to the last tour, Cohen presented a new song to his audience. [...] "I've Got a Secret" [...] had its debut at the second Dublin show, and has been performed twice more after that. It is described as an evolution of the song [...] "Feels So Good", sharing some lines with the song.|$|R
40|$|Africa is {{responsible}} for 96 % of the world's production of food yams; producing almost 30 millions tons a year. Most of the remainder is produced in the Caribbean and Pacific. For 150 million people, yam is, together with cassava and potato, a food <b>staple.</b> In the <b>last</b> thirteen years, production has risen by 17 % ? to the considerable surprise {{of those involved in}} yam research. It had appeared that yam cultivation could not be increased, because the traditional methods employed were believed to be resistant to change, and because it requires much water. The increased production is a response to growing demands from urban consumers. The farmers of the main producer countries (Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo) have changed their cultivation techniques, and switched their selection of varieties to meet demand for a specific yam product, often known as the 'podlet'. This is made by smashing a small yam into pieces. The pieces are dried in the sun and become powdery. The 'podlet' is light and easy to transport, and sells for less than fresh yam. It takes just a small blow to break it up and obtain flour, from which a couscous and biscuits, or, better still, amala may be prepared. Noticeably different from traditional household foufou, amala is leading to the emergence of a much appreciated form of street food in Togo, Nigeria and Benin. Despite its known nutritional value and pharmaceutical properties, yam has not yet been adopted for large-scale treatment in the food processing and agro-pharmaceutical industry. For the last fifteen years, some industrial companies have started to produce a yam conserve and some processed items (crisps, chips, flour and flakes). Many such initiatives have become entangled in the classical problems of transportation and conservation of fresh tubers, and have not gone beyond the experimental phase or pilot processing plant. The export share of yam has fallen to 0. 2 % of its production. Nevertheless, yam has a good future. Important pharmaceutical properties based on diosgenin and related molecules have been long recognised in wild yam. In its cultivated form, it is particularly rich in starch, mineral salts, proteins and vitamins, giving it a nutritional value comparable to cereals. Notwithstanding it's usefulness, there are still many technological barriers to be overcome before the full potential of this tuber can be exploited. Further reading: The Yam. A tropical root crop.
