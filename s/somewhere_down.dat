500|$|Coolbrith {{continued}} {{to write and}} work to support herself. From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard's poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem [...] "At Anchor" [...] to verse submitted by Stoddard's friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having {{to work for a}} living: [...] "The world has not used us well, Ina; California has been ungrateful to us. Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another, don't you think you should be {{at the head of the}} pensioners, and I <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> below?" ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{criticism}} of the game among reviewers is {{the length of the}} game. Eurogamer says that [...] "It's too short", while RPGamer state that [...] "The typical player can fly through the game's six relatively short dungeons in about ten hours". There are also various other complaints from reviewers: IGN claims that the kinstone system is overly repetitive; Nintendo World Report criticises the game's visuals on a Game Boy Player, and RPGamer details the game's low difficulty level as a disadvantage. Despite this, IGN's Craig Harris liked the way that the ability to become tiny had been incorporated to create fresh puzzles in the Zelda series. He continued to comment that [...] "It's an idea that's so well-conceived that I'd love to see worked in the series' 3D designs <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the line".|$|E

500|$|On {{a special}} episode of Raw dubbed Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He {{explained}} to fans {{that he was}} informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury {{and that he had}} to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted {{that he was going to}} have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the line. After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [...] was faking his whole injury.|$|E

Maybe <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the road. The only reason I ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn't really doing anything.

2500|$|In 2010, Grant {{released}} <b>Somewhere</b> <b>Down</b> the Road, {{featuring the}} hit single [...] "Better Than a Hallelujah", which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard Top Christian Songs chart. When {{asked about the}} new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, [...] "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs {{have the ability to}} connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of these}} surviving versions in Middle English is Ipomadon and {{occurs in the}} manuscript Chetham 8009 (Manchester), which contains a unique copy of an 8,891-line tail-rhyme romance, dating in composition to [...] "anywhere between {{the last decade of}} the fourteenth century and the middle of the fifteenth century" [...] This version of the tale follows Hue de Rotelande's story quite closely, although abridging it somewhat by cutting battle details and most of Hue's rather coarse or prosaic narrative intrusions. Composed in a dialect that suggests that it was originally written by a West Yorkshireman in his native West Yorkshire, in the north of England, the manuscript copy itself dates to the late-fifteenth century, is from a London Scriptorium and contains clues that the work from which this copy was taken had itself been re-copied, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the line, in the southwest of England.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like a guy with a deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson went on {{to become}} a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson {{described}} him in Rolling Stone as a man who [...] "could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time" [...] and said [...] "his casket [...] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it." [...] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While The Washington Post was lamenting Nixon's [...] "lonely and depressed" [...] state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that 'f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [...] rancid carcass would be <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.' There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.|$|E

2500|$|His next album, Honkytonkville was {{described}} as [...] "a fiery set of hard country", and was praised [...] "for its mixture of the old Strait with his modern, superstar self." [...] It didn't produce any No.1's for Strait but included the hits [...] "Cowboys Like Us" [...] and a cover of Bruce Robison's [...] "Desperately". His 2004 performance at Reliant Stadium set a new Rodeo attendance record, with 68,679 spectators. That year he issued a Greatest Hits package billed as 50 Number Ones, chronicling the No.1 hits of his career from all charts, starting with [...] "Fool Hearted Memory" [...] and ending with [...] "She'll Leave You With a Smile." [...] A new track, [...] "I Hate Everything", was also included, and became his 51st overall Number One in 2004. The next year, <b>Somewhere</b> <b>Down</b> in Texas arrived, which produced the hit [...] "You'll Be There," [...] marking Strait's first appearance on the Adult Contemporary chart. The next year, he embarked on a tour that included only 18 performances but grossed over $15 million. He attributed this success {{to the fact that}} he and his band are [...] "musically very tight," [...] have a large pool of songs to draw from, and perform those songs very similarly to how they sound on their albums.|$|E
2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} In Your House 13 was between Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Vader over the finish of the Royal Rumble. As per stipulation, {{the winner of}} the Rumble match would face the WWF Champion for his title at WrestleMania 13. At the Royal Rumble event, Shawn Michaels won the title from Sycho Sid in the main event {{following}} the Rumble match and avenged the loss he suffered at the hands of Sid at Survivor Series the previous November. According to Bret Hart, Michaels was scheduled to drop the title to him at WrestleMania in return for Hart having dropped the title to Michaels at the same event one year earlier. Michaels later suffered a legitimate knee injury during a three-way match with Sid and Bret Hart two weeks after the Royal Rumble, and on the February 13, 1997 edition of Raw, known as Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the title by speaking to the fans, telling them that he was told by doctors that he suffered a very bad knee injury and that he should at least consider retirement. He stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> the line. Michaels spent time rehabbing his knee at the same time Steve Austin was rehabbing his knee injury at HealthSouth in San Antonio. This did not sit well with Hart, who had legitimate backstage problems with Michaels at this time and who also thought Michaels' injury was not as severe as he was claiming it to be.|$|E
