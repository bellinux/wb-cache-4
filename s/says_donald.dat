50|$|The {{result of}} the battle has {{been a matter of}} {{argument}} amongst many historians. Some have said that Donald and the Highlanders had victory as the Duke of Albany did not return to the Highlands for four years until 1415. Others <b>say</b> that <b>Donald</b> failed to inflict a decisive victory because he withdrew back to the western highlands. The battle seems to have been indecisive for both sides. In 1415 the Earldom of Ross was resigned to the Duke of Albany who in turn awarded it to his son the John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan. However it would pass to the Lord of the Isles within a generation.|$|R

40|$|Pointing toward {{concrete}} objects is {{a well-known}} and efficient communicative strategy. Much less {{is known about the}} communicative effectiveness of abstract pointing where the pointing gestures are directed to “empty space. ” McNeill's (2003) observations suggest that abstract pointing can be used to establish referents in gesture space, without the referents being physically present. Recently, however, {{it has been shown that}} abstract pointing typically provides redundant information to the uttered speech thereby suggesting a very limited communicative value (So et al., 2009). In a first approach to tackle this issue we were interested to know whether perceivers are sensitive at all to this gesture cue or whether it is completely discarded as irrelevant add-on information. Sensitivity to for instance a gesture-speech mismatch would suggest a potential communicative function of abstract pointing. Therefore, we devised a mismatch paradigm in which participants watched a video where a female was interviewed on various topics. During her responses, she established two concepts in space using abstract pointing (e. g., pointing to the left when <b>saying</b> <b>Donald,</b> and pointing to the right when saying Mickey). In the last response to each topic, the pointing gesture accompanying a target word (e. g., Donald) was either consistent or inconsistent with the previously established location. Event related brain potentials showed an increased N 400 and P 600 when gesture and speech referred to different referents, indicating that inconsistent use of gesture space impairs language comprehension. Abstract pointing was found to influence comprehension even though gesture was not crucial to understanding the sentences or conducting the experimental task. These data suggest that a referent was retrieved via abstract pointing and that abstract pointing can potentially be used for referent indication in a discourse. We conclude that abstract pointing has a potential communicative function...|$|R

500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing.

Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey <b>says</b> that if <b>Donald</b> can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others {{are quick to point out}} that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage.
