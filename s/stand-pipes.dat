50|$|The town did {{not have}} any sort of formal or {{professional}} fire brigade. Although the <b>stand-pipes</b> connected to the public water main had recently been improved and increased, the apparatus for delivering water was wholly unsuitable - little more than a cart and a hose pipe (which, according to the inquiry, may have been faulty). The Council had attempted to obtain a trailer pump, but this had been delayed by the war emergency. There was no pumping equipment and formal, organised structure of fire officers. On the night of the fire, the Brigade in Dundalk was summoned by telephone. By the time the Dundalk Fire Brigade (which was a professional unit) had covered the forty-five or so miles of twisting road, {{there was nothing to be}} done. Enniskillen is about ten miles closer to Cavan than Dundalk and the roads are more direct. However, there is nothing to suggest that the Enniskillen Fire Brigade was summoned, even though Northern fire brigades had in the past crossed the border to assist in the South.|$|E
40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of municipal drinking water is currently {{determined by the}} presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria as indicators of faecal contamination. This is the first report of a study of microfungi in such waters from Australia. Overseas data suggest that microfungi are responsible for 'off-tastes ' and some are recognised as opportunistic human pathogens. The primary aim of this seminal {{study was to determine the}} qualitative and quantitative microfungal (filamentous and yeast/yeast-like) loads in waters from the reticulated water supply system in a tropical Australian city which abstracts untreated water from a river impoundment prior to classical treatment procedures. amples were regularly obtained from both <b>stand-pipes</b> (9) and storage tanks (6) throughout the city over a period of ca. 1 year and microfungi were recovered by Milliporeâ„¢ filtration (0. 45 Ilm). Filters were incubated for at least 3 days on malt extract agar with chloramphenicol for the suppression of bacterial growth. Colonies were counted and then identified microscopically. Numerous physicochemical parameters of each sample were recorded using a YSI multiparameter meter. Microfungi were rarely recovered immediately post-chlorination at the treatment plant. In contrast, microfungi were almost always recovered, sometimes in very high numbers,from all <b>stand-pipes</b> and all storage tanks tested. In total 61 genera were identified along with a large number of non-sporulating isolates. The genera most frequently recovered were Cladosporium (51. 9 %), Penicillium (17. 4 %), Aspergillus (6. 6 %), Fusarium (2. 9 %) and Pithomyces (2. 8 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{filter cloth}} fabrics {{commonly}} used in drains for coal waste embankments were tested by the Bureau of Mines for clogging behavior and deterioration under simulated field conditions. The objective was to provide guidelines for the mining industry for the proper selection and use of filter cloths to assure safer embankments at mine waste disposal sites. The filter cloths were tested with three coal waste samples in <b>stand-pipes</b> used to simulate coal mine waste disposal environments. Two of the cloths showed a tendency to become clogged with fines from the wastes. One waste caused clogging by precipitating an iron-silicon compound on the test cloths. No apparent cloth deterioration resulted from exposures to the simulated coal waste environments. (The exposures ranged from 2 to 12 months.) In other tests, exposures to waters in the pH range of 2 to 12 and to reagents used in coal-preparation plants resulted in insignificant or no deterioration, as measured by tensile strength. However, long exposures to sunlight (ranging from 4. 6 to 6 months) caused major deterioration {{in two of the}} cloths (86 -and 98 -pct losses in tensile strength) and slight deterioration in the third cloth (9 -pct loss in strength) ...|$|E
40|$|The Changi East Reclamation Project in the Republic of Singapore necessitated {{offshore}} {{land reclamation}} {{for the future}} airport and associated facilities. Ground improvement works in the project comprise the installation of prefabricated vertical drains and the subsequent placement of sand surcharge to accelerate the consolidation of the underlying soft marine clay. In such ground improvement projects in soft soil, the degree of improvement attained by the marine clay has to be ascertained to confirm whether the soil has achieved the required degree of consolidation to enable surcharge removal. This analysis {{can be carried out}} by means of observational methods for which continuous records of ground behavior can be monitored from the date of instrument installation. The Case Study Area conducted in the reclamation site consisted of a Vertical Drain Area and an adjacent untreated Control Area. Both areas were fully instrumented and monitored to compare the degree of consolidation of the areas close to the surcharge removal period. Instruments installed, monitored and analyzed in the Case Study Area include settlement plates, deep settlement gauges, pneumatic piezometers, electric piezometers and water <b>stand-pipes.</b> This paper discusses the methodology of land reclamation as well as the suitable types of field instrumentation for such projects...|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} {{knowledge of}} hydraulic and mining machinery Husband was surpassed by few.

He also effected many improvements in pneumatic ore stamps, finally perfecting and patenting those now known as Husband's oscillating cylinder stamps.|$|R
50|$|After {{establishing}} a regular first team the club moved {{to play at}} Hawkhill, Leith which had been its base right up until 1998. There were, of course, no bar facilities, and changing accommodation was difficult. Players changed in a wooden ex-army hut which had no lights, no toilets and no water. Washing for all players was at a single cold water tap at an outside <b>stand-pipe.</b> Annual subscription was seven shillings and sixpence (37.5p) for full members and half-a-crown (12.5p) for under-18s. There was a match levy of sixpence (2.5p). Players had to supply all their own kit and pay traveling expenses.|$|R
50|$|A 2000-gallon {{water tank}} was erected {{on a high}} stand on the north/west corner of Victoria and Gladstone Streets, as a fire {{fighting}} water source and it was kept full by a Government water tanker. The water supply to Hall had been under consideration for many years. With further persistence from the Hall Progress Association the long-awaited water supply for the Village of Hall became a reality in 1967. The official turning on of the water was performed by the minister, the Hon. J.D. Anthony M.P. on 1 April 1967. At this time a length of canvas and a <b>stand-pipe</b> {{was given to the}} village by the A.C.T. Fire Brigade, who showed the locals how to operate them.

5000|$|An {{improved}} {{construction of}} valve for water-closets and other uses, and several arrangements of valves and other apparatus for like purposes. The novelty of the valve consists in its spindle being prolonged downwards, {{so as to}} be capable of being acted on by a lever which opens and closes it, and thus admits water without (in the case of water-closets) the use of wires, &c. The other arrangements include a similar valve, but provided with a waste-pipe, and an arrangement of the same with a ball- cock for governing the supply of water to water-closets and their cisterns also an improved <b>stand-pipe,</b> and a sluice-valve for steam and fluids, the novelty of which consists in the manner of fitting and fixing the facings against which the slide works.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{lawn and}} the lower fields {{to the east of}} the Priory have been used for various large and small events over the years, however it was [...] "Central Yorkshire Scout County" [...] in 2000 that {{provided}} a fundamental change to how the grounds could be used.

During the 12-month preparation project to create temporary facilities and infrastructure, Yorkshire Water employee Jon Potter persuaded his employers to donate/install a subterranean high-pressure water mains and <b>stand-pipe</b> points around the entire eastern grounds. This was unprecedented both in terms of a corporate donation and in its benefit to the Priory, which up to that point had been considering how they could self-fund exactly this improvement.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a partial}} flow-through culture system for larvae of the blacklip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera L.). Water flowed through the 500 -l larval rearing tanks for 12 h day- 1 {{and provided a}} 100 % water exchange during this period. Larvae were prevented from leaving the culture tanks by a conical mesh screen placed over a central <b>stand-pipe.</b> Tanks were completely drained every 7 days to prevent build-up of debris on the tank bottom. First 'eyed' larvae were seen on day 23 and, by day 28, approximately 5 % of the larvae initially stocked had reached the 'eyed' stage and were removed into settlement tanks. Larval growth and survival compared fabourably with previous studies in which P. margaritifera larvae were cultured using conventional static culture methods. However, when compared to static culture systems, the partial flow-through system described in this study requires less labour and, as such, {{is likely to be}} more appropriate for hatchery culture in developing Pacific nations...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{based on}} simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and {{showed signs of}} {{incremental}} development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 - 2 psi (0.07 - 0.14 bar) - the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [...] "Great balanced Beam", the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located in-house. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston {{was surrounded by a}} seal {{in the form of a}} leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or header tank) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a <b>stand-pipe</b> for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.|$|R
40|$|A {{concern of}} the mining {{industry}} is the release of contaminants from waste rock piles into the environment. The current method of monitoring waste rock piles is to install piezometers below the water table in the soils underlying the unsaturated waste rock piles and collect a sample of water for chemical analysis. However, once a problem is detected {{it may be too}} late to initiate effective remedial measures because the contaminants are already in the local groundwater system. Therefore, it would be desirable to have an instrument that could serve as a piezometer, but be located in the unsaturated waste rock well above the local groundwater table. A <b>stand-pipe</b> lysimeter designed to measure suction and collect pore water samples from unsaturated waste rock piles has been developed and verified in a large-scale laboratory test. The laboratory testing of the prototype lysimeter involved the building of two large-scale test columns, each of which was 0. 56 m in diameter and 3. 6 m in height. The gradations of the test columns (coarse and fine) bracket the range of grainsize curves for waste rock as found in the literature and as measured in a number of research programs at the University of Saskatchewan. Applying different infiltration rates to the top of the column varied the suction profiles within the waste rock column. For each infiltration rate the suction profile of the columns was measured using both tensiometers and the lysimeters. The suction measurements were then compared and evaluated. Pore water samples were collected from the lysimeter by draining the base of the lysimeter. The volume of water and the time required to collect a pore water sample was measured. The results of column testing verified that the lysimeter could be used to measure the suction within the waste rock columns. The lysimeter measurement of suction was found to be slightly lower than the suction obtained with tensiometers, with an error of less than 1 kPa at suctions less than 10 kPa and an error of less than 2 kPa for suctions between 10 and 20 kPa. The pore fluid collection rates for the lysimeter, expressed as a ratio of the applied flux increased as the applied flux decreased. This was found to be a result of the lysimeter backfill becoming the preferential flowpath at low flux rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} continuous, rapid {{deaeration}} of hydraulic oil {{has been built}} to replace a prior system that effected deaeration more slowly in a cyclic pressure/ vacuum process. Such systems are needed because (1) hydraulic oil has an affinity for air, typically containing between 10 and 15 volume percent of air and (2) in the original application for which these systems were built, there is a requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air below 1 volume percent because a greater proportion can lead to pump cavitation and excessive softness in hydraulic-actuator force-versus-displacement characteristics. In addition to overcoming several deficiencies of the prior deaeration system, the present system removes water from the oil. The system (see figure) includes a pump that continuously circulates oil {{at a rate of}} 10 gal/min (38 L/min) between an 80 -gal (303 -L) airless reservoir and a tank containing a vacuum. When the circulation pump is started, oil is pumped, at a pressure of 120 psi (827 kPa), through a venturi tube below the tank with a connection to a <b>stand-pipe</b> in the tank. This action draws oil out of the tank via the standpipe. At the same time, oil is sprayed into the tank in a fine mist, thereby exposing a large amount of oil to the vacuum. When the oil level in the tank falls below the lower of two level switches, a vacuum pump is started, drawing a hard vacuum on the tank through a trap that collects any oil and water entrained in the airflow. When the oil level rises above higher of the two level switches or when the system is shut down, a solenoid valve between the tank and the vacuum pump is closed to prevent suction of oil into the vacuum pump. Critical requirements that the system is designed to satisfy include the following: 1) The circulation pump must have sufficient volume and pressure to operate the venturi tube and spray nozzles. 2) The venturi tube must be sized to empty the tank (except for the oil retained by the standpipe) and maintain a vacuum against the vacuum pump. 3) The tank must be strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum inside and must have sufficient volume to enable exposure of a sufficiently large amount of sprayed oil to the vacuum. 4) The spray nozzles must be sized to atomize the oil and to ensure that the rate of flow of sprayed oil does not exceed {{the rate at which the}} venturi action can empty the tank. 5) The vacuum pump must produce a hard vacuum against the venturi tube and continue to work when it ingests some oil and water. 6) Fittings must be made vacuum tight (by use of O-rings) to prevent leakage of air into the system. The system is fully automatic, and can be allowed to remain in operation with very little monitoring. It is capable of reducing the air content of the oil from 11 to less than 1 volume percent in about 4 hours and to keep the water content below 100 parts per million...|$|R
