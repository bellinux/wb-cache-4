60|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands in}} front of her and bowed her head solemnly, without uttering a word, and without taking her eyes off mine for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "What then? Is it {{something}} {{you may not}} tell me?" [...] asked the woman in a wheedling tone, as <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> legs and toyed with the flap of her tail.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> arms over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|MAUD. [Struggling to {{withdraw}} {{her hand and}} finally succeeding. Her voice is rather faint.] Ye-es, er [...] . Bob [...] . er [...] . {{glad to see you}} again. [She looks ruefully at her bruised fingers and sinks into chair. Then, recollecting <b>her</b> part, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> legs in a mannish way.] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> to <b>her</b> uncle's {{desk and}} looked downward. The carpet had {{apparently}} not been disturbed. There {{were no signs}} {{that it had been}} touched at all.|$|R
60|$|It did offend her; I {{thought it}} would. But she looked really {{interesting}} when <b>she</b> was <b>cross.</b> <b>Her</b> grey eyes would flash, and {{her whole body}} quiver. There was a charming spice of danger always about making <b>her</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{only the}} doctor," [...] said Mrs. Rook. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands over her}} bosom with a {{deep-drawn}} sigh. [...] "I want no doctor, now. My peace is made with my Maker. I'm ready for death; I'm fit for Heaven. Go away! go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|A lady, {{behind the}} Times, smiled; her mouth--indeed, her whole hard, {{handsome}} face--was reminiscent of dappled rocking-horses {{found in the}} Soho Bazaar. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> feet, and some rich and silk stuff rustled. Her whole personality seemed to creak as, without looking, she answered in harsh tones: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands resignedly. [...] "You {{know all}} by this time," [...] she answered. [...] "Sebastian would tell you, of course, {{when you went}} to {{announce}} that you were leaving Nathaniel's. He could not do otherwise; it is the outcome of his temperament--an integral part of his nature." ...|$|E
60|$|There <b>she</b> paused, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands on}} her lap, and waited for {{what was to come}} next.|$|R
50|$|On 25 April 2008, Etelvina Andreu was {{appointed}} the General Director of Consumer and Citizen Services of the Ministry of Health and Social Politics. She is closely {{linked with the}} Minister Bernat Soria, with whom <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> during <b>her</b> academic career.|$|R
60|$|She reentered the room, and as <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> it to <b>her</b> chair, {{he admired}} {{the way she}} walked, while the bronze {{slippers}} were maddening.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you live, as I understand, over at {{the pretty}} little cottage. It is very {{nice of you to}} call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get on, but still the {{intention}} is equally good." [...] <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> legs and leaned her back against the marble mantelpiece.|$|E
6000|$|There was Miss Nan, to be sure, tugging along a {{very large}} band-box tied up in linen bag. Very hot and dusty and tired did she look, but marched stoutly along, and came puffing up to the steps, where she dropped her load {{with a sigh of}} relief, and sat down upon it, {{observed}} as <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> tired arms, ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went down}} the long gallery, whose walls glowed with the new frescoes from the wonder-working brush of Andrea Mantegna; <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> ante-chamber and gained the very room where some hours ago she had {{received}} the insult of Gian Maria's odious advances. She passed through the now empty room, and stepped out on to the terrace that overlooked the paradise-like gardens of the Palace.|$|E
60|$|Virginia {{had risen}} now. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> the room, <b>her</b> head lifted, her heart lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a woman}} worker filling honey jars from a tank, ca. 1930. A woman sits on a stool to {{the left}} of center with her body facing the right. The woman wears a lightly colored dress and bonnet while <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> right foot over her left wearing {{stockings}} and darkly colored heeled shoes. She holds her hands out to the right with a jar of honey underneath a spout in her left hand and the lever that seems to control the spout in her right hand. Identical jars of honey in spherical shapes sit on the counter to the right while containers {{can be seen in the}} background. Photoprint reads "Southwest Honey Producers' Syndicate"...|$|R
6000|$|LADY (letting {{her hands}} fall [...] ). Tear them from me--by force! (As he glares {{at her like}} a tiger about to spring, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> arms on her breast in the {{attitude}} of a martyr. The gesture and pose instantly awaken his theatrical instinct: he forgets his rage in the desire to show her that in acting, too, she has met her match. He keeps her a moment in suspense; then suddenly clears up his countenance; puts his hands behind him with provoking coolness; looks at her {{up and down a}} couple of times; takes a pinch of snuff; wipes his fingers carefully and puts up his handkerchief, her heroic pose becoming more and more ridiculous all the time.) ...|$|R
60|$|In {{due course}} {{one of the}} more dashing of the young men remarked that if they wanted to dance they'd better begin. The girl who had played the accompaniments sat at the piano and placed a decided foot on the loud pedal. She played a dreamy waltz, marking the time with the bass, while with the right hand she 'tiddled' in {{alternate}} octaves. By way of a change <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands and played the air in the bass.|$|E
60|$|No singer after a first concert {{has felt}} more triumphant than Claire when <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> first state-line; rumbled {{over the bridge}} across the Red River into North Dakota. To see Dakota car {{licenses}} everywhere, instead of Minnesota, was like the sensation of street signs in a new language. And when she found a good hotel in Fargo and had a real bath, she felt that by her own efforts she had {{earned the right to}} enjoy it.|$|E
60|$|The girlish tears {{welled up}} again and overran her eyes. Thoughtfully <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> right hand over to her left ear; {{carefully}} but timidly she placed the keen, cold edge of the steel against the smooth alabaster neck, twisted the fingers of her other hand into her long black hair, drew back her head and ripped away. There was an apparition in that mirror as of a ripe watermelon opening its mouth to address a public meeting; there were the thud and jar of a sudden sitting down; and when the old lady came in from frying doughnuts in the adjoining room she found something that seemed to interest her-something still and warm and wet-something kind of doubled up.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the Bertin portrait, which required of Ingres a prolonged struggle {{to arrive at the}} final seated pose, Ingres apparently settled on the basic composition of the Rothschild portrait at the very first session. The arrangement of Rothschild's upper body may have been partly inspired by a pastel by the Swiss artist Jean-Étienne Liotard, the Portrait of Louise d'Épinay (1759), which Ingres is known to have especially admired. The liveliness of Ingres' portrait is enhanced by the casual way the sitter leans forward over <b>her</b> <b>crossed</b> legs. According to the art historian Aileen Ribiero, [...] "Madame de Rothschild's pose - the way <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> legs so that the shape of her knee can clearly be seen - might have been regarded as rather risqué, if we are to believe the etiquette books", which at the time cautioned that a woman should not <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> legs when seated.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> Europe with <b>her</b> boyfriend, {{which led}} to her first writing success, Wind in my Wheels. After her boyfriend was injured in a crash she began {{travelling}} alone, which she prefers, despite those who find it strange.|$|R
6000|$|... "He don't {{go by the}} photographs," [...] Martha Grimes explained. [...] "He {{believes}} that he crossed from Liverpool with this Mr. Douglas Romilly, and that you," [...] <b>she</b> continued, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> legs and smoothing down her skirt to hide her shabby shoes, [...] "are so much like him that he came down last night {{to see if there}} was anything else he could find out from me before he paid a visit to police headquarters." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carol relaxed, {{and found}} that she was shockingly tired. She had carried them on her thin shoulders. She could not keep it up. She longed for her father, that artist at {{creating}} hysterical parties. She thought of smoking a cigarette, to shock them, and dismissed the obscene thought before it was quite formed. She wondered whether they could for five minutes be coaxed {{to talk about something}} besides the winter top of Knute Stamquist's Ford, and what Al Tingley had said about his mother-in-law. She sighed, [...] "Oh, let 'em alone. I've done enough." [...] <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> trousered legs, and snuggled luxuriously above her saucer of ginger; she caught Pollock's congratulatory still smile, and thought well of herself for having thrown a rose light on the pallid lawyer; repented the heretical supposition that any male save her husband existed; jumped up to find Kennicott and whisper, [...] "Happy, my lord? [...] . No, it didn't cost much!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{determined}} {{to go and see}} Mary Erskine after dinner, again, as the visit would at least be a token of kindness and sympathy, even if it should do no other good. She arrived at the house about the middle of the afternoon. She found Mary Erskine busily at work, putting the house in order, and rectifying the many derangements which sickness and death always occasion. Mary Erskine received Mrs. Bell at first with a cheerful smile, and seemed, to all appearance, as contented and happy as usual. The sight of Mrs. Bell, however, recalled forcibly to her mind her irremediable loss, and overwhelmed her heart, again, with bitter grief. She went to the window, where her little work-table had been placed, and throwing herself down in a chair before it, <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> arms upon the table, laid her forehead down upon them in an attitude of despair, and burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I'm not Gertrude," [...] she said, [...] "for {{her hair}} goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all--and I'm sure I ca'n't be Florence, for I know {{all sorts of}} things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear! how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't signify--let's try Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of Yorkshire, and Paris--oh dear! dear! that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Florence! I'll try and say [...] "How doth the little,"" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands on her lap, and began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound {{the same as they}} used to do: ...|$|E
50|$|Maria Spelterini (sometimes spelled Spelterina and {{occasionally}} {{referred to as}} Marie, July 7, 1853 - October 19, 1912) was an Italian tightrope walker who {{was the only woman}} to cross the Niagara gorge on a tightrope, which she did on July 8, 1876 as part of a celebration of the U.S. Centennial. She used two and a quarter inch (57 mm) wire and crossed just north of the lower suspension bridge. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> again on July 12, 1876, this time wearing peach baskets strapped to <b>her</b> feet. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> blindfolded on July 19, and on July 22 <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> with <b>her</b> ankles and wrists manacled.|$|R
50|$|On leaving school, Stephenson {{became a}} member of the Newmarket branch of the Red <b>Cross.</b> <b>She</b> began <b>her</b> General Nurse {{training}} at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds.|$|R
5000|$|A war photographer, Lee goes to Sicily {{instead of}} going back home New York City, to forget about being taken hostage in Libya. In Sicily, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> paths with <b>her</b> former lover and mentor Albert and tries to help Hafsia, a young Tunisian migrant, escape to France.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for {{her hair}} goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know {{all sorts of}} things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little!

60|$|On {{the next}} morning M. Urmand {{returned}} home to Basle, taking the public conveyance as far as Remiremont. Everybody was up to see him off, and Marie herself gave him his cup of coffee at parting. It was pretty to see the mingled grace and shame with which the little ceremony was performed. She hardly said a word; indeed what word she did say was heard by no one; but <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands on her breast, and the gravest smile came over her face, and she turned her eyes down to the ground, and if any one ever begged pardon without a word spoken, Marie Bromar then asked Adrian Urmand to pardon her the evil she had wrought upon him. 'O, yes;--of course,' he said. 'It's all right. It's all right.' Then she gave him her hand, and said good-bye, and ran away up into her room. Though she had got rid of one lover, not a word had yet been said as to her uncle's acceptance of that other lover on her behalf; nor had any words more tender been spoken between her and George than those with which the reader has been made acquainted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to believe, Miss O'Mahony, that my {{attachment}} {{to you is}} most devoted." [...] She pursed her lips together and looked straight {{out of her eyes}} at the wall opposite. [...] "We belong to the same class of life, and our careers lie in the same groove." [...] Hereupon <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands before her on her lap, while her father sat speculating whether she might not have done better to come out on the comic stage. [...] "I wish you to believe that I am quite sincere in the expression which I make of a most ardent affection." [...] Here again he slapped his waistcoat and threw himself into an attitude. He was by no means an ill-looking man, and though he was forty years old, he {{did not appear to be}} so much. He had been a public singer all his life, and was known by Rachel to have been connected for many years with theatres both in London and New York. She had heard many stories as to his amorous adventures, but knew nothing against his character in money matters. He had, in truth, always behaved well to her in whatever pecuniary transactions there had been between them. But he had ventured to make love to her, and had done so in a manner which had altogether disgusted her. She now waited till he paused for a moment in his eloquence, and then she spoke a word.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> {{herself with}} <b>her</b> thumb-nail upon the brow and upon the lips, to repress all evil {{thoughts}} and evil words--an unfailing sign {{that she was}} stirred to anger and sought to combat the sin of it. Then she spoke, meekly enough, in the same cold, level voice.|$|R
60|$|Paula went on, the {{carriage}} following with difficulty, {{on account of}} the obstructions in the thoroughfare. At bottom, the street abutted on a wide one with customary modern life flowing through it; and as <b>she</b> looked, Somerset <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> front along this street, hurrying as if for a wager.|$|R
6000|$|She {{threw herself}} {{back in her}} chair with a dejected face. [...] "Oh, as for that," [...] <b>she</b> cried, wearily, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> hands, [...] "before you and Hilda, who know all, what need to prevaricate? How CAN I believe it? We {{understand}} how it came about. That woman! That woman!" ...|$|R
