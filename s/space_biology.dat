25|$|STS-65 Columbia (July 8–23, 1994) was {{the second}} International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) flight. The mission {{consisted}} of 82 investigations of Space Life Science (Human Physiology, <b>Space</b> <b>Biology,</b> Radiation Biology, and Bioprocessing) and Microgravity Science (Material Science, Fluid Science and Research on the Microgravity Environment and Countermeasures). IML-2 was also designated as an extended duration orbit mission focusing on medical experiments related to the cardiovascular system, autonomic nerve system, and bone and muscle metabolism. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling over 6.1 million miles in 353 hours and 55 minutes.|$|E
