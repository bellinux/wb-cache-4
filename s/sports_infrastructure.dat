25|$|Basketball, tennis, cycling, handball, futsal, motorcycling and, lately, Formula One {{are also}} {{important}} due {{to the presence of}} Spanish champions in all these disciplines. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the 1992 Summer Olympics that were hosted in Barcelona, which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> especially for water sports, golf and skiing.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet period {{brought an}} {{increased}} popularization of sports that were common in Europe {{and to a}} certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} between winning the bid and the staging of the event, New Zealand news media and social {{agencies}} cast aspersions on the nation's readiness and appropriate use of national funds for <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> as has happened with most large, international, quadrennial, multi-location sporting events of recent decades such as the 2012 Olympics, 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Concerns were raised {{about the process of}} upgrading Eden Park to expand the capacity to the 60,000 required by the IRB. In late 2008 Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully said the remaining consent process might need to be overridden by legislation for the work to be completed on time.|$|E

40|$|Sport {{management}} should {{contribute to}} making sport accessible {{for people of}} all ages. Therefore, sport management research must analyse the impact of different managerial opportunities. A special focus lies {{on the effects of}} infrastructural conditions. In this paper, the impact of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on <b>sport</b> participation has been analysed using data from a population survey in the city of Stuttgart, which are related to infrastructural data. The results show that the availability of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> regardless of individual socio-economic conditions, influences patterns of sport activity significantly. However, the influence of certain types of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> varies between age groups. For example, the availability of swimming pools is important during childhood and adolescence, whereas the availability of fitness centres, gymnasia and sports fields is of greater importance in young adulthood. These findings have significance for the ways in which sport managers can influence patterns of lifelong sports activity. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} relations between sport and socialist authority {{in a context}} of urban space. The focus is put on the role played by sport in 1945 - 1989 in Poland, influence of national and urban policies on <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> types of <b>sport</b> facilities and their location in urban space within this period. Historical maps of Krakow, Lodz and Wroclaw, history of these cities and sport clubs located there were analysed. After the World War II big Polish cities experienced heavy urbanisation, industrialisation and population inflow. Sport became a factor integrating new, diverse society. Furthermore, it was used as an instrument of propaganda by socialist authorities. The authors give examples of positive and negative effects of state intervention into sport. Among positive aspects the growth in participation in amateur sport and development of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can be mentioned, whereas lack of modernisation of sport facilities, favouritism of certain sport clubs, closures or changes of names of the others, as well as forced transfers of players are some of negative effects. The authors present the distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in urban space and diverse tempo of its development. Particularly intense investments into <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> took place in 50 ’s, 60 ’s and 80 ’s in Krakow, in 70 ’s in Wroclaw, as well as in 1956 - 1960 and 70 ’s in Lodz. The main determinants of new objects localization were: city level politics, network of formerly built facilities (old cores of concentration, settlement patterns), vast spaces (especially in the context of large sport complexes). Unequal distribution of sport objects and diverse accessibility (especially concerning settlements built in 70 ’s and 80 ’s) contradict the socialist postulate of sport’s universality. The shortages of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> are reflected in the contemporary “space of sport” of Polish cities...|$|R

2500|$|Horacio de la Vega, {{marketing}} director for Guadalajara 2011, cited the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as the inspiration for infrastructure improvements. [...] "Barcelona wasn't Barcelona before it got the Olympic Games. In a more modest sense, we {{are doing the same}} in Guadalajara", he said. The budget was estimated at US $200 million, of which $180 million was for <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Some of the funding went to general street improvement and public transportation.

2500|$|Chile's {{football}} federation committee, led by Carlos Dittborn and Juan Pinto Durán, toured {{many countries}} convincing various football associations about the country's ability to organise the tournament {{in comparison to}} Argentina's superior <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and prestige. The FIFA Congress met in Lisbon, Portugal on 10 June 1956. That day, Raul Colombo, representing Argentina's candidacy, ended his speech with the phrase [...] "We can start the World Cup tomorrow. We have it all." [...] The next day, Dittborn presented four arguments that supported Chile's candidacy: Chile's continued participations at FIFA-organised conferences and tournaments, sports climate, tolerance of race and creed and political and institutional stability of the country. In addition, Dittborn invoked Article 2 of the FIFA statutes that addressed the tournament's role in promoting the sport in countries deemed [...] "underdeveloped". Chile won 32 votes to Argentina's 11. Thirteen members abstained from voting.|$|E

40|$|Sport {{policies}} {{aiming at}} increasing mass participation and club participation have {{stressed the importance}} of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Previous research has mainly analyzed the influence of individual factors (age, income, etc.) on sport participation. Although a few studies have dealt with the impact of sport facilities on sport participation, some methodological shortcomings can be observed regarding the integration of <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> into the research design. Oftentimes, subjective measures of infrastructure are employed, leading to biased results, for example inactive people have a worse perception of the actual supply of facilities. In fact it is important to measure the available <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> objectively using a quantitative approach and integrate it into statistical models. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to analyze the impact of individual and <b>infrastructure</b> variables on <b>sport</b> participation in general and in sport clubs using geo-coded data following a multi-level design. For this purpose, both primary data (individual level) and secondary data (infrastructure level) were collected in the city of Munich, Germany. A telephone survey of the resident population was carried out (n = 11, 175) and secondary data on the available <b>sport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Munich were collected. Both datasets were geo-coded using Gauss-Krueger coordinates and integrated into multi-level analyses. The multi-level models show that swimming pools are of particular importance for sport participation in general and sport fields for participation in sport clubs. Challenges and implications for a more holistic modeling of <b>sport</b> participation including <b>infrastructure</b> variables are discussed.

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of success lately on the {{international}} level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9 million. The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government. About $9.3 million has been invested in the resort town of Tsaghkadzor to improve the winter <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> because of dismal performances at recent winter sports events. In 2005, a cycling center was opened in Yerevan, with the aim of helping produce world class Armenian cyclists. The government has also promised a cash reward of $700,000 to Armenians who win a gold medal at the Olympics. Rector of the Yerevan State Institute of Physical Culture Vahram Arakelian believes that Armenia will produce Olympic champions in 2016, because by that time “the work of new coaches and their influence on their trainees will be seen.” ...|$|E

The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40°C (104°F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30°C (86°F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying [...] "the event has to be organised in June or July. We {{will have to take}} the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well." [...] The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed <b>sports</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|E
