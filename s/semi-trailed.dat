40|$|Five {{years old}} poplar (Populus spp.) {{plantation}} represents an interesting model of productivity. The most attractive characteristics of this energy crop are the handling flexibility, the high yield of biomass per area unit {{and the good}} quality of the chips obtainable. The mechanical harvesting of five-years old poplar plantations {{requires the use of}} specialized forest machineries such as harvester, feller, forwarder and chipper. Usually, after felling, the working phases consist of extraction, stacking and chipping. Generally, the last one is carried out in a “static phase”, where the product is taken from staked logs by using a hydraulic arm having a gripper that feed the chipping machine. In order to introduce technological innovations for the medium rotation forestry harvesting, the Consiglio per la Ricerca e la sperimentazione in Agricoltura, Unità di ricerca per l’Ingegneria agraria (CRAING) of Monterotondo (Rome, Italy) has developed a five years poplar cutwindrower and a self-propelled chipper equipped with a pick up system. The prototype of cut-windrower is a <b>semi-trailed</b> machine powered by a 95 kW tractor (at least). It mounts a cutting system and a double pincer with variable positioning. During the cutting phase the plant is grasped by the double pincer which conveys and unloads the stem along the inter-row. The trees are placed parallel to the progress of the tractor, but oriented in the opposite direction. The biomass windrowed is then chipped in a dynamic phase directly from the inter row using the self-propelled chipper equipped with the pick-up head. In the first tests, the cut-windrower has reached an operative working capacity of 0. 22 ha h- 1, with an operative production of 44 t h- 1. On the other hand, the self-propelled chipper has showed an operative working capacity equal to 0. 18 ha h- 1, and an operative production of 35 t h- 1 about. Both machines have shown good quality of the work performed and the results obtained indicates that the work phases could be simplified in order to reduce both the time of use and the harvesting costs...|$|E

50|$|Like all Z3s, the M roadster’s {{suspension}} {{is made up}} of MacPherson struts in {{the front}} and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms in the rear. However, compared to the six-cylinder Z3 roadster, the M roadster included modifications such as wider front and rear tracks (by 0.4 inches), reduced ride height (by 1.1 inches), modified front suspension geometry, firmer springs and shocks, thicker anti-roll bars, stronger <b>semi-trailing</b> arms and a reinforced subframe.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{legacy of}} the 600 was its {{independent}} <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension. This was BMW's first use of this suspension system and, {{with the exception of}} the BMW M1, it was used on every BMW production automobile until the 1990s. It was eventually supplanted by the [...] "Z-axle" [...] multi-link suspension introduced with the BMW Z1 in 1988. The last BMW cars with <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension were the BMW Compact and the BMW Z3.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{features}} that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car's overall size. The <b>semi-trailing</b> arms {{have been criticized for}} the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). This has contributed to the E30 as having a reputation for [...] "tail happy" [...] handling, where rear grip is reduced in certain situations, leading to oversteer.|$|R
5000|$|The three-box four-door saloon was in {{many ways}} conventional, using a unitary {{structure}} and MacPherson strut front suspension which were becoming mainstream {{by the time of the}} 1500s introduction. Less conventional was the independent rear suspension, which featured coil springs and <b>semi-trailing</b> wishbones pivoted from a stout cross beam that also supported the differential housing. [...] While BMW was using MacPherson struts for their first time on the New Class, they had used unit body construction on the 700 and <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension on the 600 and the 700. All New Class cars had front disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{problems}} that developed with the 1500 included {{separation of the}} <b>semi-trailing</b> arm mounts from the body, rear axle failure, and gearbox problems. These were resolved in later versions of the New Class sedan.|$|R
25|$|A-arm {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts and the rear suspension is independent <b>semi-trailing</b> arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control {{arms and the}} geometry of the rear suspension was revised.|$|R
50|$|The 280ZX adopted {{suspension}} {{similar to}} that of the concurrent Bluebird 910, with MacPherson struts in front and <b>semi-trailing</b> arm independent suspension in the rear. The wheelbase was up from its predecessor (90.7 in) to 91.3 in for the two-seater.|$|R
50|$|As in the Triumph 2000 model line, unitary {{construction}} was employed, as was fully independent suspension - MacPherson struts in front, <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. Braking was by front disc and rear drum brakes, while steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} was redesigned using {{coil springs}} instead of torsion bars, {{the first major}} engineering changes since the original 911. The front suspension used MacPherson struts, {{a system that has}} continued for all subsequent versions, but the rear suspension retained <b>semi-trailing</b> arms.|$|R
50|$|The E36/5 {{made use}} of the older <b>semi-{{trailing}}</b> arm rear axle, {{as opposed to the}} E36's Z-Axle Multi-link suspension. As the trailing arm design was smaller, it allowed for a lower trunk floor height, fold-down rear seats, and an exterior undermounted compact spare tire.|$|R
50|$|The Magic Iris is {{made using}} an {{all steel body}} and frame - {{reinforced}} by reverse hat section chassis rails and beams, welded under its floor.The vehicle features all-around independent suspension with coil springs - MacPherson struts in the front, and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms in the rear.|$|R
50|$|More {{unconventional}} {{was the use}} of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension.A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Steering is by {{rack and}} pinion and has a {{comparatively}} low ratio. MacPherson strut suspension is used at the front and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. Brakes are by disc and single-piston calipers at the front, with drums at the rear also serving for handbrake function, via cables.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1981, {{the range}} was {{supplemented}} by an attractive Škoda Garde, which {{was equipped with}} the 1174 cc, [...] engine from the 120 LS and 120 GLS Saloon models. This had much improved <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension, and {{paved the way for}} the 130-136 models of the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Wishbone and {{multi-link}} {{allow the}} engineer {{more control over}} the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut or swinging arm do; however the cost and space requirements may be greater. <b>Semi-trailing</b> arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.|$|R
50|$|The Shamal used a {{traditional}} front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and an all-steel unibody construction. Suspension was by MacPherson struts upfront and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. All Shamals were {{equipped with an}} adaptive suspension developed by Maserati together with Koni. The system varied the damping rates, based on road conditions {{and the level of}} comfort desired.|$|R
50|$|A widened {{version of}} the E30 front {{suspension}} and the drivetrain from the E30 325i {{were used in the}} BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 (E36/4) and BMW Compact (E36/5) rear suspensions are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The BMW M Coupe uses a widened {{version of the}} same rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension.|$|R
50|$|A beam axle's {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, radius rods, or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a Panhard rod, a Scott Russell linkage or a Watt's linkage. While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars in the}} Biturbo {{family were}} of unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of front-longitudinally mounted engine and gearbox. Suspension was of the MacPherson strut type upfront and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and rear suspension arms were supported by a subframe.|$|R
50|$|The floorpans {{came from}} the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. Rear swing axle {{suspension}} with reduction gearing from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS <b>semi-trailing</b> arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with its}} Z3 predecessor, the Z4 is larger {{and has a}} stiffer chassis. As per the Z3, the front {{suspension}} is a Macpherson strut design. The rear suspension uses a multi-link design, instead of the <b>semi-trailing</b> design used by the Z3. Some reviewers have criticised the ride quality for being too harsh, and observed excessive bump steer from the rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|The Rapid used a unibody {{structure}} and a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.Front suspension was by double wishbones and coil springs. At the rear there were <b>semi-trailing</b> arms and coil springs, a major upgrade from the swing axle of earlier Škodas that gave {{safer and more}} predictable handling. Brakes were discs with four-pot calipers at the front, and drums at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} design was of <b>semi-trailing</b> arm configuration and, similarly {{to most of the}} body and floor pan structure aft of the A-Pillar, was shared between the 1000 and Type 110. However, the front suspension of the Typ 110 was a new double-wishbone design with longer wishbones, better noise isolation and longer wheel travel than those of the 1000 models.|$|R
25|$|The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was {{released}} in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo motor show. Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a <b>semi-trailing</b> ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} front suspension setup received {{lower control}} arm pivot points. The Series II update featured {{the addition of a}} new rear cross member, revised rear control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|R

50|$|On {{the four}} wheel drive GSi, 4x4 and Turbo models, the rear {{suspension}} is a subframe mounted fully independent design, with <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, double conical coil springs, direct acting gas assisted telescopic shock absorbers, and an anti roll bar. Steering gear is a rack and pinion type (manual or power assisted, depending on model), mounted on the bulkhead (firewall), with a telescopically deformable steering column.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} was an {{innovative}} combination transaxle with the gearbox, clutch, differential, and inboard-mounted drum brakes. The front suspension was a sliding pillar design, with rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arms {{replaced by a}} de Dion tube in the Fourth series. The Aurelia was also first car to be fitted with radial tires as standard equipment.Initially 165SR400 Michelin X and later the sports models fitted 165HR400 Pirelli Cinturato.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} incorporated {{rack and}} pinion steering and MacPherson strut suspension at the front, and <b>semi-trailing</b> arm type independent suspension at the rear. The rear suspension design causes camber changes, which can introduce [...] "snap oversteer" [...] at the handling limits. The power assisted brakes were discs on the front wheels, while the rear wheels had drum brakes (except the 323i model which had discs all round).|$|R
