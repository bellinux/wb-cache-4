The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> {{has become}} vital for {{companies}} {{in order to}} ensure a competitive advantage in our ever changing global environment. The Balanced <b>Scorecard,</b> if applied effectively, will assess whether the company’s vision, mission, strategy and values are achieved. The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> system is a management tool {{that can be used to}} transform strategy into action. The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> used at Picture Perfect Photography has been identified as problematic. This study includes a literature study on the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> system and an empirical study regarding the application of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> in a specific Photography company. The literature study set out to evaluate the efficiency of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> as it is applied at Picture Perfect Photography. The secondary objectives defined the Balanced <b>Scorecard,</b> reviewed the evolution and the need for a Balanced <b>Scorecard.</b> The literature study further explored the advantages and disadvantages of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> and continued exploring personal development with linking it to compensation. The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> should be used to align the company’s vision and strategy in order to improve long-term performance. The research indicates that communication and constant feedback play an important role in the successful implementation of a Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> approach. The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> could be a very useful instrument when implemented and applied effectively. An empirical study was done including Picture Perfect Photography’s employees, at different job levels, work sections and years of service. The aim of the empirical study was to determine how the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> was used in the alignment with the company’s strategy, vision, mission and values. Furthermore, the aim was to determine the problems with the existing Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> and if it helps to focus on quality, reengineering and customer services’ initiatives. The study indicated more or less the same average responses on specific Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> related issues. The majority of employees responded that feedback and communication of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> were not transparent enough nor was it applied effectively. Conclusions and recommendations were made in order to identify and improve the advancement of an effectively applied Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> used at Picture Perfect Photography for the future.

This new strategy was {{as a result of}} the appointment of a new chief executive officer. In order to build and implement the strategy, one of the top international consulting firms was hired by the CEO. The consulting firm advised the CEO that the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> would facilitate the implementation of the strategy and it would improve the performance of the employees and the company performance for the shareholders. The Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> architect from a consulting firm and 14 employees from the mobile telecommunications company were interviewed. The interview with the architect focused on the process of building the <b>scorecard</b> and the views of the ‗architect‘ on the implementation of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> at the company. The other interviews aimed to answer two questions; namely how the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> facilitated the implementation of the strategy in the company and the factors that helped or hindered the implementation of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> in the company. The research presents how the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> had not successfully facilitated the implementation of the company strategy as the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> had not been effectively implemented.

After round nine it was ruled Margarito could not continue, so the fight was decided on the <b>scorecards</b> and Santos led 8685, 8784 on two cards while Margarito was ahead 8685 on the third scorecard. After the loss, Margarito moved back down in weight to defend his WBO welterweight title against Sebastian Lujan on February 18, 2005. He won the fight by technical knockout in the tenth round {{and set up a}} fight against Kermit Cintron, who was in attendance for Margarito's fight with Lujan.

Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he said he could not see.

5|$|On July 30, 2011 it was {{announced}} that Cotto would make a second defence of his WBA title against rival Antonio Margarito (38-7, 27 KOs) in a rematch to their first fight, which took place in July 2008. The fight was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on December 3, 2011. The MGM Grand was also considered as a possible venue. At first, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) denied Margarito a boxing license on October 31, 2011. The reason for the denial was not due the cheating allegations, but instead due to the damage to Margarito's eye in the Manny Pacquiao fight. An appeal was filed and a hearing took place to where several leading eye doctors testified that Margarito should be allowed to fight. A final decision was expected on November 18, 2011. Without a license, Margarito could not fight in the state of New York. Arum initially stated that if Margarito was not licensed to fight, then Vanes Martirosyan would take his place on the card. However, Arum later stated that the fight would be moved to a venue in a state that Margarito holds a license. On November 18, 2011, the NYSAC did not make a final vote as expected. Instead, they ordered Margarito to be examined by their own doctor. Based on the findings of their own doctor, they would make a decision on whether Margarito received a license. The New York State Athletic Commission granted Antonio Margarito a license to box in New York after a hearing in Manhattan. A sold-out crowd of 21,239 {{was announced}}. Cotto avenged the defeat from 2008 stopping Margarito in the 10th round. The fight was stopped {{at the start of the}} 10th round because of the condition of Margarito's right eye, which was swollen shut. This was the same eye that was badly damaged in his fight with Pacquiao and the one that almost kept the New York State Athletic Commission from granting him his boxing license because of the special procedure that was performed on it in 2010. At the time of stoppage, Cotto lead 89-82 on all three judges <b>scorecards.</b> For the fight, Cottor earned a minimum $5 million, the figure would increase due to PPV shares and Margarito earned $2.5 million.|$|E
