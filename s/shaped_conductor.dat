Applying this technique, new significant information was obtained about the continuity of visual perception during eyeblinks in humans.

It was shown that the whole head MEG with individual brain <b>shaped</b> <b>conductor</b> models can be used to study the cognitive processes associated with deep brain structures like memory functions in the hippocampus. Advanced computational methods were studied to facilitate the use of realistically <b>shaped</b> <b>conductor</b> models in neuromagnetic source localization. As a first step, the methods were tested with unit spheres and applied to brain shaped homogeneous conductor models using a single current dipole. The accuracy of the forward problem solution, especially near the surface of the conductor model, could be significantly improved using the Galerkin method with linear basis functions. Contrary to a common expectation, the Galerkin method was shown to be efficient and even faster than the widely used collocation method with linear basis functions for a given forward solution accuracy. Large problems could be solved quickly without the explicit formation of the dense matrix with small computer memory requirements using the iterative Bi-CGSTAB method with the precorrected-FFT method. The methods studied can be applied for MEG, EEG, MCG or ECG with multicompartment volume conductor models and with focused or distributed current source models. The forward problem solution is needed in all bioelectromagnetic source localization. The methods can be taken into routine use for neuromagnetic source localization to improve the source localization accuracy and to decrease the computational costs of accurate modelling. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{so-called}} multi-scale problems is challenging due to large {{differences between the}} length scales of the problem, which {{can be associated with}} large computational costs. For example, modeling of pacemaker lead heating by a 1. 5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system requires length scales differing by a factor 1000 to be resolved. Lead heating is the main cause of the contraindication of pacemakers for MRI [1]. The human body sets the size of the largest scale whereas the helically <b>shaped</b> <b>conductors</b> of the pacemaker lead constitute the smallest scale. To this date, modeling of these length scales and the heterogeneous body tissue has not been performed concurrently. Neufeld et al. [2] exploited the finite-difference time-domain technique (FDTD) and modeled the heating caused by a single helix. However, the associated computational cost prevented them from examining more complex leads. Nevertheless, modern pacing leads often include two helically <b>shaped</b> <b>conductors,</b> consisting of several filars each, whose winding scheme has been shown experimentally to have significant impact on the heating [3]. Therefore, we devote special attention to the multi-scale part of the problem and exploit the frequency-domain method of moments to model an MRI radio frequency coil and a homogeneous human body phantom with an implanted pacemaker system. The pacemaker lead consists of two helically <b>shaped</b> <b>conductors</b> modeled as thin wires, insulation, and electrodes modeled by surfaces. We exploit the model to assess the effect on the heating by different factors, such as the presence of a pacemaker unit. Figure 1 shows the amplification of the absolute value of the electric field with respect to the fields in an empty phantom. Furthermore, we study the accuracy of the thin-wire approximation for densely wound helices by comparing it to a surface discretization of the helix. Figure 2 shows the maximum value of the induced current on a straight helix which is illuminated by a plane wave polarized along the helix axis.

One of the most important challenges is to control the plasma in fusion reactors is design high performance superconducting magnets. Fusion was achieved in JET reactor but actually a self-sustained fusion is the goal to make new fusion energy plants.

40|$|A highly {{efficient}} and robust scheme is proposed for analyzing electromagnetic scattering from electrically large arbitrary <b>shaped</b> <b>conductors</b> {{in a half}} space. This scheme {{is based on the}} electric field integral equation (EFIE) with a half-space Green’s function. The precorrected fast Fourier transform (p-FFT) is first extended to a half space for general three-dimensional scattering problems. A novel enhanced dual threshold incomplete LU factorization (ILUT) is then constructed as an effective preconditioner to improve the convergence of the half-space EFIE. Inspired by the idea of the improved electric field integral operator (IEFIO), the geometrical-optics current/principle value term of the magnetic field integral equation is used as a physical perturbation to stabilize the traditional ILUT perconditioning matrix. The high accuracy of EFIE is maintained, yet good calculating efficiency comparable to the combined field integral equation (CFIE) can be achieved. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to arbitrary geometrical structures including open surfaces and requires no extra types of Sommerfeld integrals needed in the half-space CFIE. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the high performance of the proposed solver among several other approaches in typical half-space problems...|$|R
