500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience might just as well understand that I am going to have my <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> stand here until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E
2500|$|Beatty {{spent much}} of his life (when not at sea) in Leicestershire, and lived at Brooksby Hall and Dingley Hall. Beatty's old {{commander}} Admiral John Jellicoe died on 19 November 1935. Already suffering from heart failure, and sick with influenza, Beatty defied doctors' orders and left his bed to act as a pallbearer, saying, [...] "What will the Navy <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> fail to attend Jellicoe's funeral?" [...] He was so obviously ill that, as the funeral procession passed up Fleet Street, a bystander sent a glass of brandy out to him. He also insisted on attending the funeral of King George V in January 1936. These acts hastened his own death.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Dearboy {{admitted}} {{to being a}} member of Charles Taylor's defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia rebel movement. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) public hearings, Dearboy said he was forcefully enlisted into the NPFL, in 1992, while searching for his girlfriend in Grand Bassa County. Three witnesses said that Dearboy raped a young woman and murdered several men, women, and children in Grand Bassa County during the civil war. Dearboy denied the accusation leveled against him. Dearboy expressed penitence {{for his role in the}} rebel movement, saying: [...] "The past is what no one is in control of. No one is reading my mind except God. But I want to <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hurt anyone during the war, I am sorry, very, very sorry from the depth of my heart. I am sorry for whatever role I played during the revolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|One long-standing {{mystery of}} the {{painting}} is why Mona Lisa features very faint eyebrows and apparently {{does not have any}} eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal Cotte, a French engineer and inventor, says he discovered with a high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes. Creating an ultra-high resolution close-up that magnified Mona Lisas face 24 times, Cotte says he found a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left eye. [...] "One day I <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow," [...] said Cotte. The engineer claims that other eyebrow hairs that potentially could have appeared on the painting may have faded or been inadvertently erased by a poor attempt to clean the painting. In addition, Cotte says his work uncovered proof that her hands were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E
