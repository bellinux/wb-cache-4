Other sensors on the SDI-12 bus ignore the command and return to low-power standby mode. The protocol also specifies a retry mechanism to overcome any data corruption.

Under {{the control of the}} distributed SVPWM strategy, the inverter PEBB modules generate their target output voltage vectors separately, operating simultaneously with the command of the synchronization signal <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> the <b>master</b> module or the upper level controller. When a synchronization error exists, the line-to-line output voltage will contain some noncharacteristic harmonic components. This paper systemically analyzes the impact of synchronization error on the system performance. Conclusions are derived from the double Fourier analysis, MATLAB simulation, and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an evaluation process of performance optimization between two different approaches based on mobile agent's technology. Results are simulated using wireless environment network in which different mobile agents communicate through performance messaging model. The environment involves set of master mobile agents working on clients, set of slave agents and communication messaging scheme. The first approach utilized a stationary agent that records slave response {{time for one}} message <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> a <b>master</b> agent. The stationary agent carries out a mathematical model based on Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) and finally it computes the optimized time and distributes messages among master agents to their slaves. The second approach is studied via a computing agent that utilizes an Assignment Computation Development Method (ACDM) that computes the final minimized time. This approach carries out an algorithm and is analyzed by comparing optimality between agents...|$|R
