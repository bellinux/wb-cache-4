40|$|For a {{cylindrical}} aluminum conductor, 0. 2 cm {{in diameter}} and loaded by a current pulse from an overdamped discharge with an initial current rate of 490 kA/Mys, <b>dynamic</b> <b>pinch</b> compression and temperature rise have been calculated. The numerical solution for the azimuthal distribution of the pinch pressure, obtained by applying Picard's method of successive iteration, consists of the superposition of a quasi-stationary and a transient term. In the very initial phase of pinching a steep, narrow pressure pulse is created {{below the surface of}} the wire which converges at the center, thereby broadening in width, growing in strength, and increasing in propagation velocity. Already in the early stage of current flow at about 0. 4 mys, well before reaching maximum current and pinch pressure, the quasi-stationary term becomes dominant. Then the conductor is compressed quite homogeneously with the exception of a narrow shell below the surface where maximum pressure gradients exist.

40|$|Background: Intracapsular {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} femur {{account for a}} major share of fractures in the elderly. The primary goal of treatment is to return the patient {{to his or her}} pre-fracture functional status. There are multiple internal fixation options (<b>screws,</b> <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw</b> plate or blade plates) and hemi and total hip arthroplasty. Open reduction and internal fixation has been shown to have a high rate of revision surgery due to nonunion and avascular necrosis. Hip replacement arthroplasty (hemi or total) is a viable treatment option. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four elderly patients (age&# 62; 70 years) with a femoral neck fracture were treated over a five-year period (January 2001 to December 2006). Eighty of the 84 patients underwent some form of hip replacement after appropriate medical and anesthetic fitness. Results: We had good results in all the patients in terms of return to pre-fracture level of activity, independent ambulation and satisfaction with the procedure. Patients over the age of 80 years who underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasty all progressed well without any complication. Patients in their seventies underwent some form of total hip replacement and barring one case of deep infection, two cases of deep vein thrombosis and three cases of dislocation (which were managed conservatively), there were no real complications. Conclusion: Hip replacement (hemi or total) is a successful procedure for the elderly population over 70 years with femoral neck fractures. Return to pre-morbid level of activity and independent functions occur very swiftly, avoiding the hazards of prolonged incumbency. We have proposed a treatment algorithm following the results of treatment of this fracture in our series.

40|$|Periprosthetic {{fractures}} of the femur after {{total hip arthroplasty}} are a big orthopaedic problem, {{particularly in}} elderly patients and quite a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. There is no universal method in treating these fractures. Rigid plates fixation can be limited and aggravated especially in the proximal part of the femur where the endoprosthesis stem {{does not allow for}} an undisturbed fixation of both femur cortexes by means of <b>screws.</b> Mitkovic’s <b>dynamic</b> internal fixator is an original implant allowing for an undisturbed fixation of both femur cortexes regardless of the presence of the endoprosthesis stem. Fixation is made possible by means of movable clamps and a convergent possibility to place <b>screws.</b> A <b>dynamic</b> internal fixator can fix all types of periprosthetic femoral fractures. The paper shows the early experience in fixating periprosthetic femoral fractures after total hip arthroplasty in 14 patients, average age 69, 7. According to Vancouver classification, 3 patients had the type A fracture, 9 patients had the type B fracture, and 2 patients had the type C fracture. All fractures were fixed by Mitkovic’s dynamic internal fixator. The fracture occurred 2 - 12 years after primary total hip arthroplasty. The follow- up of the operated patients was 12 months. The method is less invasive than the methods described in books. Mechanical complications are not likely to appear due to the fracture dynamics along the femoral shaft axis, which is made possible by this implant.

40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, linear <b>dynamic</b> <b>pinches</b> (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the stabilized pinch appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma. If these turn out to be due to the newly predicted surface hydromagnetic instabilities, then we know how to overcome these and the outlook may be better than ever.

For science-based structural design of extrusion mixing equipment is important to know the basic patterns of mixing processes that occur in its various structural zones.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate single- vs. multiple-implant fixation regarding strength and stiffness.

Fifteen subjects performed self-paced repetitive hand-action tasks for 3. 5 min {{at a rate of}} about 3 Hz. Either acceleration, pressure or force signal was acquired with MEG and EMG signals during (1) flexions–extensions of right-hand fingers, with thumb touching the other fingers (acceleration; free), (2) <b>dynamic</b> index–thumb <b>pinches</b> against an elastic rubber ball attached to a pressure sensor (pressure and acceleration; squeeze), and (3) brief fixed-finger-position index–thumb pinches against a rigid load cell (force; fixed-pinch). Significant coherence occurred between MEG and all the four peripheral measures at the fundamental frequency of the hand action (F 0) and its first harmonic (F 1). In all tasks, the cortical sources contributing to the cross-correlograms were located at the contralateral hand SM 1 cortex, with average inter-source distance (mean±SEM) of 9. 5 ± 0. 3 mm. The coherence was stronger with respect to pressure (0. 40 ± 0. 03 in squeeze) and force (0. 38 ± 0. 04 in fixed-pinch) than acceleration (0. 24 ± 0. 03 in free) and EMG (0. 25 ± 0. 02 in free, and 0. 29 ± 0. 04 in fixed-pinch). The results imply that the SM 1 cortex is strongly coherent at F 0 and F 1 with hand-action-related pressure and force, in addition to the previously demonstrated EMG, velocity, and acceleration.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} treatment for {{chronic back pain}} due to disc degeneration, motion preserving techniques, such as posterior dynamic stabilization, have been introduced clinically. The intention of such treatment is to alter the load transfer and kinematics to prevent accelerated degeneration in adjacent segments {{as well as to}} delay further degeneration at the affected level. Two main implant groups have evolved for posterior dynamic stabilization: namely pedicle <b>screw</b> based <b>dynamic</b> stabilization and interspinous implants. For both groups, numerous implants are available with a diverse range of design features and materials. Although both groups are used for a myriad of clinical indications, no substantial differences are apparent. For both implant types, the current understanding of which design is most effective for various clinical indications remains unclear. Additionally, a better knowledge of performance criteria for each implant would be beneficial in a clinical setting. With a lack of high level evidence from clinical studies, implementation of these systems is based solely on empirical data, neglecting the biomechanical impact of each individual implant. This deficiency is reflected by the high complication rate reported for these systems. Although there are biomechanical studies for single implant types from the two groups, there is still ambiguity regarding the general effect of the systems, demanding {{a deeper understanding of the}} design’s biomechanical consequences. Should an evidence-based understanding of the possible clinical indications be developed, the implants could be designed specifically to comply with these clinical requirements. Furthermore, the design related biomechanical impact of the systems are not available, which is mandatory to facilitate a physiologically relevant preclinical testing to improve device safety. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the influence of design parameters for <b>dynamic</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> systems and interspinous implants on kinematics and load bearing characteristics through in vitro testing. Furthermore, a physiologically relevant test setup for real <b>dynamic</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> systems was derived. An individual biomechanical impact was observed in each <b>dynamic</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> system. It was determined that the degree of intersegmental stabilization and the anterior load transfer (in the sagittal and frontal planes) is dependent on the axial rod stiffness, while in the transverse plane it is dependent on the design itself. Based on the center of rotation findings for the pedicles screw systems with low implant stiffness (indicated as true dynamic systems), a kinematically relevant test setup for the three principle motion planes was derived. Also for each interspinous implant a unique biomechanical characteristics was determined, whereas intersegmental stabilization and load transfer could be influenced in the sagittal plane only. In extension, the compression stiffness of the implants was observed to correlate with stabilization and reduction of intradiscal pressure, whereas in flexion, the stiffness in tension correlates only with stabilization. The findings support the conclusion that a global indication is not apparent for the implant groups as a whole or for a single design within the group. This is a result of the unique biomechanical impact of each individual implant design. Furthermore, the influence of design parameters of pedicle <b>screw</b> based <b>dynamic</b> implants and interspinous implants on intersegmental kinematics and load transfer was investigated. The findings of this investigation facilitate a functional approach to the design by incorporating clinical demand. Based on the results of this study, clinical indications for each individual design of posterior dynamic stabilization devices should be thoroughly reconsidered...|$|R

Either acceleration, pressure or force signal was acquired with MEG and EMG signals during (1) flexions–extensions of right-hand fingers, with thumb touching the other fingers (acceleration; free), (2) <b>dynamic</b> index–thumb <b>pinches</b> against an elastic rubber ball attached to a pressure sensor (pressure and acceleration; squeeze), and (3) brief fixed-finger-position index–thumb pinches against a rigid load cell (force; fixed-pinch). Significant coherence occurred between MEG and all the four peripheral measures at the fundamental frequency of the hand action (F 0) and its first harmonic (F 1). In all tasks, the cortical sources contributing to the cross-correlograms were located at the contralateral hand SM 1 cortex, with average inter-source distance (mean ± SEM) of 9. 5 ± 0. 3 mm. The coherence was stronger with respect to pressure (0. 40 ± 0. 03 in squeeze) and force (0. 38 ± 0. 04 in fixed-pinch) than acceleration (0. 24 ± 0. 03 in free) and EMG (0. 25 ± 0. 02 in free, and 0. 29 ± 0. 04 in fixed-pinch). The results imply that the SM 1 cortex is strongly coherent at F 0 and F 1 with hand-action-related pressure and force, in addition to the previously demonstrated EMG, velocity, and acceleration. All these measures, especially force and pressure, are potential tools for functional mapping of the SM 1 cortex. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} reinforced calcium phosphate cement augmentation of the femoral neck defect created after <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw</b> removal in a cadaveric model. Methods: The lag <b>screws</b> of <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw</b> implants were inserted and subsequently removed in 8 matched pairs of cadaveric, osteoporotic femurs to create a femoral neck defect. One of each pair had the defect augmented with osteoconductive calcium phosphate cement reinforced with poly(lactide-coglycolide) fibers (Norian ReinforcedTM, Synthes, West Chester, PA), and the other defect was not augmented. Each specimen was first cyclically loaded with 750 N vertical loads applied for 1000 cycles to simulate early weightbearing, and then loaded to failure. Results: Calcium phosphate cement augmentation of the lag screw defect significantly increased the mean femoral neck failure strength (4819 N) compared to specimens in which the defect was left untreated (3995 N) (P, 0. 004). The mechanism of failure for each specimen was a fracture through the femoral neck. Regression analysis demonstrated that load to failure was directly related to the bone mineral density at Ward’s triangle, and the impact of cement augmentation on failure strength was greatest for specimens with the lowest bone mineral density (correlation coefficient: 20. 82, P, 0. 0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that augmentation of the bony defect created by <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw</b> removal with reinforced calcium phosphate cement significantly improved the failure strength of the bone. Cement augmentation after hardware removal may decrease the risk of refracture and allow early weightbearing, especially in elderly patients with osteoporotic bone.

40|$|Abstract: Background: No {{consensus}} exists {{regarding the}} optimal treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures. We report {{our experience of}} managing 13 patients with ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures by using either cannulated <b>screws</b> or <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screws</b> for the neck and retrograde femoral nail for the shaft. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the function; outcome and healing of that complicated fractures. Material and methods: A consent was taken from thirteen patients who sustained ipsilateral femoral shaft and neck fractures from January 2007 and March 2011 in El Minoufiya University Hospital in Egypt. 10 patients with fracture neck femur had been treated with cannulated screws while 3 patients were treated by <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw.</b> all fractures shaft had been treated with retrograde femoral nail [...] The mean follow up period was 18 months with range from 12 - 36 months. Results: There were 10 males and 3 females. The average age was 31 years old with range of 19 - 45 years. The mean follow up period was 18 months with range from 12 - 36 months. The average healing period of femoral neck fracture was 14 weeks and all femoral neck fractures united. Average union time for femoral shaft fractures was 19 weeks (range, 16 – 36 weeks). Three femoral shaft fractures needed bone graft at six months. Conclusions: The treatment methods used in the present study achieved satisfactory functional outcome in these complex fractures. The femoral neck fracture should preferably be stabilized first. [Mohamed E. Habib, Yasser S. Hannout and Ahmed F. Shams. Treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaf...|$|R
40|$|Objective Unstable intertrochanteric {{fractures}} {{continue to}} be a challenge for orthopedic surgeons due to the functional limitations it results in the postoperative period. Anatomical reconstruction of the posteromedial fragment becomes difficult through conventional lateral approach, leading to excessive fracture collapse and limping. Materials and Methods: prospective, nonrandomized study was done with 40 patients. They were operated in prone position through posterior approach. Cancellous screws or SS-wires were used to fix the greater or lesser trochanteric fragments and <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screw</b> (DHS) or <b>dynamic</b> condylar <b>screw</b> (DCS) for the main two fragments. Bone grafts were used to pack cavities at the posterior trochanteric regions. Results: Fracture healing occurred earlier compared to conventional lateral approach without excessive fracture collapse in majority of cases (average time to achieve union was 13. 8 weeks; range: 10 – 18 weeks). Good functional recovery was noted with 75 % 'Good' or 'Excellent' Harris Hip Scores at 24 weeks. Conclusion: Anatomical reconstruction of unstable trochanteric fractures becomes easier through posterior approach with earlier and better functional recovery...|$|R
40|$|As {{health care}} costs increase, {{evaluating}} treatment methods in femoral neck fractures to determine the most effective treatment paradigm will become increasingly important. The current study compared two methods of treatment in similar cohorts of displaced femoral neck fractures. One hundred and twenty two patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups: In Group A, 62 patients were treated with a hemiarthroplasty. In group B, 60 patients were treated with <b>dynamic</b> <b>screw</b> fixation. Patients were evaluated at a minimum 3 year follow-up. Using the Matta functional hip score, 42 % of group A and 70 % of group B had good to excellent results. This difference was significant (p = 0. 004). A significant agreement between physician assessment using the Matta score, and patient perception of outcome using the SF- 36 scale was demonstrated (r = 0. 64). No statistical difference between groups for revision surgery existed. Both physician based and patient based outcome scores favour retention and internal fixation of the femoral head in this cohort of patients at a short-term follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Humeral shaft {{fractures}} {{respond well}} to conservative treatment and unite without much problem. Since it is uncommon, {{there is not much}} discussion regarding the management of nonunion in the literature, and hence this is a challenge to the treating orthopaedic surgeon. Osteoporosis of the fractured bone and stiffness of the surrounding joints compounds the situation further. The Ilizarov fixator, locking compression plate, and vascularised fibular graft are viable options in this scenario but are technically demanding. We used a fibular strut graft for bridging the fracture site in order to enhance the pull-out strength of the <b>screws</b> of the <b>dynamic</b> compression plate. Six patients in the study had successful uneventful union of the fracture at the last follow-up. The fibula is easy to harvest and produces less graft site morbidity. None of the study patients needed additional iliac crest bone grafting. This is the largest reported series of patients with osteoporotic atrophic nonunion of humerus successfully treated solely using the combination of an intramedullary fibular strut graft and dynamic compression plate...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} observational study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a percutaneous screws system {{in the treatment of}} lumbar pain caused by high-level disc degeneration combined with facet joint hypertrophy and canal stenosis especially in the L 5 -S 1 levels. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (25 males, 13 females, mean age 63 years) with lumbar pain and/or neuralgia-claudication were treated with interpeduncular <b>dynamic</b> <b>screws.</b> Diagnosis was based on clinical history evaluation and X-ray, CT, and MR examinations. All patients completed the visual analogic scale (VAS) for evaluation of clinical efficacy and pain measurement both before and after (1 month and after 2 years) the procedure. Patients also were given the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after treatment. The area of the neuroforamina also was measured. RESULTS: Thirty-eight intervertebral spaces were treated. The VAS pain scale showed a reduction of pain symptoms at 1 month and after 2 years (VAS pre 8. 7 ± 1. 1; after 1 month 5. 1 ± 2. 2; after 2 years 6. 5 ± 2. 1; p = 0. 001).

40|$|Background No {{consensus}} exists {{regarding the}} optimal treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures. The three major {{issues related to}} these fractures are the optimal timing of surgery, which fracture to stabilize first, and the optimal implant to use. In {{an effort to find}} answers to these three key issues, we report our experience of managing 27 patients with ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures by using two different treatment methods, i. e., reconstruction-type intramedullary nailing and various plate combinations. Materials and methods We divided patients into two groups. Group I included 15 patients (13 males and 2 females) who were operated with cancellous lag <b>screws</b> or <b>dynamic</b> hip <b>screws</b> (DHS) for fractured neck and com-pression plate fixation for fractured shaft of the femur. Group II included 12 patients (11 males and 1 female) who were operated with reconstruction-type intramedullary nailing. Results Mean age was 33. 2 and 37. 9 years in group I and II, respectively. Mean delay in surgery was 5. 9 and 5. 4 days in group I and II, respectively. Average union time for femoral neck fracture in groups I and II were 15. 2 and 17. 1 weeks, respectively; and for shaft fracture these times were 20. 3 and 22. 8 weeks, respectively. There were 13 (86. 6 %) good, 1 (6. 7 %) fair and 1 (6. 7 %) poor functional results in group I. There were 10 (83. 3 %) good, 1 (8. 3 %) fair and 1 (8. 3 %) poor functional results in group II. Conclusions Both of the treatment methods {{used in the present study}} achieved satisfactory functional outcome in these complex fractures. Fixation with plate for shaft and screws or DHS for hip is easy from a technical point of view. Choice of the treatment method should be dictated primarily by the type of femoral neck fracture and the surgeon’s familiarity with the treatment method chosen. The femoral neck fracture should preferably be stabilized first, and a delay of 5 – 6 days does not affect the ultimate functional outcome...|$|R
