50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump <b>suction</b> <b>main</b> through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E

To develop such compressors the performance of the most important compressor´s components must be increased. However, the pressure for fast time to market are turning more difficulty the optimization process of a big amount of components, specially using experimental validations. One of the most important components in the compressor is the <b>suction</b> muffler. The <b>main</b> <b>suction</b> muffler functions are the thermal insulation of gas from the evaporator and noise attenuation. To increase the performance of muffler is mandatory to modify the length and diameter of tubes, the geometry and volume of chambers. During the muffler development is common the necessity of modifications in at least six parameters, and is easy to verify that, with this number of parameters is almost impossible to find the optimized solution only using the iterative method, so, it is necessary to use some algorithm to optimize all these parameters to find the best solution for the suction muffler. This paper presents a series of suction muffler optimization, using in house computational code for muffler simulation and the commercial code modeFRONTIER to optimize the objective functions. The optimizing algorithms selected to this task are Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-Objective Game Theory (MOGT) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm II (MOGA-II).

We explored (i) which stress and disturbance factors were {{highly correlated with}} species richness, (ii) whether the intermediate stress hypothesis (ISH) and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) {{can be applied to}} alpine ecosystems, and (iii) whether standing crop can be used as an easily measurable surrogate for causal factors determining species richness in the alpine zone. Species numbers and standing crop were determined in 14 alpine plant communities in the Swiss Alps.

Daily maximum temperature and pH affect species richness both directly and via their effects on other environmental variables. Some stress and disturbance factors were related to species richness in a monotonic way, others in an unimodal way. Monotonic relationships suggest that the harsher the environment is, the fewer species can survive in such habitats. In cases of unimodal relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of most geotechnical structures is highly governed by environmental factors, particularly in tropical regions {{where there are}} very pronounced dry and wet seasons. Design of earth retaining structures generally tend to be too conservative due to the uncertainty generated by the incorporation of environmental variables.

Rainfall is the main aspect that affects the soil properties of a particular site. It modifies the soil suction potential, according to the degree of saturation caused by the soil-atmosphere interaction.

40|$|Objective: Minimal extracorporeal {{circulation}} (mini-ECC) {{is a new}} technology, consisting of a centrifugal pump, an oxygenator, and a modified <b>suction</b> system. The <b>main</b> advantage of mini-ECC is the reduction of tubing length (reduction of the priming volume). Additional beneficial effects are a decrease of coagulation cascade and a reduction of blood transfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. We compared the intraoperative and early postoperative myocardial damage and outcome of patients who underwent CABG surgery with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or mini-ECC. Methods: One hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery at our institution were prospectively studied. Fifty-four patients (39. 7 %) were operated with mini-ECC. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. The most interesting intraoperative details as well as in-hospital outcome were assessed. Results: There {{was no difference in}} mortality between the two groups. Cross-clamping time was similar in both groups (p = 0. 07). Defibrillation was required in one patient in the mini-ECC group (1. 9 %) and in 38 patients (46. 3 %) in the CPB group (p < 0. 001). In the mini-ECC group, the requirement of inotropic support and incidence of atrial fibrillation was significantly lower than in the CPB group.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present the {{application}} of time-lapse non invasive 3 D micro-electrical tomography (ERT) to monitor soil-plant interactions in the root zone. The goal {{of the study is}} to better understand the soil-vegetation interactions by the use of non invasive technique, and how this dynamical process can be monitored by time lapse geophysical measurements to explain water balance exchanges in the upper subsoil critical zone. We designed, built and installed a 3 D electrical tomography apparatus for the monitoring of the root zone of a single apple tree in an orchard located in the Trentino region, Northern Italy. The micro-ERT apparatus consists of 48 buried electrodes on 4 instrumented micro boreholes plus 24 mini-electrodes on the ground surface. We collected repeated ERT and TDR soil moisture measurements for about one year and performed three different controlled irrigation tests: one during a very dry summer and, during a highly dynamic plant growing spring period and one during a very wet autumn period. We also performed laboratory analysis on soil specimens, in order to evaluate the electrical response at different saturation steps. The results demonstrate that 3 D micro-ERT is able to characterize subsoil conditions and monitor root zone activities, especially in terms of root zone suction regions. In particular, we note that in very dry conditions, 3 D micro ERT is able to image water plumes on the shall subsoil produced using a drip irrigation system. In the very dynamic growing season, under induced widespread irrigation, micro 3 D ERT can detect the <b>main</b> <b>suction</b> zones caused by the tree root activity. Complex interactions between soil moisture and pore water salinity complicate the interpretation.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, several advancements {{have been made}} in the {{research}} area of the mechanics of unsaturated soils. These advancements can be categorized into two groups; (i) development (or improvement) of testing techniques (or apparatus) to determine the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils and (ii) development of (numerical, empirical or semi-empirical) models to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to suction based on the experimental results. Implementation of the mechanics of unsaturated soils in conventional geotechnical engineering practice, however, has been rather limited. The key reasons for the limited practical applications may be attributed to the lack of simple and reliable methods for (i) measuring soil suction in the field quickly and reliably and (ii) estimating the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to <b>suction.</b> The <b>main</b> objective of this thesis research is to develop simple and reliable techniques, models or approaches that can be used in geotechnical engineering practice to estimate sol suction and the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils. This research can be categorized into three parts. In the First Part, simple techniques are proposed to estimate the suction values of as-compacted unsaturated fine-grained soils using a pocket penetrometer and a conventional tensiometer. The suction values less than 300 kPa can be estimated using a strong relationship between the compressive strength measured using a pocket penetrometer and matric suction value. The high suction values in the range of 1, 200 kPa to 60, 000 kPa can be estimated using the unique relationship between the initial tangent of conventional tensiometer response versus time behavior and suction value. In the Second Part, approaches or semi-empirical models are proposed to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to suction, which include: -	Bearing capacity of unsaturated fine-grained soils -	Variation of bearing capacity of unsaturated fine-grained soils with respect to matric suction -	Variation of initial tangent elastic modulus of unsaturated soils below shallow foundations with respect to matric suction -	Variation of maximum shear modulus with respect to matric suction for unsaturated non-plastic sandy soils (i. e. plasticity index, Ip = 0 %) In the Third Part, approaches (or methodologies) are suggested to simulate the vertically applied stress versus surface settlement behavior of shallow foundations in unsaturated coarse-grained soils assuming elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. These methodologies are extended to simulate the stress versus settlement behavior of both model footings and in-situ plates in unsaturated coarse-grained soils. The results show that there is a reasonably good comparison between the measured values (i. e. soil suction, bearing capacity, elastic and shear modulus) and those estimated using the techniques or models proposed in this thesis research. The models (or methodologies) proposed in this thesis research are promising and encouraging for modeling studies and practicing engineers to estimate the variation of mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils with respect to matric suction...|$|R
40|$|The {{laboratory}} study on unsaturated soil may comprise {{the study of}} devices or apparatus used {{and the study of}} the behaviour of soil itself. In both, <b>suction</b> is the <b>main</b> issue of the study’s concern. One of the common devices for unsaturated soil strength-testing is a suction-controlled direct shear box. With this device, suction is generated by controlling water pressure and air pressure during the test. A relatively rare method in unsaturated soil testing is suction-monitored direct shear. In this test, soil suction is not controlled; rather it is directly monitored by attaching the tensiometer to the top cap of the shear box. For flexible pavement design, a very common laboratory test is the California Bearing Ratio (CBR). The CBR {{has been used as a}} semi-empirical approach for predicting the bearing capacity of sub-grade soil since the 1920 ’s. The effect of water content on the CBR is commonly investigated in this type of study. Even though suction is one of the key parameters affecting unsaturated soil behaviour, the effect of soil suction on the CBR is not usually taken into account. This may be due to the difficulty in measuring soil suction while the performing the CBR test. The main objective of this study is to review the behaviour and capability of a suction-monitored direct shear device and to introduce a modified CBR test device in which suction is taken into consideration during the test. A series of laboratory tests was carried out consisting of a saturated direct shear test, an unsaturated direct shear test, and a suction-monitored CBR test on both soaked and unsoaked CBR using the artificial soil of sand and sand-kaolin clay mixtures. During the tests, suction was generated naturally by controlling the specimen in different water content values. For this, the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) was a very useful tool for predicting the desired specimen water content and/or matric suction. Suction-monitored direct shear and CBR devices were successfully used for the specimens where matric suction was less than 80 kPa. The tensiometer performed effectively during the test. The results indicated that the presence of kaolin clay in the mixture, to some extent, led to the increase in unsaturated shear strength and the CBR. In general, matric suction versus unsaturated shear strength and matric suction versus CBR curves exhibited bi-linear curves with the inflection points occurring around the air entry value (AEV). The correlation between CBR and unsaturated shear strength was developed by plotting the failure envelopes resulting from unsaturated direct shear and unsaturated CBR tests. The range of R-square was between 0. 87 and 0. 99. The high R-square value of the equations indicated that the correlations were reasonable. This correlation may be applicable only for these particular specimens in the range of suction between 0 and 80 kPa...|$|R
40|$|Transonic buffet is a {{well known}} {{phenomenon}} of quasi-periodic shock oscillation with associated unsteady flow separation occurring on the suction side of airfoils in the transonic regime, and as such it has important impact in external aero dynamics and in turbomachinery. Transonic buffet is responsible for severe, low-frequency excitation of structural components, with incurred strong vibrations which in worst case may threaten the integrity of aircraft. The buffet mechanism {{has been the subject}} of several experimental and numerical studies, many of which are summarized in the review paper of [4]. However, to date there is no consensus on what its causes may be. The most commonly accepted scenario involves an acoustic feedback loop, whereby the shock motion produces the unsteady shedding of eddies towards the trailing edge, where they scatter acoustic waves. Those waves travel upstream through the outer potential flow, thus reaching the shock foot and closing the loop. An alternative explanation [8] suggests that buffet is primarily associated with the intrinsic dynamics of the separation bubble, which periodically grows and bursts as it reaches the airfoil trailing edge. In this scenario, the shock would play an essentially passive role. A recent thorough scrutiny of the possible mechanisms underlying transonic buffet was carried out by the present research group [5]. Numerical simulations including LES, DES and RANS were used to reach the following conclusions: i) buffet dynamics is inherently limited to the suction side, and pressure waves propagating upstream on the pressure side have no dynamical effect; ii) the acoustic mechanism, while being possible is in significant disagreement with the numerical data, and not supported by available evidence. Another important finding was that RANS is capable of predicting transonic buffet with good accuracy, hence it is unlikely that the scattering of acoustic waves from eddies at the trailing edge (which is not resolved in RANS) may be advocated as a convincing explanation. Hence, we are personally more prone to believe that buffet arises as a result of the breathing motion of the separation bubble. Whatever its causes may be, the control of transonic buffet {{has been the subject of}} several past investigations, which had variable degree of success. Two main types of actuation have mainly been considered: i) periodic deflection of the trailing edge to counteract shock excursion [2]; ii) airfoil-mounted vortex generators and bumps to mitigate the strength of the shock/boundary layer interaction [6, 3]. In the present research we propose a novel technique for buffet control based on the use of deployable tabs. We show that these are capable of fully suppressing buffet, with minimal loss of aerodynamic efficiency. Numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations relying on the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are hereafter presented to show the feasibility of a new type of controlscheme for buffet suppression. The finite-volume solver relies on a baseline second-order discretization which guarantees discrete preservation of the total flow kinetic energy from convection in the inviscid limit [9]. The scheme is made to switch to third-order weighted essentially-non-oscillatory (WENO) near discontinuities, as controlled by a shock sensor. The gradients normal to the cell faces needed for the viscous fluxes, are evaluated through second-order central-difference approximations, obtaining compact stencils and avoiding numerical odd-even decoupling phenomena. Of special importance in the study of external flows is the correct enforcement of the far-field numerical boundary conditions. Here, we rely on characteristic decomposition to identify waves entering and leaving the domain and estimate the contribution of outgoing waves at the boundary through extrapolation of interior information. Time advancement of the semi-discretized system of ODEs resulting from the spatial discretization is carried out by means of an semi-implicit low-storage third-order Runge-Kutta algorithm [7], whereby the convective and the viscous terms in the wall-normal direction are handled implicitly through Beam-Warming linearization. As a representative geometry we have considered the V 2 C airfoil, a supercritical laminar profile designed by Dassault Aviation within the TFAST European research project ([URL] A structured C-type mesh including 1024 x 512 cells was used for all simulations, in which the external boundary is placed 50 chords away from the airfoil surface, and which has the first point off the wall at a distance Dy/c = 0. 000065, corresponding to about 0. 6 wall units. For the purpose of controlling the flow and suppressing buffet, we herein propose to use a deployable flap, which is placed in the aft part of the airfoil <b>suction</b> side. The <b>main</b> rationale is to mimic the behavior of shock holders, which are frequently used in experiments to stabilize normal shock waves [1]. Another plausible reason is that a wall-parallel flap would create a ‘channeling’ effect with the airfoil surface, which mitigates the adverse pressure gradient, thus reducing the separated flow extent. Probably, the two effects are related to each other. For preliminary simulations, the flap has been shaped as a bi-convex airfoil. Two sample configurations have been considered, namely a HIGH configuration, with flap chord cf/c = 0. 2, relative thickness of 6...|$|R

Kumlu kil numunesi İstanbul Güneşli bölgesinden elde edilmiş olup, diğer numuneler daha önce yapılmış çalışmalardan elde edilmiştir. Laboratuvar çalışmaları Şubat 2014 – Temmuz 2014 tarihleri arasında İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Ord. Prof Dr. Hamdi Peynircioğlu Zemin Mekaniği Laboratuvarı’nda gerçekleştirilmiştir. Deneyler iki aşamalı olarak yapılmıştır. İlk aşama zeminin mühendislik ve fiziksel özelliklerinin belirlendiği; elek analizi, hidrometre, Atterberg limitleri analizi, piknometre, {{standart}} kompaksiyon ve kesme kutusu deneyleridir. İkinci aşamada ise zeminin doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği parametrelerini belirleyebilmek için basınç plakası deneyi uygulanmıştır.

Numunelerde kum oranı arttıkça; doygun ve doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği ilkelerine göre yapılan analizlerin sonuçları arasındaki fark azalmaktadır. Yeraltı su seviyesinin yükselmesiyle her üç numunede de doygun ve doygun olmayan kabuller için elde edilen güvenlik sayıları birbirlerine yaklaşmakta; zeminin suya tamamen doygun olduğu durumda elde edilen güvenlik sayıları ise aynı olmaktadır. Şevler doygun duruma gelmeden de göçmeler meydana gelebildiğinden, doygun olmayan zemin mekaniğinin önemi artmaktadır. Analysis of {{slope stability}} {{is one of}} the main issues of geotechnical engineering. Natural or human made slopes’ problems are focus area, which geotechnical engineers have to bring a solution. There are main acceptances, which base on saturated soil mechanic principles to analyze slope stability.  However, this approach sometimes causes the uneconomical solutions. According to researches that were made in the last years, unsaturated soil mechanichs approach has been started to use in the slope stability analyses and this approach creates the economical and reliable results for slope stability analyses.   Depending of the developments in the technology, the laboratory devices has been used widely and the quality of devices has increased. Thanks to this development, soil mechanich acceptances has been started to change. The unsaturated soil mechanichs principles are one result of this change. In the scope of this thesis, the effects of properties of unsaturated soil mechanic’s parameters to factor of safety of slopes were searched. Effects of changing of ground water table level on the factor of safety of slopes and the different impacts of unsaturated soil mechanic principles on the various soil types were the main topics in the thesis. Although the unsaturated soil mechanic approach has been appeared since early of 1900 ’s, the development of acceptances has begun for last twenty years because of reasons, which was mentioned above paragraph. Especially for the dry conditions and the conditions where the ground water table level is far from the surface, the unsaturated soil mechanic parameters affect the stability of slopes, bearing capacity of foundations, consolidation and infiltration of soils. Unsaturated soil mechanic researches remark that the unsaturated soil parameters should not be ignored especially for clay soils. In this thesis, factor of safety that obtained from the results of slope stability analysis of sandy clay, low plasticity clay and poor graded sand soil are examined with the change of ground water table level for saturated and unsaturated soil mechanics principles.  The sandy clay sample is from Günesli vicinity of Istanbul and the other samples are got from the other researches. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, laboratory tests are available. The laboratory tests were performed in the Ord. Prof. Dr. Hamdi Peynircioğlu Soil Mechanics Laboratory, Istanbul Technical University between the dates February of 2014 and July of 2014.  The tests were performed by two stages. In the first stage, sieve analyses, hydrometer, Atterberg limits, pycnometer, standard compaction and direct shear tests are available. The second stage consists of pressure plate test, which gives the unsaturated soil properties. In the light of sieve analysis and Atterbeg limits, the soil sample that was obtained from the field was described as low plasticity clay according to Unified Soil Classification System. The samples, which were used for direct shear test and pressure plate test, were preapeared as near the optimum conditions these are defined from standart proctor test. The other samples, which were used for slope stability analyses have experienced to same tests from other researchers with sample obtained from field.   The Sample I is the sample which the experimentals applied in the labarotory by author of this thesis. The Sample II was taken from Gülsen’s research and the classifition of the soil is poor graded sand. The Sample II consists of 100 percent sand. The sample III is named as Indian Head Till is from Kutlu’s research. According to Unified Soil Classification System, the soil is low plasticity clay. For each soil samples, the parameters that were used in slope stability analyses were defined. These parameters were effective cohesion (c’) and effective internal friction angle (ɸ’) for saturated and unsaturated soil acceptances and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and matric suction for unsaturated soil acceptance. SWCC and matric suction was determined with pressure plate test for Sample I and Sample III and with tempe-pressure cell for Sample II. Both of the test devices use the axis translation technique. The axes translation technique was mentioned in the thesis with details.   Soil water characteristic curve {{is one of the}} main parameter, which specifies the behavior of unsaturated soils. Soil water characteristic curve is relationship of matric suction and degree or saturation or water content or volumetric water content. Soil water characteristic curve can be obtained from experimental, estimation or fitting methods. In the light of researches for the unsaturated soil mechanics, properties of soils as the clay or sand content, plasticity or coefficient of compressibility has significiant effects on the soil water characteristic curve. Suction pressure of soils is the other main parameter for unsaturated soil mechanic approaches. It includes both osmotic suction and matric suction parameters. Osmotic suction is related with chemical contents, which takes part in pores of soil. Because of difficulties to gauge the osmotic suction, it is usually neglected. Therefore, the matric <b>suction</b> becomes the <b>main</b> parameter for the suction pressure. The matric suction is difference between pore air pressure and pore water pressure. İt can be described as negative pore water pressure. Pore water pressure inceares under the ground water table level with depth and matric suction increases above the ground water table level. Researchs about unsaturated soil mechanics proove the positive effect of matric suction to the shear strength of soils. Because of ıts positive effects to the shear strength of soils, the calculations become more economical ıf we compare with saturated solution.   In the second part of the thesis, slope stability for saturated and unsaturated conditions was analyzed using parameters, which were obtained from experimental studies and the effect of unsaturated soil parameters on the factor of safety was defined. The change of factor of safety was examined with change of ground water table level. For each soil samples, same geometry of cross section was used for the models. Each stability of slopes was analyzed with the SLOPE/W, which takes part in GeoStudio packet programme. SLOPE/W programme benefits from Limit Eqiulibrium Methods. In the thesis, principles of Limit Equilibrium Methods and the usage of SLOPE/W are shared with details.  The results were obtained with Bishop Limit Equilibrium Method for each soil type. Mohr-Coulomb failure hpyothesis was accepted for the soil behavior. Three ground water conditions were examined for the solutions. For three soil samples, soil parameters for saturated and unsaturated acceptances were determined.    The first condition was the initial condition of the soils. There was no ground water level for initial conditions. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters that were defined for the analysis were effective cohesion and effective internal friction, which were obtained from direct shear tests and unit weight of the soils. For unsaturated soil acceptances, the matric suction value was acted to effective cohesion. Defined cohesion for dry condition according to unsaturated acceptances was greater value than defined effective cohesion according to saturated acceptances. For unsaturated soil acceptances, soil water characteristic curve was necessary to account the cohesion value. Beside the soil water characteristic curve, to describe the cohesion of unsaturated soil acceptances for dry conditions, effective cohesion that was obtained from direct shear test and matric suction of the soil must be contributed to calculation of cohesion. The calculation of cohesion according to unsaturated soil principles for dry condition was told with details in the next chapters.   In the second condition for the soils, the ground water table level was defined and systematically it was assessed nearer positions to surface of ground. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters which has determined for the stability analysis were effective cohesion, effective internal friction angle and unit weight of the soils. To get the factor of safety according to unsaturated soil acceptances, effective cohesion, effective internal friction angle, unit weight of soil and soil water characteristic curve were necessary. Soil water characteristic curve that was determined from experimental ways was defined in the programme related with volumetric water content and matric suction values.   For the third condition of the soil, soil pores was completely full of pore water. The ground water table level was fifty centimeter above of surface. The parameters were same with the conditions that ground water table level was defined. After the geometry of cross section, soil parameters and ground water conditions were defined, the factor of safety for the slope stability analyses was obtained.  SLOPE/W gave the crititical slip surfaces of circle and factor of safety for critical slip circle’s surface was the factor of safety value for the slope stability analyses.   The greatest factor of safety was obtained for the initial conditions according to unsaturated soil acceptance. The difference between saturated soil and unsaturated soil analyses was the most apparent value for Sample III. However, the difference was so little for the Sample II. That demonstrates, while the clay content was raising, unsaturated soil parameters had more significiant role in the shear strength theory.   While the ground water table level was increasing, factor of safety difference between saturated and unsaturated slope stability analyses decreased. This remarks that, while the soil was becoming more saturated, the effect of unsaturated soil parameters declined. With the increasing of ground water table level, factor of safety for unsaturated soil acceptances has significiantly declined for especially Sample III.   When the ground water table level was above of ground surface, there was no factor of safety difference between analyses with unsaturated soil principles and saturated soil principles. This is because there was no pore air pressure in the soil when the ground water table level above of ground surface. Because of this reason, unsaturated soil parameters had no effect on the shear strength of soils, when the soil pores were full of pore water. For the thesis, both of experimental and analytical studies were done. The results were presented with details. In the scope of the research, three soil samples were used. For a detailed study, the number of soil samples may increase. To define the ground water level, the rain infiltration case can be considered. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
