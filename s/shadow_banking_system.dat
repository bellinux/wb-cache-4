5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{financial}} crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve has been engaging in quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is a form of open market operation in which the Federal Reserve buys long-term U. S. government and other securities, versus traditional open market operations that occur through the short-term Treasury bill market. At the same time, the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> <b>system,</b> which is a system of financial intermediaries that perform unregulated credit intermediation outside of traditional banks, has contracted significantly. Some argue that this contraction is due to a collateral crunch induced by quantitative easing in the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> system—a crunch that occurred when the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program took high-quality collateral off the market. I will focus specifically on repurchase agreements, an instrument within the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> that uses the same types of securities that the Federal Reserve has been buying during quantitative easing as collateral, to determine whether quantitative easing has led to a contraction of the repurchase agreement market. I find that increases in Federal Reserve asset holdings from 2005 - 2013, and specifically during QE 1, are associated with decreases in primary dealer repurchase agreements. This shows that under certain circumstances, Federal Reserve asset purchases lead to contractions in the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> <b>system.</b> This paper aims to increase understanding of how monetary policy affects <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> and understanding of the unintended consequences of monetary policy, such as decreased <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> lending caused by quantitative easing...|$|R
25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007. Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels of leverage. This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher home prices. Since the bubble burst, {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E

The {{situation}} was dire; the economy had lost nearly 3.6 million jobs in 2008 and was shedding jobs at a nearly 800,000 per month rate when he took office. During September 2008, several major financial institutions either collapsed, were forced into mergers, or were bailed-out by the government. The financial system was nearly frozen, as the equivalent of a bank run on the essentially unregulated, non-depository <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> was in-progress.

The essentially unregulated <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> (e.g., investment banks, mortgage companies, money market mutual funds, etc.) had grown to rival the traditional, regulated depository banking system but without equivalent safeguards. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman described the run on the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> as the [...] "core of what happened" [...] to cause the crisis. [...] "As the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have {{realized that they were}} re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible—and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions.

40|$|<b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{emerged in}} the {{regulated}} <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> in the 1980 s and 1990 s when the traditional banking model became outmoded. <b>Banking</b> regulators encouraged <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{as the only way}} to preserve banks as viable entities in the financial system.

2500|$|Household debt grew {{dramatically}} {{during the}} period to a record level, rising from $7.4 trillion in Q1 2001 to $14.3 trillion in Q4 2008, an increase of $6.9 trillion. Measured {{as a percent of}} GDP, it rose from 70% GDP to 99% GDP. This debt addition was a driver of the housing bubble and crises that followed. When housing prices fell, but the value of the mortgage debt generally did not, many homeowners found themselves in a negative equity position (underwater) on their homes, driving a significant housing payment delinquency and foreclosure problem. This caused investors to question the value of mortgage-backed securities held by financial institutions, contributing to the run on the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

[...] Besides singing high praises for the book, Forbes links the message of the book and contemporary politics in developed countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Though the two countries are by far some of the most inclusive economies in the world, various parts of them are, by nature, extractive—for instance, the existence of a <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> of conglomerate manufacturers, and so on. He warns against extractive practices under the guise of an inclusive economy.|$|E
2500|$|Bernanke further {{explained}} that specific triggering events began in mid-2007, as investors began to withdraw {{funds from the}} <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> analogous to depositors withdrawing money from depository banks in past bank runs. Investors became unsure {{of the value of}} the securities (loan collateral) held by the shadow banks, as many derived their value from subprime mortgages. [...] Mortgage companies could no longer borrow money to originate mortgages, and many failed in 2007. The crisis accelerated in 2008, as the largest five U.S. investment banks, which had $4 trillion in liabilities by the end of 2007, could no longer obtain financing. They had grown increasingly dependent on short-term sources of financing (e.g., repurchase agreements), and were unable to obtain new funding from investors. These investment banks were forced to sell long-term securities at fire-sale prices to meet their daily financing needs, suffering enormous losses. Concerns about the possible failure of these banks led the financial system to essentially freeze by September 2008. The Federal Reserve increasingly intervened in its role as lender of last resort to stabilize the financial system as the crisis deepened.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the economic case for regulating <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> It asks three questions. First, what is <b>shadow</b> <b>banking?</b> Second, why <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> should be regulated. Third, how to regulate <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> efficiently. Although <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> is, like banking, based on maturity transformation, no definition of <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is ideal for}} regulatory purposes. Focusing on systemic risk, we take an instrument-based approach and define banking as leveraging on collateral to support liquidity promises. For regulation to be effective, however, this definition must be combined with other entity-based approaches. The economic rationale for regulating <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> is the negative externality stemming from systemic risk. Because uncertainty makes any measure of systemic risk imprecise, quantity regulation is preferable to a Pigovian tax {{to cope with this}} externality. Regulation should limit the leverage of <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> by imposing a minimum haircut regulation on the assets being used as collateral for funding. In theory, minimum haircuts regulation is an efficient way to constrain <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> However, the practical difficulties of monitoring leverage at the assets level call for an indirect regulation of institutional leverage, too. This is effectively achieved through the regulation of bank leverage, which increases the cost of liquidity puts to <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> Such risk-insensitive restrictions, however, undermine the efficiency of banking, whether official or shadow...|$|R
