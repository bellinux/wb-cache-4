5|$|Sound Transit {{suspended}} {{planning for}} the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected and found, through <b>soil</b> <b>testing,</b> that a deeper tunnel would be required. The project's costs overall rose $1 billion over budget and the schedule was delayed by three years, due to unrealistic cost and time estimates made during previous stages of planning. Capitol Hill businesses, while initially supportive of the light rail station's placement, later pulled their support of the cut and cover option due to the longer period required for construction. Sound Transit, faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options.|$|E

Soil P was analyzed using Bray- 1 (BP), Olsen (OP), and Mehlich- 3 (MP) methods as agronomic tests, and using Fe-oxide impregnated filter paper (FeP), anion-exchange resin membrane (RP), and water (WP) as environmental tests. There were linear relationships between soil P extractable with all the tests evaluated. The regression coefficients, R- 2, ranged from 0. 8164 to 0. 9409 between each two of the agronomic <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P, and ranged from 0. 4702 to 0. 8990 between each two of the environmental <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P, when the three soils were considered separately. When <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P was analyzed across all the three soils, the highest regression R- 2 was found between OP and MP (0. 7940) amongst agronomic <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P, and between FeP and RP amongst environmental <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P (0, 8842). While all of the three agronomic <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P was linearly related to each of the environmental <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P across the three soils, strongest relationships were found between OP and environmental <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P.

Phosphorus fertilizer recommendations for small grains based on this test are remarkably similar across the Western states. Despite the availability of this test, its proven accuracy (93 % in California), and its low cost ($ 1 /acre), most farmers in Arizona apply phosphorus fertilizer to their small grains crops {{without the benefit of}} a preplant <b>soil</b> <b>test.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate the effectiveness of the <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> in predicting a response to phosphorus fertilizer. At Maricopa, the <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> P was 8. 1 ppm, a variable response to P fertilizer was expected, and a variable response to P fertilizer was obtained.

The results confirmed the principle, recently proposed by the author, that the larger the negative effect of buffer capacity on extraction of labile phosphate by a <b>soil</b> <b>test,</b> the higher is the correlation between the <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> and plant yield response to phosphate. The acidic ammonium fluoride extractant of Bray and Kurtz was the most sensitive to buffering in this respect, while the alkaline sodium bicarbonate extractant of Olsen el al. was less sensitive and the modified sodium bicarbonate test of Colwell least sensitive to buffering. Whereas a previous glasshouse study suggested that the ammonium fluoride test was over-sensitive to buffering, and hence underestimated available phosphate in strongly buffered soils, this field study showed that the test is correctly sensitive to buffering. Consequently critical levels for near-maximum wheat yields do not vary for the ammonium fluoride tests, but increase with increasing buffer capacity for the sodium bicarbonate tests. The additional measurement of buffer capacity is therefore required to give precision in the use of the sodium bicarbonate <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> and particularly the Colwell test. The results also suggest that a high correlatiori between two <b>soil</b> <b>tests</b> can only be expected where each test is similarly sensitive to buffering, provided of course that both tests extract phosphate mainly from the labile pool...|$|R
