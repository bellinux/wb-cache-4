Nonlinear static analysis with parameters (thickness of plate, type of brace, size of brace and {{the ratio of}} span to height) changed of a single-span and single-floor semi-rigid <b>steel</b> frame-braced <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> shear wall system illustrates that braced <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> shear walls contributes obviously to bearing capacity and lateral rigidity of semi-rigid steel frame.

40|$|In {{order to}} quantitatively {{evaluate}} the shear-bearing capacity of shear connectors of square concrete filled steel tube (CFST), push-out tests on 14 square CFSTs with shear connectors {{have been carried}} out. Among the 14 CFSTs, there are 13 specimens with <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> connectors and one specimen with steel bar connectors. The following factors are investigated to figure out their influences {{on the performance of}} CFSTs, which are the width to thickness ratio of steel tube, thickness of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> length of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> strength of concrete, welding condition of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> number of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> layer and interlayer spacing. The test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity and the elastic stiffness increase with decreasing width to thickness ratio of the steel tube, and increasing thickness and length of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> With increasing concrete strength, the ultimate bearing capacity also increases. However, the welding condition has no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity. The ultimate bearing capacity of the CFST with double-layer <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> is greater than that with single-layer <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The ultimate bearing capacity of steel bar type shear connector is 87 % greater than that of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> type shear connector, and the steel bar specimen shows good ductility. A formula for calculating the shear-bearing capacity of shear connectors has been developed, and the calculated shear-bearing capacities are in good agreement with the test data. </p...|$|R

5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E

5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

Experimental results show that the composite wall with two skins of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> has an optimal ability of elastic-plastic deformation, and the maximum axial compressive bearing capacity among the three specimens. Using the energy method, the critical local buckling stresses of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> were calculated, and compared with the yield stresses. According to different confined actions of concrete, concrete constitutive models were proposed, and the axial compressive strengths of confined concrete were calculated. Considering the local buckling of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> and confined concrete, the calculation formula of the axial compression of the composite wall was put forward, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the test results. Therefore, the different layout forms of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> have a great influence on its buckling, and on the concrete inhibition effect, which can affect the axial compressive bearing capacity of the composite wall...|$|R

5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E
