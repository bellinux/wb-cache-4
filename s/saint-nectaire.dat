50|$|This {{cheese is}} a non-baked cheese with {{compressed}} paste, made from cow's milk, mainly of Holstein and Montbéliarde and sometimes Salers. It has a cylindrical shape, is about 20 to 24 cm wide, {{and is about}} 3 to 5 cm thick. It never weights more than 1.850 kg. The “petit-Saint-Nectaire” is 12 to 14 cm wide, 3.5 to 4.5 cm thick, and the weight doesn’t exceed 0.650 kg. The cheese has a rind that is similar on both sides, with few moulds. Depending on how old the cheese is, the rind can be white, brown or grey, and with orange, yellow, or red patches. If a cheese has a uniform colour, it can’t be sold as a <b>Saint-Nectaire</b> cheese. There is a minimum of 45 grams of fat per 100 grams of cheese once the cheese is desiccated. The whole refined cheese must have less than 50% of dry-matter content. Once cut, the <b>Saint-Nectaire</b> has a soft, fluid and smelly paste, of a creamy colour. Its taste has a hint of hazelnut, due to the aromatic flora where the cheese ages.|$|E
