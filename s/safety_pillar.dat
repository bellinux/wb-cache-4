40|$|Although mineral {{resources}} have mainly been extracted by {{open pit mining}} method in Indonesia, the underground mining will be promoted {{in terms of the}} increasing mining depth and the environmental protection. Overhand cut and fill mining method is used in steeply dipping ore bodies in strata having a relatively weak strength and comparatively high grade ore. In cut and fill mining method, as the mined voids are backfilled with waste rock or tailings, the surface subsidence due to mining operation can be controlled and the impact on the environment is small. Generally, the roadways are developed from the surface and then the cross-cut is derived from roadway to the ore bodies to extract ore. As both the hanging wall and footwall are weak compared with orebodies, overhand cut and fill mining method is applied in Cibaliung underground gold mine, Indonesia. However, failures have been occurred in roadway, cross-cuts and stopes due to the extraction of ore in the area where the ore bodies are heavily fractured. Hence, a reassessment of the current support system and a development of more effective one have to be conducted in order to continue an effective and safe mining operation under these conditions. From these backgrounds, the effect of an induced stress due to the overhand cut and fill mining operation on the stress conditions around the roadways/openings have been evaluated in Cibaliung underground gold mine, Indonesia and then a design guideline for an appropriate support system in roadways, cross-cut and stopes have been proposed in this study, consisting of seven chapters as follows: Chapter 1 introduces the background of this research, geotechnical issues and mining technology related to this research topic and an involved outline of the dissertation. Chapter 2 describes the current support system and its design guideline used in Cibaliung mine. Moreover, as this support system has been developed and used in another gold mine, Pongkor underground gold mine in Indonesia, the effect of this support system on the stability of roadways in Pongkor mine and it characteristics are discussed by means of numerical analysis. Chapter 3 discusses the effect of current support system on the stability of roadways in Cibaliung mine. According to the results obtained from the numerical analysis, the current support system does not work well in this mine. This is because the geological conditions such as rock mass fracture state, mechanical properties of rock, in-situ stress conditions are different with those of Pongkor mine. Moreover, the effect of additional stress induced by mining operation on the stress and rock mass conditions around roadways are not evaluated and considered in the current support design. Hence, {{it can be said that}} a new design guideline of support system considering these factors has to be developed in this mine. Chapter 4 describes empirical and numerical methods in order to evaluate the effect of induced stress of stope on the stability of roadways in quantity. Based on these results, the prediction chart of maximum tangential stress factor is proposed. This prediction chart includes the features that the maximum principle stress works only in the tangential direction along the wall and the stress conditions around the roadway is changed into the initial stress condition with increasing the distance from stope to roadway. It can be said from this prediction chart that the failure of roadway may be occurred when the distance from roadway to stope is less than 20 m and the location of the maximum principle stress factor is changed as the distance between roadway and stope decreases. Based on these results, it is made clear that the stability of roadway cannot be maintained because enough supports are not installed in the area that the stress concentration factor is large in the current support system. Hence, the stress condition around the roadway have to be evaluated precisely and then the support system has to be designed considering the stress condition in order to maintain the stability of roadway affected by mining operation in stope. The stability of the roadway can be maintained under the condition that a 15 cm thick layer of shotcrete and H-beam with spacing 0. 6 m are installed, and the length of the rock bolt is changed from 1. 8 m to 2. 4 m and they are installed at 1. 0 m intervals on the sidewall roadway far from stope, and done at 0. 5 m intervals on the roof and the sidewall roadway near from stope. Chapter 5 discusses the design of a support system for the cross-cut which connects the roadway and orebodies/stopes and is developed in hanging wall by means of numerical analysis. It can be said from the results that the stability of cross-cut cannot be maintained by using the current support system when the distance of cross-cut and stope is less than 20 m because a failure zone caused by induced stress of stope is developed in the roof. This situation could be improved by the application of a cable bolt. The stability of the roof of the cross-cut can be improved by installation of 11 m cable bolt in the vertical direction. Besides, the anchor effect is also obtained by connecting the roof and sill pillar, which is left as a <b>safety</b> <b>pillar</b> in the upper part of the stope, by using cable bolt. However, the failure zone still develops at the roof under the condition that the distance between the cross-cut and stope are less than 10 m. Therefore, standing support such as steel arch and cribs has to be installed in order to maintain the stability of the cross-cut. Chapter 6 discusses an appropriate support system for the stope using numerical analysis by changing the thickness of the sill pillar and the installation pattern of rock bolts with a focus on the condition of fractures in the ore body. It can be said from the results that the stope can be maintained by using the current support system under the rock mass condition that RQD value, which is index for the description of rock mass fractures state, is larger than 60. On the other hand, in case that the value of RQD is less than 60, the length and the number of installation rock bolts should be changed from 5 m to 7. 5 m and from 3 pieces to 9 pieces, respectively. Furthermore, not only changing the thickness of the sill pillar and the pattern of the construction of the rock bolt, but also by installation of standing support such as rigid arch and cribs or increasing the strength of backfilling materials are required in order to maintain the stability of the stope when the extraction level reaches to 150 m depth.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The 2008 / 2009 {{economic}} downturn {{had a major}} impact on the international steel industry. With economic activities declining, the demand for steel decreased and subsequently, prices started to tumble. This put a great deal of pressure on steel manufacturing companies’ financials and they had to focus on cost reduction initiatives to survive. Steel companies who did not follow a turnaround strategy were not able {{to keep up with the}} competition. This research study focused on determining the details pertaining to the ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works turnaround strategy, as it is viewed as one of the most successful in the steel industry. Data was obtained from discussions with various role players and managers at ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works. The aim of the interviews was to get the detail of all the steps taken by the company to turn around its performance. Quantitative data describing the operational as well as financial and cost performance was sourced from the ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works Key Performance Indicator (KPI) system and from financial statements and progress reports. It was found that the basis for the turnaround strategy of ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works was World Class Manufacturing as it provided the vehicles through which improvements were managed with the aid of mainly the Autonomous Maintenance (AM), Professional Maintenance(PM), People Development (PD), Focused Improvement (FI), Product Quality (PQ) and <b>Safety</b> <b>Pillars.</b> The Cost Deployment (CD) Pillar was used to identify the biggest losses that needed to be addressed. ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works moved from one of the highest-cost producers in the ArcelorMittal group during 2010 to the second-lowest-cost producer in the group at the end of 2013. It reduced its total cost of production with $ 70 per ton over this period, without any major capital expenditure. The study concluded that the turnaround of ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works was successful and it is sustainable. This can be seen from the increase in the overall equipment availability, amount of hot-rolled coil tons produced, as well as the EBITDA figures reported in the study...|$|R
40|$|TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) forms one of {{the crucial}} <b>safety</b> <b>pillars</b> in air traffic management. It has been {{designed}} to detect near mid-air collisions, provide advisories to the pilot and, ultimately, reduce the incidence of mid-air collisions between aircraft. Increasing traffic demands and the forthcoming use of drones in non-segregated air space poses novel evaluation challenges to TCAS. Important limitations of existing TCAS models are: that their model is specified through their computer code only, that uncertainties are not or only partially captured, and the difficulty in incorporating model changes in interactions with novel airspace users. These findings motivated the development of an agent-based modelling and simulation approach that takes various uncertainties well into account. The core development consists of a mathematical model of TCAS II specifications according to the internationally accepted operational performance standards of TCAS II and airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS). This model has been completed with other agents and their interactions, has been implemented in MATLAB, and has been validated against EUROCONTROL’s deterministic TCAS simulation model InCAS. The novel TCAS model considers the following uncertainties: errors in relative position measurements, errors in own rate of climb/descent estimates; variation in pilot response time; probability of reception of an interrogation response; variation in TCAS computation cycle. To assess the effect of these uncertainties on TCAS operations, several air traffic encounter scenarios are considered. For each scenario, rare event Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted. The results of the simulations show that the considered uncertainties may {{have a significant impact on}} the safety improvement by TCAS that often deviates from prior expectations. For example, the simulation results show that uncertainties may induce mid-air collisions in scenarios where continuation of the original aircraft flights would not have resulted in a mid-air collision. An overview of the results obtained will be given for current TCAS. In addition it will be explained what this means for future collision avoidance developments. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The Petrikov {{deposits}} of potash salt {{is situated in}} Gomel oblast of Belarus in the south-east of Pripyat Trough, and have Northern and Southern prospects. Underground mining of potash salt will start at the Northern prospect with an area of 166 km 2. It is expected that mining will last for between 50 - 80 years. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out {{at the design stage}} of the Petrikov mining and processing plant. The standard EIA procedure included a set of investigations, including assessments of surface subsidence, changes in groundwater level, changes in productivity of forest phytocoenoses and crops, and assessment of groundwater pollution due to production of potash fertilizers. Maximum values of possible surface subsidence (up to 2. 3 m) will occur within the area, where the surface will be affected by the mining of potash layers 1, 2, and 3 of the productive horizon IV-Π, using a long-pillar mining system. Surface subsidence will influence surface topography, surface and groundwater, landscape structure and land resources. The result of surface subsidence will lead to inundation and swamping of land, as well as to an increase in the areas affected by annual floods in the valleys of the Pripyat and Bobrik rivers. Surface subsidence will affect the whole area of the prospect within the limits of planned mining fields, except the areas above <b>safety</b> <b>pillars.</b> In the result of raised groundwater levels the area with groundwater depth of more than 2 m will decrease from 69. 1 % to 17. 8 %, and the areas with groundwater depth from 3 to 5 m will disappear.

Surface subsidence and change in groundwater level will cause certain decreases in yields of timber and crops, and 2564 ha of forest, 68 ha of arable land and 324 ha of meadows will be inundated.

40|$|In deep {{underground}} mining, {{ground support}} represents a significant {{component of the}} total mining cost. Serious failure of the ground support system in such high stress areas, and particularly in burst prone ground, can result in production delays, loss of reserves, damage to equipment, injuries, etc., the cost of which greatly exceeds the original ground support cost. Historically, the major problem has been the inability of engineering and operations staff to evaluate the “as placed ” status of a ground support system, {{with any degree of}} confidence, as the mining front progresses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Korea, in general, {{separation}} distance between existing parallel tunnels {{was set at}} two to five times as distant as {{the diameter of the}} tunnels according to ground conditions. Recently, however, actual applicability of closely spaced parallel tunnels whose distance between tunnel centers was shorter than the diameter has increased due to environmental damages resulting from massive cutting, restriction in purchase of required land, and maintenance of linear continuity. In particular, when the pillar width of tunnel decreases, the <b>safety</b> of <b>pillars</b> affects behaviors of the tunnel and therefore the need for diverse relevant studies has emerged. However, research so far has been largely confined to analysis of behavior characteristics of pillars, or parameters affecting design, and actually applicable and quantitative data have not been presented. Accordingly, in order to present a stability evaluation method which may maximally reflect construction conditions of spots, this study reflected topographical and stratigraphic characteristics of the portal part with the highest closeness between the tunnels, simulated multi-layer conditions with rock mass and complete weathering, and assessed the degree of effect the stability of pillars had on the entire tunnels through numerical analysis according to changes in pillar width by ground strength.

While research it was found that there are lot of doubtful calculations and interpretations by NAMNAM a North Korean company proposed a mine project with the stope geometry of 230 m length, 20 m width and 60 m height at a depth of 270 m below the surface. The pillar width is also 20 m and the crown pillar is 500 m. This research work deals with recanalization of the stress-strain conditions of the rock categories of Maddhapara Mine area, assessment of present support design on the basis of its stability and propose necessary support design. Examine 2 D software was used to calculate the stress condition for multiple stopes, mechanical behavior for the exact scenario of the Maddhapara Mine Project. Moreover, the factor of <b>safety</b> for the <b>pillars</b> is also calculated mathematically. The stress-strain relationship of the tested samples indicates that some of them have failed in the elastic range while that of others are beyond the elastic range. The average lower tangent modules values of first, second and third category ar...|$|R
