40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) using the Pap test as a first <b>screening</b> <b>step</b> to {{evaluate}} genetic stability. Human adipose tissue from six healthy female donors was obtained from elective liposuction procedures. The cells were isolated, cultivated at P 2 /P 3, characterized by flow cytometric analysis, and differentiation induced. The AT-MSCs were stained by Papanicolaou staining and analyzed according to the Bethesda classification, and viability-apoptosis relationships were evaluated. The results of the Pap test for Sample I indicated high-grade alterations consistent with genetic instability; for Samples II-V, atypical cells of undetermined significance; and for Sample VI, normal cells. These results demonstrate the potential of using the Pap test as an initial <b>screening</b> <b>step</b> to evaluate the genetic stability of cultured AT-MSCs and also suggest its use for other adherent cells such as embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells...|$|R

40|$|For genomewide {{association}} (GWA) {{studies in}} family-based designs, we propose a novel two-stage strategy that weighs the association P values {{with the use}} of independently estimated weights. The association information contained in the family sample is partitioned into two orthogonal components—namely, the between-family information and the within-family information. The between-family component is used in the first (i. e., screening) stage to obtain a relative ranking of all the markers. The within-family component is used in the second (i. e., testing) stage in the framework of the standard family-based association test, and the resulting P values are weighted using the estimated marker ranking from the <b>screening</b> <b>step.</b> The approach is appealing, in that it ensures that all the markers are tested in the testing step and, at the same time, also uses information from the <b>screening</b> <b>step.</b> Through simulation studies, we show that testing all the markers is more powerful than testing only the most promising ones from the <b>screening</b> <b>step,</b> which was the method suggested by Van Steen et al. A comparison with a population-based approach shows that the approach achieves comparable power. In the presence of a reasonable level of population stratification, our approach is only slightly affected in terms of power and, since it is a family-based method, is completely robust to spurious effects. An application to a 100 K scan in the Framingham Heart Study illustrates the practical advantages of our approach. The proposed method is of general applicability; it extends to any setting in which prior, independent ranking of hypotheses is available...|$|R

40|$|In most policy {{analysis}} studies {{there are a}} large number of alternative policies and {{a large number of}} impacts to be considered. Time and budget constraints make it impossible to calculate all the impacts for all of the alternatives. As a result, such studies include some process for reducing the number of alternatives to be examined in detail. The process is often implicit and nonscientific (e. g., only the decisionmaker's three favorite alternatives are considered). This paper suggests that {{policy analysis}} studies explicitly include a <b>screening</b> <b>step,</b> in which the alternatives to be examined in detail and those to be excluded from further consideration are chosen in a scientific and systematic manner. The output from this step is a relatively small set of policy alternatives that are sufficiently attractive that they deserve a more thorough evaluation.

We propose Partial Correlation Screening (PCS) as a new row-by-row approach. To estimate the i-th row of Ω, 1 ≤ i ≤ p, PCS uses a <b>Screen</b> <b>step</b> and a Clean <b>step.</b> In the <b>Screen</b> <b>step,</b> PCS recruits a (small) subset of indices using a stage-wise algorithm, where in each stage, the algorithm updates the set of recruited indices by adding the index j that has the largest empirical partial correlation (in magnitude) with i, given the set of indices recruited so far. In the Clean step, PCS first re-investigates all recruited indices in hopes of removing false positives, and then uses the resultant set of indices to reconstruct the i-th row of Ω. PCS is computationally efficient and modest in memory use: to estimate a row of Ω, it only needs a few rows (determined sequentially) of the empirical covariance matrix. This enables PCS to execute the estimation of a large precision matrix (e. g., p = 10 K...|$|R

40|$|Background: In the European Union the placing of {{pesticides}} {{on the market}} requires as a prerequisite that a risk assessment demonstrates low risks to {{human health and the}} environment, among which includes pollinators. Currently risks are evaluated for honey bees and for non-target arthropods (NTA) of cultivated ecosystems. The actual protection of pollinators other than the honey bees, as for example for non-Apis bees, in relation to these risk assessments has recently been questioned and requires further investigation. We present the findings from a comparison of Hazard Quotient (HQ) value calculations to assess the risk to honey bees, non-target arthropods and to non-Apis bees (with the application of an additional safety factor of 10). Calculations were based on publicly available ecotoxicological data. Results: The risk to NTA, honey bees and non-Apis bees, as depicted by HQ values, indicated a higher fail rate for NTA than for bees, but a similar pass / fail rate for non-Apis bees when compared to the NTA scheme. Outcome of the risk assessment for NTA using extended laboratory tests gave similar pass/fail rates compared to the <b>screening</b> <b>step</b> for honey bees.
