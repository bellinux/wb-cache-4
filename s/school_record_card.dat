The Working Group was aware that the Minister for Health wished to introduce the pre-school <b>record</b> <b>card</b> during October, 1970 when developmental paediatric examinations for babies aged 6 months were due to commence in the major urban areas. Revised school health procedures were also envisaged and it was desirable {{to have a new}} School Health Card available as soon as possible.

Two members of the Group had a detailed and fruitful discussion with him in Manchester. Dr. D. L.
