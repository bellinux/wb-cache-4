40|$|Nonlinear {{solutions}} for the large-scale flow of interstellar gas {{in the presence of}} a spiral gravitational field have received considerable attention because this model allows to explain a lot of observations for galaxy disks. However this investigations were forced to limit by numerable analysis of the problem because of its nonlinearity. In this paper we wish to carry out the analytical expression which allows us to describe the super sonic nonlinear interstellar gas flow in rapidly rotating galaxy disk which is made by the spiral density wave. One of characteristic parameters of theory is the amplitude of spiral density wave potential corresponding to separatrix, which separates super <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> from flows containing the jump from super <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> to subsonic. We have defined the dependence of perturbing potential value, under which the galaxy shock wave appeared with respect to the parameters characterizing the gas disk (such as sound speed in gas, disk rotation speed, "spiral design" rotation speed) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{theory for}} sound propagation in nearly <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> in variable area ducts is outlined. The theory {{is based on}} a quasi-one-dimensional model and the use of matched asymptotic expansions. The problem of an acoustic source located in the throat region of a duct with a converging section is treated. It is shown that the near-sonic region has a marked nonlinear effect on sound propagation in the duct...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{shock waves}} in a {{variable}} area duct which contains near <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> are considered. The problem is modeled after an aeroengine inlet. Area variation of a duct and high Mach number mean the flow reduces acoustical energy yielding substantial noise reduction. One possible {{reason for this}} is acoustic shock. The use of an explicit accurate numerical method which captures shocks is described. Comparison of the results are made with an existing asymptotic theory for Mach numbers close to unity. When shock occurs reduction of sound pressure levels are shown by example...|$|R
50|$|Constant {{mass flow}} is {{achieved}} by <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> through an orifice. The flow of a compressible fluid through an orifice {{is limited to the}} flow at sonic velocity in the orifice. This can be controlled by the upstream pressure and the orifice size and shape, but once the flow reached the speed of sound in the orifice, any further reduction of downstream pressure has no influence on the flow rate. This requires a gas source at a fixed pressure, and it only works at depths which have a low enough ambient pressure to provide <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> in the orifice.|$|E
5000|$|At high-subsonic flight speeds, {{the local}} {{speed of the}} airflow can reach {{the speed of sound}} where the flow accelerates around the {{aircraft}} body and wings. The speed at which this development occurs varies from aircraft to aircraft and is known as the [...] critical Mach number. The resulting shock waves formed at these points of <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> can greatly reduce power, which is experienced by the aircraft as a sudden and very powerful [...] drag, called wave drag. To reduce the number and power of these shock waves, an aerodynamic shape should change in cross sectional area as smoothly as possible.|$|E
50|$|The minimum {{pressure}} ratios {{required for}} choked conditions to occur (when some typical industrial gases are flowing) {{are presented in}} Table 1. The ratios were obtained using the criterion that choked flow occurs when {{the ratio of the}} absolute upstream pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than , where k is the specific heat ratio of the gas. The minimum pressure ratio may be understood as the ratio between the upstream pressure and the pressure at the nozzle throat when the gas is traveling at Mach 1; if the upstream pressure is too low compared to the downstream pressure, <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> cannot occur at the throat.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} have a high level of maneuverability, {{supersonic}} delta wings should have a cross flow that is free of embedded shock waves. The conical cross <b>flow</b> <b>sonic</b> surface differs from that of plane transonic flow in many aspects. Well-known properties such as the monotone law are not true for conical cross <b>flow</b> <b>sonic</b> surfaces. By using a local analysis of the cross <b>flow</b> <b>sonic</b> line, relevant conditions for smooth cross flow are obtained. A technique to artificially construct a smooth sonic surface and an efficient numerical method to calculate the flow field are used to obtain cones with smooth cross flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of acoustic choking in near <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> is investigated using the one-dimensional gasdynamic equations for an ideal gas. It is {{pointed out that}} this approach eliminates {{the need to make}} the classical small disturbance assumption. A finite difference scheme is elaborated to approximate these equations. Boundary conditions that correctly model the physics of the acoustics problems are chosen. The use of a fast Fourier transform routine allows the results to be compared with those obtained by using the conventional harmonic assumptions. Only solutions in which shocks have not fully developed are reported. Continuous solutions are sought, and these are compared with the Fubini solution and with certain results of Myers and Callegari (1977, 1978, 1979) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} system of active {{addition}} of make-up gas in semi-closed rebreathers is {{by use of}} a constant mass flow injector, also known as choked flow. This is easily achieved by using a sonic orifice, as provided the pressure drop over the orifice is sufficient to ensure <b>sonic</b> <b>flow,</b> the mass flow for a specific gas will be independent of the downstream pressure. The mass flow through a sonic orifice {{is a function of}} the upstream pressure and the gas mixture, so the upstream pressure must remain constant for the working depth range of the rebreather to provide a reliably predictable mixture in the breathing circuit, and a modified regulator is used which is not affected by changes in ambient pressure. Gas addition is independent of oxygen use, and the gas fraction in the loop is strongly dependent on exertion of the diver - it is possible to dangerously deplete the oxygen by excessive physical exertion.|$|E
5000|$|Stereo Worxxx {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Ian Martin commented that {{while most of}} the track were catchy, he felt [...] "The wild party of 2011’s World of Fantasy still seems to be raging on into 2012, with Nakata continuing to integrate tribal and Japanese festival rhythms into his music...", citing [...] "Tapping Beats" [...] and [...] "All the Way" [...] as examples. He concluded [...] "There’s certainly a lot to take away from Stereo Worxxx, but it’s definitely a transitional album with no clear sense of direction or identity. It has material to tantalize fans of both its predecessor and Nakata’s work with Perfume, but probably not enough to satisfy either. Importantly though, it makes clear that these two poles are not irreconcilable, which could augur very well for the future." [...] Patrick St. Michel from Make Believe Melodies also felt that the music from Stereo Worxxx was comparable to World of Fantasy, and felt that songs like [...] "In the Rain" [...] and [...] "Tapping Beats" [...] ruined the albums <b>sonic</b> <b>flow.</b> However, he concluded it as a [...] "good, uncomplicated album".|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of Law of Similarity is used extensively for theoretical and experimental fluid machines. With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity {{is the foundation}} for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined {{at the time of}} calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and <b>sonic</b> <b>flow.</b> To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the calibrated meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists in the “field meter installation” over the entire custody transfer period.|$|E

5000|$|The New Danger {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics; it holds an aggregate score of 59 out of 100 at Metacritic. Blender called it [...] "mushily sentimental, self-righteously indignant and constantly in your face", while AllMusic's Andy Kellman {{said it was}} [...] "a sprawling, overambitious mess". New York magazine panned the album as [...] "an unsatisfying muddle of protest music, black rock, and rap". In The New York Times, Kelefa Sanneh wrote that the record suffered from extended soul songs that meandered, dull rock songs, and some raps such as [...] "The Rap Over" [...] that were devoid of Mos Def's usual [...] "warmth and wit". NME deemed some of the songs failed experiments but also highlighted [...] "Boogie Man Song", [...] "Modern Marvel", and [...] "Champion Requiem" [...] as more timeless material. Rolling Stone critic Tom Moon was more enthusiastic, hailing the album as an [...] "earthy, impressively diverse" [...] work that showcased Mos Def's abilities to [...] "create deeply nuanced characterizations" [...] and [...] "broaden the hip-hop palette without sacrificing, or selling out, its core ideals". Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said while Mos Def's past records were driven by his [...] "verbal flow", The New Danger was more interesting musically and defined by its <b>sonic</b> <b>flow,</b> which the critic described as [...] "a shadowy, guitar-drenched tone poem of the streets".

40|$|Re-examination of the Crocco-Lees {{method has}} shown that the {{previous}} quantitative disagreement between theory and experiment in the region of flow up to separation was caused primarily by the improper C(K) relation assumed. A new C(K) correlation, based on low-speed theoretical and experimental data and on supersonic experimental results, has been developed and found to be satisfactory for accurate calculation of two-dimensional laminar super <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> up to separation. A study of separated and reattaching regions of flow has led to a physical model which incorporates the concept of the "dividing" streamline and the results of experiment. According to this physical model, viscous momentum transport is the essential mechanism in the zone between separation and the beginning of reattachment, while the reattachment process is, on the contrary, an essentially inviscid process. This physical model has been translated into Crocco-Lees language using a semi-empirical approach, and approximate C(K) and F(K) relations have been determined for the separated and reattaching regions. The results of this analysis have been applied to the problem of shock wave-laminar boundary layer interaction, and satisfactory quantitative agreement with experiment has been achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{modeling}} of porous bleed regions as boundary conditions in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations of supersonic inlet flows has been improved through a scaling of <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> coefficient data for 90 deg bleed holes. The scaling removed the Mach number {{as a factor in}} computing the <b>sonic</b> <b>flow</b> coefficient and allowed the data to be fitted with a quadratic equation, with the only factor being the ratio of the plenum static pressure to the surface static pressure. The implementation of the bleed model into the Wind-US CFD flow solver was simplified by no longer requiring the evaluation of the flow properties at the boundary-layer edge. The quadratic equation can be extrapolated to allow the {{modeling of}} small amounts of blowing, which can exist when recirculation of the bleed flow occurs within the bleed region. The improved accuracy of the bleed model was demonstrated through CFD simulations of bleed regions on a flat plate in supersonic flow with and without an impinging oblique shock.

40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FzK) are {{developing}} GASFLOW, a three-dimensional (3 D) fluid dynamics field code as a best- estimate tool to characterize local phenomena within a flow field. Examples of 3 D phenomena include circulation patterns; flow stratification; hydrogen distribution mixing and stratification; combustion and flame propagation; effects of noncondensable gas distribution on local condensation and evaporation; and aerosol entrainment, transport, and deposition. An analysis with GASFLOW {{will result in}} a prediction of the gas composition and discrete particle distribution in space and time throughout the facility and the resulting pressure and temperature loadings on the walls and internal structures with or without combustion. A major application of GASFLOW is for predicting the transport, mixing, and combustion of hydrogen and other gases in nuclear reactor containment and other facilities. It has been applied to situations involving transporting and distributing combustible gas mixtures. It has been used to study gas dynamic behavior in low-speed, buoyancy-driven flows, as well as <b>sonic</b> <b>flows</b> or diffusion dominated flows; and during chemically reacting flows, including deflagrations.
