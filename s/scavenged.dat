5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs {{also have}} been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been <b>scavenged</b> by a shark).|$|E
5|$|Leftovers of wolf kills are {{sometimes}} <b>scavenged</b> by wolverines. Wolverines usually {{wait until the}} wolves are done feeding, but {{have been known to}} drive away wolves from kills. However, there have been confirmed reports of wolf packs killing wolverines.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be <b>scavenged</b> from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the in-vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of cycloart– 23 -ene– 3 β, 25 -diol (called as B 2) isolated from stem bark of Pongamia pinnata. MethodsIn vitro antioxidant activity of B 2 {{was determined by}} methods for determination of DPPH radical <b>scavenging,</b> reducing power, superoxide anion radical <b>scavenging,</b> hydroxyl radical <b>scavenging,</b> hydrogen peroxide <b>scavenging,</b> metal chelating and nitric oxide radical <b>scavenging</b> at the doses of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. β-tocopherol with same concentration {{was used as a}} standard antioxidant. In vitro antimicrobial activity of B 2 was determined by cup plate method in different concentration range of 10 - 100 μg/mL. ResultsThe results indicated that dose dependent % reduction against DPPH radical, reducing power, superoxide anion radical <b>scavenging,</b> hydroxyl radical <b>scavenging,</b> metal chelating, hydrogen peroxide <b>scavenging</b> and nitric oxide radical <b>scavenging</b> by B 2 and β-tocopherol. ConclusionsIt is concluded that cycloart 23 -ene- 3 β, 25 diol (B 2) showed dose dependent antioxidant activity. B 2 showed more DPPH radical <b>scavenging,</b> reducing power, superoxide <b>scavenging,</b> hydroxyl radical <b>scavenging,</b> metal chelating <b>scavenging,</b> hydrogen peroxide radical <b>scavenging</b> and nitric oxide radical <b>scavenging</b> activity than β–tocopherol and in case of antimicrobial activity B 2 exhibited broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and strong activity against yeast type of fungi...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scavenging</b> begins 32° later, at BDC-45° 135°, {{and ends}} at BDC+45° 225°, for a <b>scavenging</b> {{duration}} of 90 degrees; the 32° delay in opening the <b>scavenging</b> ports (constraining {{the length of}} the power stroke), and the 16° delay after the <b>scavenging</b> ports are closed (thereby initiating the compression stroke), maximizes <b>scavenging</b> effectiveness, thereby maximizing engine power output, while minimizing engine fuel consumption.|$|R

5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have <b>scavenged</b> on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Raath (1972) {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with {{the head and neck}} bended backwards above the pelvis, a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have <b>scavenged</b> on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E

Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and <b>scavenged</b> fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs.

The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally {{trapped in the}} seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then <b>scavenged</b> by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and <b>scavenged</b> carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC 3) field experiment was to determine the <b>scavenging</b> of soluble trace gases by thunderstorms. We present an analysis of <b>scavenging</b> of hydrogen peroxide (H_ 2 O_ 2) and methyl hydrogen peroxide (CH_ 3 OOH) from six DC 3 cases that occurred in Oklahoma and northeast Colorado. Estimates of H_ 2 O_ 2 <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies are comparable to previous studies ranging from 79 to 97 % with relative uncertainties of 5 – 25 %. CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies ranged from 12 to 84 % with relative uncertainties of 18 – 558 %. The wide range of CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies is surprising, as previous studies suggested that CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies would be < 10 %. Cloud chemistry model simulations of one DC 3 storm produced CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies of 26 – 61 % depending on the ice retention factor of CH_ 3 OOH during cloud drop freezing, suggesting ice physics impacts CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging.</b> The highest CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies occurred in two severe thunderstorms, but there is no obvious correlation between the CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiency and the storm thermodynamic environment. We found a moderate correlation between the estimated entrainment rates and CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies. Changes in gas-phase chemistry due to lightning production of nitric oxide and aqueous-phase chemistry have little effect on CH_ 3 OOH <b>scavenging</b> efficiencies. To determine why CH_ 3 OOH can be substantially removed from storms, future studies should examine effects of entrainment rate, retention of CH_ 3 OOH in frozen cloud particles during drop freezing, and lightning-NO_x production...|$|R

It is shown that <b>scavenging</b> coefficient is non-stationary and height-dependent. It is found also that the <b>scavenging</b> coefficient strongly depends on initial concentration distribution of soluble gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere.
