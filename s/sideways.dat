5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game the Decepticon Soundwave hacks onto a satellite and finding a piece of Cybertronian technology on a NEST truck in Shanghai. <b>Sideways</b> and Demolishor are contacted to steal the technology. Optimus Prime is transported to near where the technology was stolen, where he confronts Devastator. Nearby Ironhide engages in battle with Demolishor. Elsewhere in the city, Bumblebee chases <b>Sideways</b> through the streets, who narrowly escapes with assistance from Starscream. Starscream and <b>Sideways</b> travel to the Laurentian Abyss, where the dead body of Megatron is being guarded by military forces. Starscream attacks the navy ships, giving <b>Sideways</b> an opportunity to retrieve the body. Megatron is then resurrected by The Fallen, becoming his servant.|$|E
5|$|Many insects can hover {{by beating}} their wings rapidly, {{requiring}} <b>sideways</b> stabilization {{as well as}} lift.|$|E
5|$|A movable {{cartridge}} {{guide was}} placed {{on the right side of}} the carrier block to prevent the escape of the shell when the shotgun was turned <b>sideways</b> in the act of loading.|$|E
5|$|Altar N {{is another}} small {{rhyolite}} sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has {{the form of}} a turtle shell with a skeletal head with a mirror on its forehead emerging <b>sideways</b> from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the bicephalic deity Pawatun (GodN), a prominent underworld deity.|$|E
5|$|Eros Bendato ("Eros Bound"; 1999) {{is a large}} bronze head by {{sculptor}} Igor Mitoraj. Located on {{the corner}} of Eighth and Market streets, the statue lays <b>sideways</b> on a slanted granite circle, which is covered by a steady stream of water.|$|E
5|$|In the 33rd minute Tommy Smith {{directed}} a high free kick from the centre circle into the penalty area. From Berti Vogts's defensive header, Emlyn Hughes headed {{the ball back}} into the Borussia penalty area. Vogts this time could only direct his header <b>sideways</b> towards Toshack. Toshack headed a knockdown to Keegan who volleyed in for a 2â€“0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other <b>sideways</b> and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than <b>sideways,</b> with their tails aloft and their ears rotated <b>sideways.</b> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|On lap 206, Martin's car {{suffered}} {{a flat tire}} and the fourth caution was given as a result. Bowyer led on the restart, although he was passed by Stewart within one lap. On lap 213, Hamlin spun <b>sideways,</b> prompting the fifth caution. Despite remaining undamaged, Hamlin fell from fourth to twenty-second position. Stewart led on the restart, as Jeff Gordon claimed second from Bowyer. By lap 221, a sixth caution came out as Kurt Busch, Johnson, and Kyle Busch all spun <b>sideways.</b> After the accident, Johnson fell to twenty-fourth; Stewart maintained his lead on the restart. Five laps later, Matt Kenseth spun out, causing the seventh caution. Stewart led the drivers back to the green flag, but was overtaken by McMurray one lap later.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticon {{campaign}} {{begins in}} Shanghai with <b>Sideways</b> searching {{the area for}} fuel and power, and also for Megatron's lost body. He learns of Autobots {{in the area and}} hunts and eliminates them. He then learns that Grindor has gone missing and that <b>Sideways</b> must find, repair, and transport Grindor to the extraction site. Once Grindor is safe, he attacks Autobots protecting NEST arrays and infects the arrays with a virus, giving the Decepticons access to NEST communications. Elsewhere, Long Haul destroys NEST bases located around Shanghai. Ironhide emerges to fight Long Haul but is defeated, and Starscream proclaims the victory as a warning to Optimus Prime.|$|E
5|$|The Merlin {{consumed}} {{an enormous}} volume of air {{at full power}} (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300mph (2,100km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting <b>sideways.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until its {{acceptance}} by the National Trust, Belton House {{was always in}} the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass <b>sideways</b> and sometimes through the female line.|$|E
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping <b>sideways</b> in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Stewart passed Harvick for {{the fourth}} {{position}} on the 219th lap. Three laps later, Robby Gordon spun <b>sideways,</b> prompting the fourth caution to be given. All the front runners made pit stops during the caution, and Kyle Busch became the leader. At the lap 228 restart, Kyle Busch was first ahead of Hamlin, Edwards, Johnson, and Burton. On the following lap, Hamlin passed Busch for the first position. During the 231st lap, Edwards passed Busch {{to take over the}} second position, making Busch fall to third after two laps. Two laps later, the fifth caution was given because Travis Kvapil spun <b>sideways.</b> During the caution, the first eight cars did not pit, while the others did. Hamlin led on the restart ahead of Carl Edwards in second. At lap 242, Kurt Busch moved up to ninth, after passing Stewart. Three laps later, Stewart fell to 12th, after being passed by Martin and Logano. By lap 249, Hamlin had a 0.75 second lead over second. On lap 252, Jeff Burton moved up to the seventh position.|$|E
5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled <b>sideways</b> off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the <b>sideways</b> drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed {{to the left or}} right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|In the Wii version, players {{control the}} game using the Wii Remote held <b>sideways,</b> {{and the game}} world is rotated by {{twisting}} the controller in various directions. The Nunchuk and Classic Controller are also compatible for alternate control schemes. This version also removes the restriction to only rotate in 90 degree intervals and offers three additional levels compared to the PC versions.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns <b>sideways</b> because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground <b>sideways</b> when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|Lead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who {{sometimes}} sang {{through a}} bullhorn), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and whichever bassist {{happened to be}} filling in at the time, had a visual aspect. As with their music, their appearance was exceptionally non-conventional in the early days, including <b>sideways</b> mohawks, dreadlocks, unnaturally colored hair, and the like.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout <b>sideways</b> and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move <b>sideways</b> to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing <b>sideways</b> in a vehicle. The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon optionsâ€”they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|Pole {{position}} driver Kasey Kahne {{maintained his}} {{lead on the}} first lap of the race. Edwards started in the second position on the grid, and became {{the leader of the}} race on the fourth lap. Shortly after a restart on lap 22, championship leader Denny Hamlin spun <b>sideways,</b> resulting with damage to his splitter. Martin Truex, Jr. took the lead on lap 73, but after the final pit stops Edwards was first. He maintained the lead to win the race, having led it for 192 laps.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sideways</b> {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30â€“34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (<b>sideways</b> movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The Aviator won {{the most}} awards {{of the night}} with five. Million Dollar Baby won four awards, {{including}} Best Picture. Other winners included The Incredibles, and Ray with two awards, and Born into Brothels, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Finding Neverland, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, , The Motorcycle Diaries, Ryan, The Sea Inside, <b>Sideways,</b> Spider-Man 2 and Wasp each with one. The telecast garnered over 42 million viewers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (<b>Sideways</b> Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced the built-in TIRRS system.|$|E
5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out <b>sideways.</b> It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|They {{were usually}} joined by other local children, {{two of whom}} became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven (an Australian rules footballer) and Harold Shillinglaw (both an Australian rules footballer and {{first-class}} cricketer)the group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate <b>sideways</b> after bouncing.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable <b>sideways</b> pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} pit lane, Zanardi {{lost control of}} his car, which turned <b>sideways</b> onto the circuit. Alex Tagliani crashed into Zanardi's car, {{splitting}} the chassis into two pieces. The crash led to the amputation of both of Zanardi's legs. The rest of the race was run under a caution flag, and BrÃ¤ck, who had moved into second place before Zanardi's pit stop, secured the victory. Zanardi and Tagliani were taken to a Berlin hospital; Zanardi had a fractured pelvis and a concussion {{in addition to his}} amputations, while Tagliani was not severely injured.|$|E
5|$|With {{assistance}} from Kyle Busch, Harvick took over fifth {{place on the}} following lap. Afterward, Edwards became the leader, after passing Truex, Jr. On lap 105, Jamie McMurray passed Truex, Jr. to move into second. David Ragan passed Kahne for the tenth position eleven laps later. Having led 86 of the first 124 laps, Edwards was finally passed on lap 125. Truex, Jr. moved into first position, and by the same lap Almirola had slipped to tenth. Marcos Ambrose spun <b>sideways</b> on lap 135, causing the fourth caution of the race. The front runners subsequently made pit stops. At the lap 139 restart, Truex, Jr. was the leader, ahead of Edwards, Harvick, and Johnson. One lap later, Montoya and Joey Logano collided, which resulted in Logano spinning <b>sideways</b> and sustaining major damage. At the lap 143 restart, Edwards was leader, after passing Truex, Jr. before the previous caution. On the following lap, Johnson fell to fifth, as Harvick moved to third. During lap 145, Kyle Busch took third away from Harvick. Two laps later, Truex, Jr. reclaimed the lead from Edwards.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a <b>sideways</b> jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved <b>sideways</b> into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and <b>sideways</b> in ducks.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out <b>sideways,</b> making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles <b>sideways.</b> The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
