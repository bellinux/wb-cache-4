5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea of}} Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, a panel of former justices and {{selected}} MPs was tasked with <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the documents, and determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials. The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E

25|$|Photo Gallery is an {{optional}} application to view, create and group photos from PS3, which is installed {{separately from the}} system software at 105MB. It was introduced in system software version 2.60 and provides a range of tools for <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> and displaying the system's pictures. The key feature of this application {{is that it can}} organize photos into groups according to various criteria. Notable categorizations are colors, ages, or facial expressions {{of the people in the}} photos. Slideshows can be viewed with the application, along with music and playlists. The software was updated with the release of system software version 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on Facebook and Picasa.|$|E

500|$|At Herbertson's recommendation, in 1913 Crawford gained {{employment}} {{as an assistant}} on William Scoresby Routledge and Katherine Routledge's expedition to Easter Island. The expedition had the intention of {{learning more about the}} island's first inhabitants and its Moai statues. After the team departed from Britain aboard the schooner Mana, Crawford began quarrelling with the Routledges. Informing them that they had demonstrated an [...] "extraordinary lack of courtesy" [...] and [...] "appalling stinginess" [...] toward both him and other crew members, he left the ship at Cape Verde and returned to Britain. He then gained employment from the wealthy philanthropist Henry Wellcome, who sent him to Egypt to gain further training in archaeological excavation from G. A. Reisner. Wellcome then sent him to Sudan, where Crawford was given charge of the excavation of the Meroitic site at Abu Geili, remaining there from January to June 1914. On his return to England—where he was planning on <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the artefacts found in Sudan—he and his friend Earnest Hooton began excavation of a long barrow on Wexcombe Down in Wiltshire.|$|E

500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} the following recording studios—4220 Studios, Conway Recording Studios, and East West Studios in Hollywood, Instrument Zoo Studios in Miami, Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios in New York City, Record One in Sherman Oaks, and Westlake Studios in Los Angeles. Nas worked with several musicians, including Amy Winehouse, Mary J. Blige, James Poyser, Anthony Hamilton, Miguel, Large Professor, and Hal Ritson, among others. For the album, Nas wanted the production to complement his lyrics' nostalgic themes with 1980s hip hop influences. He primarily worked with hip hop producers No I.D. and Salaam Remi, a frequent collaborator of Nas. Remi said that he wanted his production [...] "to be something that a mumble-mouth rapper can’t rap on. You better have something to say and be speaking up." [...] Along with producer Swizz Beatz, No I.D. and Nas related to the latter's lyrics concerning divorce during the recording sessions. During the sessions, Nas recorded the song [...] "No Such Thing as White Jesus" [...] with singer Frank Ocean and producer Hit Boy, who misplaced the track while <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> music he had produced for Jay-Z and Kanye West's album Watch the Throne (2011). Although he later recovered it, the song was not included on Life Is Good.|$|E
500|$|After {{first meeting}} Lennon, Jim warned Paul {{that he would}} get him [...] "into trouble", {{although}} he later allowed The Quarrymen to rehearse in the dining room at Forthlin Road in the evenings. Jim was reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to Hamburg with The Beatles until Paul said the group would earn £15 per week each. As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed, but only after a visit from the group's then-manager, Allan Williams, who said that Jim should not worry. Jim was later present at a Beatles' concert in Manchester when fans surrounded drummer Pete Best, and ignored the rest of The Beatles. Jim criticised Best by saying, [...] "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you". Bill Harry recalled that Jim was probably [...] "The Beatles' biggest fan", and was extremely proud of Paul's success. Shelagh Johnson—later to become director of The Beatles' Museum in Liverpool—said that Jim's outward show of pride embarrassed his son. Jim enlisted Michael's help when <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the ever-increasing sacks of fan letters that were delivered to Forthlin Road, with both composing [...] "personal" [...] responses that were supposedly from Paul. Michael would later have success on his own with the group The Scaffold.|$|E

500|$|Not My Life {{begins with}} a black screen on which the words [...] "Human {{trafficking}} is slavery" [...] appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E
500|$|U2's initial time at Danesmoate {{was spent}} {{recording}} and refining [...] "extensive demos" [...] that the Edge anticipated {{could turn into}} final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: [...] "Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 —it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when they walked into the room." [...] One of the first songs worked on was [...] "Heartland", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for [...] "With or Without You" [...] and [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer {{for a week or}} two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is <b>sorting</b> <b>through</b> the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
