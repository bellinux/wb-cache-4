This, states the text, gives him satisfaction in his wakeful state, in dream as he sleeps his soul fashions a dream world of joys and nightmares, {{but this is}} all deception. True bliss, states the text, comes in the third <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It is, states the text, the third state, everything comes to rest, in whole, in peace, in bliss.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
30|$|Tirumandiram <b>states</b> that  most <b>of</b> the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> are {{experienced}} in the sakala state. The kevala in sakala, sakala in sakala and suddha in sakala experience five <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> each. The <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> experienced during yoga also occur in the sakala state. Thus, the total <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{experienced in the}} sakala state are twenty. Besides these, the true kevala experience five states and the suddha experience five states. Thus, the total number <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> is thirty.|$|R
40|$|This {{theoretical}} study {{contains a}} systematic analysis <b>of</b> altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The study {{is based on a}} reflection of the qualitative altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> that offers some potential and attempts to describe altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in their complexity as well as to map all their aspects in a structured. It utilises the notion <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to define the altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The chosen method is to work with literary sources where an emphasis is placed on an interdisciplinary approach. The structure of the thesis is divided into three chapters. The key topic of the first chapter is an examination of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and interdisciplinary theories <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The second chapter is focused on the description and analysis <b>of</b> altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> concentrates on the history and methods of research <b>of</b> altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and delineates their basic characteristic and their functions. The last chapter divides the altered <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> into categories and gives them a detailed description. The thesis ends with a final conclusion which brings an integration of the findings above mentioned with the focused on the second chapter.

5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E

When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{acquiring}} this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, {{is essentially the}} same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as anubhava, immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness of Brahman, but instead an awareness that is Brahman, since one will transcend any form of duality in this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of the {{important}} questions in sleep research is clearly defining the sleep state. This problem arises because sleep was traditionally defined as a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{and not as a}} physiological state, thus there was no clear definition of what minimum set of events constitute sleep and distinguish it from other states of partial or no consciousness. The problem of making such a definition is complicated because it needs to include a variety of modes of sleep found across different species.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.|$|E

On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial mastectomy for breast cancer on Kan Aiya, using tsūsensan as a general anesthetic. This is regarded today by some as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia. Nearly forty years would pass before Crawford Long used general anesthesia in Jefferson, Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are {{descriptions}} of a disposition {{free from the}} effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, t'ai chi ch'uan (太极拳, tàijíquán), yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and some traditional Christian contemplative practices such as monasticism, {{as well as with the}} New Age movement.|$|E
25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn {{due to the}} ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products are determined by various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media {{is the key to}} the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E
