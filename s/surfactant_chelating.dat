40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the fundamental characteristics of a <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant</b> in terms of solution behaviour, chelation of divalent metal ions, and interaction in mixtures with different foaming agents and divalent metal ion, as well as examining its prospects in some practical applications. <b>Chelating</b> <b>surfactants</b> are functional molecules, with both surface active and chelating properties, which are water soluble and therefore suitable for chelation in many aqueous environments. The dual functionality offers the possibility to recover the <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant</b> as well as the metals. The DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) -based <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant</b> 4 -C 12 -DTPA (2 -dodecyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) was synthesized at Mid Sweden University. In the absence of metal ions, all eight donor atoms in the headgroup of 4 -C 12 -DTPA are titrating and the headgroup charge can be tuned from + 3 to - 5 by altering the pH. The solution properties, studied by surface tension measurements and NMR diffusometry, were consequently found strongly pH dependent. pH measurements of <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant</b> solutions as a function of concentration was used to extract information regarding the interaction between surfactants in the aggregation process. Small differences in the conditional stability constants (log K) between coordination complexes of DTPA and 4 -C 12 -DTPA, determined by competition measurements utilizing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), indicated that the hydrocarbon tail only affected the chelating ability of the headgroup to a limited extent. This was further confirmed in hydrogen peroxide bleaching of thermomechanical pulp (TMP) treated with 4 -C 12 -DTPA. Interaction parameters for mixed systems of 4 -C 12 -DTPA and different foaming agents were calculated following the approach of Rubingh’s regular solution theory. The mixtures were also examined with addition of divalent metal ions in equimolar ratio to the <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant.</b> Strong correlation was found between the interaction parameter and the phase transfer efficiency of Ni 2 + ions during flotations. Furthermore, a significant difference in log K between different metal complexes with 4 -C 12 -DTPA enabled selective recovery of the metal ion with the highest log K. The findings in this study contribute to the understanding of the fundamental characteristics of <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactants,</b> which can be further utilized in practical applications...|$|R

The uniqueness in each lattice structure of titania leads to multifaceted physico-chemical and opto-electronic properties, which yield different functionalities and thus influence their performances in various green energy applications.

Thus, the preparation of crystalline titania with tunable phase/particle size/morphology at low to moderate temperatures using a solution-based approach has paved the way for further exciting areas of research. In this focused review, titania synthesis from hydrothermal/solvothermal method, conventional sol-gel method and sol-gel-assisted method via ultrasonication, photoillumination and ILs, thermolysis and microemulsion routes are discussed. These wet chemical methods have broader visibility, since multiple reaction parameters, such as precursor chemistry, <b>surfactants,</b> <b>chelating</b> agents, solvents, mineralizer, pH of the solution, aging time, reaction temperature/time, inorganic electrolytes, can be easily manipulated to tune the final physical structure. This review sheds light on the stabilization/phase transformation pathways of titania polymorphs like anatase, rutile, brookite and TiO 2 (B) under a variety of reaction conditions. The driving force for crystallization arising from complex species in solution coupled with pH of the solution and ion species facilitating the orientation of octahedral resulting in a crystalline phase are reviewed in detail.

An extracellular fraction containing protein purified from a C. versicolor culture solubilized leonardite in vitro. Expression of the activity did not require the presence of leonardite and appeared during idiophase. During ion-exchange and gel filtration column chromatography, leonardite-biosolubilizing activity eluted with syringaldazine oxidase activity and with protein, as measured by A 280 and the biuret protein assay. Syringaldazine is a substrate of the polyphenol oxidase formed by C. versicolor. Comparison of leonardite-biosolubilizing activity {{with the effects of}} chelators and surface-active agents on leonardite showed that biosolubilization was not due to either <b>surfactant</b> or <b>chelating</b> ability.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of chemical cleaning on the rejection of trace contaminants (TrOC) by nanofiltration (NF) membranes. The impact of chemical cleaning on TrOC rejection was investigated by exposing three different virgin NF membrane samples - namely NF 270, NF 90 and TFC-SR 100  to chemical cleaning solutions (i. e. alkalis, acids, <b>surfactants,</b> <b>chelating</b> reagents and a combination of these chemicals) of various strengths and temperatures. Filtration experiments of the chemically cleaned membrane samples were subsequently carried out in a laboratory-scale cross-flow membrane filtration system. The observed variations in rejection of TrOC were related to the variations of the membrane surface structure and properties, including charge, hydrophobicity, permeability and chemistry. The results showed considerable impacts of chemical cleaning on the properties of the NF membranes as well as their capacity to reject TrOC. In this study, the observed changes in TrOC rejection were in good agreement with the changes in the membrane permeate flux. The predominant trend in rejection caused by chemical cleaning depends on the physicochemical properties of the TrOC, the nature of the cleaning solution (i. e. caustic or acidic) and the structure and composition of the membrane. The rejection of negatively charged TrOC was the least affected by chemical cleaning in this study. This is because charge repulsion (which is the predominant rejection mechanism of negatively charged TrOC) was not affected by chemical cleaning. By contrast, the rejection of neutral TrOC by the NF 270 membrane varied considerably due to chemical cleaning as a response to conformational rearrangements of polymeric chains in the membrane active skin layer. These conformational relocations of polymeric chains were mainly driven by variation in the membrane surface charge as a response to caustic and acidic cleaning. On the other hand, the impact of chemical cleaning on the solute rejection by the NF 90 and TFC-SR 100 membranes was insignificant, most likely because of their thicker and denser active skin layer. Caustic cleaning reagents increased the membrane permeability and the convective passage of neutral TrOC through the NF 270 membrane most significantly among all cleaning reagents investigated in this study, particularly when <b>surfactants</b> and/or metal <b>chelating</b> reagents were incorporated in the caustic cleaning solution. In contrast, insignificant variations in the membrane performance were observed when the same metal <b>chelating</b> reagents and <b>surfactants</b> were used individually. The observed variations in the membrane permeability and TrOC rejection due to caustic chemical cleaning are not permanent and can be recovered by subsequently rendering the membrane neutral (e. g. by subsequent acidic cleaning). Similarly, elevated cleaning temperature can compensate for the impact of caustic cleaning, since cyclic changes in the cleaning temperature tightened the membrane polymer significantly. This study also explored the impact of repetitive fouling-cleaning cycles on the rejection of TrOC. Membrane fouling (i. e. by silica colloid, humic acid, alginate and secondary treated effluent) changed the solute rejection by pore blocking, modification of the membrane surface charge, and cake-enhanced concentration polarisation. Subsequent chemical cleaning using a commercial cleaning formulation was applied to recover the membrane flux. Although chemical cleaning effectively restored the membrane flux (over 100 %), surface hydrophobicity and zeta potential was not recovered over multiple fouling-cleaning cycles. In agreement with this, microscopic investigations confirmed traces of remaining foulants on the membrane surface. The enlargement of the membrane pores due to caustic cleaning subsequently led to notable changes in the rejection of neutral TrOC, whereas repetitive fouling-cleaning cycles had negligible effects on the rejection of negatively charged TrOC...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the impacts of chemical cleaning {{on the performance of}} a reverse osmosis membrane. Chemicals used for simulating membrane cleaning include a surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS), a chelating agent (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA), and two proprietary cleaning formulations namely MC 3 and MC 11. The impact of sequential exposure to multiple membrane cleaning solutions was also examined. Water permeability and the rejection of boron and sodium were investigated under various water fluxes, temperatures and feedwater pH. Changes in the membrane performance were systematically explained based on the changes in the charge density, hydrophobicity and chemical structure of the membrane surface. The experimental results show that membrane cleaning can significantly alter the hydrophobicity and water permeability of the membrane; however, its impacts on the rejections of boron and sodium are marginal. Although the presence of <b>surfactant</b> or <b>chelating</b> agent may cause decreases in the rejection, solution pH is the key factor responsible for the loss of membrane separation and changes in the surface properties. The impact of solution pH on the water permeability can be reversed by applying a subsequent cleaning with the opposite pH condition.

The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephacryl S- 200 and Q-Sepharose column chromatography. The protein corresponded to molecular mass and pi values of 67 kDa and 3. 7, respectively. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7. 0 - 8. 0 and 60 degrees C and retained 50 % of its optimum activity at pH 12. The most notable characteristic of the endoglucanase was its high stability up to pH 12 for 20 h at 30 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and cello-oligosaccharides but was inactive on cellobiose, cellotriose, Avicel, xylan, 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside, and 4 -nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside. Analysis of reaction mixtures by HPLC revealed that the enzyme produced almost exclusively cellotriose when acted on CMC and appeared to hydrolyze cello-oligosaccharides by successively releasing cellotriose. The use of 4 -methylumbelliferyl cello-oligosaccharides and the determination of bond cleavage frequency revealed that the enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed the third glycosidic bond adjacent to the glycon.

In {{the same way that}} pollutants are made more bioavailable to microorganisms, the procedure can be used to remove potential interfering materials from soil prior to cell lysis and extraction of DNA from indigenous microorganisms. The effect of soil washing was evaluated by extracting DNA from sediments of an intertidal freshwater wetland contaminated with hydrocarbons and from highly contaminated marine sediments from Sydney Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada. Sediment samples had total organic carbon (TOC) contents that varied between 0. 2 % and 13 %. The chemical lysis technique was also examined by comparison of an ammonium acetate precipitation of proteins and humic acids with a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) incubation and phenol:chloroform extraction. In this study, the incorporation of soil washing steps facilitated the desorption of contaminants from sediment surfaces and improved the recovery of DNA of amplifiable quality from both freshwater and marine sediments. CTAB contributed only slightly to the recovery of DNA of higher quality in the most contaminated sample from Sydney Harbour and was concomitant with a decrease in DNA yield in both sediment types.

The determination {{of the most promising}} extracting solutions is critical for the development of effective treatment technologies such as soil washing/flushing and electrokinetic remediation. MGP contaminated soil was silty sand with 11 % organic matter containing higher levels of phenanthrene and two heavy metals lead and zinc. Several batch tests were conducted using the soil with different extracting solutions at various concentrations to enhance the removal efficiency and to optimize the concentration of each extractant. The test results showed that both surfactants Igepal CA- 720 and Tween 80 at a wide range of concentrations were effective for the removal of phenantherene from the soil. Only selective cosolvents and cyclodextrins n-butylamine and HPCD at higher concentrations were found to be effective in the solubilization of phenanthrene. Selective acids citric acid and phosphoric acid were found to be effective in the removal of heavy metals, while chelating agents EDTA and DTPA resulted in a moderate heavy metal removal. Overall, none of the selected extractants removed both heavy metals and PAHs; therefore, sequential extraction schemes using the selected extractants were investigated.

30|$|Agar is a water-soluble, neutral, polysaccharide, {{extracted}} from several genera of red seaweeds of Rhodophyceae class (Gelidium, Gracilaria, Gelidiella, Pterocladia, Sphaerococcus genera). It {{is made of}} two polysaccharides, agaropectin and agarose. The latter derives from disaccharide agarobiose units sided by 3 -linked β-D-galactopyranosyl and 4 -linked 3, 6 - anhydro-α-L-galactopyranosyl units [17]. Thanks to its gelling properties, agar is applied in several different fields: in biology for the preparation of culture media [18], in chemistry as electrode binder for electrolyte cells [19], in pharmacy for drug delivery [20], in the food industry as thickening agent. Once the agar powder is mixed in water suspension and heated up to 80 °C, it develops a random coil structure which is able to progressively rearrange and gel during the cooling stage, below 40 °C. It then forms thermo-reversible physical gels, characterized by ordered double helix chains linked by hydrogen bonding [21]. The terminations of the chains remain in the coil form, available to join with other terminations and creating a 3 -dimensional reticulum [22]. The resulting microstructure is well-ordered, with {{a high number of}} pores, having rather homogeneous pore size distribution, which enhance water retention and allow liquid water migration within the gel [23]. When agar is applied as a water-based poultice, the solvent effect of water is therefore promoted: in presence of soluble deposits the dissolution is favoured and the dissolved material is drained into the gel structure, which acts as a “sponge”. Agar gels can also be prepared by adding <b>surfactant</b> or <b>chelating</b> agents into the water solutions, to create gels characterized by a variable pH for the treatment of specific substrates [24].|$|R

Overall, the impact of chemical cleaning on surface properties and rejection was membrane and cleaning reagent specific. It was driven mostly by conformational changes of the membrane polymeric active skin layer {{in response to an}} extreme caustic or acidic environment and to a certain extent by the adsorption of cleaning additives (e. g., <b>surfactants</b> and <b>chelating</b> reagents). The influence of chemical cleaning on the membrane properties and separation efficiency was most severe for the NF 270 due to its loose and very thin active skin layer. Caustic cleaning using either the MC 11 or PC 98 formulations led to {{a significant increase in the}} permeability and a considerable decrease in the rejection of both inorganic salts and trace organic contaminants by the NF 270 membrane. In contrast, acidic cleaning using the MC 3 formulation caused a small decrease in the permeability of the NF 270 membrane. The influence of chemical cleaning on the NF 90 and TFC-SR 100 membranes was much less significant, possibly because of their thicker and denser active skin layer. The results reported here demonstrated that the impact of chemical cleaning was not permanent and could be minimised by adapting an appropriate strategy involving caustic cleaning followed by acidic cleaning.

Disturbances such as pitch depositions in thepaper machine (pitch problems), specks in the paper, decreased wet and drystrength, interference with cationic process chemicals, and impaired sheetbrightness and friction properties appear when DSC are present. Transition metalions such as manganese results in higher consumption of bleaching chemicals(hydrogen peroxide) and lowers the optical quality of the final product, andaddition of complexing agents, such as EDTA or DTPA, to prevent this is needed.

In this thesis, a new approach using induced air flotation (IAF) without a cationicpolyelectrolyte addition for the removal of pitch and metal ions from mechanicalpulp mill process waters is presented. The induced air flotation of different processwaters is facilitated by the addition of a <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant</b> and different foamingagents. The influence of the pH value, temperature and foaming agentconcentration on the flotation efficiency has been investigated. The investigations presented show that the disturbing components can be removed from TMP presswater to a high extent. A 90 % decrease in turbidity and a 91 % removal of lipophilicextractives (i. e. resin and fatty acids, triglycerides, sterols and steryl esters) fromunbleached and bleached TMP process water can be obtained by addition of acationic surfactant as foaming agent during flotation. Lower amount of foamingagent is needed to purify efficiently bleached TMP process water, than unbleached. Additionally, fibres located in TMP press water are not removed with the foamfraction but purified. A retained concentration of hydrophilic extractives (i. e. hemicelluloses and lignans) in the process water indicates that the flotation isselective. Moreover, by introduction of a new recoverable surface activecomplexing agent, a <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactant,</b> manganese ions in the form of chelatescan be successfully removed from the pulp fibres and separated from the processwater in the same flotation process. Furthermore, from the purified unbleachedTMP process water a 90 % recovery of dissolved hemicelluloses by anti‐solventprecipitation was obtained. The findings presented above indicate new possibilities for the internal watercleaning stage to decrease DSC emissions to recipient and for recovery of valuableraw materials from purified process water if flotation technology is applied in anintegrated mechanical pulp mill.

Methods: In {{this research}} some additives such as co solvents and tonicity adjusters, <b>surfactants,</b> antioxidants and <b>chelating</b> agents as well as buffer solutions, were used to improve {{the stability of the}} parenteral mixed formulations of B 12 in the presence of other B vitamins (B 1 and B 6). Screening tests and accelerated stability tests were performed according to ICH guidelines Q 1 A (R 2). Results: Shelf life evaluation revealed the best formulation and the proper storage condition. The results indicated the first kinetic models for all tested formulations and the optimum pH value was determined to be 5. 8. There was no evidence of B 12 loss when mixed with B 1 and B 6 in a medical syringe at room temperature for maximum of 8 hours. Conclusion: It is necessary to formulate vitamin B 12 mixed parenteral solutions using proper phosphate buffers (pH= 5. 8) and to indicate “Store in refrigerator” on the mixed parenteral formulations of vitamin B 12 with other B vitamins, which has not been expressed on the label of tested Brand formulations {{at the time of this}} study...|$|R

The theoretical part is focused on biomaterials, bioceramics and phosphates characterization. Further the work is focused on hydroxyapatite, its characteristics and possible synthesis in particular. The synthesis of hydroxyapatite precipitation is described in the experimental part. Syntheses were performed at a reaction temperature of 0 - 80 °C at pH = 8 - 11, at the aging time of 0 - 24 h, {{in the presence of}} <b>surfactant</b> and the <b>chelating</b> agent and with the post-precipitation hydrothermal or ultrasonic treatment. For characterization of the prepared powders, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser diffraction (LD) and the analysis of the specific surface area (BET) were used. Pure hydroxyapatite powders or a mixture of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate were prepared by precipitation syntheses. HA particle morphology was strongly affected by the reaction temperature – with increasing temperature the larger particles with a clearer morphology were formed, mostly in the rod shape. Postprecipitation hydrothermal treatment had a significant influence on the morphology of HA particles – it caused the formation of spherical or slightly elongated particles. The reaction medium of water/ethanol significantly affected the particle morphology – it inhibited the particle growth...|$|R
30|$|Emulsified acid has {{attracted}} considerable {{attention of the}} oil and gas industry due to its delayed nature that allows deeper penetration of acid into the formation which essentially facilitate further enhancing the well productivity, and at the same time minimizes the corrosion issues. However, emulsified acid has only been extensively studied and applied on carbonate formations. Considering more than half of the reservoirs worldwide are sandstone reservoirs, studying the effects of emulsified acid on sandstone under high-temperature conditions would unlock the potential of emulsified acid and help generate more value for {{the oil and gas}} industry by improving the well productivity from sandstone reservoirs. To ensure the applicability of the emulsified acid on the real sandstone reservoir, which usually has a temperature higher than ambient conditions, the stability of emulsified acids is investigated under 300  °F. Then, the stable emulsified acid samples are developed and their impact on the properties of Berea sandstone core samples, including porosity, pore-size distribution, permeability and wettability, are investigated. The core samples have undergone pre-flush (10 % HCl: 5 % CH 3 COOH) before the main flush (emulsified acid). The emulsified acids are prepared using hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, cationic <b>surfactant</b> and <b>chelating</b> agent. Fourteen core samples are saturated with different emulsified acids under vacuum conditions for 3  days to ensure maximum saturation. The porosity, permeability and wettability of each core sample are measured before and after the reaction with acid. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis has been applied to evaluate the change in pore size distribution. This study has demonstrated that the emulsified acids are capable of improving the porosity and permeability of Berea sandstone core sample. The pore size distribution has also been affected by the application of emulsified acid, where more large pores have been evolved to the core samples due to the reaction of acids with the sandstone which ultimately helps in improving the productivity of hydrocarbons. This indicates less precipitation of the secondary reaction products resulting better enhancement in sandstone flow properties. These results demonstrate the potential of emulsified acid during sandstone acidizing as emulsified acid significantly improved the sandstone properties which can essentially enhance the well productivity.|$|R
40|$|Research {{done during}} the last 15 years has proven that one can use CO 2 as a solvent in many processes. There have been {{compounds}} from <b>surfactants</b> to <b>chelating</b> agents that were shown to be soluble in CO 2 to low pressures. By attaching CO 2 -philic groups to polymer chains, previously insoluble polymers have exhibited miscibility with CO 2, allowing for applications such as emulsion polymerization, dispersion polymerization, dissolution of proteins, extraction of heavy metals, and other processes. Unfortunately, the most successful CO 2 -philes, the fluorinated polymers, have a very unfavorable economic drawback that makes their commercial use impractical. As a result, this work seeks to determine the characteristics that could be built into a carbon based polymer {{to allow for the}} polymer to be miscible with CO 2 down to low pressures. Several design elements were considered in this work: the cohesive energy density, the free volume, and the Lewis acid/base interactions with CO 2 acting as a Lewis acid. Lowering the cohesive energy density and increasing the free volume limited undesirable polymer-polymer interactions, while the addition of Lewis base groups to the polymer in the backbone and as grafted side chains increased the favorable polymer-CO 2 interactions. Several side chains containing Lewis base groups were first grafted onto silicon-backbone polymers. The effects of the grafting and degree of substitution were determined, and the best performing side chains were then grafted onto a polyether backbone to investigate their interactions with the carbon/oxygen backbone. This work made clear the importance of adding optimal amounts of a Lewis base group to the polymer, whether in the backbone or as a grafted side chain. While attaining a low cohesive energy density and maintaining a low glass transition temperature are important, polymers with these features alone performed very poorly in CO 2. The addition of Lewis base groups in the backbone or as a side chain dramatically improved the solubility of the polymers and showed the importance of favorable polymer-CO 2 interactions. A key observation was that an ether functional group may provide the same Lewis acid/base interaction with CO 2 that is seen with the acetate group...|$|R
40|$|Phytoremediation of Soil {{containing}} Mixed Contaminants Ramin Memarian, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2012 This {{study investigated}} the application of <b>surfactants</b> and <b>chelates</b> to enhance the removal of mixed contaminants [Cd (II), Pb (II) and used engine oil] from a sandy soil cultivated with Indian mustard plants. For chelate additives, EDTA (Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) {{was found to be}} more efficient than EDDS (Ethylenediamine disuccinic acid) in increasing the accumulation of metal contaminants Pb (II) in the plants. EDTA was also more capable of removing the used engine oil through rhizodegradation than EDDS. EDTA caused a sharper decrease in basal soil respiration (BSR) than EDDS, indicating that the former was much more toxic to the microbes. For surfactant additives, the results showed that Triton X- 100 and Tween 80 at concentrations higher than their critical micellar concentration enhanced phytostabilization of Pb (II). The application of Tween 80 resulted in an increase in phytoremediation of Pb (II). At the same concentrations, Tween 80 was more effective than Triton X- 100 in facilitating rhizodegradation of the used engine oil. Soil basal microbiological respiration tests showed that the application of Tween 80 resulted in an increase in BSR. These tests indicated that the lower concentration of Triton X- 100 had a slightly positive effect on BSR, whereas at higher concentrations, it was inhibitory to the microbes. Empirical phytoremediation models linked to the removal of the heavy metals from the soil were formulated in the study. The two first order kinetic models were able to describe the leaching process for both Cd (II) and Pb (II). The models also revealed that the uptake of Pb (II) and Cd (II) were well described by the Freundlich type model, in the presence of surfactants. On the other hand, in the presence of chelates the uptake of Pb (II) and Cd (II) was found to follow the Langmuir type model. According to the leachability index (LI) determined in the tests, all surfactants tested can be considered as safe additives for enhancing phytoremediation. Compared to Triton X- 100, Tween 80 resulted in lower diffusivity of metals tested and higher values of LI indicating that this surfactant was also safer {{from the point of view}} of reducing ground water pollution. Compared to EDTA, EDDS resulted in higher values of LI, which is desirable. ...|$|R
40|$|Dissolved and Colloidal {{substances}} (DisCo) and metals {{are released}} from wood during thermomechanical pulp (TMP) production. The mechanical treatment causes that these components {{have a tendency}} to accumulate in process waters, as the water circulation systems in integrated paper mills are being closed. Disturbances such as pitch depositions on the paper machine (pitch problems), specks in the paper, decreased wet and dry strength, interference with cationic process chemicals, and impaired sheet brightness and friction properties appear in the presence of DisCo substances. The presence of transition metal ions such as manganese results in higher consumption of bleaching chemicals (hydrogen peroxide) and lowers the optical quality of the final product, and addition of complexing agents, such as EDTA or DTPA, to prevent this is needed. The never ending trends to decrease water consumption and increase process efficiency in pulp and paper production stress that it is very important both to know the effects of wood substances on pulping and papermaking {{and to be able to}} remove them in an efficient way. Carried out investigations presented in this thesis show that the lipophilic extractives can be removed from TMP press water to high extent. A 90 % decrease in turbidity and a 91 % removal of lipophilic extractives from TMP press water can be obtained by addition of a cationic surfactant as foaming agent during flotation.

40|$|In this work, {{the main}} {{emphasis}} of the research concerns the development of isolation and purification methods of biomolecules from biological fluids. Several separation techniques were incorporated in chromatographic gels to obtain multifunctional hybrid chromatographic separation media for proteins, peptides and amino acid isolation and purification. In {{the first part of}} the research, several chelating agents were synthesized and their effectiveness to purify immunoglobulins using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) was investigated. Ethylenediamine triacetic acid (TED) with immobilized copper resulted in the most effective in terms of purification and protein capacities. The next part of the work involved the development of hybrid chromatographic media that combines protein specific adsorption with sharp controlled size access permeation. This was accomplished by incorporating two types of ligand derivatives, one that permits the permeation of only certain molecular size range compounds, and a second one that specifically binds target biomolecules among the compounds of that specific molecular size range. Hybrid systems included binding ligands for Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEX) and Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) combined with a controlled access polymer at different densities such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran derivatives. In general, low grafting density of high molecular weight PEG was found to be as effective as high grafting density of low molecular weight PEG in the rejecting properties of the semi-permeable synthesized media. Theoretical and experimental batch adsorption studies were also performed with the hybrid media and a mathematical model was developed to study the uptake of proteins under specific conditions of controlled permeation. In the last stage of this work, <b>chelating</b> <b>surfactants</b> were synthesized and used as reversible affinity ligands on reversed phase adsorbents for protein separations. One of the main accomplishments of this research was the development of separation media for small molecular size compounds from larger molecules and from complex biological systems. Applications of special interest will include the isolation and purification of solutes, such as metal ions, toxins, drugs, biomolecules, including proteins, biotoxins, nucleic acids, peptides, hormones, and biomarkers from biological fluids (such as human serum, urine, etc.) and from aqueous solutions...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the use of near-/super-critical carbon dioxide has {{received}} much attention as a green alternative to organic solvents for chemical reactions, separations, and extractions because of its pressure-tunable physicochemical properties and economic advantages. However the advantages are diminished because of a relative narrow range of CO 2 -soluble materials. The goal of this work is to identify, design and synthesize oxygenated hydrocarbon-based CO 2 -soluble polymers that are able to serve as construction blocks for copolymers, dispersants, <b>surfactants,</b> thickeners, and <b>chelating</b> agents. Without concerning on the cost and the environmental persistence like fluorinated materials, the inexpensive, environmentally benign materials would significantly enhance the viability of near-/super-critical carbon dioxide-based technology. Based on both experimental heuristics and ab initio simulation results of molecular modeling (performed by Dr. Johnson's group), we proposed specific new polymer structures: poly(3 -acetoxy oxetane) (PAO), poly(vinyl methoxymethyl ether) (PVMME), poly(vinyl 1 -methoxyethyl ether) (PVMEE), and cellulose triacetate (CTA) oligomers. Phase behavior studies were also performed with novel CO 2 -philic compounds containing vinyl acetate, propylene glycol, or multiple tert-butyl groups. PAO, PVMME and PVMME were soluble in CO 2, but not as soluble as poly(vinyl acetate). Oligomers of cellulose triacetate with as many as four repeat units solubilized into dense CO 2 less than 14 MPa in the concentration range of 1 - 5 wt%. Phase behaviors of more than thirty compounds in dense CO 2 were studied in this project. A new type of phase behavior for solid (at ambient temperature) CO 2 -philes that melt and dissolve in CO 2 was detailed using a model binary mixture of β-D-maltose octaacetate and CO 2. Copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and vinyl acetate (VAc) exhibited lower miscibility pressures than either of the homopolymers, probably due to quadradentate binding configurations with CO 2. Phase behavior investigation of poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) monobutyl ether in CO 2 demonstrated ether-CO 2 interactions should receive as much attention as carbonyl-CO 2 interactions when designing CO 2 -philic functional groups. 1, 3, 5 -tri-tert-butylbenzene and tri-tert-butyl-phenol were both extraordinarily soluble in CO 2, and are excellent candidates for CO 2 -soluble sand binders. In summary, although a new CO 2 thickener was not identified, new non-fluorous CO 2 -soluble materials were identified that were, in general, acetate-rich with flexible chains, weak self-interactions, and multidentate interaction between CO 2 and solute functional groups...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to enrich}} the literature on boron rejection by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. A novel method to improve boron rejection by NF/RO membranes, {{which is based on}} the complexation reactions between boron and poly-alcohols (polyols), was investigated. The impacts of chemical cleaning and chemical preservation on the boron rejection efficiency of RO membranes were examined. In addition, the dissertation assessed the feasibility of utilising boron rejection data as a surrogate for the rejection of Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) – an emerging pollutant which attracts major concerns in contemporary water reclamation applications. Filtration experiments were conducted using a laboratory-scale cross-flow membrane filtration system. Experimental results were elaborated based on the recognised transport mechanisms of boron through NF/RO membranes and also on the characterised membrane surface properties. In the presence of polyols, significant boron rejection improvement was obtained and the extent of the impact was directly related to the stability constant of the boron– polyol complex. Polyols could complex with boron in either the boric acid or borate anion forms; however the complexation between polyol and boric acid appeared to be incomplete. With and without the presence of polyols, boron rejection was strongly pH dependent. The increase in boron rejection due to polyol addition was higher for the NF membrane compared to the RO membrane. A boron:polyol molar ratio of 1 : 1 appeared to be adequate. The presence of polyols did not cause any observable membrane fouling. Results reported here suggest that the addition of polyols could allow NF membranes to be effectively used for boron removal. Experimental results of this study showed that chemical cleaning can significantly change the hydrophobicity and water permeability of the RO membrane; however, its impacts on the rejections of boron and sodium were marginal. Although the presence of <b>surfactant</b> or <b>chelating</b> agent could cause decreases in the rejections, solution pH was found to be the key factor responsible for the loss of membrane separation and surface properties. The impacts of solution pH on the water permeability could be reversed by applying a subsequent cleaning with the opposite pH condition. Nevertheless, the impacts of solution pH on boron and sodium rejections were irreversible in most cases. Chemical preservation could change the membrane surface properties, and consequently water permeability and solute rejection efficiency of the membrane were negatively impacted. The impacts of preservation on boron rejection and sodium rejection were similar in magnitude and more significant than those on water permeability. The results indicated that the impact of chemical preservation on the membrane depends on both the preserving chemicals used and the solution pH value. More importantly, the undesirable impacts of chemical preservation could be minimised by appropriate selection of the preservatives and by preserving the membrane in a reducing condition. A near-neutral pH (i. e., pH 7) is necessary to avoid any significantly negative impacts on membrane performance due to chemical preservation using either formaldehyde or sodium metabisulfite. The study results suggested that the previously recommended minimum pH value of 3 of the preservative solution may be inadequate. A strong linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 95) between the rejections of boron and Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by six different reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was obtained, suggesting that boron {{can be used as a}} surrogate for NDMA rejection. This proposal is based on the premise that the rejection of both boric acid and NDMA is governed by steric hindrance and that they have similar molecular dimensions. The concept proposed here is shown to be valid at pH 8 or below where boron exists as the neutral boric acid species and NDMA is also a neutral solute. Observed changes in the rejections of these two species, as a function of permeate fluxes and feed solution temperatures, were also almost identical. Boron rejection increased from 21 to 79 % and the correlation coefficient of the linear regression between boron and NDMA rejections was 0. 99 as the permeate flux increased from 5 to 60 L. m- 2. h- 1. Similarly, a linear correlation between boron and NDMA rejections was observed as the feed solution temperature increased from 10 to 40 °C. This linear correlation was also validated in a tertiary treated effluent matrix...|$|R
