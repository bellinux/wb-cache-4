40|$|Once {{the first}} sources have formed, their mass deposition, energy {{injection}} and emitted radiation can deeply affect the subsequent galaxy formation process and influence {{the evolution of}} the IGM via a number of so-called feedback effects. The word 'feedback' is by far one of the most used in modern cosmology, where it is applied to a vast range of situations and astrophysical objects. Generally speaking, the concept of feedback invokes a back reaction of a process on itself or on the causes that have produced it. The character of feedback can be either negative or positive. Here, I will review the present <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> of the feedback effects from the first stars and galaxies.

40|$|Micro EDM (Electro Discharge Machining) is a known nonconventional {{process for}} the {{machining}} of hard to cut materials. Due to its ablating nature based on melting and evaporation through heat induced by electrical discharges, it can function independently of the hardness, toughness or brittleness of the workpiece. Because of these benefits, EDM is widely used in tool- and mould making; micro-EDM, with its much lower discharge energies, has been successfully applied to micromachining of high-accuracy parts. The precision manufacturing of high aspect ratio micro geometries such as deep micro bores relies on stable process conditions in the discharge gap. Its minimization - a precondition for minimal feature size and higher accuracy – limits the effectiveness of conventional flushing techniques, leading to a higher fraction of unwanted discharge states (open and short circuit), lower process speed, and geometrical errors. New hybrid technology approaches, such as ultrasonic or low frequency superposition, significantly raise the process stability and speed. Another restriction {{on the use of}} EDM, the exclusive machinability of electrically conductive materials, is overcome by the application of the assisting electrode method that enables a micro-ED-machining of nonconductive zirconium oxide ceramics. This paper presents the current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> into the micro-EDM process with ultrasonic vibration assistance - directly applied to the workpiece and indirectly applied high-intensity ultrasonic to the dielectric - in metallic materials {{as well as in the}} machining of electrically nonconductive ceramic materials.

40|$|Cell based therapies {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{in the context of}} transplantation tolerance induction. The most successful protocols have relied on transfusion of bone marrow prior to the transplantation of a renal allograft.
