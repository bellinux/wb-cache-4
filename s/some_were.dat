5|$|The Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s drove {{migrants}} {{across the}} Irish Sea, and many {{settled in the}} industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool – at the 1851 census, 13% {{of the population of}} Manchester and Salford were Irish-born, and in Liverpool the figure was 22%. In response there was a wave of anti-Catholic riots and Protestant Orange Orders proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North. By 1881 there were 374 Orange organisations in Lancashire, 71 in the North East, and 42 in Yorkshire. From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia, and from East Asia and Africa. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, <b>some</b> <b>were</b> escaping poverty, <b>some</b> <b>were</b> servants or slaves, <b>some</b> <b>were</b> sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, <b>some</b> <b>were</b> Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and <b>some</b> <b>were</b> migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire. At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
