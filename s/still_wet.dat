They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – <b>still</b> <b>wet</b> {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as {{a binding}} agent {{can be traced to}} the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while <b>still</b> <b>wet.</b> These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was <b>still</b> <b>wet</b> and {{slippery}} and all drivers opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hamilton got away better at the start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens was touched from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with a damper failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when he came into the pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} {{used in the}} popular frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael was to scrape indentations into {{certain areas of the}} plaster while <b>still</b> <b>wet</b> to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others. The eyes {{of the people of the}} School of Athens are sunken-in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pensive. Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark 'outlining' of his central figures within his frescoes.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, {{anhydrous}} {{sodium sulfate}} {{is widely used}} as an inert drying agent, for removing traces of water from organic solutions. It is more efficient, but slower-acting, than the similar agent magnesium sulfate. It is only effective below about 30°C, {{but it can be}} used with a variety of materials since it is chemically fairly inert. Sodium sulfate is added to the solution until the crystals no longer clump together; the two video clips (see above) demonstrate how the crystals clump when <b>still</b> <b>wet,</b> but some crystals flow freely once a sample is dry.|$|E

25|$|To {{make the}} {{parchment}} more aesthetically pleasing or {{more suitable for}} the scribes, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing pumice powder into the flesh side of parchment while it was <b>still</b> <b>wet</b> on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.|$|E

25|$|The {{carving of}} a piece, which is done while the wood is <b>still</b> <b>wet,</b> can last {{anywhere}} from hours to a month, {{depending on the}} size and fineness of the piece. Often the copal wood that is used will influence what is made, both because of the shapes the branches can take and because male and female trees differ in hardness and shape. Carving is done with non-mechanical hand tools such as machetes, chisels and knives. The only time a more sophisticated tool is used is when a chain saw is employed to cut off a branch or level a base for the proposed figure. The basic shape of the creature is usually hacked using a machete, then a series of smaller knives used as the final shape is achieved. Certain details such as ears, tails and wings are usually made from pieces separate from the one for the main body.|$|E

25|$|Cahokia, Pre-Columbian North Americas largest {{civic center}} north of Mexico, {{produced}} {{some of the}} finest and most widely spread ceramics. Pottery from the Cahokia site was especially fine, exhibiting smooth surfaces, very thin walls, and distinctive tempering, slips and coloring. Archaeologists have recorded how these qualities changed and evolved through time, and most examples can be pinpointed very accurately within the phases of the sites chronology. Ramey Incised and Powell Plain are two varieties that emerged during the Stirling Phase, and are considered two of the most important local varieties. A distinctive trait of this period is the shell temper. The cores of the sherds are typically a range of greys to buffs and creams. Some have slips of liquid clay and pigment with common colors being red, grey, and black and the surfaces polished to a high sheen. Although their attributes are nearly identical, there are major differences. While the Powell Plain has an unadorned surface, Ramey Incised are burnished and decorated with a series of incised motifs decorating the upper shoulders of the jar most often interpreted as having underworld or water connections. The incised decoration is added when the clay is <b>still</b> <b>wet</b> by tracing a design with a blunt-ended tool. The specific shapes and incised motifs are used to place the artifacts securely into the local chronology. Most have been found in association with high status items fashioned from exotic materials and associated with specialized structures such as mortuaries and temples, and were almost certainly vessels used exclusively by the elites and for ritual purposes. As the influence of the Cahokian religion, lifestyle and trade network expanded outward from its American Bottom origins, examples of its high status pottery went with it. Numerous examples have been found of local imitations of the exotic wares, albeit usually with less technical skill. Examples of Cahokian made or inspired wares have been found as far away as Aztalan in Wisconsin, the Winterville Site in Mississippi. and Fort Ancient sites in Ohio.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} this race {{would be reduced}} to 215 laps / 220.375 miles (354.659 km) due to rain. The race was {{actually}} restarted with 10 laps to go but because the track was <b>still</b> too <b>wet</b> to drive on, Danica Patrick spun immediately when the green flag came out, resulting in a multiple car crash. Will Power was involved as well and was very mad about the call, like multiple other drivers and team owners were. They were mad because the race got restarted, while they all said that the track was <b>still</b> too <b>wet</b> to race on during the caution period. Oriol Servià took over the lead from Ryan Hunter-Reay during the last restart but because the restart heavily failed as the track was <b>still</b> too <b>wet,</b> the race would be red flagged and the order like how the drivers were running before the aborted restart, would count as the unofficial race results. This means Ryan Hunter-Reay was declared winner. Newman/Haas Racing and Chip Ganassi Racing filed protests regarding to the finish because of Servia's pass off Hunter-Reay on the aborted restart. The hearing was scheduled on August 22, which would also include Andretti Autosport. The unofficial results would not change and Ryan Hunter-Reay would become the official winner of the race.|$|R

500|$|The Third Test in Adelaide was Morris's first Test as captain, after Hassett withdrew on match eve {{due to a}} {{strained}} hip muscle. Australia were already one batsman short after the Australian Board of Control had earlier vetoed the selection of Barnes [...] "for grounds other than cricketing ability", which was widely {{believed to be a}} result of Barnes' previous clashes with authority. Under board's regulations at the time, a replacement player needed the approval of the entire board. Since it was the weekend, some of the members could not be contacted by phone, and as a result Hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside the twelve man squad. Instead, his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in the squad. This left Morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and Miller as the all-rounder. Morris had a long tail with wicketkeeper Gil Langley and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23, and was reportedly [...] "in a state of shock". Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a sticky wicket. Because of a leak in the covers, one end of the pitch was dry and the other was wet. Australia were bowled out for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict the West Indies to 105. In all 22 wickets fell on the first day, the most in a Test on Australian soil in 50 years. Morris proceeded to reverse the batting order in the second innings, with bowler Ian Johnson and Langley opening the batting. They were followed by bowlers Geff Noblet and Doug Ring, {{in order to protect the}} batsmen from a wicket that was <b>still</b> <b>wet.</b> Ring made an unexpected 67 and Morris scored 45 as Australia compiled 255, but it was not enough; the West Indies reached the target with six wickets in hand.|$|E
