Overall, {{there is a strong}} emphasis on ownership, or to be precise, ownership-within-tradition. Family/middle class capitalism and the political/historical background of Switzerland are deciding as well, whereas size and capacities astonishingly seem to matter less. This generated some testable hypothesis, e. g., on how the Swiss SME model will be received in particular settings to which it is “exported”. Further, <b>Swiss</b> SMEs <b>turned</b> out to be genuine “social enterprises” so that the relevance of “social business planning” needs to be questioned, certainly as a novel idea in Switzerland. Overall, this study challenges the primacy of formal management systems to support CSR in companies, especially SMEs, and addresses critical moments at which the nexus between small businesses, Swiss society, and the state might be adjusted...|$|R

50|$|Psychagogy {{maintained}} {{its association with}} ethical and moral self-improvement, and during the 1920s psychagogic methods were assimilated into the work of hypnosis, psychoanalysis, and psychotherapy. The International Institute for Psychagogy and Psychotherapy was founded in 1924 by Charles Baudouin, a <b>Swiss</b> psychoanalyst. In <b>turn,</b> psychagogy was influenced by other psychological fields such as social psychology, developmental psychology, and depth psychology. Due to the additional effect of special education and social work on the field during the 1950s and 1960s, psychagogy and its practitioners {{found their way to}} the specialized role of working with emotionally disturbed adolescents. In 1955, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) was developed by Albert Ellis, an American psychologist. Heavily influenced by psychagogic methods, REBT is an evidence-based psychotherapy that promotes goal achievement and well-being by first resolving negative emotions and behaviors. The term psychagogy fell out of use during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
30|$|Ten {{years after}} its constitution, the Federal Commission for Foreigners {{published}} its first report on the “so-called second generation of foreigners” (CFE 1980), a document which marks the entry of this theme in the Swiss public arena. At the time young foreigners were mainly of Italian and Spanish origin, children of the workers that had fuelled the post-war industrial development of Switzerland. In {{the wake of the}} oil crisis in the 1970 s, immigration to Switzerland decreased, but immigration flows soon recovered with newly recruited workers arriving in the 1980 s and 1990 s. They came predominantly from Portugal, Turkey and Yugoslavia (Wanner, Efionayi, and Fibbi, 2009) and occupied similar positions in the labour market than the Southern Europeans did earlier. As <b>Swiss</b> immigration policy <b>turned</b> towards the European Union, the conclusion of the Bilateral Agreements between Switzerland and the European Union in 1999 and the adoption of the Federal Act on Foreign Nationals in 2005 institutionalised a dual recruitment regime, one for EU-EFTA 1 citizens and one for third country nationals. This polarisation appears also in the integration policy and public debates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the legacy of Jacob Burckhardt and Heinrich Wölfflin as founders of the {{department}} of art history at the university of Basel, Switzerland. Wölfflin’s pupils became his successors as head of the department and museum from H. A. Schmid, Friedrich Rintelen, Paul Ganz to Joseph Gantner and Hans Reinhardt until the 1960 s. Wölfflin’s theories and teachings continued to be propagated throughout this period. During the intellectual isolation of Switzerland during the Nazi period and WWII, <b>Swiss</b> art historians <b>turned</b> to local topics for their research. Gantner’s scholarship then focused on modern and medieval art as well as on issues of aesthetics and art criticism. His pupils primarily chose medieval topics for their dissertations and future research, while some branched out into modern art. While thoroughly grounded in a formalist tradition, they now incorporated a contextual and interdisciplinary approach. In 1939, a strong counterforce to older traditional studies occurred at Basel with the appointment of Georg Schmidt as director of the Kunstmuseum and Kupferstichkabinett. He changed the direction of the museum towards modern and contemporary art and helped establish the present character of Basel as a contemporary art city rather than the traditional city and university it had been known for...|$|R

40|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} and registered partnership brought new, unexpected diversity to light between European countries: British or <b>Swiss</b> frequency rates <b>turn</b> {{out to be}} ten times higher than Swedish or German rates, hundred times higher than Slovenian rates. This diversity {{is not to be}} considered as socially problematic per se. Yet, it has to be explained and the explanation might detect effects of social inclusion or exclusion. Previous studies invalidated the hypothesis that it may be explained by unequal levels of legal and financial advantages coming with the registration (Festy, 2006). This paper tries to formulate new hypotheses. Preliminary results show a major influence of marriage values. But the effects of marriage values seem conditioned by the level of social homophobia that admits or not to come out as a same-sex union to one’s family of origin. They also seem conditioned by differences in family values and practices that we observe in the different parts of Europe. However, many questions remain unanswered by lack of data: in many countries, statistics are lacking, incomplete or show data for three or four years only. But even if the conclusions cannot be more than preliminary hypotheses, they may be formulated and discussed already at this stage, because the international diversity undoubtedly {{will turn out to be}} extreme. The study is based on two types of material. First, it relies on socio-demographic indicators of same-sex union registration, marriage values, homophobia and gender inequality. Second, it relies on interviews with same-sex couples, registered or not, in Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and France, aiming at a better understanding of motivation for same-sex couples to register or not to register in the concrete circumstances of their social environment...|$|R
5000|$|On May 5, 1977, a {{furniture}} truck backed into the clock, damaging the pedestal. Benny and Della Baxter hired a salvage company {{the following day}} to use a crane to lift the clock from the pedestal {{so it could be}} repaired. During the procedure, the clock was accidentally dropped causing it to smash into pieces on the sidewalk. The cast iron casing of the clock was relatively unscathed, but much of the workings was heavily damaged. The accident shocked the Baxters and residents of New Bern. Dabney Coddington, then a curator at Tryon Palace, said [...] "That block of Pollock Street really looks naked, believe me." [...] The Baxters attempted to repair or replace the clock, but were unsuccessful. The surviving pedestal was all that remained on the street for the next fourteen years while the broken pieces were stored {{in the basement of the}} jewelry store. In 1990, the non-profit Swiss Bear Downtown Development Corporation wanted to see if it was possible to restore the clock. Swiss Bear was granted ownership of the clock by the Baxter family on the condition it was restored. <b>Swiss</b> Bear in <b>turn</b> told city leaders the organization would help restore the clock if the city took over ownership and maintenance costs following the restoration. A Swiss Bear representative contacted the clock manufacturer Verdin Company of Ohio which had the original patterns of the clock case. Swiss Bear began the Baxter Clock Restoration Campaign which raised the necessary $28,000 needed for repairs. The repaired clock was dedicated on April 20, 1991, with special guest Patricia Dorsey, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, in attendance.

Sources are unclear, whether he sold them due to his debts he had accumulated owing to his luxurious lifestyle, or just [...] "rented" [...] them {{because he wanted to}} have them protected better against the expansion of the <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy. In <b>turn,</b> he extneded his Vorarlberg possessions, purchasing the County of Sonnenberg in 1474 and, together with the Swiss (with whom he had concluded a peace treaty in Konstanz) and the Alsatian cities, he sided against Duke Charles of Burgundy in the Battle of Héricourt.In 1477, his cousin Frederick, crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1452, elevated him to Archduke. Three years later, Princess Eleanor died, and 1484, Sigismund married the 16-year-old Catherine of Saxony, daughter of the Wettin duke Albert III of Saxony. He had no offspring from either marriage.In the later years of the 1470s and early 1480s Sigismund issued a decree that instituted a radical coinage reformation that eventually led up {{to the creation of the}} world's first really large and heavy silver coin in nearly a millennium, the guldengroschen, which the Habsburgs in Bohemia developed later into the thaler. This coin was the ancestor of many of the major European coin denominations to come later and also of the US dollar. Using new mining methods and technology, the largely quiescent silver mines in Tirol were brought back into production and soon numerous surrounding states were re-opening old mines and minting similar coins. This production of large coinage exploded as silver from Spain's colonies in the Americas flooded the European economy. It is from these reforms in part that Sigismund acquired the nickname of der Münzreiche, or [...] "rich in coin".|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Circular Economy is much {{discussed}} among experts and in sustainably advanced business contexts {{such as the}} 2017 Sustainability Summit in London. Several multinational companies have already joined networks to accelerate the transition into futureproofed business practices. Startups, long-established companies and scientific research are devising groundbreaking solutions to work towards this new business imperative. At its core, the Circular Economy aims at replacing the traditional, linear way of extraction, production, consumption and disposal with a circular model, where waste is considered as a precious resource for new applications. However, it seems that in the Swiss business environment the concept is rather unknown or ignored, {{even though it is}} highly relevant considering the current and forecasted macro-economic and environmental developments. “Adapt or die” {{is one of the more}} recent statements in the light of environmental pollution, the tightening of resource availability together with population growth and increasing consumption on a global level. Therefore, this Bachelor’s thesis aims to analyze the present status of and to provide guidance for the Swiss fashion retail industry. By means of a multiple-case, embedded case study design, two Swiss fashion retailers are studied within their respective ecosystems. The two units of study were selected to approach a certain degree of external analytic validity, which is the reason why a large multinational and a smaller player with Swiss tradition were chosen. Qualitative and quantitative sources of primary and secondary data are adduced, whereas solely qualitative methods are applied. The assessments are then made inductively on the basis of the business model Recovery & Recycling. It is as such one of five Accenture-devised possibilities for enterprises to embark on a circular future. It was found that successfully employing the Recovery & Recycling business model embraces decoupling in two different ways: decoupling from potentially harmful resources, the environmental perspective and, decoupling from increasingly scarce resources, the economic perspective. The <b>Swiss</b> fashion industry <b>turned</b> out to be rather advanced within the environmental perspective, yet there is room for improvement when it comes to closing the material loop from an economic perspective. Smaller players with limited means are well advised to draw on the many instruments or methods already available and to imitate larger, more advanced players. Finally, some advancements depend on breakthroughs in recycling technology and material sciences. Nevertheless, much can already be improved by efficient design of products and processes in a way that facilitates reuse and recycling...|$|R
