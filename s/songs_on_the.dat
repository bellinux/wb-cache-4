Occasionally, the band would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E

After hearing him play {{a couple of}} <b>songs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he still needed to develop as an artist.|$|E

5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala.

5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that the}} album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. <b>Songs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had been written in the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended only for the Japanese market).

Several of the <b>songs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album were previously recorded by the band {{in one form or}} another, although most of the songs are completely new material.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} <b>songs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack, or {{employing a}} score, The Wire primarily uses pieces {{of music that}} emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E

5|$|Spiritual Machines is {{the fourth}} studio album by the Canadian {{alternative}} rock band Our Lady Peace, released by Columbia Records in December 2000.

Short tracks of spoken dialog from Kurzweil himself are interspersed among the actual <b>songs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. The Kurzweil K250 keyboard, one of his inventions, was utilized throughout the recording of the album.|$|E
