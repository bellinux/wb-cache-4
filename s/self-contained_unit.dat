25|$|An {{important}} step {{in the development of}} open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the demand regulator in 1864 by the French engineers Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol. Their suit was the first to supply air to the user by adjusting the flow according to the diver's requirements. The system still had to use surface supply, as the storage cylinders of the 1860s were not able to withstand the high pressures necessary for a practical <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E

500|$|Reed's first {{response}} to the request for school stories for The Boy's Own Paper was The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch, which ran for 19 instalments from October 1880 to April 1881. The travels of a schoolboy's pocket watch are charted through school, university and, finally, India {{at the time of}} the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The school, [...] "Randlebury", is believed to be based, like [...] "Parkhurst", on information Reed received from friends who had boarded at Radley. The success of the story encouraged the B.O.P.s editors to ask Reed to attempt a longer and more ambitious work. The result was The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's, which became the favourite and most influential of all Reed's stories. Extended over 38 episodes, each a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> within an overall plot, this was the first of a sequence of school stories, all serialised in the B.O.P. [...] The boarding school milieu was repeated, with a few variations, in The Willoughby Captains (serialised 1883–84), The Master of the Shell (1887–88), The Cock-House at Fellsgarth (1891) and Tom, Dick and Harry (1892–93). Reed followed the suggestion of his editors by setting My Friend Smith (1882–83) in a different kind of school, a [...] "modest establishment for the backward and troublesome". It was, however, the boarding school stories that endured and which became the standard model for school stories for many decades. All the serials were quickly issued in book form, and most were reprinted for the benefit of successive generations of boys, up to the 1950s. The model was imitated or copied by other writers for the next half century; according to historian Isabel Quigly, [...] "Reed was a better writer than his followers, and has been diminished by their imitations." ...|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for the service wings {{to be the same}} size as the main part of the house which they served, or even larger than it. At the Baroque Castle Howard and its slightly younger relation Blenheim Palace completed in 1722, the service wings are of monumental proportions, intended to be highly visible, enhancing the appearance of both the size and prestige of the mansion. In smaller houses the flanking wings could take the form of symmetrical pavilions linked to the corps de logis by open or closed colonnades. Each pavilion was a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> for a designated purpose as at both Holkham Hall and Kedleston, where one pavilion housed the kitchens and staff, and another the private family rooms.

2500|$|Berti {{preferred}} {{an advance}} {{along the coast}} road by the infantry of the XXI Corps, because the metropolitan infantry divisions of XXI Corps had scant desert experience. They would be flanked to the south by the much more experienced Libyan divisions and the motorised Maletti Group. The ground forces were supported by the [...] of the Regia Aeronautica, with [...] of various types. The command had four bomber wings, a fighter wing, three fighter groups, two reconnaissance groups, and two squadrons of colonial reconnaissance aircraft, with Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers, Breda Ba.65 ground attack aircraft, Fiat CR.42 fighters and IMAM Ro.37, Caproni Ca.309 and Caproni Ca.310bis reconnaissance aircraft. The [...] was organised to follow and support the army in the field as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit.</b> Berti could expect little support from the Italian Regia Marina, because ten submarines had been lost since Italy declared war, the fleet was too important to risk and was short of fuel.|$|E
2500|$|ATC's North African Wing {{had already}} {{provided}} stopgap support by transporting 250 spare B-29 engines to the CBI in April and May 1944, using 25 C-54s over a [...] shuttle route {{from the port}} of Casablanca to Calcutta {{that came to be}} called the [...] "Crescent Blend" [...] until three special mission C-46 squadrons—created in early 1944 under the code name [...] "Moby Dick"—were ready to carry out supply operations for XX Bomber Command. Designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Transport Squadrons (Mobile), each was intended to be a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> of twenty C-46s, flight crews, maintenance and engineering specialists, and a full complement of station operation personnel, although when first committed the service elements had not yet been integrated. They arrived in the CBI in June 1944, with the 1st and 2nd MATS based at Kalaikunda, West Bengal, taking over the [...] "Crescent Blend" [...] shuttle and bringing in over 100 spare engines per month, while the 3rd MATS was sent forward to the ICD base at Kunming to augment the India-China airlift.|$|E

6000|$|The same {{familiar}} patterns recur {{in every}} large collection of finger prints, and the eye soon selects {{what appear to}} be typical forms; but are they truly [...] "typical" [...] or not? By a type I understand an ideal form around which the actual forms are grouped, very closely in its immediate neighbourhood, and becoming more rare with increasing rapidity at an increasing distance from it, just {{as is the case with}} shot marks to the right or left of a line drawn vertically through the bull's eye of a target. The analogy is exact; in both cases there is a well-defined point of departure; in both cases the departure of individual instances from that point is due to a multitude of independently variable causes. In short, both are realisations of the now well-known theoretical law of Frequency of Error. The problem then is this:--take some one of the well-marked patterns, such as it appears on a particular digit,--say a loop on the right thumb; find the average number of ridges that cross a specified portion of it; then this average value will determine an ideal centre from which individual departures may be measured; next, tabulate the frequency of the departures that attain to each of many successive specified distances from that ideal centre; then see whether their diminishing frequency as the distances increase, is or is not in accordance with the law of frequency of error. If it is, then the central form has the attributes of a true type, and such will be shown to be the case with the loops of either thumb. I shall only give the data and the results, not the precise way in which they are worked out, because an account of the method employed in similar cases will be found in Natural Inheritance, and again in the Memoir on Finger Prints in the Phil. Trans.; it is too technical to be appropriate here, and would occupy too much space. The only point which need be briefly explained and of which non-mathematical readers might be ignorant, is how a single numerical table derived from abstract calculations can be made to apply to such minute objects as finger prints, as well as to the shot marks on a huge target; what is the common unit by which departures on such different scales are measured? The answer is that it is a <b>self-contained</b> <b>unit</b> appropriate to each series severally, and technically called the Probable Error, or more briefly, P.E., in the headings to the following tables. In order to determine it, the range of the central half of the series has to be measured, namely, of that part of the series which remains after its two extreme quarters have been cut off and removed. The series had no limitation before, its two ends tailing away indefinitely into nothingness, but, by the artifice of lopping off a definite fraction of the whole series from both ends of it, a sharply-defined length, call it PQ, is obtained. Such series as have usually to be dealt with are fairly symmetrical, so the position of the half-way point M, between P and Q, corresponds with rough accuracy to the average of the positions of all the members of the series, that is to the point whence departures have to be measured. MP, or MQ,--or still better, 1/2(MP + MQ) is the above-mentioned Probable Error. It is so called because the amount of Error, or Departure from M of any one observation, falls just as often within the distance PE as it falls without it. In the calculated tables of the Law of Frequency, PE (or a multiple of it) is taken as unity. In each observed series, the actual measures have to be converted into another scale, in which the PE of that series is taken as unity. Then observation and calculation may be compared on equal terms.|$|E
