40|$|Objective: Clinical {{acceptance}} of laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring (LDPM) of microcirculation suffers {{from lack of}} quantitatively reliable signal data, due to varying tissue constitution, temperature, hydration, etc. In this article, we show that a novel approach using physiological models for response upon provacations provides quantitatively and clinically relevant time constants. Methods: We investigated this for two provocation protocols: postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) and iontophoresis shots, measured with LDPM on extremities. PORH experiments were performed on patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) or diabetes mellitus (DM), and on healthy controls. Iontophoresis experiments were performed on pre-eclamptic patients and healthy controls. We developed two dynamical physical models, both based on two characteristic time constants: for PORH, an "arterial" and a "capillary" time constant and, <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis,</b> a "diffusion" and a "decay" time constant. Results: For the different subject groups, we could extract time constants that could probably be related to physiological differences. <b>For</b> <b>iontophoresis,</b> a shot saturation constant was determined, with very different values for different groups and administered drugs. Conclusions: With these models, {{the dynamics of the}} provocations can be investigated and quantitative comparisons between experiments and subject groups become available. The models offer a quantifiable standard that is independent of the type of LDPM instrumentation. Microcirculation (2009) 16, 559 - 571. doi: 10. 1080 / 1073968090295610...|$|R

5000|$|Sonophoresis is {{a process}} that {{exponentially}} increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, usually consisting of hydrophilic molecules and macromolecules, (transdermal delivery) into the epidermis, dermis and skin appendages. Sonophoresis occurs because ultrasound waves stimulate micro-vibrations within the skin epidermis and increase the overall kinetic energy of molecules making up topical agents. This technology {{has been found to be}} most effective at low frequencies (less than 100 kHz). [...] It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer to the skin. The ultrasound probably enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating. Sonophoresis is also used without drug delivery in physical therapy, and as a complementary modality <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis.</b>|$|R
40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{might be}} an important and early event in the pathogenesis of major cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the evaluation of endothelial function in humans may be of great clinical relevance. Usual methods for that purpose are either invasive and/or technically demanding. In the dermal microcirculation, endothelial function may be assessed noninvasively from the laser Doppler measurement of increases in blood flow after either the transdermal application of acetylcholine by iontophoresis, or the release of transient arterial occlusion (reactive hyperemia). An endothelium-independent response may be provided by the iontophoresis of sodium nitroprusside. This approach is notable for technical simplicity, but of uncertain reproducibility. Sixteen young, healthy, nonsmoking males were examined in the fasting state. Changes in skin blood flow were measured with a laser Doppler imager during the iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, as well as during reactive hyperemia, on two different days, at each of two different sites on the volar face of the forearm. Nonspecific effects related to the stimulation of terminal nerve fibers by the iontophoretic current were suppressed by prior surface anesthesia. The iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside induced a seven- to eightfold increase in dermal blood flow. The corresponding figure for peak reactive hyperemia was approximately fourfold. The mean coefficients of variation of responses recorded on different days, on the same site, in the same individual were &lt; 10 % <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis</b> of acetylcholine and for peak reactive hyperemia, and between 10 and 20 % <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis</b> of sodium nitroprusside. This day-to-day variation was significantly smaller than the site-to-site variation (p &lt; 0. 01 for all three responses). Endothelium-dependent and -independent responses of dermal blood flow evaluated with laser Doppler imaging are highly reproducible from day to day, at least in healthy nonsmoking young male subjects, and provided some simple precautions are observed, foremost among which is the strict standardization of the recording site. These observations may have implications for the testing of endothelial function in clinical studies...|$|R

In vitro assays were performed to investigate the influence of several electrical and physicochemical parameters on the transdermal permeation of sufentanil. Continuous current application strongly enhanced sufentanil flux through hairless rat skin as compared to passive diffusion. Direct current was more potent than pulse current to promote sufentanil transdermal permeation. An enhancement in current density applied induced {{an increase in the}} flux of the drug.

40|$|Purpose, An {{integrated}} ionic mobility-pore model <b>for</b> epidermal <b>iontophoresis</b> {{is developed}} from theoretical considerations using both the free volume and pore restriction {{forms of the}} model {{for a range of}} solute radii (r(j)) approaching the pore radii (r(p)) as well as approximation of the pore restriction form for r(j) /r(p) < 0. 4. In this model, we defined the determinants <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis</b> as solute size (defined by MV, MW or radius), solute mobility, solute shape, solute charge, the Debye layer thickness, total current applied, solute concentration, fraction ionized, presence of extraneous ions (defined by solvent conductivity), epidermal permselectivity, partitioning rates to account for interaction of unionized and ionized lipophilic solutes with the wall of the pore and electroosmosis. Methods, The ionic mobility-pore model was developed from theoretical considerations to include each of the determinants of iontophoretic transport. The model was then used to reexamine iontophoretic flux conductivity and iontophoretic flux-fraction ionized literature data on the determinants of iontophoretic flux. Results. The ionic mobility-pore model was found to be consistent with existing experimental data and determinants defining iontophoretic transport. However, the predicted effects of solute size on iontophoresis are more consistent with the pore-restriction than free volume form of the model. A reanalysis of iontophoretic flux-conductivity data confirmed the model 2 ̆ 7 s prediction that, in the absence of significant electroosmosis, the reciprocal of flux is linearly related to either donor or receptor solution conductivity. Significant interaction with the pore walls, as described by the model, accounted for the reported pH dependence of the iontophoretic transport for a range of ionizable solutes. Conclusions. The ionic mobility-pore iontophoretic model developed enables a range of determinants of iontophoresis to be described in a single unifying equation which recognises a range of determinants of iontophoretic flux...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{hypothesis}} that the application of high voltage to the skin enhances both stratum corneum and keratinocyte permeability. Therefore, the transport of FITC labelled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (FITC-PS) administered by passive diffusion, iontophoresis or electroporation was localized. METHODS: Fluorescent microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to visualize the FITC-PS transport at the tissue and cell level respectively in hairless rat skin after electroporation (5 x (200 V approximately 500 ms) or iontophoresis (same amount of charges transferred). RESULTS: FITC-PS did not penetrate the viable skin by passive diffusion. Molecular transport in the skin upon electroporation or iontophoresis was localized and implied mainly hair follicles <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis.</b> In the stratum corneum, the pathways for FITC-PS transport were more transcellular during electroporation and paracellular during iontophoresis. FITC-PS were detected in the nucleus of the keratinocytes a few minutes after pulsing. In contrast, iontophoresis did not lead to an uptake of the oligomer. CONCLUSIONS: The internalization of FITC-PS in the keratinocytes after electroporation confirms the hypothesis and suggests that electroporation, which allows both efficient topical delivery and rapid cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides, might be useful for antisense therapy of epidermal diseases...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the effects induced by {{iontophoresis}} and electroporation on the stratum corneum of the skin. Hence, the aims were: (1) {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the mechanisms of drug transport by these methods; (2) to evaluate the safety issues associated with current application. Complementary biophysical methods were used to provide a complete picture of the stratum corneum. Even though the mechanism of drug transport is believed to be different, i. e., electrophoresis <b>for</b> <b>iontophoresis</b> and creation of new aqueous pathways for electroporation, the effects on the stratum corneum detected minutes after current application are very similar. For both methods, the major findings were: (1) a disorganisation of the lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum; (2) an increase in skin hydration; (3) a larger decrease in skin resistance induced by electroporation as compared to iontophoresis. These changes were partly reversible and depended on the amount of electrical charges transferred. The mechanisms of stratum corneum perturbations are discussed. These perturbations could explain partly the increase in drug transport. If iontophoresis is considered as a safe method of drug delivery, the data augurs for the safety of electroporation...|$|R
