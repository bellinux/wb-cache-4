25|$|Dress {{coats and}} morning coats, the other main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of frock coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the frock coat {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal frock coat only buttons down to the waist seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The frock coat that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar,</b> was worn only by clergymen.|$|E
25|$|The Navy Service Uniform is {{a year-round}} service uniform to {{withstand}} day-to-day classroom and office-like environments where the service uniform is typically worn.

Silver anodized-metal rank insignia is worn on shirt/blouse collars and cap. The service uniform also includes a black relaxed-fit Eisenhower-style jacket with a knit <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar</b> and epaulets, on which petty officers wear large, silver anodized-metal rate insignia. Those entitled to wear gold chevrons continue to wear gold chevrons on the large metal rate insignia on the jacket.|$|E

25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar.</b> The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E
25|$|The 28th Arkansas Infantry mustered by {{companies}} and conducted its initial training near Fort Smith, Arkansas, {{on what the}} locals called the Mazzard Prairie. Initially, the regiment was poorly equipped; however, they were eventually supplied with modern Springfield rifle-muskets that had been captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and transported west. The regiment gained a reputation {{as some of the}} most disciplined and martial looking then training on Mazzard Prairie. In the Spring of 1863 the men was issued standard Columbus Depot uniforms, generally made from light-grey jean material with an eight button single breasted frock coat having dark blue trim on its straight <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar</b> and straight cuffs. They also were issued one pair of matching trousers and a simple black felt hat. The regiment's commissioned officers were mostly men of means before to the war, and it is assumed they would have indulged themselves at the many commercial uniform outfitters. The 36th Arkansas's microfilm records include many Quartermaster receipts showing the officers purchased gold braid, coats, silk sashes, white cotton shirts, and large brimmed hats.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} Tom had reached his last quarter at King's Lorton the years had made {{striking}} changes in him. He {{was a tall}} youth now, and wore his tail-coat and his <b>stand-up</b> <b>collars.</b> Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair.

2500|$|Uniforms of chevaulegers were {{modelled}} upon Cavalry National uniforms {{from the}} last decade of the 18th century. Dark blue kurtka had crimson <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar,</b> wristbands and facings. The snug dark blue pantaloons (breeches) were lined with leather, and ornamented with a single crimson stripe. Collar and facings of the Grand Uniform were ornamented also with silver wavy line, and pantaloons with double crimson stripes (officer's Gala Full Dress was white and crimson). High (22cm) czapkas had their forehead metals made of brass (officer's of silver) with a rising sun and the letter [...] "N". For the parade czapka was crowned with 47cm long plume of heron's or ostrich white feathers, and a cockade with a blue center, broad crimson middle band and a narrow white outer edging, with the blue practically hidden under the silver Maltese cross. Officers had blue, while regular soldiers had off-white overcoats, known as manteau-capotes.|$|E

50|$|The basic mess dress (Grundform) for men {{consists}} of a jacket with a chain closure, trousers with black silk trim strips, and either a cummerbund (army, air force, navy) or a Torerobund (a torero-style waist sash, for the army and air force). These sashes or cummerbunds are of black fabric for the army and dark blue {{for the air force}} and navy. The chain is gold for the navy and for army and air force generals; others wear a silver chain. This is matched by a white dress shirt (with a concealed placket; no <b>stand-up</b> <b>collars,</b> ruffles, or embroidery) and a black bow tie and black or black patent leather shoes.|$|R

60|$|In this he {{was helped}} by counsel and example. Pierce, his {{immediate}} senior, was {{by way of}} being what was called a Masher, and preached his cult. During slack times grave discussions about collars, ties, the cut of trouser legs, and the proper shape of a boot-toe, were held in the Manchester department. In due course Kipps went to a tailor, and his short jacket {{was replaced by a}} morning coat with tails. Stirred by this, he purchased at his own expense three <b>stand-up</b> <b>collars</b> to replace his former turn-down ones. They were nearly three inches high, higher than those Pierce wore, and they made his neck quite sore and left a red mark under his ears.... So equipped, he found himself fit company even for this fashionable apprentice, who had now succeeded Minton in his seniority.|$|R

60|$|I thanked him, {{and climbed}} {{quickly to the}} quarterdeck. The 'Bon homme Richard' was lumbering like a leaden ship before the wind, swaying ponderously, her topsails {{flapping}} and her heavy blocks whacking against the yards. And there was the commodore, erect, and with fire in his eye, giving sharp commands to {{the men at the}} wheel. I knew at once that no trifle had disturbed him. He wore a brand-new uniform; a blue coat with red lapels and yellow buttons, and slashed cuffs and <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar,</b> a red waistcoat with tawny lace, blue breeches, white silk stockings, and a cocked hat and a sword. Into his belt were stuck two brace of pistols.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} Tom had reached his last quarter at King's Lorton, the years had made {{striking}} changes in him {{since the day}} we saw him returning from Mr. Jacobs's academy. He was a tall youth now, carrying himself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he wore his tail-coat and his <b>stand-up</b> <b>collars,</b> and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience, looking every day at his virgin razor, with which he had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip had already left,--at the autumn quarter,--that he might go to the south for the winter, {{for the sake of}} his health; and this change helped to give Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last months before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some hope of his father's lawsuit being decided; that made the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had gathered his view of the case from his father's conversation, had no doubt that Pivart would be beaten.|$|R

60|$|Most of {{the above}} I {{elicited}} from Marlow, for all I knew of Carleon Anthony was his unexciting but fascinating verse. Marlow assured me that the Fyne marriage was perfectly successful and even happy, in an earnest, unplayful fashion, being blessed besides by three healthy, active, self-reliant children, all girls. They were all pedestrians too. Even the youngest would wander away for miles if not restrained. Mrs Fyne had a ruddy out-of-doors complexion and wore blouses with a starched front like a man's shirt, a <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar</b> and a long necktie. Marlow had made their acquaintance one summer in the country, where they were accustomed to take a cottage for the holidays...|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} thing I liked in Mrs. Strickland. She managed her {{surroundings}} with elegance. Her flat was always neat and cheerful, gay with flowers, and the chintzes in the drawing-room, notwithstanding their severe design, were bright and pretty. The meals in the artistic little dining-room were pleasant; the table looked nice, the two maids were trim and comely; the food was well cooked. It was impossible not to see that Mrs. Strickland was an excellent housekeeper. And you felt sure {{that she was an}} admirable mother. There were photographs in the drawing-room of her son and daughter. The son -- his name was Robert -- was a boy of sixteen at Rugby; and you saw him in flannels and a cricket cap, and again in a tail-coat and a <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar.</b> He had his mother's candid brow and fine, reflective eyes. He looked clean, healthy, and normal.|$|E

He went {{straight}} up to the greatest treasure of them all, an undoubted Turner, and, carrying it to the easel, turned its face to the light. There had been a movement in Turners, {{but he had not}} been able to make up his mind to part with it. He stood for a long time, his pale, clean-shaven face poked forward above his <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar,</b> looking at the picture as though he were adding it up; a wistful expression came into his eyes; he found, perhaps, that it came to too little. He took it down from the easel to put it back against the wall; but, in crossing the room, stopped, for he seemed to hear sobbing.|$|E

6000|$|Joan's eyes followed. It was {{certainly}} an odd collection. Flossie, in her hunt for brains, had issued her invitations broadcast; and her fate {{had been that}} of the Charity concert. Not all the stars upon whom she had most depended had turned up. On the other hand not a single freak had failed her. At the moment, {{the centre of the}} room was occupied by a gentleman and two ladies in classical drapery. They were holding hands in an attitude suggestive of a bas-relief. Joan remembered them, having seen them on one or two occasions wandering in the King's Road, Chelsea; still maintaining, as far as the traffic would allow, the bas-relief suggestion; and generally surrounded by a crowd of children, ever hopeful that at the next corner they would stop and do something really interesting. They belonged to a society whose object was to lure the London public by the force of example towards the adoption of the early Greek fashions and the simpler Greek attitudes. A friend of Flossie's had thrown in her lot with them, but could never be induced to abandon her umbrella. They also, as Joan told herself, were reformers. Near to them was a picturesque gentleman with a beard down to his waist whose [...] "stunt"--as Flossie would have termed it--was hygienic clothing; it seemed to contain an undue proportion of fresh air. There were ladies in coats and <b>stand-up</b> <b>collars,</b> and gentlemen with ringlets. More than one of the guests would have been better, though perhaps not happier, for a bath.|$|R
5000|$|The show shirt, {{called a}} [...] "ratcatcher," [...] is a buttoned {{shirt with a}} <b>stand-up</b> mandarin-style <b>collar</b> covered by a separate, {{matching}} choker or a stock tie, the final look usually resembling that of a turtleneck. The traditional, classic shirt is white. However, in some places and at some types of less formal competition, particularly for children, pastel-colored shirts are popular, coordinated with the colors in the hunt coat. Traditionally shirts were long-sleeved, but today are more often short-sleeved or sleeveless, though sleeveless shirts cannot be worn when the jacket rule is waived. Stock pins are sometimes worn on the stock tie or choker, although the most recent fashion has been to embroider the rider's initials on the choker.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice the girl moved toward the mats. Her black hair hung like a mantle. Her sarong, the kilt-like garment which both sexes wear, had the {{national}} check of grey and red, but she had not completed her attire by the belt, scarves, the loose upper wrappings, and the head-covering of a woman. A black silk jacket, like that of a man of rank, was buttoned over her bust and fitted closely to her slender waist. The edge of a <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar,</b> stiff with gold embroidery, rubbed her cheek. She had no bracelets, no anklets, and although dressed practically in man's clothes, had about her person no weapon of any sort. Her arms hung down in exceedingly tight sleeves slit a little way up from the wrist, gold-braided and with a row of small gold buttons. She walked, brown and alert, all of a piece, with short steps, the eyes lively in an impassive little face, the arched mouth closed firmly; and her whole person breathed in its rigid grace the fiery gravity of youth at the beginning of the task of life--at the beginning of beliefs and hopes.|$|E

I am fairly well educated, of good family and address, and, so my friends tell me, of {{passable}} appearance. I yearn to become a gentleman. If it is not troubling you too much, would you mind telling me how to set about the business? What socks and ties ought I to wear? Do I wear a flower in my button-hole, or is that {{a sign of a}} coarse mind? How many buttons on a morning coat show a beautiful nature? Does a <b>stand-up</b> <b>collar</b> with a tennis shirt prove that you are of noble descent, or, on the contrary, stamp you as a parvenu? If answering these questions imposes too great a tax on your time, perhaps you would not mind telling me how you yourself know these things. Who is your authority, and when is he at home? I should apologize for writing to you but that I feel you will sympathize with my appeal.

Then wild and wicked thoughts come into my heart. I don't want to be good and respectable. (I never can be sensible, I'm told; so that don't matter.) I want to put on lavender-colored tights, with red velvet breeches and a green doublet slashed with yellow; to have a light-blue silk cloak on my shoulder, and a black eagle's plume waving from my hat, and a big sword, and a falcon, and a lance, and a prancing horse, so that I might go about and gladden {{the eyes of the}} people. Why should we all try to look like ants crawling over a dust-heap? Why shouldn't we dress a little gayly? I am sure if we did we should be happier. True, it is a little thing, but we are a little race, and what is the use of our pretending otherwise and spoiling fun? Let philosophers get themselves up like old crows if they like.
