40|$|A vehicle parking {{manoeuvre}} {{is characterized}} by low or zero speed, small turning radius and large yaw velocity of the steered wheels. To predict the forces and moments generated by a wheel under these conditions, the Pacejka Magic Formula model has been extended to incorporate the effect of spin (<b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> model) in the past years. The extensions have been further developed and incorporated in the MFTyre/MF-Swift 6. 2 model. This paper describes {{the development of a}} method for the identification of the <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> parameters. Based on the operating conditions of a typical parking manoeuvre, the dominant parameters of the <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> model are firstly defined. At an indoor test facility, the response of a tyre under the identified operating conditions is measured. An algorithm is developed to identify the dominant <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> parameters from the measured responses. Wherever possible, the algorithm is based on direct analytical relationships between the <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> model parameters and the measured signals, otherwise an iterative method is applied. By means of comparing vehicle simulation results to instrumented vehicle measurements, the <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> model, including the identified parameters, is validated. The results show the effectiveness of the developed method...|$|R

The numbers may range from small fractions of 1 to a number the size of a googol (1 followed by a hundred 0s) or even larger. These <b>slips</b> are <b>turned</b> face down and shuffled over the top of a table. One at a time you <b>turn</b> the <b>slips</b> face up. The aim is to stop turning when you come to the number that you guess to be the largest of the series. You cannot go back and pick a previously <b>turned</b> <b>slip.</b> If you <b>turn</b> over all the slips, then of course you must pick the last one turned." ...|$|R

We derive a generalized Arrhenius-like expression for the rate of stochastic phase slips. We develop a method to estimate the energy barrier separating different superflow states. The parameters at which the energy barrier disappears agree with the critical parameters for deterministic phase slips obtained from dynamics simulations, which confirms the validity of our energetic analysis. We reveal that adding thermal noise lowers the phase-slip threshold. However, the quantitative impact of the stochastic phase <b>slips</b> <b>turns</b> out to be too small to explain the significant discrepancy between theoretical and the experimental results.

30|$|Fluid flow {{problems}} {{have been carried out}} traditionally under the no-slip boundary condition [12 – 14], which dictates that the velocity, relative to the wall channel, of the fluid adjacent to the wall is zero.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the purpose}} of {{investigating}} the microstructure evolution and deformation behavior of magnesium under high strain rates, the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus was used under high strain rates from 755  s− 1 to 2826  s− 1 in the present work at room temperature. The microstructures of extruded Mg-Gd-Y Magnesium alloy under different strain rates and along different compression directions were observed by metallographic microscope. The results show that, microstructures of extruded Mg-Gd-Y Magnesium alloy along ED, TD and ND compression directions are sensitive to strain rates. The amount of twins firstly increases and then decreases with strain rates being increased, and the recrystal grains increase and grow up. When the strain rate reaches 2500  s− 1, the adiabatic shear band (ASB) begins to form. The formation process of the adiabatic shear band {{can be divided into}} three stages. In the first stage, under the impact load a great deal of twins form and the deformation mechanism is twinning. In the second stage, discontinuous ASB forms due to twins adjusting the directions of located grains and the deformation mechanisms are twinning and non-basal slip. In the last stage, non-basal <b>slip</b> <b>turns</b> to basal <b>slip</b> and continuous ASB forms. The dynamic compression fracture mechanism of extruded Mg-Gd-Y Magnesium alloy is multi-crack propagation...|$|R

40|$|On November 3, 2002, a moment-magnitude (Mw) 7. 9 {{earthquake}} produced 340 km {{of surface}} rupture on the Denali fault and two related faults in central Alaska. The rupture, which proceeded from west to east, {{began with a}} 40 -km-long break on a previously unknown thrust fault. Estimates of surface slip on this thrust were 3 - 6 m. Next came the principal surface break, along 220 km of the Denali fault. There, right-lateral offset averaged almost 5 m and increased eastward {{to a maximum of}} nearly 9 m. Finally, <b>slip</b> <b>turned</b> southeastward onto the Totschunda fault, where dextral offsets up to 3 m continued for another 70 km. This three-part rupture ranks among the longest documented strike-slip events of the past two centuries. The surface-slip distribution supports and clarifies models of seismological and geodetic data that indicated initial thrusting followed by rightlateral strike slip, with the largest moment release near the east end of the Denali fault. The Denali fault ruptured beneath the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The pipeline withstood almost 6 m of lateral offset, because engineers designed it to survive such offsets based on pre-construction geological studies. The Denali fault earthquake was typical of large-magnitude earthquakes on major intracontinental strike-slip faults, in the length of the rupture, the multiple fault strands that ruptured, and the variable slip along strike...|$|R
40|$|A novel model-based {{method for}} odometry {{calculation}} of all-terrain mobile robots is proposed in this paper. Using an all-terrain mobile robot with passively compliant mechanism as an instance, this paper grasps the wheel slip {{as a key}} factor affecting the accuracy of odometry calculation by investigating the physical contact relationship between the wheel and the terrain. Firstly, the wheel slip model involving rolling slip, side <b>slip</b> and <b>turning</b> <b>slip</b> is investigated. Then, the whole kinematics model of the robot is built considering the above wheel slips. Finally, the odometry information is achieved based on solving the kinematics model of the robot and the dead-reckon operation. Both theoretical analyses and experimental results testify the correctness and validity of this method. Moreover, the odometry calculation method proposed in this paper can be easily performed based on on-board sensors without taking extra hardware cost.

40|$|In this study, desired {{center of}} {{pressure}} (dCOP) was introduced to evaluate dynamic postural stability. The dCOP {{is defined as a}} virtual point on the ground, where the moment around the body center of mass (COM) becomes zero when dCOP and the measured COP (mCOP) coincide. We hypothesized that, when the misalignment of the dCOP and mCOP (dCOP-mCOP) increases up to a certain value due to a large perturbation during walking, it becomes difficult to make a compensatory step and to recover balance of COM and to continue gait. Here we tested this hypothesis in <b>slipping</b> during <b>turning.</b> The study involved twelve healthy young adult males with an average age of 21. 5 ± 1. 9 yrs. The subjects were asked to (1) walk straight and turn 60 degrees to the right with the right foot (spin turn) on a dry floor surface, and (2) walk straight and 60 degrees spin turn to the right on a slippery lubricated surface. The dCOP-mCOP during <b>turning</b> in the <b>slip</b> trial with fall were significantly larger, particularly in x-direction (i. e., the medial-lateral direction during straight walk), than that in no-slip trial and slip trial without fall. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the dCOP-mCOP in x-direction is good indicator of falling (area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 93) and the threshold in the dCOP-mCOP in x-direction to distinguish for fall or no-fall was 0. 55 m.

40|$|For {{the virtual}} {{development}} of steering systems, especially those including {{electric power steering}} systems (EPS or EPAS), it is required to have a tyre model that accurately predicts the forces and moments at standstill and manoeuvring at low velocities.

Recently, TNO updated the <b>turn</b> <b>slip</b> theory originally developed by Pacejka in the latest MF-Swift 6. 2 tyre model. Extensive validation with measurements has however been lacking, as suitable tyre test facilities are unavailable.

30|$|Lack {{of effect}} of pruning {{on the average}} fruit quality {{attributes}} might be caused by slips becoming autotrophic {{at a very early}} stage of their development and by slips being only initiated when the plant is likely to support their growth. Kerns et al. (1936) working with Cayenne pineapple cultivar, found that during the generative phase, the infructescence is completely formed before the slips are initiated. Since the fruit is a stronger sink than other developing sinks (Malézieux et al. 2003), it would tend to take more assimilates from the plant than the other sinks. In these conditions, the slips, at the earlier stage of their development, i.e., when they appear like a bud at {{the upper part of the}} peduncle, would also take assimilates from the plants but not in a way to limit the assimilates needed for the fruit development and growth. When the <b>slips</b> <b>turn</b> from the bud stage to the leaf production stage, they certainly start producing their own assimilates for their development and growth, hence they become autotrophic. This view agrees with absence of slips or the lower number of slips produced in less vigorous plants (Figures  3 and 4); it suggests that the Sugarloaf pineapple plant adjusts the number of slips so that their need for assimilates at an early stage of development does not compromise the needs for assimilates of the fruit. The lack of a consistent significant effect of pruning on the variation in fruit quality attributes might be a direct consequence of the lack of effect of pruning on individual fruit quality.|$|R
