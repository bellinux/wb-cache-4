40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming process for rods and tubes {{and has a}} wide spread use in the automotive industry for the manufacture of axles or <b>steering</b> <b>spindles.</b> The advantage of rotary swaging is the optimal use of work piece material resources, due to material strengthening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. The established processes use lubricants which fulfil necessary functions such as cooling, washing abrasive particles out of the forming zone and to provide an adequate work piece surface quality. Both, under economic and ecological aspects, the development of rotary swaging towards a dry process layout is highly innovative. To avoid ex-tensive lubrication it is necessary to substitute the above mentioned functions of the lubricant by new innovative ap-proaches. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for dry rotary swaging, at first a FE modelling and simulation of the rotary swaging process for understanding and designing a dry process. Furthermore, coated tools are presented for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tool and structured tools for the control of friction and process forces. At last the combination of both tool modifications is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this master degree thesis is Formula Car Steering System Design. The thesis {{analyses}} principles {{connected with the}} steering system, such as aligning torque, camber variation from <b>steering</b> or <b>spindle</b> height change, {{as well as the}} influence of the steering wheel geometry on these principles. The main part of this thesis is steering system designing for practical purposes in international competitions of university teams. The simulation of parts is processed by finite element method. Also included are the load transfer and the tyre data sets topics. The thesis concludes with a list of several examples of car setup for cornering...|$|R
50|$|Unlike a kingpin, which {{requires}} an assembly {{in the center}} of the wheel in order to pivot, joints connect to the upper and lower end of the <b>spindle</b> (<b>steering</b> knuckle), to the control arms. This leaves the center section open to allow the use of front-wheel drive. Older kingpin designs can only be used in a rear-wheel-drive configuration.|$|R
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical light weight components such as axles and <b>steering</b> <b>spindles</b> and has a wide spread use in the automotive industry. The advantage of rotary swaging is the optimal use of work piece material resources. This is due to material strengthening through strain hardening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. However, main drawback is the need for an extensive lubrication to control tool wear, to discharge abrasive particles from the forming zone, and to provide adequate work piece surface quality. The subsequent, inevitable cleaning of the work pieces after manufacture leads to a significant increase of costs per unit. Thus, the development of rotary swaging towards a dry process layout is highly innovative both under economic and ecological aspects. The omission of lubricant provokes fundamentally changed tribological conditions in tool-work piece contact, leading to changes in process forces, increased abrasive and adhesive tool wear and reduced work piece quality. A robust, lubricant free rotary swaging, offering the same product quality as a conventional rotary swaging process with the use of lubricant, therefore implies the control of the modified tribological properties by methodologies substituting the tasks of the lubricant. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for the development of dry rotary swaging, that comprises the FE modeling and simulation of the rotary swaging process for general process understanding and designing; the micro structuring of the rotary swaging tool surfaces for control of friction and process forces; and the development of tungsten doped a-C:H tool hard coatings for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tools...|$|R
