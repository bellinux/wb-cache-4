In this paper, we present an electronic measurement instrumentation developed in our laboratory to measure and plot the impedance of a loaded <b>electrochemical</b> <b>generator</b> like batteries and fuel cells. Impedance measures were done according to variations of the frequency in a larger band than what is usually used. The electronic instrumentation is controlled by Hpvee® software which allows us to plot the Nyquist graph of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>generator</b> impedance. The theoretical results obtained in simulation under Pspice® confirm the choice of the method and its advantage. For safety reasons, the experimental preliminary tests were done on a 12 V vehicle battery, having an input current of 330 A and a capacity of 40 Ah and are now extended to a fuel cell. The results were plotted at various nominal voltages of the battery (12. 7 V, 10 V, 8 V and 5 V) and with two imposed currents (0. 6 A and 4 A).
