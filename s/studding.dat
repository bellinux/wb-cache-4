25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called <b>studding</b> sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main <b>studding</b> sails, main top <b>studding</b> sails, and the main top gallant <b>studding</b> sails, etc.|$|E
25|$|Hadley Hall, on Wirswall Road at , is a grade-II-listed, timber-framed {{farmhouse}} {{with red}} brick infill, originally {{dating from the}} 16th century. It has two gabled end bays, one of which features close <b>studding.</b> Also on Wirswall Road {{is a group of}} estate cottages which, as of 2010, are under consideration as locally important buildings.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Cerberus also {{chased the}} {{privateer}} Buonaparte {{but failed to}} capture the French ship after Cerberuss <b>studding</b> sails and top gallant mast were carried away. Buonaparte was armed with 32 guns and had a crew of 250 men. Apparently, in order to escape Cerberus, Buonaparte threw many of her guns and stores overboard, necessitating her return to Bordeaux.|$|E
5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, <b>stud</b> bolts a.k.a <b>studs</b> are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded <b>Stud</b> Bolts", [...] "Tap End <b>Stud</b> Bolts", and [...] "Double End <b>Stud</b> Bolts". Each of these <b>studs</b> have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded <b>studs</b> have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end <b>studs</b> have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end <b>stud</b> bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are <b>stud</b> bolts for flanges which are fully threaded <b>studs</b> with chamfered ends, and double end <b>studs</b> with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For <b>studs</b> that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied <b>studs,</b> and undercut <b>studs.</b> Full-bodied <b>studs</b> have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut <b>studs</b> have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut <b>studs</b> are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied <b>stud</b> the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, Ampeg had {{a line of}} Japanese-made {{guitars and}} basses under the [...] "Stud" [...] name. The guitars {{included}} the <b>Stud,</b> Heavy <b>Stud,</b> and Super <b>Stud,</b> and the basses included the Big <b>Stud</b> and Little <b>Stud.</b> The <b>Studs</b> were knock-offs of popular Fender and Gibson instruments. Some of the <b>Stud</b> instruments were poorly built (e.g. the plywood bodies and necks on the Little <b>Stud),</b> while others had good-quality features (e.g., gold-plated hardware on the Super <b>Stud).</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>stud</b> finder (also <b>stud</b> {{detector}} or <b>stud</b> sensor) is {{a handheld}} device used to locate framing <b>studs</b> located behind the final walling surface, usually drywall. While {{there are many}} different <b>stud</b> finders available, most fall into two main categories: magnetic <b>stud</b> detectors and electric <b>stud</b> finders. Some newer technologies exist such as RF radar with 3D imaging technology.|$|R
25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{to the front}} façade {{and half of the}} west (left) side {{features}} decorative framing, made up of small panels containing ornamental devices. Patterns include chevron bracing with middle rails, often inverted, which forms herringbone patterns and diamonds. This type of decoration is typical of early Elizabethan work (mid-16th century) and is also seen at Little Moreton Hall (c.1504–1610). Curved braces forming concave-sided diamonds are also present; this is a common motif in Cheshire, also seen at Churche's Mansion, Chorley Old Hall and Blackden Hall. The ornamental panelling is not carried {{to the rear of the}} west face, presumably for cost reasons. Close <b>studding</b> with a middle rail is used on the back half of the west face, as well as parts of the Hospital Street façade. This mix of decorative framing with close <b>studding</b> is unusual in Nantwich; other examples are Churche's Mansion and two houses built after the fire, 46 High Street and 3 Church Lane. The rear of the building has small framing.|$|E
25|$|The {{inventory}} of 1611 records the household had 17 beds of different types, truckle beds for the servants and grand tester beds {{for members of}} the family. Older beds were relegated to less important rooms. The Little Parlour Chamber is furnished with older furniture and used as a second-best bedchamber. Reproduction tapestries are hung on the walls. In the 19th century, this room was transformed with the addition of the stairs and passage. The original timber <b>studding</b> can be seen on two walls, showing the lath and plaster structure.|$|E
25|$|The Birmingham Plateau {{during the}} medieval period was heavily wooded but poorly {{supplied}} with building stone, so {{the architecture of}} the early town was dominated by timber framing, with dark wooden structures in complex patterns infilled with lightly coloured plaster. As late as the 19th century guidebooks would compare Birmingham's surviving medieval streetscape with those of Shrewsbury or Chester. Distinctive local styles of wall framing emerged, including the use of close <b>studding</b> and decorative braces within panels in herringbone and quadrant patterns, exemplified by the early 16th century Golden Lion Inn, which survives in Cannon Hill Park.|$|E
50|$|Instant <b>stud</b> finders are {{a recent}} innovation. Instant <b>stud</b> finders have {{multiple}} sensor plates, {{and do not}} need to be moved across the wall to detect a <b>stud,</b> overcoming the effects of bumpy wall texture. They use an algorithm to analyze the readings from the multiple sensor plates for a quicker, more accurate indication. Instant <b>stud</b> finders sense multiple regions of a wall simultaneously including the center of a <b>stud,</b> edges of the <b>stud,</b> and regions without <b>studs.</b> Instant <b>stud</b> finders will indicate varied widths of <b>studs</b> and the location of multiple <b>studs</b> at the same time.|$|R

25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{features}} close <b>studding</b> with a middle rail. It {{rests on a}} stone plinth, the infill is rendered brick and the roof is of slate. At the west end is a shingled square tower with a shingled broach spire ending in a weather cock. This is surrounded by lean-to roofed aisles on the north, west and south sides. The tower has a western arched door with a 20th-century door which incorporates 17th-century iron strap hinges. The body of the church consists of a three-bay nave with north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel and north and south chapels {{at the ends of}} the aisles, and a south porch.|$|E
25|$|The {{hall was}} built for the Woodhey branch of the Wilbraham family. The {{original}} date is probably 15th century, and the hall is often considered the oldest half-timbered building in the town {{not to have been}} encased in brick. The external appearance is early Elizabethan, with both ornamental panelling and close <b>studding.</b> It was recorded in 1577, and is known to have survived the fire of 1583, which destroyed the adjacent building. It has been substantially altered from its original form, in particular {{with the addition of a}} pentagonal bay in the late 16th or early 17th centuries. The timber frame was covered with render in the 18th century, and by the mid-20th century the hall had become very dilapidated. Restoration work was carried out by James Edleston in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Both the High Street and Castle Street faces have {{decorative}} framing {{on the two}} upper storeys, {{which is}} made up of small panels containing ornamental devices. The design uses ogee bracing, similar to that at Churche's Mansion; it is elaborated on the High Street façade with spurs. Ornamental panelling, the most expensive and highest status type of timber framing, was very fashionable in the Elizabethan period. The ground floor of the Castle Street side was originally close studded with a middle rail, another expensive type of framing; this was still present in around 1883, but has since been replaced. 46 High Street is one of two houses built after the fire which originally used both decorative panels and close <b>studding,</b> the other being 3 Church Lane. Both types of framing are also used together on the earlier Churche's Mansion and Sweetbriar Hall.|$|E

50|$|Since 1998, many {{developments}} and improvements {{have been made}} to the internal capacitor <b>stud</b> finders and increased their popularity. Recent innovators developed <b>stud</b> finders with multiple sensor plates that sense the wall in multiple places instantly. These sensors can indicate the location, width, and lack of <b>studs</b> simultaneously. With more sensors, these instant <b>stud</b> finders avoid the shortcomings of previous electronic <b>stud</b> finders, which require calibration and do not adapt to inconsistencies in wall construction. While the instant <b>stud</b> finders have made finding <b>studs</b> an easy and efficient task, many people still use magnetic <b>stud</b> detectors.|$|R
5000|$|Ice racing {{tires are}} either <b>studded</b> or non-studded. <b>Studded</b> tires have a <b>stud</b> {{such as a}} screw or bolt to provide better {{traction}} and increased speed. Some <b>studs</b> are sharpened to increase penetration. [...] Tires cannot be purchased with <b>studs,</b> so the pit crew needs to attach the <b>studs</b> to the tire. Through 2008, Menard's Racing in Wisconsin manufactured and sold <b>studded</b> racing tires for cars, and they were required in many ice-racing classes. Cars with <b>studded</b> tires are generally required to contain a roll cage and increased safety equipment since they achieve much more speed with the greater cornering abilities.|$|R
25|$|Three timber-framed, {{black-and-white}} {{buildings in}} the village centre are listed at grade II. Marbury Cottage on Church Lane dates originally from the late 16th or early 17th century and {{is believed to have}} formerly been a dower house. The two-storey, T-shaped building has both close <b>studding</b> and small framing with brick infill. Some 17th- and 18th-century doors survive on the interior. On the corner of Church Lane and Wirswall Road stands 1–4 Black and White Cottages, which was once a single house with a service wing, but is now divided into four cottages. The original house dates from the late 16th or early 17th century and features close studding; it has a projecting wing with a jettied gable. The former service wing dates in part from the late 17th or early 18th century, and has some small framing. Finally, a two-storey outhouse on Wirswall Road adjacent to The Swan dates from the 17th century, and features small framing with brick infill.|$|E

500|$|On 1 February 1800 at 07:00, Truxton's crew spotted what {{appeared}} to be a 54-gun frigate flying British colors two leagues off the Basse-Terre roadstead. In an effort to communicate with the mysterious frigate, Constellation flew British colors. Pitot had sighted the American ship by 07:45. [...] Thinking the vessel chasing him was a superior 55-gun warship, he sought to avoid conflict, and continued to sail with the wind rather than head north as he had originally intended. In an effort to increase her speed, the French frigate's crew put out <b>studding</b> sails to catch more wind. The behavior of Pitot's frigate signaled to Truxton that she was really a French warship, so he ordered Constellation cleared for action and gave chase. By 08:00 he struck the British colors and raised the American flag. As he closed with La Vengeance he shouted through a speaking trumpet for the French vessel to surrender.|$|E

500|$|As he {{approached}} the twilight of his career, Liddell slowed {{as a player and}} his appearances from the 1958–59 season became infrequent. He sought to mitigate his declining pace by adopting a deeper approach, with a [...] "more thoughtful passing game". His omission from the lineup for the match against Fulham, in which Bimpson replaced him, provoked criticism from supporters, with some opposition being expressed via letters to local newspapers. Bimpson scored and Liddell's confinement to the reserves attracted the interest of Mersey neighbours New Brighton. The non-leaguers approached Liddell with an offer to become player-manager, which he and the club rejected. After one start in November, Liddell returned to the senior squad in March 1959 for his 466th league appearance, which the footballing community believed would surpass Ted Sagar's Merseyside record of 465. Liddell scored two goals in a 3–2 win over Barnsley at Anfield, but later learnt that Sagar's accepted total had been erroneous (463 being the correct figure). During his absence, Liverpool unexpectedly succumbed to part-time Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup. Liddell had played in 40 consecutive cup fixtures, but his involvement in the 2–1 defeat had been limited to the <b>studding</b> of his colleagues' boots.|$|E
500|$|The plan of {{the hall}} {{consists}} of four ranges or wings arranged as a quadrangle around a courtyard, and comprises a mixture of architectural styles. [...] The north and east wings are in 15th- and 16th-century black-and-white timber framing, and {{the south and west}} wings are in brick dating {{from the middle of the}} 18thcentury. [...] The north front is in brick with stone quoins enclosing the timber-framing. [...] It is irregular, in two or three storeys with six gables. [...] It contains a mixture of 12- and 16-pane sash windows, and two Venetian windows. On the courtyard side is a two-storey timber-framed porch bearing a long inscription dated 1581. [...] The east wing is timber-framed, with close <b>studding,</b> on a rubble stone plinth. [...] It contains mullioned and transomed windows, a small oriel window, and 12- and 16-pane sash windows. [...] There is also a two-storey staircase turret. [...] The south wing is in Flemish bond brick with sandstone dressings. [...] It is symmetrical, in two and three storeys, and 13bays. [...] It is set on a low stone plinth, and has rusticated quoins. [...] In the centre is a portico rising to the full height of the building.

500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed <b>studding</b> sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E
40|$|The {{traction}} force of <b>studded</b> boots on artificial turf was studied using a friction sled pulled by a constant speed motor. The traction of 6 and 12 mm cylindrical <b>studs</b> were studied on an artificial surface with grass fibre lengths of 50 mm {{and filled with}} rubber crumb and sand. It {{was found that the}} {{traction force}} increased with the number of <b>studs</b> and became approximately constant if more than six <b>studs</b> were used. Doubling the <b>stud</b> length more than doubled the traction. A simple model of traction was developed, in which the total traction was equal to the plate friction plus the ploughing traction of <b>studs.</b> The ploughing traction increased and the plate friction decreased with the number of <b>studs,</b> due to lift that was generated by each <b>stud</b> as the sled moved across the surface. The theory over predicted the traction for large numbers of <b>studs,</b> probably because leading <b>studs</b> shielded following <b>studs,</b> thus reducing the shear strength of the surface...|$|R
5000|$|A state <b>stud</b> farm (Landgestüt, Haras) is {{one that}} is owned by the government. The first state <b>studs</b> were ordered by Louis XIV of France in 1665.
