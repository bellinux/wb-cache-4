5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E

5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E

25|$|The raspberry, whose pistils are termed drupelets {{because each}} {{is like a}} small drupe {{attached}} to the receptacle. In some bramble fruits (such as blackberry) the receptacle is elongated {{and part of the}} ripe fruit, making the blackberry an aggregate-accessory fruit. The strawberry is also an aggregate-accessory fruit, only one in which the seeds are contained in achenes. In all these examples, the fruit develops from a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> with numerous pistils.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of pulque {{is complex and}} required {{the death of the}} maguey plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as aguamiel (honeywater), collects. It takes a maguey plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.|$|E
25|$|Oreostylidium subulatum {{is a very}} small, cæspitose, and densely tufted plant about 2-3cm tall. The 2cm long linear-subulate leaves form a basal rosette {{close to}} the ground.

25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{arranged}} in flower spikes or capitate flower heads. The character most commonly associated with Banksia is the flower spike, an elongated inflorescence consisting of a woody axis covered in tightly-packed pairs of flowers attached at right angles. A <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> spike generally contains hundreds or even thousands of flowers; the most recorded is around 6000 on inflorescences of B.grandis. Not all Banksia have an elongate flower spike, however: {{the members of the}} small Isostylis complex have long been recognised as Banksias in which the flower spike has been reduced to a head; and recently the large genus Dryandra has been found to have arisen from within the ranks of Banksia, and sunk into it as B.ser. Dryandra. They similarly have capitate flower heads rather than spikes.|$|E
500|$|Flower {{morphology}} differs in details, but ascribes to {{a simple}} blueprint: four petals, zygomorphic in nature, with the trigger protruding from the [...] "throat" [...] of the flower and resting below {{the plane of the}} flower petals. Flower size ranges from many species that have small [...] wide flowers to the [...] wide flowers of S. schoenoides. Flower color can also vary from species to species, but most include some combination of white, cream, yellow, or pink. Flowers are usually arranged in a spike or dense raceme, but {{there is at least one}} exception to the rule: S. uniflorum, as its name suggests, produces a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> per inflorescence.|$|E
500|$|Flower {{is divided}} up into six main levels and one credits level. Each level is {{represented}} by a flower in a pot on a city apartment windowsill, and upon selecting one the player is taken to the [...] "dream" [...] of that flower. Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it blows a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and roll of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the PlayStation 3 controller. Pressing any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions.|$|E

500|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see Evolution). The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous {{in the case}} of Medeoleae) flowering plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged along the stem, developing from the base, or as a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers.

The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind-dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles did {{not attend}} Epstein's funeral, both to allow his family some privacy, and to avoid {{attracting}} fans and the media. According to Geoffrey Ellis, chief executive of NEMS Enterprises, George Harrison had given Nat Weiss, Epstein's good friend and confidant, {{the day before the}} funeral a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> (Ellis remembers it being a chrysanthemum) wrapped in a newspaper on behalf of all four Beatles, with instructions to place the flower on Brian's coffin as a final farewell. However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials. Weiss and Ellis discussed this dilemma while walking back to the grave, where they observed two men beginning to shovel dirt onto the casket. Ellis: [...] "Nat, who himself was Jewish, cast the newspaper package unopened onto Brian's coffin, where it was swiftly covered by earth." [...] Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool. The service at the graveside was held by Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon, who said, disparagingly, that Epstein was [...] "a symbol of the malaise of our generation". A few weeks later, on 17 October, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in St John's Wood (near Abbey Road Studios), which was officiated by Rabbi Louis Jacobs. The Bee Gees' 1968 song [...] "In the Summer of His Years" [...] was written and recorded as a tribute to Epstein.|$|E
500|$|The complex flower spikes, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear {{generally}} from late summer to early winter (February to June) in New South Wales and Victoria, although flowering occurs in late autumn and {{winter in the}} Gibraltar Range. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, perpendicularly from which {{a large number of}} compact floral units arise, which measure [...] tall and [...] wide. Pale yellow in colour, they are composed of up to 1000 individual flowers (784 recorded in the Gibraltar Range) and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old. Sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in the same flowering season. They can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud. As with most banksias, anthesis is the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. Over time the flower spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the old flowers generally persist on the cone. The woody follicles grow in the six months after flowering, with up to 150 developing on a <b>single</b> <b>flower</b> spike. In many populations, only a few follicles develop. Small and elliptic, they measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. In coastal and floodplain populations, these usually open spontaneously and release seed, while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats. Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring [...] in length, the seed is egg- to wedge-shaped ( [...] to [...] ) and composed of a dark brown [...] wide membranous [...] "wing" [...] and wedge- or sickle-shaped (cuneate–) seed proper which measures [...] long by [...] wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often [...] The resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. The cotyledons of Banksia marginata, B.paludosa and B.integrifolia are very similar in appearance.|$|E

40|$|The nutritive {{reserves}} in angiosperm pollen grains and the pollen and ovule numbers of <b>single</b> <b>flowers</b> {{are considered to}} be correlated with the pollinating vectors. In this paper, we studied the relationships between pollen histochemistry, pollen grain number, ovule number and pollinators in Phyllanthaceae. Hymenoptera- and Diptera-pollinated species tend to have starchless, lipid-rich pollen while most Lepidopteran-pollinated species have starchy pollen grains. No correlation was found between pollinator-types and pollen number of <b>single</b> <b>flowers.</b> Flowers of fly-pollinated species have much fewer ovules than flowers of moth-pollinated species. It is suggested that the decrease in ovule number may be an adaptation to the pollinating flies, which have relatively poorer pollen-transferring ability and which transfer pollen less precisely in comparison with other pollinating insects such as moths or butterflies. Pollen grains in <b>single</b> <b>flowers</b> of shrub species were found to be almost ten times as many as that of herbs, while the treespecies also have higher pollen grain numbers than congeneric shrub species. This {{may be due to the}} different flower size in plants with different life forms. Significant differences were found in the pollen ornamentation patterns under SEM between fly-pollinated and moth-pollinated species...|$|R
