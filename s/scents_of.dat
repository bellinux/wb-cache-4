5|$|Predators of the pudús {{include the}} horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, {{and other small}} cats. The pudú is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> predators. Being a {{proficient}} climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15years and 9months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, {{from a wide range}} of causes. Maternal neglect of newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.|$|E

For example, {{both males and females}} were more attracted to the natural <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> individuals who had been rated by consensus as facially attractive. Additionally, it has also been shown that women have a preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with more symmetrical faces, and that women's preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> more symmetrical men is strongest during the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle. Within the set of normally cycling women, individual women's preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with high facial symmetry correlated with their probability of conception.|$|R

25|$|Fractionation: Through {{the use of}} a {{fractionation}} column, different fractions distilled from {{a material}} can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> developmental stability (low fluctuating asymmetry, FA) is attractive to women who are fertile (at high-conception risk points in their menstrual cycles), but not to other women or men. Prior research also indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> dissimilarity in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes {{may play a role}} in human mate choice. We studied the scent attractiveness to the opposite sex of t-shirts worn for 2 nights 2 ̆ 7 sleep. Our results indicate that the two olfactory systems are independent. We repeated previous results from studies <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. We repeated previous results from MHC research in part; men, but not women, showed a preference for t-shirts with the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> MHC dissimilarity. Women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scent</b> ratings <b>of</b> t-shirts were uncorrelated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC dissimilarity and allele frequency, but positively correlated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC heterozygosity. Fertile women did not exhibit any MHC trait preferences. Women 2 ̆ 7 s preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men who were heterozygous for MHC alleles may be stronger in women who are at infertile cycle points. Men preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> common MHC alleles, which may function to avoid mates with rare alleles that exhibit gestational drive. Men also preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> women at fertile cycle points. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> facially attractive women, but not men, was preferred. Neither FA nor facial attractiveness in either sex correlated with MHC dissimilarity to others, MHC heterozygosity, or MHC allelic rarity...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{provided}} additional confirmatory evidence showing MHC influences mate preference. It {{was found that}} females not using non hormonal contraceptives were more attracted to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> males with dissimilar MHCs. Additionally, females currently using hormonal contraceptives preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with MHCs similar to their own. Research has also shown that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> an individual with low fluctuating asymmetry is universally more attractive.|$|R

25|$|After {{making a}} {{delivery}} to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with {{his ability to}} identify and create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini {{teach him how to}} preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. Grenouille continues working for Baldini but is saddened when he learns that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> all objects. Baldini informs Grenouille of another method that can be learned in Grasse and agrees to help him by providing the journeyman papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. En route to Grasse, Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, taking refuge in a cave. During this time, he discovers that he lacks any personal scent himself, and believes this is why he is perceived as strange or disturbing by others. Deciding to continue his quest, he leaves his cave and continues to Grasse.|$|E

500|$|Much {{critical}} commentary about Tzara {{surrounds the}} measure {{to which the}} poet identified with the national cultures which he represented.

[...] Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of Yiddish literature, argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and Hasidic philosophy shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular, while American poet Andrei Codrescu speaks of Tzara as one in a Balkan line of [...] "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians Urmuz, Eugène Ionesco and Emil Cioran.

500|$|S by Shakira is {{the first}} woman's {{fragrance}} by Colombian singer songwriter Shakira. Developing an interest in perfumery and scents, Shakira {{signed an agreement with}} international fashion company Puig to create a line of beauty and personal care products. S by Shakira is inspired by the singer's [...] "light" [...] and is an oriental perfume which combines <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> various exotic sources like sambac jasmine, sandalwood, and vanilla. The bottle of the perfume is made of treated glass which reflects light at different angles; it does not have a cap and instead utilises a key-like mechanism to stop the flow of the perfume. Shakira launched S by Shakira at a press release in Madrid, Spain, in June 2010, and it was sent to retail stores in September 2010. Critics praised the scent of S by Shakira, but there was criticism regarding the design of the bottle. It was nominated for a FiFi Award in 2011.|$|E

50|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that men prefer the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> {{women in her}} most fertile period. For example, in one study, men rated the body odours of T-shirts worn by women during their most fertile phase as more sexy and pleasant than T-shirts worn during their least fertile phase. Despite this, {{much of the research}} in the area concludes that the effect <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry appears to be sex specific such that men do not find the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetrical women more attractive than the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> asymmetrical women. It therefore appears that attraction to symmetric body odour of the opposite sex appears to apply exclusively to women, and specifically fertile women, as non-fertile women and men do not display this preference.|$|R
40|$|Many snakes {{are able}} to use their chemosensory system to detect <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> conspecifics, which is {{important}} in many social contexts. Age discrimination based on chemical cues may be especially important to ensure access to sexually mature potential partners. In this study, we used 24 individual Boa constrictor snakes (12 adults mature and 12 non-mature individuals) that had been captured in different areas of Ecuador, and were maintained in captivity at the Vivarium of Quito. We used tongue-flick experiments to examine whether these snakes were able to discriminate between scents from mature and non-mature individuals. Results showed that B. constrictor snakes used chemical cues to recognize conspecifics and that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> individuals of different ages elicited chemosensory responses of different magnitudes. The scents from adult conspecifics elicited the quickest and highest chemosensory responses (i. e., short latency times and high tongue-flick rates), although {{we did not find}} differential responses to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> males and females. The magnitude of the responses was lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> sub adult individuals, and then even lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> juvenile snakes, but in all cases the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> snakes was discriminated from a blank control. We discuss the potential chemical mechanisms that may allow age recognition and its implications for social and sexual behavior of this snake species...|$|R
