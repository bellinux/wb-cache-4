25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding ploughs with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|E

In {{a letter to}} his friend Marjorie Robinson he described the investiture at Buckingham Palace, remarking that the Queen [...] "might have been any nice shy young lady in D.H. Evans or Kendal Milnes". Just over two years later Cardus was awarded a knighthood, the first music critic to receive such an honour, although in all likelihood it was awarded as much for his cricket writing. Years previously Beecham had advised: [...] "In the unlikely event of you being offered a knighthood, Neville, take it. It makes tables at the Savoy <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to come by".|$|E
2500|$|Crawford despaired at the {{attention}} Margaret was getting, writing to friends: [...] "Could you this year only ask Princess Elizabeth to your party?... Princess Margaret does draw all {{the attention}} and Princess Elizabeth lets her do that." [...] Elizabeth, however, did not mind this, and commented, [...] "Oh, it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> when Margaret's there—everybody laughs at what Margaret says". King George described Elizabeth as his pride and Margaret as his joy.|$|E

2500|$|Encouraged {{by their}} Australian success, the band {{undertook}} their first international tour. They {{flew to the}} UK on 17 September 1976 to play a show in London's Hyde Park supporting Queen. They then opened shows {{in the rest of}} Europe for the Hollies during September and October. Birtles advised fellow Australian bands that [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> when you have a product to sell... And the money you make on the club circuit in Australia while establishing yourself is better than anything you can make in Britain, where there is so much competition." [...] In November 1976 they performed their first US concert, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as the opening act for Average White Band. Due to their US appearances and support from FM stations, [...] "It's a Long Way There" [...] reached No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100. This galvanised the commitment of the band members to tackle the US record market.|$|E
2500|$|This class's combat-management system (CMS), which {{apparently}} {{accounts for about}} 40 percent of each warship's cost, was purchased from the Thales Detexis company. The Tavitac system is also fitted to the French Navy's La Fayette-class frigates, and updated versions are aboard the Saudi Arabian F3000-class air-defence frigates, and the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. Kamerman {{said that he was}} very proud of the ships' combat system and the South African ingenuity that went into their design. [...] "Seventy-five percent of the combat suite is home-grown. It's the largest local-content percentage of all the defence packages. The local content makes testing and integration <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier.</b> The foreign stuff must be done in a tight time-frame and flying their experts here is expensive. The guys who built our radars are just 40 km away in Stellenbosch," [...] Kamerman said of Reutech Radar Systems, one of the contractors. Local content also speeded up repair and maintenance. [...] "It is local support in-country, not a local capacity created artificially or a bunch of foreigners flown in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier.</b> We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E

50|$|Sampati proved {{instrumental}} in Sita's search {{later on in}} the Ramayana. His role comes when the search party sent to the south, led by Angada with aloi and Jambavan, exhausted, thirsty and depressed, reach to {{the southern end of the}} land. They have the endless sea before them, and still no clue of Sita. Disappointed, everybody just collapses on the sand, unable and unwilling to move or act any further. At this point, Sampati appears, openly talking about his fortune in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easy</b> meat arriving at his doorstep. At that moment, Jambavan laments out loud, comparing the morals of a vulture who would prey on the helpless with the vulture Jatayu, who defended Sita from Ravana.|$|R
50|$|A {{period of}} {{prosperity}} in the 1880s {{led to a}} wild speculation in land and buildings, and money poured in from England. Land companies, mortgage societies, municipal bodies, building societies, {{and a host of}} other organisations all clamoured for a share in the good things that were on offer, and probably £40,000,000 flowed into Victoria during a period of six years. With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easy</b> money in circulation, a fictitious prosperity of a feverish sort resulted. The banks issued notes to the value of millions of pounds, and trade and industry flourished as never before. The reaction came quickly. Public confidence subsided like a pricked balloon. A run commenced on the banks, and the bursting of the boom brought with it widespread disaster.|$|R

6000|$|But for {{whatever}} old causes such {{people might be}} interested in each other, their distinguished host was not specially interested in them. No one of them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. Valentin was expecting, for special reasons, a man of world-wide fame, whose friendship he had secured during some of his great detective tours and triumphs in the United States. He was expecting Julius K. Brayne, that multi-millionaire whose colossal and even crushing endowments of small religions have occasioned <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easy</b> sport and easier solemnity for the American and English papers. Nobody could quite make out whether Mr. Brayne was an atheist or a Mormon or a Christian Scientist; but he was ready to pour money into any intellectual vessel, so long as it was an untried vessel. One of his hobbies was to wait for the American Shakespeare--a hobby more patient than angling. He admired Walt Whitman, but thought that Luke P.
