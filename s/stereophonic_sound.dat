5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound.</b> In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that some}} of the {{stimulus}} sets contain only monophonic sounds, whereas others contain only <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sounds,</b> and, although the acoustic features are calculated on both channels in the latter case, the salience of an indicator in one channel compared to the other depends on the recording context. For example, if a car interior sound has been recorded from the driver's seat, the most relevant channel for a given sound feature will probably not be the same {{as if it had been}} recorded from the passenger's seat. Accordingly, the features in the correlation tables can be either from the left or the right channel, or from the mean of both channels.|$|R
5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|During this period, WIN {{expanded}} to include new stations in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. In 1984, WIN became the first regional television station to transmit in <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound.</b> Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network, ensured it the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation took place in 1989 thus the logo of the station changed to that of its partner network with the matching nine dots and similar ident packages. The changes meant that WIN expanded {{into the rest of}} southern New South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, amongst others in 1989, {{and at the same time}} acquiring new facilities in Orange, Wagga and Canberra. It also provided the network with two additional competitors, The Prime Network and Capital Television.|$|E

30|$|The {{sounds were}} {{recorded}} in 16 different vehicles at two different engine modes. The engine modes defined two substudies: study A 1 involved sounds produced when the engine was running in 3 rd gear at 4000 [*]RPM (Round Per Minute) and study A 2 involved sounds produced when the engine was running in 5 th gear at 3500 [*]RPM. A preliminary experiment showed that loudness was the main auditory cue used by the participants to rate the dissimilarity. Thus, in order to let other auditory attributes emerge, loudness was equalized. Both stimulus sets were composed of 16 <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sounds</b> that were 4.1 seconds in duration. Their levels—after loudness equalization—varied between 69 and 80 [*]dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level).|$|R

5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E
5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E

This was done to allow consumers with DVD-Audio players access to very high-resolution <b>stereophonic</b> and/or surround <b>sound</b> versions of the album, while also providing the lower-resolution Dolby Digital <b>stereophonic</b> and/or surround <b>sound</b> which is compatible with any DVD player.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound,</b> and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

50|$|Control {{grouping}} poses difficult problems, {{especially in}} systems where a given operating parameter {{may be affected}} by multiple control groups. For example, in a <b>stereophonic</b> multiway <b>sound</b> system, the gain of the left-channel high-frequency amplifier may be affected by settings of master controls for (a) overall high-frequency level, (b) left-channel level, and (c) overall level of the entire system. In such systems, machine intelligence is required to manage cumulative settings effects that lead to overrange or underrange parameter values. The AES70 grouping mechanism provides a basis for such management, for one or many devices.|$|R

50|$|The {{reason for}} the process is the {{compatibility}} issue between stereophonic and monaural recordings: information which is identical on {{both the left and}} right channels of a <b>stereophonic</b> mix <b>sounds</b> too loud when played back on mono AM and FM radio stations and phonographs. When the left and right channels are summed together, any musical parts that are common to both channels combine to be 6 decibels louder than they are in the same mix when played in stereo. Vocals, solo instruments and bass lines are often mixed equally to both stereo channels — these sounds tend to be too loud when heard in mono.|$|R
