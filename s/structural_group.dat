40|$|Computer aided {{molecular}} {{design is}} a strategy in which a set of <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> are systematically combined to form molecules with desired properties. In this paper, a mathematical programming based approach to computer aided molecular design is presented. Using a set of <b>structural</b> <b>groups,</b> the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program in which discrete variables represent the number of each type of <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> present in the candidate compound. The augmentedpenalty /outer-approximation algorithm is used to solve the MINLP to obtain compound(s) with an optimum value of an appropriate performance index such that molecular structural constraints, physical property constraints and process design limitations are met. With the current renewed interest in the environment, the suggested approach is applied to refrigerant design with an environmental constraint. The results indicate the viability of this approach.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a comparative analysis of competition routines with a hoop, ball or rope {{of the top}} six competitors at the World Championship in Moscow 2010 and the top six competitors at the Serbian Championship in Belgrade 2010. This analysis {{was conducted on the}} basis of the proportion of body difficulties from various <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> (leaps, balances, pirouettes, flexibilities and waves) comprised within the routines of the competitors with corresponding apparatus (hoop, ball, rope) in both championships. The aim of this research was to identify the similarities and differences in the structure of leaps, pirouettes, balances and elements of flexibilities and waves of the first six competitors in both championships by analyzing their routines on video recordings. The findings discovered that the competitors in the World Championship demonstrated a considerably higher level of technical value in their routines compared to the Serbian competitors. The competitors at World level perform difficulties of greater average difficulties from all <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> in their routines with a hoop, ball and rope and these differences are generally important from a statistical point of view.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a two-stage {{technique for}} estimation and inference in probit models with <b>structural</b> <b>group</b> effects. The <b>structural</b> <b>group</b> specification {{belongs to a}} broader class of random components models. In particular, individuals in a given group share a common component in the specification of the conditional mean of a latent variable. For a number of computational reasons, existing random-effects models are impractical for estimation and inference {{in this type of}} problem. Our two-stage estimator provides an easily estimable alternative to the random effect specification. In addition, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation comparing the performance of alternative estimators, and find that the two-stage estimator is superior [...] both in terms of estimation and inference [...] to traditional estimators. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} simulation {{was created}} to determine the seismic performance of coupled systems {{with a group of}} up to 100 pile-high-rise structures resting on soil layers using system modal, harmonic, and time domain analysis. The results demonstrated that the existence of a <b>structural</b> <b>group</b> mitigates the structural responses with respect to the single-structure-soil interaction (SSI) and results in significantly nonuniform ground seismic motions. Due to the influence of a <b>structural</b> <b>group,</b> adjacent structures can exhibit fully alternating mechanical behavior, and buildings in the urban fringe are subjected to stronger shaking than downtown buildings. The overall trend of the influence of structural groups is that ground motions are lessened inside an urban area, and ground motions at the locations between structures differ from those at the locations of the structures. Moreover, the effective distance of a <b>structural</b> <b>group</b> on ground motions is associated with the urban width. Less distance between structures enhances the interaction effect. In addition, the soil properties can greatly influence the system’s seismic responses and can even completely change the effect trends. The results in our paper are consistent with the phenomena observed in the Mexico City earthquake and the 1976 earthquake in Friuli, Italy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Class I {{cytokine}} receptors have a {{wide range}} of actions, including {{a major role in the}} development and function of immune and blood cells. However, the evolution of the genes encoding them remains poorly understood. To address this we have used bioinformatics to analyze the Class I receptor repertoire in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Results Only two Class I receptors were identified in sea squirt, one with homology to the archetypal GP 130 receptor, and the other with high conservation with the divergent orphan receptor CLF- 3. In contrast, 36 Class I cytokine receptors were present in zebrafish, including representative members for each of the five <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> found in mammals. This allowed the identification of 27 core receptors belonging to the last common ancestor of teleosts and mammals. Conclusion This study suggests that the majority of diversification of this receptor family occurred after the divergence of urochordates and vertebrates approximately 794 million years ago (MYA), but before the divergence of ray-finned from lobe-finned fishes around 476 MYA. Since then, only relatively limited lineage-specific diversification within the different Class I receptor <b>structural</b> <b>groups</b> has occurred. </p...|$|R
