25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of}} the head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> alone, and put {{his head in his}} hands... He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E

60|$|She <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{and smiled}} at him. His obvious embarrassment amused her. It was a new sort of game, this, altogether.|$|R

60|$|While I <b>sat</b> musing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>the</b> curtain was drawn, {{and a man}} entered {{bearing a}} torch. It was Guatemoc as he {{had come from the}} fray, which, except for its harvest of burning houses, was {{finished}} for that night. The plumes were shorn from his head, his golden armour was hacked by the Spanish swords, and he bled from a shot wound in the neck.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{that she}} had been {{influenced}} by the managerial Vida Sherwin; certainly she sounded as though she was selling culture. But she dropped it when she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> her chin in her hands, a volume of Yeats on her knees, and read aloud.|$|E
60|$|Betty did not answer. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> while Mrs. Zane {{held the}} little bare foot and slowly poured {{the hot water}} over the swollen and {{discolored}} ankle. Betty's lips were pale. She winced every time Mrs. Zane touched her foot, but as yet she had not uttered even a sigh.|$|E
60|$|He {{stepped back}} and leaned against my bed with a level, quiet glance. I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> We {{had nothing to say}} to each other. Over our heads the officer of the watch moved here and there. Then I heard him move quickly. I knew what that meant. He was making for the companion; and {{presently}} his voice was outside my door.|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, {{while she}} busied {{herself with the}} curtains. Then she came and <b>sat</b> herself down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> also, leaning against {{the end of it}} in such a fashion that she could watch me in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|When the freedman {{had ceased}} speaking, Vetranio <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> {{called for a}} basin of water, dipped his fingers in the {{refreshing}} liquid, dried them abstractedly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long silky curls of the singing-boy who stood beside him, gazed about him once more, repeated interrogatively the word 'daybreak', and sunk gently back upon his couch. We are grieved to confess it--but {{the author of the}} Nightingale Sauce was moderately inebriated.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a vacant}} place beside young Hortensius, and Taurus Antinor took it, {{but he did}} not lie along the {{cushions}} as the others did but half <b>sat,</b> half leaned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and turning to the young man said simply: ...|$|R
6000|$|Carol fluttered at {{the back}} of the room, childishly excited when she was sent to fetch towels and a basin of water. Kennicott lifted the farmer into a chair and chuckled, [...] "There we are, Halvor! We'll have you out fixing fences and {{drinking}} aquavit in a month." [...] The farmwife <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> expressionless, bulky in a man's dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets. The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her seamed neck. Her white wool gloves lay in her lap.|$|E
6000|$|Kennicott rose quickly, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> took {{both her}} hands. [...] "Suppose he fails--as he will! Suppose {{he goes back}} to tailoring, and you're his wife. Is that going to be this artistic life you've been {{thinking}} about? He's in some bum shack, pressing pants all day, or stooped over sewing, and having to be polite to any grouch that blows in and jams a dirty stinking old suit in his face and says, 'Here you, fix this, and be blame quick about it.' He won't even have enough savvy to get him a big shop. He'll pike along doing his own work--unless you, his wife, go help him, go help him in the shop, and stand over a table all day, pushing a big heavy iron. Your complexion will look fine after about fifteen years of baking that way, won't it! And you'll be humped over like an old hag. And probably you'll live in one room back of the shop. And then at night--oh, you'll have your artist--sure! He'll come in stinking of gasoline, and cranky from hard work, and hinting around that if it hadn't been for you, he'd of gone East and been a great artist. Sure! And you'll be entertaining his relatives----Talk about Uncle Whit! You'll be having some old Axel Axelberg coming in with manure on his boots and sitting down to supper in his socks and yelling at you, 'Hurry up now, you vimmin make me sick!' Yes, and you'll have a squalling brat every year, tugging at you while you press clothes, and you won't love 'em like you do Hugh up-stairs, all downy and asleep----" ...|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} several years, he {{made a couple of}} half-hearted {{comeback}} attempts and remained in the public eye as a repeating star of Jack McCoy's Billabong videos. Married in 1993 to Beatrice Ballardie, he built a house near Kirra, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and basically didn't get up for more than a year. From his 111-kilo peak, he began a training program under McCoy in Western Australia that helped him shed 34 kilos and regain his form.|$|E
50|$|The Anonymous Valesianus tells {{an account}} about his {{choosing}} of a successor: Anastasius could not decide which {{of his three}} nephews should succeed him, so he put a message under a couch and had his nephews take seats in the room, which also had two other seats; {{he believed that the}} nephew to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> special <b>couch</b> would be his proper heir. However, two of his nephews <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>couch,</b> and <b>the</b> one with the concealed message remained empty.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and groaned: [...] "To have to {{come home}} to this! I simply can't trust mother. She hasn't done one--single--thing, not one single thing. And if it were only the first time--! But it's every day, pretty nearly. She's been asleep all day, and then gone for a walk. Oh yes, of course! She'll come back and say she'd {{forgotten}} this was Saturday and I'd be home early! Oh, of course!" ...|$|R
50|$|On August 11, 2016, The Splat {{celebrated the}} 25th {{anniversary of the}} Nicktoons by air the first three (Doug, Rugrats, and Ren & Stimpy) while <b>the</b> creators <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orange <b>couch</b> {{discussing}} <b>the</b> show and behind the scenes and continued by airing a different Nicktoon for an hour every weekend (with the exception of Thanksgiving Weekend and Christmas Eve) until the weekend of December 3-4 which included premieres of KaBlam!, ChalkZone, Action League Now!, and Oh Yeah! Cartoons.|$|R

We went up to some {{backwater}} {{because it was the only}} accommodation we could find. Anyway, there was nothing to do, so that night I started drawing a data model. So it sort of started there really. Then when I came back to Wellington I literally <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and built the site on a laptop over a five- or six-week period." ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{mainstream}} appearance {{may have}} been in the Speller for WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows, released 30 November 1992. As programmer Robert John Stevens, now CEO of WriteExpress, watched users at the WordPerfect Usability Lab in Orem, Utah use the 5.1 Speller that he and Steven M. Cannon ported to Windows, he noticed that when a word was not found in the dictionary and no alternative words were presented, users seemed lost, moved the mouse cursor around the page and even exited the Speller. Dumbstruck by the anomaly, he went home, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and discussed his observations with his wife. Stevens coded the solution: as a user typed in the edit box, Speller would suggest words beginning with the letters entered.|$|E
5000|$|Pierce {{spent time}} with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds during the {{recording}} period of the Bad Seeds' album Let Love In. Mick Harvey, a former Bad Seeds member, has recalled, [...] "He was <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{during much of the}} recording ... He'd come almost every day and just sit on the couch and then he'd come out to dinner with us and just mumble away. He was very hard work. He was very unusual and a very unique guy." [...] Pierce then joined the band on-stage at the Shepherds Bush Empire venue, during the [...] "Let Love In" [...] tour in 1994, to sing on the Cave/Bad Seeds song [...] "Wanted Man". Harvey has also disclosed his personal perspective on Pierce: ...|$|E
60|$|While Paula sang <b>the</b> Gloria, he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>couches,</b> sipping {{his drink}} and remembering keenly.

60|$|Carol <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gritty <b>couch,</b> {{and sank}} into fear. Could this drabness of life keep up forever, then? Would she some day so despise {{herself and her}} neighbors that she too would walk Main Street an old skinny {{eccentric}} woman in a mangy cat's-fur? As she crept home she felt that the trap had finally closed. She went into the house, a frail small woman, still winsome but hopeless of eye as she staggered {{with the weight of}} the drowsy boy in her arms.|$|R
50|$|Manolo, Vickie, and Jane were {{appointed}} {{leaders of the}} new weekly task, Lapislide, with a goal of making towers out of 15,000 sharpened pencils and rolling a ball into {{it so that it}} shoots into a small ring. Vickie decided that the teen housemates {{will be the first to}} do the task. Big Brother prohibited the housemates from using the couch after Fifth was made by Daniel to exercise on it. Jayme was prohibited from entering in the activity area that day because she wrote using one of the pencils. Fourth and Aina, who were late in entering the activity area, returned to the house; but since they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> all housemates were not allowed to sit except for the teens. The six lapel violators were each given a wooden chair on Day 31. They can sit only on this chair and this should not be separated from their body. This punishment was later revoked. Daniel was allowed earlier by Big Brother to become a servant in order to help the teens.|$|E

5000|$|Three days later, on the 17th, {{after making}} her way {{up the stairs to}} Lawren Harris's studio, she had what she and her critics agree was the {{creative}} epiphany of her career. As she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> in his studio, Harris brought out one painting after another; Carr was mesmerized [...] "like a dumbfounded fool," [...] and inspired. She wrote that no other artwork she had ever seen, even in Europe, had so affected her [...] "right to the very core." [...] Back in her room at the Tuxedo Hotel on Sherbourne Street she was unable to sleep, and that meeting {{on the third floor of}} the Studio Building was to leave a permanent impression. His ascetic yet dynamic depictions of the Canadian landscape would greatly influence her own work on her return to her native province. The spare depictions and sweeping wind-blown trees and clouds of her post-1927 paintings, considered her best work, are products of that late autumn meeting in the Studio Building. Some say that if she hadn't been a woman, there would have been a Group of Eight with a representative on the West Coast. Her continuing relationship with the Group was a tremendous source of support in the following years.|$|E
60|$|Holden <b>sat</b> silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{thinking}} of <b>the</b> future, and his thoughts were not pleasant. The drawbacks {{of a double}} life are manifold. The Government, with singular care, had ordered {{him out of the}} station for a fortnight on special duty in the place {{of a man who was}} watching by the bedside of a sick wife. The verbal notification of the transfer had been edged by a cheerful remark that Holden ought to think himself lucky in being a bachelor and a free man. He came to break the news to Ameera.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> cross-legged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> where, by a {{turn of the}} head, {{she could}} view Graham {{lounging}} comfortably in the big chair, or Dick, on his elbow, sprawled among the cushions. And ever, as they talked, her eyes roved {{from one to the}} other; and, as they spoke of struggle and battle, always in the cold iron terms of realists, her own thoughts became so colored, until she could look coolly at Dick with no further urge of the pity that had intermittently ached her heart for days.|$|R
5000|$|After Humbug {{folded in}} 1958, Jaffee brought his {{unpublished}} material to Mad, which bought the work. [...] "Bill Gaines took out every Trump and Humbug," [...] remembered Jaffee, [...] "called {{me into his}} office, <b>sat</b> me down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> next to him, and went over every issue and said [...] "Which is yours?" [...] And as he came to each one, when he saw my stuff, he OK'd to hire me." ...|$|R
5000|$|I'm pretty {{shy about}} being {{in the studio with}} other people. Marc walked in, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and said, 'Let's tell each other a secret,' so we {{exchanged}} stupid, little private things. Then he said, 'For the next six hours, {{we are going to be}} completely in love, like we've known each other's lives and secrets for years. ... We sang to each other the whole time. ...I think you can hear our friendship coming through here. We really created it together, and I think it has such passion. —Simpson on [...] "There You Were"s recording process. Motolla selected Cory Rooney as the executive producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes down to what you hear. ... She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E

40|$|Conceptualization {{of spatial}} {{relations}} takes different forms in different languages, and certain cognitive spatial structures underlie {{the meaning of}} many linguistic expressions, both lexical and grammatical (Kravchenko 1996 a). However, these underlying structures that often account for the functional features of such expressions, are not so obvious across languages, and it is sometimes rather difficult to relate {{the meaning of a}} particular expression to its function on the basis of common sense reasoning. A good example are the Russian verbs stoyat ’ ‘stand’, sidet ’ ‘sit’, lezhat ’ ‘lie’ 1. On the one hand, their meaning is clearly that of spatial orientation, since their usage implies reference to {{the manner in which the}} object (prototypically, an adult human being) is oriented in space at the time of observation: (1) Maria postoyala nemnogo, sela na divan i, nemnogo pogodya, legla ‘Maria stood for a while, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and, after some time, lay down’ On the other hand, these verbs may be described as basic existential predicates whose meaning is different from the verb byt ’ ‘be ’ in that they establish explicit reference to a 3 -dimensional spatial grid by assigning to their subjects geometrical axes an...|$|E
60|$|The {{end of the}} {{nightmare}} was not altogether according to Inspector Jacks' expectations. He {{found himself in a}} small back room, stretched upon a sofa before the open French-windows, through which came a pleasant vision of waving green trees and a pleasanter stream of fresh air. His first instinct was to sniff, and a sense of relief crept through him when he realized that this room, at any rate, was free from abnormal odors. He <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> A pale-faced Japanese servant stood by his side with a glass in his hand. A few feet away, the man whom he had come to visit was looking down upon him with an expression of grave concern in his kindly face.|$|R
