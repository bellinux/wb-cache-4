5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> out on Commonwealth Games selection, Kydd had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} particularly difficult opponent {{by the beginning of the}} 2002 Commonwealth Bank Trophy season. She was consistently among the league's top goalers, particularly after she was again paired with Burton, due to the axing of struggling new recruit Kristy Doyle. She scored her 500th goal with the Kestrels in the middle of the season, and excelled against some particularly difficult opponents, including then-Australian captain Kathryn Harby-Williams. She was integral in helping the Kestrels make the semifinals for the first time since 1999, and was the third-highest scorer in the league. Kydd was again named in the extended national squad at the end of the season, and finally survived the cut, being named in the squad to tour Jamaica in early 2003, beating rival shooters Jane Altschwager and Megan Dehn (née Anderson) for the vacancy caused by the retirement of veteran player Jacqui Delaney.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{began her}} {{football}} career playing at primary school {{in her hometown}} of Bermondsey. At the age of ten, she joined leading women's club Millwall Lionesses. In the 1996–97 season, Chapman made her senior team debut at the age of14. She became a regular starter in the team and also participated in the 1997 FA Women's Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup final wins. In the 1998–99 campaign, Chapman won FA Young Player of the Year award. Already a full England international, she left Millwall in 2000 to sign a professional contract with Fulham. She played on the teams that won back-to-back promotions, as well as the 2001–02 Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup. In June2001 Chapman was again named FA Young Player of the Year. After two years with Charlton Athletic from 2004, Chapman joined Arsenal Ladies and reached prominence with the team in her first season, winning a domestic treble as well as the UEFA Women's Cup. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> significant sections of the 2002–03 and 2007–08 seasons through pregnancy, and spent a single season with WPS team Chicago Red Stars in 2010, before returning to Arsenal Ladies. After another pregnancy truncated her 2013 season, Chapman moved across London to sign for Chelsea Ladies in January 2014.|$|E

25|$|In 1814 Kingsmill {{became the}} first vessel to sail to India under a license from the EIC after the EIC lost its {{monopoly}} on trade with India. She sailed after George Canning wrote on 16 May 1814 to Secretary of the Admiralty John Wilson Croker requesting an exemption for her from the requirement that vessels travel in convoy. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the convoy and Croker argued that Gladstone would suffer a substantial financial loss {{if she had to}} await the next convoy. Croker further argued that Kingsmill was well-armed and so would not be vulnerable to attacks from most privateers.|$|E
25|$|Outraged by a {{derogatory}} cartoon {{published in}} Hustler in 1976, Kathy Keeton, then girlfriend of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, filed a libel suit against Flynt in Ohio. Her lawsuit was dismissed because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the deadline under {{the statute of}} limitations. She then filed a new lawsuit in New Hampshire, where Hustler's sales were very small. The question of whether she could sue there reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, with Flynt losing the case. This case is occasionally reviewed today in first-year law school Civil Procedure courses, due to its implications regarding personal jurisdiction over a defendant.|$|E

25|$|The only Spanish ship in {{the area}} left from the Armada; the 120 ton Bear of Amsterdam had not seen any of her fellow cohorts. Poor {{navigation}} meant that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> Milford Haven and landed as far North at Aberdyfi via the Dyfi Estuary on October 26. They landed men ashore but were ambushed by the Merionethshire Militia losing two killed and four captured and retreated back to their ship. The Bear was unable to leave for ten days {{because of a lack}} of wind but at the same time could not be boarded by the militia as there was no suitable boats. An attempt to burn the ship was thwarted by the wind and the Bear of Amsterdam eventually left. She was driven around the Cornish peninsula & swept up the channel by an easterly gale suffering some damage. Hoping to see the Spanish already at Falmouth, the ship was captured not far off from there on November 10 by a waiting English squadron. She was led into Dartmouth with 70 Spaniards taken prisoner, and this being the last ship from the Armada to be captured.|$|E
500|$|The {{second wave}} of {{feminism}} created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language. Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as {{a woman and a}} poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson, [...] "Perhaps as a poet [...] could find the fulfillment <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> as a woman." [...] Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet. Adrienne Rich theorized in Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: [...] " [...] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed. ... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time ... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{researching the}} history of UCL's Egyptology department, the {{historian}} Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was [...] "remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E

500|$|Following her {{comeback}} {{with lead}} single [...] "Applause" [...] from the album, Gaga performed few {{songs from the}} record at the iTunes Festival in London in September 2013. One of the songs, known as [...] "I Wanna Be with You", was performed as an acoustic version on the festival; Gaga called it an ode to her fans and about how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> them while recuperating from the surgery. The song, later renamed to [...] "Dope", was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Dino Zisis and Nick Monson and produced by Gaga and Rick Rubin. Described by Gaga as an electronic ballad, [...] "Dope" [...] was revealed to be [...] "the evolution of a fan song that became a deep confession in me." [...] In an interview with Kiss FM (UK) Gaga said that [...] "Dope" [...] was the most personal song she had ever created. Feeling that the album needed something more autobiographical and confessional and a song which would show her vulnerable side, Gaga worked with Rubin who let her do the song {{in the way she}} wanted and just assisted in recording it. He had contacted Gaga for producing the track, while she was on her sabbatical; Gaga consulted with Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, her main producer for Artpop and then decided to enlist Rubin's help. [...] "'Dope' is actually about me battling all sorts of addiction since I was growing up", she explained to the interviewers.|$|E

[...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, still on the bench in 2010, spoke on the record, saying that Moore would have killed President Ford had {{she had her own}} gun, and it was only [...] "because her gun was faulty" [...] that the president's life was spared.|$|E

Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2002, Norwood {{gave birth}} to her {{daughter}} Sy'rai. Soon, she resumed work on her then-untitled fourth studio album with producer Mike City and companion Robert [...] "Big Bert" [...] Smith, the latter of which served as the album's executive producer and A. He replaced longtime contributor and mentor Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, who Norwood felt was not going in the same direction creatively after all, and kept her from exploring her [...] "versatility, [...] creativity and [...] art." [...] The couple eventually finished a number of demo recordings and at least four full songs until late November 2002, and although Smith expected the album to drop by spring 2003 at one time or another, Norwood and Big Bert ended their relationship in mid-2003, resulting in the album's delay and several personnel changes. Norwood eventually decided to scrap most of the project, and instead enlisted producer Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timbaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> on Full Moon and its technical priority.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} Riki Lindhome {{was called in}} to {{audition}} for the role of Sadie, December 2007, she had not heard of Craven's original film. On the day of her audition, Lindhome was informed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> her scheduled appointment and that she would need to return come January. Lindhome took the time to watch the original movie and read an article in Vanity Fair about the film, giving her some familiarity with the story and her role when she went to audition. Lindhome says she finds her character [...] "creepy for no apparent reason", because the film does not attempt to justify why the three antagonists do what they do. The actress characterizes Sadie as being [...] "equally as bad as [...] ", being just as vicious as the others. Lindhome admits that early in production it was easier for her to detach herself from the violent character she was portraying, but as filming continued and the cast grew closer she says that it became more difficult and [...] "upsetting" [...] to perform some of the scenes. According to Lindhome, as a response to seeing how some of the scenes were affecting the women, the producers sent Paxton, Lindhome, and Martha MacIsaac to a spa for a weekend.|$|E

Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had another side to me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute [...] "Turn It Up", was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.|$|E
