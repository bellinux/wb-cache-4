International film merchants, based in Los Angeles, had to attend Cannes and MIFED, to sell their films to overseas markets during the 1970s and early 1980s. At the time, there were no comparable venues to sell U.S. films to the world markets held in the United States. His reports on the foreign <b>sales</b> <b>monopolies</b> held by Cannes and MIFED led {{to the establishment of}} the American Film Market (AFM) in 1981. Hollinger's work has been credited with the need an American alternative to Cannes and MIFED. Robert Meyers, a founding member and first chairman of the American Film Market, recalled asking other film executives, [...] "Why are we all going to Cannes just to sell the American independent film, and why not right here in the U.S.?", after reading a series of Hollinger's stories in Variety. The American Film Market, one of the film industry's leading marketplaces, is now held annually in Santa Monica, California.|$|R
30|$|Data in {{this thesis}} also include the sales, profit, and {{incremental}} of enterprises. We use {{the average number of}} employees in an enterprise to calculate the average operation index and compare the operational performance between monopoly industries and competition industries. From Table  2 we can see that there are great differentials in operation situations among enterprises in monopoly industries. Although the proportion of enterprises ﻿with﻿ loss﻿ in monopoly industries is quite high, the proportions of average profit and average incremental are higher than the corresponding index in competition industry. The profit per capita in monopoly industry is 7.8 thousand yuan, while the median of the average profit in enterprises of competition industries is 3.5 thousand yuan; the median of the average <b>sales</b> in <b>monopoly</b> industries is 336.1 thousand yuan, while the median for the average <b>sales</b> in <b>monopoly</b> industries is 326 thousand yuan. The average incremental is also a measurement on enterprises’ operation situation. The median of the average incremental in monopoly industries is 53.4 thousand yuan, while the median of average incremental in competition industries is 36.6 thousand yuan. As the incremental of financial industry is not calculated and there is lack of data about enterprises’ incremental, the number observed on average incremental is less than other indexes of enterprises.|$|R

To uphold the monopoly, Peru bought in 1876 the nitrate concessions Henry Meiggs had in Bolivia.

50|$|The privileged traders {{enjoyed a}} {{dominant}} economic, social, and political {{position in the}} local milieu. They controlled the local trade, fresh fish purchases, and fish processing, and they often owned the local estate. They sought to supply the locals with all the goods they needed from elsewhere, and this <b>sales</b> <b>monopoly</b> resulted in no room for competition. They covered needs ranging from food and fuel to boats and finished log houses. Often the sale of goods and purchases of fish happened at the same time, so that trade {{was more of a}} barter and the privileged trader profited from both the purchase and sale. Because there was little money in circulation, not only these exchanges were kept in written account books, but also the residents' other expenditures were recorded in the books maintained by the privileged trader; for example, taxes or costs of medical treatment. Fishermen’s dole-fish (the share of the catch they were entitled to) was also often handled by the privileged trader, and so he acted as a bank in many ways. This also applied to loans—both for working capital for fishing, as well as consumer loans for houses and land, equipment, and boats. There was often little chance of the debt being paid off. The privileged traders secured the debts by having the borrowers pledge their property as security. If the people could not repay their debt, this could lead to foreclosure or forced sale and the loss of their boats, houses, or other property, which was their source of livelihood. Practice varied on how the debt was enforced; some allowed the old owners to remain on the farm as tenants, whereas others evicted them and brought in new residents. Often the privileged traders had not only a trade monopoly, but also political power, such as mayor or other offices, which often undermined the municipal system.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{the effects of the}} abolishment of the Norwegian gas <b>sales</b> <b>monopoly</b> „GFU‟ in 2001. The {{conflicting}} interest between Norway as a gas exporting country and the European Union as mainly a gas importing region made the conflict over GFU “the biggest dispute between Norway and the EU since the signing of the EEA agreement”. In this thesis, I study the characteristics of the European gas market (with the current ongoing liberalization) and the role of Norway as a gas exporting country. The former gas <b>sales</b> <b>monopoly</b> model is presented with its advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, I look at the effects of abolishing GFU in terms of gas export price, internal sales, market structure, contractual agreements and resource management. Based on relevant literature, price data and industry sources, I conclude that the „forced‟ abolishment of GFU has been largely beneficial for Norway. Firstly, the Norwegian government has managed to retain its control over the resource management of the Norwegian gas reserves. Secondly, an expected oversupply of Norwegian gas to the European market with a resulting lower gas export price has not materialized. Instead, the combination of increased flexibility of gas sales from the Norwegian Continental Shelf and the „tight‟ gas market situation in Europe has made Norway able to reap advantages of the abolishment of GFU...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{characteristics}} of perfect rational-expectations equilibria for monopolists producing finitely durable goods in a continuous-time setting. We model this problem because we believe that both limited durability and continuous ability to change prices are more realistic than the standard paradigm of infinite durability and discrete (and quite long) trading periods. Even if durability is exogenous, we find that sales monopolists retain {{a great deal of}} monopoly power, except for goods with lifetimes of several decades or more. If the monopolist has the power to determine the level of built-in durability, he can further recover monopoly profit by reducing durability below its optimal level. 26 Finally, if the monopolist has control over the market for repair/replacement parts which are required to maintain the good, the sales monopolist recovers still more profit. Since altering built-in durability and excessively raising parts prices result in technical inefficiency which a rental monopolist would not find necessary, it is possible that consumer welfare is higher under rental than <b>sales</b> <b>monopoly.</b> In no plausible case do we find that the Coase discipline comes close to replicating the welfare benefits of competition, and in many instances it does more harm than good. 27 Appendi...|$|E
40|$|Merchant {{capitalism}} and the merchant class in Venice during the Renaissance Jean-Claude Hocquet The evolution of freight fees for Mediterranean salt in Venice between the 13 th and 16 th centuries reveals the following paradox : this freight was extremely costly beginning in 1350, while the historiography, {{for more than}} half a century, stresses the serious slump existing throughout all of Europe with regard to over-all prices and the marasmus of economic activity during the 14 th and 15 th centuries. Why, then, in this period of depression did Venice stand out as an island of prosperity at the height of its power? The patrician State and the patrician merchant tried to set up an extensive commercial operation : in order to lower shipping costs on luxury commodities and their cost, they had the salt that was used to ballast the ship, bear part of the freight cost to find outlets for this salt imported from all the Mediterranean shores frequented in the trade of precious products, they proceeded with the quasi-systematic destruction of saltworks on the Adriatic Sea and made a common product scarce, thereby, putting it into the same category with rare products of great market value. The salt monopoly, which is a consumer <b>sales</b> <b>monopoly,</b> was set up as a means of managing the commercial policy that guaranteed the maintenance of revenues for the ship-owner and merchant classes. However, the salt trade had no margin for autonomous action at its disposal and it fell into ruin at the end of the 16 th century when the major sea routes by-passed Venice for Atlantic seaports. In search of more profitable investments the State favoured the development of nearby saltworks within their coastal territories, just as the upper classes put their capital into agricultural development.

First, we extend {{the relationship between}} price discrimination and optimal auctions from the single-product case to the multiple-product case.

Second, we demonstrate that optimal auctions are qualitatively distinct from <b>monopoly</b> <b>sales</b> of multiple products. Because of uncertainty about the values of other consumers, two products are bundled probabilistically in an optimal auction for a customer who is willing to buy both of them.

40|$|In this {{research}} I {{have used a}} sample that was to cover market - regulatory environment - firm performance permutations capturing the changes in competitive dynamics and the co-evolutionary paths the firms and their respective business environment have taken when the markets were opened for competition. The research process builds on Event Structure Analysis (ESA) {{as a means to}} create causal patterns in the interaction between the firm and the environment. Data was collected from primary and secondary sources and complemented by confirmatory interviews. The electricity markets prior to opening for competition were either vertically integrated geographically monopoly markets or monopoly markets where the entry was constrained by other means. The value chain from generation to retail sales was rigid. There was either a position in which one company {{was in charge of the}} entire value chain, or the wholesale oligopolies had exclusivity on the <b>sales</b> to local <b>monopoly</b> distribution / retail firms. In most researched jurisdictions an oversupply of power prevailed at the time of the introduction of competition, which subsequently led to price cuts for some customers. During the process the focal point of activities shifted from being between the firm and the regulator / legislator to being between the firm and the customer. There was difference between the cases, but the fundamental shift seemed to follow the same basic pattern. The process ended in the key interaction taking place between the firm and the customer, with the regulator and legislator influence still being active. The regulative framework was not really designed for competitive markets but the existing structure had to be used to support another modification of the system. Key contribution of {{this research}} consists of the cyclical co-evolutionary interaction model that captures the interactions between the energy firm and its regulatory, legislative, customer and external interactions to a cohesive whole.

40|$|Each of this {{dissertations}} chapters studies {{a different}} problem in microeconomics. The approach used in each is uniquely tailored {{to deal with}} a particular problem. The first chapter shows how to optimally delegate actions to an informed agent when the principal cannot require payments. Instead, they are able to commit to actions in the future that affect both parties’ payoffs. I use these results to study a model of delegating decisions sequentially, and a model of delegation in which the principal can use measures that are costly to both parties. I characterize optimal mechanisms in both of these settings and show how the mechanisms vary with the model’s parameters. The second chapter compares the predictive performance of several models of risk aversion and time preferences in experimental settings. Models are evaluated on the basis of out of sample prediction rather than in sample fit. Some models predict behavior better than others, and these are often not the models which have the best in sample fit. More complicated models improve predictive power in choices over risk, and “behavioral” parameters improve prediction further. This contrasts with time preferences, where adding the present bias parameter β worsens prediction for all sample sizes, despite improving fit significantly. The methodology is easy to implement and interpret, and results can be used by both experimentalists and applied modelers. In the third chapter, I study a dynamic model of <b>monopoly</b> <b>sales</b> in which consumers are finitely lived. I characterize the equilibrium when the monopolist can only commit to a contract in the current period, and compare it to the equilibrium when the monopolist can fully commit and when she can sign long term commitments with renegotiation.

I then characterize how the equilibrium payoff set of the repeated game is affected by exogenously provided commitment...|$|R
