40|$|ABSTRACT. Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops; however, excessive vibration generated by rollers and transferred to tractors hinders the adoption of this technology in the United States. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on cover crop termination rate and vibration level was tested on several roller designs. Two field experiments were conducted with different roller designs to terminate a cover crop of rye (Secale cereale L.). In the first experiment, three single-section roller designs (long straight bars, curved blunt bars, and a <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> with an oscillating crimping bar) were tested at 1. 6, 4. 8, and 8 km/h operating speeds. In the second experiment, two triple-section commercial width rollers, one with long straight bars and the other, a <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> with an oscillating crimping bar, were tested at speeds 3. 2 and 6. 4 km/h. Data from the first experiment showed that all three roller designs terminated at levels greater than 90 % with the highest termination rate produced by the <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> with crimping bar (93. 4 %). Three weeks after rolling, termination rates varied from 88. 3 % to 94. 0 % for all designs and speed ranges, all of which were sufficient mortality rates for rye before planting a cash crop without need to use herbicide. Reduced vibration levels measured on the tractor’s frame were generated by the <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> with oscillating crimping bar with the highest vibration levels being generated by the roller with the straight bars. In the second experiment, three weeks after rolling significantly higher rye termination rates resulted from the roller with long straight bars (96 %) in comparison with the <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> (94 %).

However, the contribution of the drum detachers to the overall milling efficiency is in close correlation with the nature of the formed flakes.

The effect of speed on rye (Secale cereale L.) termination rate, vibrations and cotton yield was tested for two roller designs during the 2004 - 2005 growing season. A triple-section roller (4. 1 m wide) with long straight bars (straight bar roller) and a <b>smooth</b> <b>roller</b> with an oscillating crimping bar (smooth roller/crimper) were evaluated at speeds of 3. 2 and 6. 4 km h- 1.

Three weeks after rolling, both rollers had effectively terminated rye without use of herbicides. The smooth roller/crimper transferred lower vibration levels to the tractor’s frame than the straight bar roller at both speeds. No differences in cotton yield were found between roller types, speeds and chemical treatment (glyphosate) except for lower cotton yield recorded for the smooth roller/crimper at the speed of 3. 2 km h- 1. Cotton yield in 2004 was decreased by hurricane Ivan and these results might not be representative for normal weather conditions. Under typical weather conditions in 2005, higher cotton yield resulted following straight bar roller and glyphosate application, and might be associated with higher soil moisture availability due to faster termination of rye...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} of the roller stimulates not only the forma¬tion of roots and improves access to water, but stimulates also the tiller of the grain increasing its stability and thus {{reducing the risk of}} falling over. Practical recommendation •	Rolling requires dry soil in order to prevent the soil from sticking to the roller and ripping out the plants (especially when using <b>smooth</b> <b>rollers).</b> •	The corrugated roller must not damage the plants too much. Take special care when using sharp-edged rollers. •	Every mechanical interference puts the plants under stress. For this reason, it is advised to go at a maximum rolling speed of 5 km/h. Notes •	Even in densely sown or strongly fertilized spelt crops, the rolling is recommended. It weakens the main shoot and increases growth on side shoots, which improves the stability of the plants at the expense of longitudinal growth.

50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, <b>smooth</b> tandem <b>roller</b> or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem <b>smooth</b> drum <b>roller,</b> a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R

It was also known to the Estremedura's skipper that he had once swum off to the steamer from the roaring beach at Orotava when no fishermen in the little port would launch a barquillo out. Thus he felt himself in entire sympathy with Jefferson as every big comber hove the launch up and the spray lashed his tingling skin, while for five anxious minutes the issue hung in the balance. Launch and lighter went astern with the heavier seas, and barely recovered the lost ground in the <b>smooths</b> when a <b>roller</b> failed to break quite so fiercely as its predecessors.|$|R
