5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he <b>saw</b> <b>before,</b> which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, the parodies {{grew more}} complex {{over time as}} they were altered to {{resemble}} movie posters, and statues. Examples of parodies include pictures of Lee holding an electric <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> the Chinese, driving a crane towards Li, and Lee in Goku's costume in his Super Saiyan form. As of June 2006, the number of parodies have exceeded 200. Less frequently, the Chinese athlete (Yang Chen) in the background {{has been the subject}} of photoshopping.|$|E
25|$|Little {{action was}} {{actually}} {{seen as the}} Turks slipped out of El Arish, apparently getting wind of the attack a day before the Train landed. But {{it was one of}} the few times that the Train supported other Australian forces in combat, the Imperial Camel Corps and Australian Light Horse under General Sir Harry Chauvel were both involved in the Battle. However, this was the last real action that the Train <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> being disbanded.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first <b>Saw),</b> <b>before</b> the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

The mountains to the west curved round to block their path southward, and the party's attention was caught by a [...] "brilliant gleam of light" [...] in the sky ahead. The reason for this phenomenon became clear on 3 December when, after a climb through {{the foothills of the}} mountain chain, they <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> them what Shackleton later described as [...] "an open road to the south, [...] a great glacier, running almost south to north between two huge mountain ranges".|$|E

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
2500|$|Famously, upon visiting Merthyr's districts {{aforementioned}} in 1850, Thomas Carlyle {{wrote that}} the town was filled with such [...] "unguided, hard-worked, fierce, and miserable-looking sons of Adam I never <b>saw</b> <b>before.</b> Ah me! It is like a vision of Hell, and will never leave me, that of these poor creatures broiling, all in sweat and dirt, amid their furnaces, pits, and rolling mills." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Clerk, in his 1812 The Works of William Hogarth, {{writes that}} the sign-painter has been {{suggested}} as a satire on Jean-Étienne Liotard (called John Stephen by Clerk), a Swiss portrait painter and enameller whom Horace Walpole praised for his attention to detail and realism, mentioning he was, [...] "...devoid of imagination, and one would think memory, he could render nothing but what he <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> his eyes." [...] In his notes in Walpole's Anecdotes of painting in England, James Dallaway adds a footnote to this statement about Liotard claiming, [...] "Hogarth has introduced him, in several instances, alluding to this want of genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1870, H. J. Byron's Uncle Dick's Darling starred a young Henry Irving. [...] This was {{the last}} play that theatre buff Charles Dickens <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> his death. [...] Irving also played in the popular and {{frequently}} played comical interlude, The Trial of Mr. Pickwick, with Gaiety favourites J. L. Toole and Nellie Farren, who played Sam Weller. [...] Thespis, the first collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and J. L. Toole in the title role. Offenbach's Les deux aveugles played in 1872, starring Fred Sullivan. [...] Two Dion Boucicault plays produced here in the early 1870s were Night and Morning and Led Astray. [...] Among other burlesques written by Byron for the theatre from 1876 to 1879, he travestied Boucicault's Don Caesar de Bazan as Little Don Caesar de Bazan. In the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its frontstage.|$|E

His voice remained harsh and loud, and his look wild, as if he still <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> him Libyans or Cimbrians, and not well-bred and perfumed colleagues. ... is want of political culture was unpardonable... {{what was to be}} thought of a consul who was so ignorant of constitutional etiquette as to appear in triumphal costume in the senate! In other respects too the plebeian character clung to him. He was not merely—according to aristocratic phraseology—a poor man, but, what was worse, frugal, and a declared enemy of all bribery and corruption. After the manner of soldiers he was not nice, but was fond of his cups... he knew not the art of giving feasts, and kept a bad cook. It was likewise awkward that the consular understood nothing but Latin and declined conversation in Greek. ... Thus he remained throughout his life a countryman cast adrift among aristocrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequent}} {{topic of}} discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player {{of the first half}} of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge [...] "the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived." [...] In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he <b>saw</b> <b>before</b> the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion.|$|E
