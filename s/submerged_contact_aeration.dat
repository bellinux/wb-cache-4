The destroyer engaged the {{contact with a}} 24-mortar spread from its hedgehog mount, and then dropped a string of eight depth charges. Shortly after the munitions detonated, a series of four underwater explosions were detected. All 52 men aboard RO-501 were believed killed (the 48 crew who had trained on him, plus the Captain, an Engineer, a German pilot, and a German radar operator).|$|R
50|$|Changing an ROV's depth {{allows a}} towed array to be {{deployed}} in different thermal layers, giving a surface anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel a view {{above and below the}} layer. This compensates for density and temperature differences, which duct sound above or below a thermal layer by reflection. By dropping the array's 'tail' below the layer, a surface ASW platform can better detect a quiet, <b>submerged</b> <b>contact</b> hiding in cold water below a warm upper layer. A submarine can likewise monitor surface combatants by floating the tail of its array above a thermal layer while lurking below.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the reasons}} {{expressed}} above, the depth charge was generally replaced as an anti-submarine weapon. Initially, this was by ahead-throwing weapons {{such as the}} British-developed Hedgehog and later squid. These weapons threw a pattern of warheads ahead of the attacking vessel to bracket a <b>submerged</b> <b>contact.</b> The Hedgehog was contact fuzed, while the squid fired a pattern of three large (200 kg) depth charges with clockwork detonators. Later developments included the Mark 24 [...] "Fido" [...] acoustic homing torpedo (and later such weapons), and the SUBROC, which was armed with a nuclear depth charge. The USSR, United States and United Kingdom developed anti-submarine weapons using nuclear warheads, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "nuclear depth bombs".|$|R

2500|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine attack system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hamstrung {{by the use of}} the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a <b>submerged</b> <b>contact</b> before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied by using several ships cooperating and by the adoption of [...] "ahead-throwing weapons", such as Hedgehog and later Squid, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and thus still in ASDIC contact. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.|$|R

Unmanned systems, including autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), are anticipated to {{play a key role}} for critical tasks such as mine countermeasures (MCM) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Addressing these issues with autonomous systems poses a host of difficult research challenges, including sensing, power, acoustic communications, navigation, and autonomous decision-making. This thesis addresses the issues of sensing and autonomy, studying the benefits of adaptive motion in overcoming partial observability of sensor observations. We focus on the challenge of target tracking with range-only measurements, relying on adaptive motion to localize and track maneuvering targets. Our primary contribution has been to develop new MOOS-IvP autonomy and state estimation modules to enable an autonomous surface vehicle to locate and track a <b>submerged</b> <b>contact</b> using range-only sensor information. These capabilities were initially tested in simulation for increasing levels of complexity of target motion, and subsequently evaluated in a field test with a Kingfisher ASV. Our results demonstrate the feasibility, in a controlled environment, to localize and track a maneuvering undersea target using range-only measurements. by Andrew J. Privette. Thesis (Nav. E.)

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} using the Johkasou system {{installed at the}} Gunma National College of Technology, which uses a <b>contact</b> <b>aeration</b> process to effect water treatment. This system does not have denitrification capabilities. Several intermittent aeration modes were surveyed to investigate their effects on the total nitrogen (T–N) removal performance and energy efficiency. The water temperature was significantly correlated with the decreased velocity of dissolved oxygen (DO); the decreases at 25 and 23 °C were 1. 4 and 1. 2 mg・(L∙hr) − 1, respectively. The aeration time required to achieve DO 0 mg・L− 1 was more than 6 h. The time required upon restarting to reacquire the DO value observed during aeration was 30 min. It was thought that an aeration period exceeding 3 h was necessary for denitrification. Intermittent aeration times of 3 and 6 h exhibited good biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values at more than 25 °C. However, at water temperatures lower than 20 °C, the effluent BOD was approximately 3 times higher, denitrification did not proceed, and the NH 4 -N concentration became high. The denitrification effect {{was not able to}} expect the big effect in comparison with consecutive aeration mode. As a result of this study, we concluded that the most suitable operating conditions for intermittent aeration would employ a 3 h application from December to April, and a 6 h application from May to November. The energy costs were calculated to be 1, 120, 000 yen∙year− 1 based on the most suitable operating conditions. In comparison to the consecutive aeration mode, the energy, environmental, and cost savings with intermittent aeration were calculated to be 38, 500 kWh, 15. 6 t-CO 2, and 730, 000 yen per year...|$|R

The effects of operational parameters such as pH, sorbent dosage, initial concentration, <b>contact</b> time, <b>aeration</b> {{rate and the}} thermodynamics of the uptake of MO had been exhaustively evaluated. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) for PANI/glass and PANI powder was 93 and 147 mgg− 1, respectively. In addition, pseudo-second order model was the best fitted kinetic model for both systems, suggesting that the rate-limiting step may be chemisorptions. The obtained negative values of free energy and enthalpy indicated the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. In contrast to PANI powder, PANI/glass yielded negative entropy.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} in the area of mass transfer of air as a bubble in hydraulic fluid or lubricant is very limited. There are only a few studies on the interaction of oils with air, especially knowledge of air solubility of the oil and diffusivity of dissolved air in oil, namely aeration. This paper will study the effect of aeration on a direct acting hydraulic valve lifter system in an internal combustion engine. Aeration is, primarily, influenced by hydrodynamic factors such as, design features of the oil system and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. The direct acting hydraulic valve lifter (DAHVL) was introduced to the automotive industry because of some definite advantages, such as acoustic improvement and friction reduction. Although, the aforementioned, advantages of DAHVL are significant, the aeration effect due to hydraulics creates a challenge. Aeration stems from compressibility of air in oil. It is a fact that the incompressibility of the oil hydraulically maintains all components of the valve train in <b>contact.</b> Therefore, <b>aeration</b> tends to create separation between the valve train components. This separation creates certain effects on the dynamic performance. This paper has concentrated on 3 major specifics: how oil aeration affects engine operation (via a linear math model compared to experimental data), a brief discussion on what variables inherent in the design could significantly improve the system 2 ̆ 7 s robustness to aeration effects (experimental only) and on what causes aeration (theory) ...|$|R

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the presence of bundles or fascicles in aerial conidia absent from in vitro blastospores and <b>submerged</b> conidia. <b>Contact</b> angle measurements using polar and apolar test liquids placed on cell layers were used to calculate surface tension values and the free energies of interaction of the cell types with surfaces. These analyses indicated that the cell surfaces of aerial conidia were hydrophobic, whereas those of blastospores and submerged conidia were hydrophilic. Zeta potential determinations of the electrostatic charge distribution {{across the surface of}} the cells varied from + 22 to ” 30 mV for 16 -day aerial conidia at pH values ranging from 3 to 9, while the net surface charge ranged from + 10 to ” 13 mV for submerged conidia, with much less variation observed for blastospores, + 4 to” 4 mV, over the same pH range. Measurements of hydrophobicity using microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) indicated that the surfaces of aerial conidia were hydrophobic, and those of blastospores hydrophilic, whereas submerged conidia displayed cell surface characteristics on the borderline between hydrophobic and hydrophilic.

40|$|Widespread glacier {{acceleration}} {{has been}} observed in Greenland {{in the past few}} years associated with the thinning of the lower reaches of the glaciers as they terminate in the ocean. These glaciers thin both at the surface, from warm air temperatures, and along their <b>submerged</b> faces in <b>contact</b> with warm ocean waters. Little is known about the rates of submarine melting and how they may affect glacier dynamics. Here we present measurements of ocean currents, temperature and salinity near the calving fronts of the Eqip Sermia, Kangilerngata Sermia, Sermeq Kujatdleq and Sermeq Avangnardleq glaciers in central West Greenland, as well as ice-front bathymetry and geographical positions. We calculate water-mass and heat budgets that reveal summer submarine melt rates ranging from 0. 7 ± 0. 2 to 3. 9 ± 0. 8 m d - 1. These rates of submarine melting are two orders of magnitude larger than surface melt rates, but comparable to rates of iceberg discharge. We conclude that ocean waters melt a considerable, but highly variable, fraction of the calving fronts of glaciers before they disintegrate into icebergs, and suggest that submarine melting must have a profound influence on grounding-line stability and ice-flow dynamics. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

After spotting two convoys which Delfinul couldn't follow, on the 9 September, at 9:35, it was detected on the surface by a cruiser, which Căpitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Corneliu Lungu identified as the Komintern. The submarine carefully maneuvered because of the underwater rocks. In the following days, the submarine had some chances of attack but the rough seas made it impossible.

40|$|Callitriche cophocarpa Sendtner is a heterophyllous amphibious {{macrophyte}} {{that produces}} apical rosettes of floating leaves. The importance of air contact for inorganic carbon and N uptake and for growth was investigated. Plants were grown with the floating rosette {{in contact with}} air of various humidities (10, 50, and > 90 % relative humidity) and with the submerged parts in N-free water at 350 [mu]M free CO 2 and the roots in sediment with low or high NH 3 -N content. Humidity greatly affected the transpiration rate, whereas growth rate and N content were unaffected and were comparable to values measured for fully <b>submerged</b> shoots. Air <b>contact</b> had, however, {{a significant impact on}} growth when the free CO 2 concentration in the water was low. Thus, the growth rate of shoots with air contact was about 3 times faster than the rate of fully submerged shoots when grown at air-equilibrium concentration of dissolved free CO 2 in the water (16 [mu]M). This difference decreased with increased dissolved free CO 2 concentration in the water, and the two shoot types grew at the same rate when the submerged shoots received > 350 [mu]M free CO 2. The quantitative importance of the floating rosette for total carbon uptake declined also with decreased ratio of floating rosette to total shoot weight.

40|$|We report, for {{the first}} time, some {{experimental}} observations regarding {{a new type of}} long range interaction between rigid particles that prevails when they are suspended in an soft elastic gel. A denser particle submerges itself to a considerable depth inside the gel and becomes buoyant by balancing its weight against the elastic force exerted by the surrounding medium. By virtue of a large elastic-capillary length, the surface of the gel wraps around the particle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the free surface of the gel. Substantial amount of tensile strain is thus developed in the gel network parallel to the free surface that penetrates to a significant depth inside the gel. The field of this tensile strain is rather long range owing to a large correlation length and strong enough to pull two <b>submerged</b> particles into <b>contact.</b> The particles move towards each other with an effective force following an inverse linear distance law. When more monomers or dimers of the particles are released inside the gel, they orient rather freely inside the capsules they are in, and attract each other to form close packed clusters. Eventually, these clusters themselves interact and coalesce. This is an emergent phenomenon in which the gravity, the capillarity and the elasticity work in tandem to create a long range interaction. We also present the results of a related experiment, in which a particle suspended inside a thickness graded gel moves accompanied by the continuous folding and the relaxation of the surface of the gel...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{an emerging}} low energy desalination technology, where low-grade heat source can be utilized to provide heat to the feed, offering an alternative solution to saline concentrate treatment. Yet, MD still suffers prominently from scaling, wetting and low flux. To overcome these problems, methods of fouling control are frequently investigated, such as process optimization by selecting the appropriate operational parameters and cleaning protocols, and refining the intrinsic {{properties of the}} membrane {{to meet the needs}} of membrane distillation, in terms of enhanced fouling/wetting resistance and reduced mass transfer resistance. This dissertation examined the fouling mechanisms in MD process by different substances in treating saline concentrates produced from coal seam gas generation, as well as the desalination of brackish groundwater. In particular, the fouling mechanisms of substances such as alkaline scalants, silica, and humic acids were studied. During the treatment of coal seam gas water with the presence of silica, magnesium formed porous structured depositions with silica, which caused a less severe flux decline as compared to the feed without silica. Initially, the precipitation of calcite was spotted, followed by the deposition of magnesium silicate and sodium chloride. The roles of fouling control via intermittent cleaning, mechanical agitations, as well as an integrated thermal crystallizer were investigated. As such, cleaning of the membrane prior to catastrophic membrane degradation is a critical operating protocol as an approach to the maintenance of membrane performance. It should be noted that the approaches to fouling control should be carefully selected according to the specific fouling mechanism by the pollutants present in the feed. While vigorous agitations might be undesirable in MD process for the treatment of inorganic feed, it was discovered that the application of an integrated thermal crystallizer could help sustain membrane performance and harvest crystals. On the other hand, high speed transverse vibration at 500 rpm was found to be effective in fouling control for the treatment of brackish groundwater concentrates with a considerable amount of humic aicds. This work also explored the effect of surface engineering on membrane performance for different MD processes. To be specific, two approaches to surface functionalization were investigated as the purpose of different MD applications, namely Janus hydrophobic-hydrophilic membrane and superhydrophobic surface. To fabricate a Janus membrane, a facile solution-immersion method in the dopamine solution was applied. Significant increase of flux measured in a <b>submerged</b> direct <b>contact</b> membrane distillation configuration was observed from the modified membrane by this approach. The thickness of the hydrophilic layer determined the flux values and the rejection rate for long-term operation in saline solution; the trade-off caused by these two parameters should be carefully examined during the design of membrane. The maximum flux enhancement achieved by the Janus membranes was 120 % as compared to the nascent membranes. To fabricate the superhydrophobic surface, the membrane was immersed in the dopamine solution, followed by the deposition of silica nano-particles and low surface energy material of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PDTS). The modified membrane showed enhanced anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties in a submerged vacuum membrane distillation setup for the desalination of brackish groundwater concentrates and sodium chloride solution. Both modified membranes showed superior stability in long-term desalination processes for MD applications...|$|R
