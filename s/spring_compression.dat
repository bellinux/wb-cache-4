50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} <b>springs,</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> The most widely used application are for engine valve <b>springs</b> (<b>compression</b> <b>springs)</b> due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R

A zero-length spring is a spring supported {{in such a}} way that its exerted force is proportional to its length, rather than the distance it is compressed. That is, over at least part of its travel, it does not conform to Hooke's Law of <b>spring</b> <b>compression.</b>|$|E
50|$|The outlet {{pressure}} and the inlet pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of the}} large spring. If the supply pressure falls, {{it is as if the}} large <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if the supply pressure falls, the {{outlet pressure}} will increase, provided the outlet pressure remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet pressure causes the outlet pressure to climb. If the <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the supply pressure, the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} electronics to {{the control of the}} rear suspension of a motorcycle. The aim of the system is to make the suspension work around its optimal operating point, so that the safety and comfort of the vehicle can be improved. In fact, variations of the load carried by the vehicle determine a change of the suspension <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> that moves the operating point away from the optimal value. <b>Spring</b> <b>compression</b> can also be changed by varying the suspension preload. The electronic system described here reveals load changes and automatically adjusts the motorcycle suspension preload in order to compensate the load variation and keep the suspension to its optimal operating point. The system is based on a linear position sensor that monitors the actual stroke of the suspension and a microcontroller that executes the control algorithm and drives the preload actuator. Road tests carried out on a motor scooter equipped with the system show its correct functionality and demonstrate the achievement of a better operation of the suspension with simple hardware and cost affordable for the two-wheel market...|$|E

40|$|Dry {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in conventional and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} throwout bearing position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of dry clutches is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, cushion <b>spring</b> <b>compression,</b> cushion spring load, and slip-speed-dependent friction.

40|$|Heavy duty {{trucks are}} faced with strict {{requirements}} regarding exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency. The demands are achieved through downsizing and downspeeding. This introduces torsional vibrations in the powertrain which, if not dealt with, will decrease life and comfort. One solution that deals with these vibrations is the Dual Mass Flywheel that absorbs the vibrations. The goal of this thesis is to develop and verify different computational models of a Dual Mass Flywheel and in particular study how the friction between the arc-spring and the primary ywheel affects the system. Modelling is done in Python using the Newmark- method combined with Newton's method for numerical simulations. The same model is also created in AVL Excite for verification. The friction between the arc-spring and the primary flywheel channel is modelled using the Coulomb friction model or an inverse tangent function. It has been verified that the two computational models give similar results. A method to approximate Coulomb friction has been developed {{in order to make}} the computational model more stable. The friction depends on both <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> and centripetal force due to the rotation of the Dual Mass Flywheel. For a truck's operating speed the <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> is the largest factor to frictional losses with current selection of geometrical and structural parameters. The results show that with low friction and low viscous damping resonance is not a significant problem even if it occurs at low engine speed. A study about the number of masses needed to solve the friction model have been performed. It is concluded that the friction moment has not converged using five spring masses. A method of achieving accurate results with few masses is presented. For a final conclusion about the dynamics of the Dual Mass Flywheel, the developed computational models need to be validated using experimental data. Modifications of geometrical and structural parameters should be done to fit the experiments...|$|E

The finite element model, including {{the spring and}} {{the upper and lower}} spring seats, is firstly described in the paper; the spring geometry was accurately obtained by a reverse engineering procedure based on two video cameras and a video projector. Surface to surface contact elements were defined between spring and seats; the initial assembling phase of the spring between the seats was also included in the finite element analysis. The experimental rig, employed for spring characterisation, and the performed numerical analyses are then presented; results are discussed in comparison with experimental data, in terms of spring characteristic, side-load force and thrust axis spatial position, as a function of <b>spring</b> <b>compression.</b> A fully satisfactory agreement was generally observed between numerical results and experiments.

40|$|Background. The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} control fingertip force vector magnitude and direction {{is critical for}} dexter-ous manipulation. We quantified the dynamic control of fingertip forces to examine how dexterous manipulation declines with age. Methods. The strength–dexterity (SD) test measures fingertip forces during compression of a slender spring prone to instability and buckling. The greatest sustained compression (designed to be under 3 N), and force dynamics therein, {{have been shown to}} be simple and quick measures of dynamic dexterous manipulation ability. We measured pinch strength and strength–dexterity test in a cross-sectional population of 98 people from 18 to 89  years of age. Results. Dexterous manipulation ability is poorer at older ages, beginning in middle age (p <. 001), with greater decline past 65  years of age. Fingertip force dynamics during <b>spring</b> <b>compression</b> and stabilization show a deteriora-tion of neuromuscular control with age. Importantly, this novel detection of decline in dynamic manipulation ability is not correlated with, and thus cannot be entirely explained by, the known decline in pinch strength. We also measured standardized tests of dexterity in participants older than 45, and discuss how the strength–dexterity test uniquely captures features of sensorimotor capabilities for dexterous manipulation in this adult population. Conclusions. Starting in middle age, changes in the functional interactions among sensory, motor, and neural capa-bilities result in measurably poorer dynamic dexterous manipulation. This deterioration of neuromuscular control moti...|$|E
