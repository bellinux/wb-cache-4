For the small damage that is difficult to see with the naked eyes, according to that the impedance of damaged position is different from that of other position, the discharge signals of <b>sealing</b> <b>packaging</b> food in different damaged conditions are different in high voltage dielectric barrier discharge circuit, and then they are collected and analyzed.

50|$|This item is an {{inexpensive}} way to quantify relative humidity levels inside <b>sealed</b> <b>packaging.</b> They {{are available in}} many configurations and used in many applications, especially military and semiconductor. The most common humidity indicator cards change color from blue (less than indicated RH level) to pink (greater than indicated RH level). United States Military Specification Mil-I-8835A is the governing specification for a humidity indicator card. The humidity indicator card is also specified for use in J-STD-033 which is the standard for Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices, also known generically as semiconductors. This is a joint standard developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council and IPC and is used in semiconductor packaging.|$|E

The first Ukrainian sex shop was open in Kiev in 1999. For today in Ukraine there is no clearly formulated legislative base that would regulate the activity of sex shops, both stationary stores and online stores. At the same time, Ukraine has the Law of Ukraine [...] "Concerning Protection of Public Morality" [...] of November 20, 2003 No. 1296-IV (as amended). In this law, a definition of public morals, products of an erotic and sexual nature is given. According to the Law, products of erotic and / or sexual nature should be sold in hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>packaging</b> labeled [...] "sexual products, sale to minors is prohibited". When sending goods by mail or courier delivery services, the goods are placed in an opaque package.

50|$|Piercing guns {{have been}} widely criticized as {{dangerous}} among professional body piercers. The use of older designs of piercing gun can possibly carry {{an increased risk of}} disease transmission, as compared to methods used by professional piercers. However, more modern designs of reusable piercing gun have addressed this problem by the use of self-contained disposable cartridges. With these new designs, all parts of the gun that could come into contact with the customer's body are made of medical-grade plastic, which is sterilised at the time of manufacture and stored in <b>sealed</b> <b>packaging</b> that is only opened immediately before use {{in exactly the same way}} as the needles used by body piercing establishments. This automatically removes the problem of possible disease transmission found in the earlier types of device. Unfortunately there are still the issues of blunt force trauma to the skin and underlying tissue. Standard ear piercing studs are too short for some earlobes and most cartilage. Diminished air and blood circulation in tissue compressed by a piercing gun can lead to prolonged healing, minor complications and scarring. However, this problem has also been addressed in more recent gun-based systems, which use longer and thinner posts on the earrings, which also have much sharper points. These newer designs reduce the trauma to the skin and tissue, but cannot compare to hollow needles used professionally. Also, while most older ear piercing studs were not made of materials certified by the FDA, ISO, or ASTM as safe for long term implant in the human body, which could lead to materials from underlying alloys leaching into human tissue through corrosion, scratches and surface defects, causing cytotoxicity and allergic reaction, more recent designs offer much safer options such as titanium.|$|E
