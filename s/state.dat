5|$|After the {{independence}} of India in 1947, the region was organised into four states: Madras <b>State,</b> Mysore <b>State,</b> Hyderabad <b>State</b> and Travancore-Cochin. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 reorganised the states on linguistic lines resulting {{in the creation of}} the new states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. As a result of this Act, Madras <b>State</b> retained its name and Kanyakumari district was added to it from the <b>state</b> of Travancore-Cochin. The <b>state</b> was subsequently renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968. Andhra Pradesh was created through the merger of Andhra <b>State</b> with the Telugu-speaking districts of the Hyderabad <b>State</b> in 1956. Kerala emerged from the merger of Malabar district and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara districts of the Madras <b>State</b> with Travancore-Cochin. Mysore <b>State</b> was re-organised with the addition of districts of Bellary and South Canara (excluding Kasaragod taluk) and the Kollegal taluk of Coimbatore district from the Madras <b>State,</b> the districts of Belgaum, Bijapur, North Canara and Dharwad from the Bombay <b>State,</b> the Kannada-majority districts of Bidar, Raichur and Gulbarga from the Hyderabad <b>State</b> and the province of Coorg. Mysore <b>State</b> was renamed as Karnataka in 1973. The Union territory of Puducherry was created in 1954 comprising the previous French enclaves of Pondichérry, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahé. The Laccadive Islands, which were divided between South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras <b>State,</b> were united and organised into the union territory of Lakshadweep. Telangana was created on 2 June 2014 by bifurcating Andhra Pradesh and it comprises ten districts of the erstwhile <b>state</b> of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent <b>state</b> {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free <b>State.</b> He designed the coat of arms of the <b>state,</b> and laid the foundation of the model <b>state</b> the Orange Free <b>State</b> was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the <b>State</b> President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the <b>State,</b> Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the <b>state</b> apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the <b>state</b> {{highway system}} was {{restructured}} completely, incorporating numbers instead of names. The Olympic Highway became <b>State</b> Road9, the Pacific Highway became <b>State</b> Road1, the National Park Highway absorbed the Naches Pass Highway and remained <b>State</b> Road5, and the Inland Empire Highway became <b>State</b> Road3, but its branch from Dayton to Clarkston remained {{a branch of}} the now non-existent Inland Empire Highway. A system of national highways that improved on the concept of auto trails was formed in late 1925. The final plan for the system—which became the U.S. routes—was approved on November11, 1926. One of the routes included in the plan was US410, which extended from US101 in Aberdeen to US95 in Lewiston, Idaho. Parts of US410 were concurrent with other new highways, including US99 from Olympia to Tacoma and US97 in Yakima. In 1937, the <b>state</b> highway system changed to a primary and secondary system. US410 remained the same, but its concurrent <b>state</b> highways had their designations changed by the <b>state.</b> <b>State</b> Road9 became Primary <b>State</b> Highway9 (PSH9), <b>State</b> Road1 and US99 became PSH1, <b>State</b> Road5 became PSH5, <b>State</b> Road3 became PSH3, and the Inland Empire Highway branch from Dayton to Clarkston became a branch of PSH3.|$|E
