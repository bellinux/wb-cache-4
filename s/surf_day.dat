40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} indictors of performance in surfing. Therefore the objectives of the study were to determine the following: {u 100085 } Anthropometric measures such as: height, weight, body proportions; {u 100085 } Flexibility measures such as: back extension, hip flexion, ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion; {u 100085 } Core stability; {u 100085 } Dynamic balance; {u 100085 } Explosive leg power; {u 100085 } Which of the physical characteristics measured discriminate between elite and non-elite surfers. To achieve the aim and objectives of this study, the literature pertaining to excellence in surfing, and the theory surrounding talent identification and the many factors that can contribute to success in sport, were reviewed. Potential criteria important for performance in surfing were identified and appropriate tests to assess these criteria were selected. An ex post facto quasi experimental design was used to assess which of the identified criteria best discriminated between elite and non-elite surfboard riders. The test battery included a personal information questionnaire and the assessment of: anthropometric variables, flexibility, core stability, dynamic balance and explosive leg power. These abovementioned physical characteristics were identified from the literature as the factors most important to success in surfing. Fifty five (55) surfers were assessed of which 28 were elite surfers and 27 were non-elite surfers. The results obtained from the evaluation of the samples were compared in terms of their descriptive statistics and the differences tested for statistical and practical significance. The variables of height, age started surfing, core stability, dynamic balance, number of <b>days</b> <b>surfed</b> per week and number of hours <b>surfed</b> per <b>day</b> were found to most discriminate between the elite and non-elite participants. Finally, a stepwise discriminant analysis was used to determine classification functions that could be used for future prediction purposes. The variables included in the discriminant analyses included height, age started surfing, number of years surfing, core stability and dynamic balance. To verify the prediction model a jack-knife procedure was performed. The results from the jack-knife procedure indicated that 85. 5 perecent of the entire sample was correctly classified while 92. 9 percent of the elite sample and 77. 8 percent of the non-elite sample were correctly classified. Thus, the discriminant functions obtained can be used for predictive purpose...|$|R

We focus on data-streams with underlying graph structure and perform several large-scale experiments on the Wikipedia visitor activity data. We show that the presented model is scalable regarding time-series length and graph density, providing a distributed implementation of the proposed algorithm. We extract dynamical patterns of collective activity and demonstrate that they correspond to meaningful clusters of associated events, reflected in the Wikipedia articles. We also illustrate evolutionary dynamics of the graphs over time to highlight changing nature of visitors' interests.
