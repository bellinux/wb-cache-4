5000|$|While grinding's {{potential}} to cause players {{to stop being}} entertained {{may be seen as}} contradictory to good game design, it has been justified in several different ways. The first explanation is that it helps ensure a level playing field. [...] According to the Pareto principle, players with better aim, faster reactions, or more extensive tactical knowledge will quickly dominate the entire game, frustrating the now-powerless vast majority. By creating a direct correlation between in-game power and time <b>spent</b> <b>grinding,</b> every player has the {{potential to}} reach the top 20% (although the Pareto principle will still apply to the amount of time <b>spent</b> <b>grinding).</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule.

The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to <b>grind,</b> <b>sand</b> and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas.

In Titanium and Ti 6 Al 7 Nb surface by mechanical <b>grinding</b> and <b>sanding</b> acid corrosion are different processing to prepare a smooth surface and rough surface with holes, SEM and EDX analyze titanium surface morphology and elemental composition, laser confocal microscopy analyze surface roughness of titanium plate and a three-dimensional structure, inductively coupled plasma spectrometer to measure the internal elements of titanium and titanium alloy precipitation, observe different titanium surface adhesion of osteoblast cells by scanning electron microscope and analyze the proliferation of osteoblast by MTT test. Our results showed that sandblasted etched titanium surface treated to form a porous structure, the roughness of the surface is much larger than mechanical polishing, the precipitation of element content among titanium and titanium alloys is minimal in simulated body fluid, osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation, differentiation on titanium surface with Sandblasted etching group {{is much better than}} the mechanical grinding group. In summary, two methods could promote osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, but sandblasting etching group is better than mechanical grinding group, while in sandblasting etching treatment group Ti 6 Al 7 Nb is better than Titanium.

5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for <b>grinding,</b> <b>sanding,</b> honing, polishing, or machining material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the die grinder name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The die grinder name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (steel erectors), sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits. Die grinders are often used for engraving, cylinder head porting, and general shaping of a part.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} personal exposure to metalworking fluid (MWF) aerosols in very small machine shops (1 – 8 machinists per shop) and to investigate workplace factors associated with exposures. A total of 20 willing machine shops in Vancouver, Canada (from 46 eligible shops, 43 %) and 88 machinists participated (participation rate for machinists 92 %). Most machinists wore two personal sampling trains (an open-faced 37 mm cassette and a PM 10 impactor) on each of two full work shifts. Observational data were collected regarding potential determinants of exposure at 15 min intervals throughout each shift. A total of 322 personal samples were taken over 54 days. Mean aerosol exposure was 0. 32 mg/m 3 (range 0. 06 – 2. 19) for the 37 mm cassette samples and 0. 27 mg/m 3 (range 0. 026 – 3. 67) for PM 10. Expos-ures from the two sampler types were highly correlated (R = 0. 86). The mean shop-specific ratio comparing exposure from the 37 mm cassette with that from the PM 10 sampler was 1. 43 and varied significantly across shops, ranging from 0. 97 to 2. 19.

5000|$|In the Bartle {{taxonomy}} of gamer styles, Achievers ("Diamonds") are most typically enthusiastic optimizers, while the play style of Socializers ("Hearts") {{is the most}} distant from (and generally antipathic to) optimization.

To whatever extent the game style rewards optimization with power, Killers will appear to be optimizers as they work to maintain their competitiveness.

Killers who are also optimizers, then, tend to find more enjoyment in games where characters' statistics more strongly predict who will win in combat. Non-optimizer Killers, on the other hand, tend to prefer games where conflict outcomes are determined more by the player than the character, and may actively dislike games that reward optimization.|$|R
