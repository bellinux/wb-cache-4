The operational lifetime and reliability of any GSHP depends heavily on the way the system is designed, installed and operated. In order to provide a good system performance after installation, aspects such as borehole heat exchanger (BHE) <b>system</b> <b>flushing,</b> charging and purging, among others, should be taken into consideration. The aim of this work has been to review some existing methods of <b>system</b> <b>flushing,</b> charging and purging in order and make observations that may be applicable for the GSHP industry.

The results show that {{there is a lack of}} specific recommendations regarding the flushing and purging procedures for BHEs in Sweden. A well-defined range or adaptation of similar IGSHPA standards could help in defining the minimum flush velocity.

40|$|The {{current study}} explores the {{possibility}} that multiple fish farms (FFs) containing sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream (Sparus aurata) can be successfully integrated within a semi-enclosed bay in the Croatian Adriatic. The research focuses on determining principal environmental factors (EFs) that control the integration and attempts to estimate their individual and synergic ability to influence deposition and removal of organic matter (OM) and trace elements (TE) from the system. The complexity of the designated tasks demanded a comprehensive number of various datasets and samples {{to be used in}} the analysis. The ADCP data revealed strong wind induced currents forming within the research domain resulting in high <b>system</b> <b>flushing</b> efficiency (3. 5 – 6 days). The sediment samples from all stations contained relatively inert minerals which contributed to overall low OM and TE concentrations and very limited variability found across the entire bathymetric range. The thermal advection effect recorded at two stations was attributed to specific seabed topography and the hydrodynamic response formed during Maestral wind episodes. The results indicate that a successful integration of four FFs has taken place within the research site (semi enclosed bay), and that the key EFs responsible for its success are strong wind induced hydrodynamics, favorable seabed topography and sediment mineral composition. The synergy of the principal EFs that formed within the system was found to have an attenuating effect regarding FFs chemical influence (OM and TE) and an amplifying one regarding spatial footprint which extended to ≈ 2000  m distance...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved and {{particulate}} inorganic {{and organic}} forms of phosphorus and nitrogen, suspended sediments, dissolved silica and physico-chemical parameters {{were examined in}} the Richmond River estuary following a small flood event. Under flood conditions, nutrient concentrations were elevated, estuarine processes were bypassed and freshwater, sediments and nutrients were discharged directly onto the continental shelf. The Estuary recovered {{by way of a}} salt wedge penetrating landward along the channel bottom, and progressed from a small highly stratified, through a moderately stratified, to a large vertically homogeneous <b>system.</b> <b>Flushing</b> times were the dominant control on the degree to which nutrients were internally processed, with most of the river-supplied nutrients transformed under normal conditions due to very long flushing times. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus is apparently removed at low salinities by adsorption to iron and aluminium colloidal oxyhydroxides which aggregate and undergo sedimentation. At higher salinities, dissolved inorganic phosphorus is apparently desorbed due to a sharp rise in pH. Dissolved nitrate and silica were probably depleted by phytoplankton, and some nitrate may also have been removed through denitrification. As the riverine supply of nutrients is potentially nitrogen limited (i. e. low dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus), primary production for much of the year appears to be supported by the benthic flux of ammonium produced by the mineralization of particulate organic nitrogen deposited during the recovery stage. When this benthic supply of ammonium is exhausted, riverine nitrate becomes an important source of nitrogen. There also appears to be continuous wind-driven resuspension and deposition of bottom materials under the shallow well-mixed conditions that prevail during normal conditions. A three-stage (flood, recovery, normal) conceptual model is presented, which may be more applicable to highly variable Australian estuaries than the typical North American and West European estuarine models found in the literature...|$|E

An integrated lab scale system is currently being designed and built. The next planned stage of development is a pilot plant with a thermal input of about 500 kW, equivalent to about 30, 000 standard liters per hour of hydrogen production. The sulfur-iodine process contains a variety of hazards, including temperatures up to 850 ºC and hazardous chemical species including SO 2, H 2 SO 4, HI, I 2, and of course H 2. The siting and design of a pilot plant must consider these and other hazards. This report presents an initial analysis of the hazards that might affect pilot plant design and should be considered in the initial planning. The general hazards that have been identified include reactivity, flammability, toxicity, pressure, electrical hazards, and industrial hazards such as lifting and rotating equipment. Personnel exposure to these hazards could occur during normal operations, which includes not only running the process at the design conditions but also initial inventory loading, heatup, startup, shutdown, and <b>system</b> <b>flushing</b> before equipment maintenance. Because of the complexity and severity of the process, these ancillary operations are expected to be performed frequently. In addition, personnel could be exposed to the hazards during various abnormal situations which could include unplanned phase changes of liquids or solids, leaks of process fluids or cooling water into other process streams, unintentional introducion of foreign species into the process, and unexpected side reactions. Design of a pilot plant will also be affected by various codes and regulations such as the International Building Code, the International Fire Code, various National Fire Protection Association Codes, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act...|$|E

40|$|Many systems degrade as {{functions}} of their operation and require maintenance {{to extend their}} productivity. When operating under steady conditions, prescheduled maintenance {{can be used to}} ensure such systems meet their required levels of productivity at lowest cost. However, using pre-scheduled maintenance on systems that degrade as {{functions of}} their operation under uncertain, varying conditions will not guarantee that they meet their productivity at lowest cost. They require maintenance schedules that accommodate changes in their operating conditions and degradation. This research develops a prognostic maintenance methodology that ensures a system degrading with its operation under variable, uncertain operating conditions meets its desired productivity at the lowest cost. An example of a degrading system under variable, uncertain operating conditions is a photovoltaic-powered reverse osmosis (PVRO) desalination system. PVRO desalination can provide drinking water to remote communities in sunny areas with saline water sources. Such systems produce clean water and degrade as functions of their operating conditions, including solar radiation, water chemistry and community demand. These conditions are not constant, but vary stochastically. Maintenance (<b>system</b> <b>flushing</b> and cleaning) will extend a PVRO system's productivity, but requires time, chemicals and use of the clean product water. Hence, it has a substantial impact on the total cost of water production and should be adjusted in response to variations in operation. The community members who generally operate and maintain PVRO systems do not have the training or experience to determine the best type and timing of maintenance to ensure their water demand is met at lowest cost, and require a method to do so. Here, prognostic maintenance methodology is developed and applied to community-scale PVRO desalination. Degradation (fouling) and remediation (cleaning) of the RO membrane have the largest impact on the system productivity and water cost, and hence are the focus of this study. Fouling and cleaning are complex functions of water chemistry and system operation. Physics-based mathematical models of fouling and cleaning rely on two critical unknown parameters: fouling rate and cleaning effectiveness. They can be determined using system identification methods in real time, using measurements of the PVRO feed water pressure and clean water production rates. The identified fouling and cleaning models are combined with statistical models of the expected future PV power and community water demand to predict the type and timing of future maintenance procedures. The maintenance protocols are adjusted in real time in response to changes in identified fouling. The prognostic algorithm developed here is suitable for implementation on a PVRO system's embedded microcontroller. Case studies presented here show that the prognostic maintenance methodology provides non-expert operators with near optimal maintenance protocols when compared with conventional periodic scheduling, especially under varying degradation, solar radiation and demand. In this example study, annual maintenance happens to be nearly optimal, so the prognostic maintenance algorithm produces a nearly annual cleaning schedule that minimizes maintenance costs. Since the statistical nature of this example prevents demand from being met 100 % of the time, the prognostic maintenance method is used to minimize cost and water loss. On average, following the prognostic maintenance protocol results in less than 4 % loss of water over a 5 -year period at lowest cost. Although developed in the domain of PVRO, the prognostic maintenance methodology developed here is anticipated to be applicable to other systems that degrade as functions of their operation, including machine systems, vehicle fleets and transportation networks. by Leah C.
