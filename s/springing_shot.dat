50|$|The {{third stage}} is heat treating, which {{prevents}} the spring from being too brittle to function. Heat treating involves placing the spring in an oven at high temperature for a predetermined amount of time, and then letting it cool slowly. The fourth stage is applying {{the finishing touches}} to the spring, which may include grinding (flattening {{the ends of the}} <b>spring),</b> <b>shot</b> peening (shooting tiny steel balls at the spring to harden the wire further), setting (permanently fixing the length and pitch of the spring), coating (electroplating or applying paint or rubber to the surface to prevent corrosion), and packaging.|$|R

40|$|An {{equipment}} {{for measuring the}} influence of the strain rate on the mechanical properties of concretes based on a modified Split Hopkinson Bar (SHB) test technique is described. The SHB technique estbalished in the testing of steel has been applied to concrete utilizing a new discretization model for the exact determination of such parameters like stress-strain curves together with a dispersion correcture for pressure tests with short-time load. A defined load history is simulated by a <b>spring</b> <b>shot</b> gun as the load facility. It is shown that the load history exhibits a strong influence on the concrete behaviour. The degree of damage is clearly influenced by the strain rate, the load level and the duration of load. The increased stability of the concrete under dynamic load as compared to static load can be used only for short load impacts. The possibility {{to make use of the}} raised concrete stability under dynamic load can be estimated from critical load curves.

5000|$|The Gewehr 88 is {{in essence}} a Mannlicher design, {{though it is}} {{sometimes}} (incorrectly) called a [...] "Model 88 Mauser". It has a receiver with a [...] "split bridge" [...] (i.e., the bolt passes through the receiver and locks {{in front of the}} rear bridge); a rotating bolt head; and the characteristic Mannlicher-style [...] "packet loading" [...] or [...] "en-bloc" [...] system in which cartridges are loaded into a steel carrier (a charger clip) which is inserted into the magazine, where it holds the cartridges in alignment over a <b>spring.</b> As <b>shots</b> are fired the clip remains in place until the last round is chambered, at which point it drops {{through a hole in the}} bottom of the rifle. This system was used in almost all Mannlicher designs and derivatives, and while it allows for speedy reloading, it also creates an entry point for dirt. To settle a patent infringement claim by Steyr-Mannlicher, Germany contracted the Austro-Hungarian company to be one of the manufacturers of Gewehr 88s.|$|R

5000|$|The Barrett M107 is a [...]50 caliber, shoulder-fired, {{semi-automatic}} sniper rifle. Like its predecessors, {{the rifle}} {{is said to}} have manageable recoil for a weapon of its size owing to the barrel assembly that itself absorbs force, moving inward toward the receiver against large <b>springs</b> with every <b>shot.</b> Additionally, the weapon's weight and large muzzle brake also assist in recoil reduction. Various changes were made to the original M82A1 to create the M107, with new features such as a lengthened accessory rail, rear grip, and monopod socket. Barrett has recently been asked to develop a lightweight version of the M107 under the Anti-Materiel Sniper Rifle Congressional Program, and has already come up with a scheme to build important component parts such as the receiver frame and muzzle brake out of lighter-weight materials.|$|R
60|$|The men {{who were}} best mounted of course darted forward in advance and secured the fattest cows. They seldom dropped a mark to {{identify}} their property. These hunters possess a power of distinguishing the animals they have slain during a hot and long ride, which amounts almost to an instinct--even though they may have killed from ten to twelve animals. An experienced hunter on a good horse will perform such a feat during one race. He seldom fires till within three or four yards of his prey, and never misses. A well-trained horse, the moment it hears the <b>shot,</b> <b>springs</b> on one side to avoid stumbling over the buffalo. An awkward or shy horse will not approach nearer than ten or fifteen yards. Badly mounted men think themselves well off if they secure two or three animals during one run.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Swaysland of Brighton, who {{has been}} in the habit, during the last forty years, of {{catching}} our migratory birds on their first arrival, writes to me that he has never known the females of any species to arrive before their males. During one <b>spring</b> he <b>shot</b> thirty-nine males of Ray’s wagtail (Budytes Raii) before he saw a single female. Mr. Gould has ascertained by dissection, as he informs me, that male snipes arrive in this country before the females. In the case of fish, at the period when the salmon ascend our rivers, the males in large numbers are ready to breed before the females. So it apparently is with frogs and toads. Throughout the great class of insects the males almost always emerge from the pupal state before the other sex, so that they generally swarm for a time before any females can be seen.[338] The cause of this difference between the males and females in their periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious. Those males which annually first migrated into any country, or which in the spring were first ready to breed, or were the most eager, would leave the largest number of offspring; and these would tend to inherit similar instincts and constitutions. On the whole {{there can be no doubt}} that with almost all animals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a constantly recurrent struggle between the males for the possession of the females.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore the effect of cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of compression springs. Product manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to make their products last longer. This dissertation addresses three questions: (1) What {{is the effect of}} cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of chrome silicon steel compression springs? Does the life increase, decrease, or remain the same? (2) What is the effect of cryogenic treatment on the Percent Load Loss (Stress Relaxation) of chrome silicon steel compression springs? (3) What are the possible changes in the material that cause these effects? The following tests were carried out; wire tensile test, hardness test, chemical analysis, residual stress, retained austenite, lattice parameter, force vs. deflection, percent load loss (stress relaxation), fatigue, microstructures, and eta carbides. This research produced a number of key findings: (1) The cryogenically treated springs had a longer cycle life and a higher endurance limit than the untreated springs. (2) The percent load loss (stress relaxation) of the cryogenically treated springs was similar to the untreated springs. (3) The cryogenically treated springs had a higher compressive residual stress at the surface than the untreated springs. The conclusions of this research are that the cryogenic treatment of chrome silicon steel compression springs led to an increase in compressive residual stress on the wire surface, which in turn led to an increase in fatigue life and a higher endurance limit. A recommended future study would be to compare cryogenically treated <b>springs</b> to <b>shot</b> peened <b>springs...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The album artwork, shot in Hill Garden, Hampstead Heath, draws {{inspiration}} from seminal rock album design company Hipgnosis. Upon inadvertently discovering the {{location for the}} cover, Petit presented his ideas for the cover to Hipgnosis principle Storm Thorgerson, aiming to collaborate with the legendary album cover artist for the shoot. This did not materialise due to Thorgerson’s deteriorating health. Discussing the new album with iconic rock photographer and guitarists’ muse Pattie Boyd, {{it was decided that}} she would photograph the cover image. After Petit presented his initial mock-up shots to Boyd, work began on location in <b>Spring</b> 2013. The <b>shot</b> features Petit seemingly walking on water, surrounded by white balloons suspended in mid-air. Petit has since revealed that it was Boyd who suggested he stand {{in the middle of the}} pond featured in the image to create the illusion. [...] "There’s nothing faked. I’m actually standing on a table with about a millimetre of water beneath my shoe. Those balloons are suspended by bricks and tied with fishing line." [...] The white balloons featured on the album artwork were specifically arranged into three groups of three balloons to represent the number sequence 333.|$|R
5000|$|The ATF agents {{began the}} {{interrogation}} by asking Spring {{to elaborate on}} the firearms transactions that directly led to his arrest, {{so as not to}} give away that they planned on eventually questioning about the death of Walker. From there, the agents progressed to the topic of whether or not he had a prior a criminal record. When <b>Spring</b> admitted he <b>shot</b> his aunt at age ten, the agents saw an opportunity. Given Spring had just confessed to shooting someone as close to him as a family member, they questioned whether or not there were other victims. In response, Spring lowered his head and simply uttered the phrase, “I shot another guy once,” [...] without specifically naming or describing the man who he fired upon. The agents pressed further, first asking if he ever visited the state of Colorado in the past, and if the man he claimed to have shot was named Donald Walker. They also questioned if he used a snowbank to hide Walker’s corpse, in the case that he did murder the man. Spring responded to both questions with a “no,” and the interview ended at this point.|$|R

During one <b>spring</b> he <b>shot</b> thirty-nine males of Ray's wagtail (Budytes Raii) before he saw a single female. Mr. Gould has ascertained by the dissection of those snipes which arrive the first in this country, that the males come before the females. And the like holds good with most of the migratory birds of the United States. (5. J.A. Allen, on the 'Mammals and Winter Birds of Florida,' Bulletin of Comparative Zoology, Harvard College, p. 268.) The majority of the male salmon in our rivers, on coming up from the sea, are ready to breed before the females. So it appears to be with frogs and toads. Throughout the great class of insects the males almost always are the first to emerge from the pupal state, so that they generally abound for a time before any females can be seen. (6. Even with those plants in which the sexes are separate, the male flowers are generally mature before the female. As first shewn by C.K. Sprengel, many hermaphrodite plants are dichogamous; that is, their male and female organs are not ready at the same time, so that they cannot be self-fertilised. Now in such flowers, the pollen is in general matured before the stigma, though there are exceptional cases in which the female organs are beforehand.) The cause of this difference between the males and females in their periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious. Those males which annually first migrated into any country, or which in the spring were first ready to breed, or were the most eager, would leave the largest number of offspring; and these would tend to inherit similar instincts and constitutions. It must be borne in mind {{that it would have been}} impossible to change very materially the time of sexual maturity in the females, without at the same time interfering with the period of the production of the young--a period which must be determined by the seasons of the year. On the whole there can be no doubt that with almost all animals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a constantly recurrent struggle between the males for the possession of the females.|$|R
