50|$|Forces {{occurring}} {{between the}} motorcycle {{and the road}} (such as those that result in accelerating, decelerating and turning) occur at the contact patch through friction and normal forces.

Modern decks vary in size, but most are 7.5 to 9 inches wide and between 29 and 36 inches long.

40|$|When {{introducing}} commercial driving simulators a {{few years}} ago, the main interest was focused either on operating the vehicle or on the reactions of the driver in traffic and in emergency situations. A comprehensive modeling of the vehicle dynamics was not required for these tasks. However, there are driving simulator applications which make much higher demands on the modeling of the vehicle dynamics. Training simulators for drivers of emergency vehicles or cross-country trucks have to provide a realistic vehicle dynamics simulation including a detailed tire-ground interaction. This paper presents a generic toolbox of vehicle subsystems {{that can be used}} to assemble and simulate in real-time almost any kind of wheeled or tracked vehicle. The toolbox includes all the mechanical or electronic components found in on-road or off-road vehicles. The equations of motion are formulated and solved automatically. The vehicle dynamics is calculated for all six degrees of freedom considering the topography of the terrain, the type of the ground and the aerodynamic forces. Interaction of the vehicle with the terrain is based on an elaborated tire model that allows <b>sliding,</b> <b>skidding</b> or completely loosing the contact to the ground. For illustrating the capabilities of the toolbox, a detailed model of a heavy off-road truck is presented. Several results from the validation procedure and from special driving maneuvers are used to demonstrate the effect of anti-lock braking system or locking differential, when driving near or beyond the physical limits of adhesion...|$|R

The Wolf ends up apprehended by the Long Arm of the Law and is placed before The Judge who declares the Wolf guilty and sentences him to Life in spite of his objections ("You can't do dis to me! I'm a citizen, see!"), though the Wolf makes his Escape soon after. Jimmy Durante, incongruously illustrating the cover of So Big, turns toward the Wolf, and his huge nose trips the Wolf, who goes <b>sliding</b> down <b>Skid</b> Row, nearly falling into Dante's Inferno. The Wolf scrambles to the top, but the Sinatra caricature reappears, held in the orderly's hands as if he were a doll. The Wolf, being in the grandma archetype, swoons and faints just as the female characters did and skids head first into the inferno.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} motion {{planning for}} robots subjected to strong physical interaction constraints. More precisely, {{we will show}} how to solve two particular instances of this general problem: {{the case of a}} rover moving on a hilly three dimensional terrain, and the case of a dextrous hand executing a grasping operation. In addition to the high dimension of the associated search spaces, such motion planning problems exhibit new difficulties coming {{from the fact that the}} dynamics of the robot/ environment interactions may strongly modify the characteristics of the generated motion. Indeed, parameters like friction, inertia, or accelerations generate physical phenomena like <b>sliding</b> or <b>skidding</b> which may obviously affect the final behaviour of the robot. Therefore, such physical characteristics have to be carefully modeled and integrated into the motion planning paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to show how this goal can be achieved by appropriately combining geometric and physical m [...] ...|$|R

Their croup is wide, long, and slightly sloping towards the tail. The tail is long, bears thick fir, erected in a form of a sword when the dog's excited. The chest is moderately wide, while the belly is reasonably tucked up. The chests are scimitar in form, reaching the hocks or slightly longer in some cases. The legs are strong and straight; feet are oval and compact.

5000|$|VDIM's {{capabilities}} expand upon Toyota's stand-alone Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) {{system which}} {{was introduced in}} 1995; VSC remains the baseline electronic stability control system used by the company. VSC by definition does not intervene until after a skid is detected, while VDIM takes measures to prevent <b>skids,</b> <b>slides,</b> or wheel spins rather than just take action after tire slippage has occurred. [...] This is done by constantly making corrections in a subtle manner that are transparent to the driver. In further contrast with VSC, VDIM can also calibrate driver steering input according to vehicle speed, with active steering and throttle adjustments to improve ride quality and directional control during performance driving, such as in slalom courses.|$|R
40|$|Doubtless, {{there is}} a strong {{correlation}} between road friction and accident risk. The problems arise when we demand a more detailed view of that correlation. The aim of the project behind this report was to gather information about the different friction methods in use and about published quantitative relations between road friction and accident risk. Regarding friction measurements, every country has instruments and methods of its own, and the friction values reported from different international investigations are therefore not directly comparable. Work on harmonisation of friction measurements is in progress. Road friction is very important for traffic safety, {{but it is difficult to}} single out the effect of poor friction on the accident risk. Drivers adjust their driving behaviour depending on many factors, e. g. the appearance of the road environment, the weather, the sound from the tyres, and the <b>sliding</b> and <b>skidding</b> movements of the vehicle. For dry or wet bare roadway, however, the conditions are comparably homogeneous, and several studies show a dramatic increase in accident risk when the friction numbers decrease below certain threshold values. For winter circumstances there are few and unreliable estimations of the correlation between accident risk and friction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe freefall {{lifeboats}} {{have been}} designed to be fast and reliable evacuation system. Once the occupants have gone onboard, the lifeboat is simply <b>sliding</b> from a <b>skid</b> before the freefall. Some second after the water impact, the propulsion system can be started and the lifeboat can sail away from parent vessel. During the launching process, trajectories of freefall lifeboats can be divided into such categories, depending on the headway and advance speed after water entry and surfacing of the lifeboats. The aim of the paper is investigating the influence of the launching parameters such as, sliding distance, angle of skid and the falling height on the motion pattern of the freefall lifeboats by using Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis. The fluid structure interaction analysis is simulated using penalty coupling algorithm. The fluid is treated on a fixed mesh using a Single Material Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation and the lifeboat structure on a rigid shell element mesh using a Lagrangian formulation. The results of the numerical simulations provide the magnitude of launching parameters for safely launching of the freefall lifeboat...|$|R

By the 1930s the White and Black populations of the Third Ward were about even. After World War II White residents and the Temple Beth Israel moved from the Third Ward to newly developed suburbs on the southwest side, and the Third Ward became mostly African American. In the era of racial segregation, Almeda Road, a road located in the Third Ward area that at that time served as a corridor to Downtown Houston, was a busy commercial corridor.
