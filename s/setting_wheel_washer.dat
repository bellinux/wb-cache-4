40|$|Train <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> must be {{periodically}} inspected {{for possible}} or actual premature failures {{and it is}} very significant to record the wear history for the full life of utilization of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets.</b> This means that an online measuring system could be of great benefit to overall process control. An online non-contact method for measuring a <b>wheel</b> <b>set’s</b> geometric parameters based on the opto-electronic measuring technique is presented in this paper. A charge coupled device (CCD) camera with a selected optical lens and a frame grabber was used to capture the image of the light profile of the <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> illuminated by a linear laser. The analogue signals of the image were transformed into corresponding digital grey level values. The ‘mapping function method’ is used to transform an image pixel coordinate to a space coordinate. The images of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> were captured when the train passed through the measuring system. The rim inside thickness and flange thickness were measured and analyzed. The spatial resolution of the whole image capturing system is about 0. 33 mm. Theoretic and experimental results show that the online measurement system based on computer vision can meet <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> measurement requirements...|$|R
40|$|As a {{means of}} transport, the railway is gaining in importance, and this has {{inspired}} {{a large number of}} innovations. International rail traffic, for example, and logistics solutions need to be improved, but technical safety must also be guaranteed, especially for high-speed trains. Reliability and availability of high-speed trains depends significantly on the quality of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> axles. There are, indeed, already a large number of national and international rules and regulations, for example on the inspection of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and tracks, which take this into account. European and – not least – Fraunhofer research together with industrial partners have assumed a leading role in this process, resulting in international demand for inspection systems developed in Europe. Having said that, the systems do need to be adapted to suit national specifications. Keywords: High-speed train, ultrasonic, eddy-current, wheel-, wheel set-, axle testing 1.

50|$|Center pivot {{irrigation}} {{is a form}} of {{overhead sprinkler}} irrigation consisting of several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminum) joined together and supported by trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length.

The outside <b>set</b> of <b>wheels</b> <b>sets</b> the master pace for the rotation (typically once every three days). The inner <b>sets</b> of <b>wheels</b> are mounted at hubs between two segments and use angle sensors to detect when the bend at the joint exceeds a certain threshold, and thus, the wheels should be rotated to keep the segments aligned.
