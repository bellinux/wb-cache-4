40|$|Summary. The aims of {{this article}} are twofold: first {{estimate}} {{the parameters of the}} superpopulation model for two-stage cluster sampling from a finite population when the sampling design for the both stages is informative. Second predict the finite population total, cluster-specific effects for clusters in the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> clusters not in the <b>sample,</b> <b>and</b> predict the cluster totals for clusters in the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> clusters not in the sample. To achieve this we derive the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> complement-sample distributions and the moments of the first stage and second stage measurements. Also we derive the conditional <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> conditional sample-complement distributions and the moments of the cluster-specific effects given the cluster measurements...|$|R
5|$|Sons of Soul was {{produced}} entirely by the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment.

Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E

5|$|West further broadened {{his musical}} palette on Graduation by not {{limiting}} {{himself to his}} customary use of <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, {{for much of the}} third studio album, Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono's operatic vocal stylings. West altered his vocabulary, he utilized less of the percussive, rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother, melodic vowel sounds. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic <b>samples,</b> <b>and</b> describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} technique, which shares much {{in common}} with DSC, is differential thermal analysis (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference <b>and</b> the <b>sample</b> at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.|$|R

In particular, we derive the capacity of sampled analog channels for several sampling mechanisms, including a filter followed by <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> a filter bank followed by sampling.

The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E

They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, fun and Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors.

50|$|<b>Sample</b> <b>and</b> hold {{circuits}} {{are used}} in linear systems. In some kinds of analog-to-digital converters, the input is compared to a voltage generated internally from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The circuit tries a series of values and stops converting once the voltages are equal, within some defined error margin. If the input value was permitted to change during this comparison process, the resulting conversion would be inaccurate and possibly unrelated to the true input value. Such successive approximation converters will often incorporate internal <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> hold circuitry.
