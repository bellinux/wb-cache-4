The experimental result showed that the mixing of ethane and propane in ethylene diffusion flame increased soot volume fraction while the mixing of methane decreased. As compare to the ethylene-base flame, the diameters of soot particles for mixture flames are slightly smaller. While the <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> densities for the mixture flames are much higher.

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] new optical diagnostic technique {{has been used to}} measure the spatially distributed temperatures, soot diameters, and soot volume fractions in several different ethylene laminar diffusion flames to investigate the effect of adding hydrogen and helium on the soot formation. The test results show that adding hydrogen increases the flame temperature in all regions, while adding helium does not significantly affect the flame temperature in the reaction region but does increase the flame temperature elsewhere. The flame heights when adding helium and hydrogen can be calculated using the correlation introduced by Roper if the ethylene diffusion coefficient is used. This indicates that the flame height is determined by the diffusion of ethylene molecules when the hydrogen fraction is below 20 %. It was also found that either adding helium or hydrogen does not significantly affect the soot diameter but does reduce the soot volume fraction. A total of 20 % of helium addition by volume was measured to reduce the total <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> by 19 %, while a total of 20 % of hydrogen addition reduced the total <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> by 23 %. In comparison, replacing the hydrocarbon with hydrogen is much more effective in reducing soot formation. Replacement of 25 % ethylene by hydrogen was measured to reduce the total <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> by 66 %. Apart from demonstrating the influence of hydrogen and helium on ethylene diffusion flames, these measurements provide additional data for modelers of diffusion flames, especially those with an interest in the formation of particulate matter. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|A soot {{model was}} {{developed}} {{based on the}} recently proposed PAH growth mechanism for C 1 -C 4 gaseous fuels (KAUST PAH Mechanism 2, KM 2) that included molecular growth up to coronene (A 7) to simulate soot formation in counterflow diffusion flames of ethylene and its binary mixtures with methane, ethane and propane based on the method of moments. The soot model has 36 soot nucleation reactions from 8 PAH molecules including pyrene and larger PAHs. Soot surface growth reactions {{were based on a}} modified hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition (HACA) mechanism in which CH 3, C 3 H 3 and C 2 H radicals were included in the hydrogen abstraction reactions in addition to H atoms. PAH condensation on soot particles was also considered. The experimentally measured profiles of <b>soot</b> volume fraction, <b>number</b> density, and particle size were well captured by the model for the baseline case of ethylene along with the cases involving mixtures of fuels. The simulation results, which were in qualitative agreement with the experimental data in the effects of binary fuel mixing on the sooting structures of the measured flames, showed in particular that 5 % addition of propane (ethane) led to an increase in the soot volume fraction of the ethylene flame by 32 % (6 %), despite the fact that propane and ethane are less sooting fuels than is ethylene, which is in reasonable agreement with experiments of 37 % (14 %). The model revealed that with 5 % addition of methane, there was an increase of 6 % in the soot volume fraction. The average soot particle sizes were only minimally influenced while the <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> densities were increased by the fuel mixing. Further analysis of the numerical data indicated that the chemical cross-linking effect between ethylene and the dopant fuels resulted in an increase in PAH formation, which led to higher soot nucleation rates and therefore higher <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> densities. On the other hand, the rates of soot surface growth per unit surface area through the HACA mechanism were similar among the different fuel mixing cases, although slightly lower compared with ethylene base case. The increased soot nucleation rates by fuel mixing and similar soot surface growth rates (per unit surface area) help to explain the increased soot volume fraction/number density and similar average sizes among the tested cases...|$|R

In contrast, the measured ice particle concentrations were found larger in the secondary wake than in the primary wake.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} state, aircraft {{emissions and}} engine properties determine formation and initial properties of contrails. The synoptic situation controls microphysical and dynamical processes and causes a wide variability of contrail cirrus life cycles. A reduction of <b>soot</b> particle <b>number</b> emissions, resulting e. g. {{from the use}} of alternative fuels, strongly impacts initial ice crystal numbers and microphysical process rates of contrail cirrus. We use a climate model including a contrail cirrus scheme, ECHAM 5 -CCMod, studying process rates, properties and life cycles of contrail cirrus clusters within different synoptic situations. The impact of reduced <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> emissions is approximated by a reduction in the initial ice crystal number, exemplarily studied for 80 %. Contrail cirrus microphysical and macrophysical properties can depend much more strongly on the synoptic situation than on the initial ice crystal number. They can attain a large cover, optical depth and ice water content in long-lived and large-scale ice-supersaturated areas, making them particularly climate relevant. In those synoptic situations, the accumulated ice crystal loss due to sedimentation is increased by around 15 % and the volume of contrail cirrus, exceeding an optical depth of 0. 02, and their short-wave radiative impact are strongly decreased due to reduced soot emissions. These reductions are of little consequence in short-lived and small-scale ice-supersaturated areas, where contrail cirrus stay optically very thin and attain a low cover. The synoptic situations in which long-lived and climate relevant contrail cirrus clusters can be found over the eastern USA occur in around 25 % of cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of soot formation in turbulent ethylene-air nonpremixed counterflow flames is studied using {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) with a semi-empirical soot model and the discrete ordinate method (DOM) as a radiation solver. Transient characteristics of soot behavior are studies by a model problem of flame interaction with turbulence inflow at various intensities. The interaction between soot and turbulence reveals that the soot volume fraction depends on the combined effects of the local conditions of flow, temperature, and fuel concentration, while the <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density depends predominantly on the high temperature regions. Depending on the relative strength between mixing and reaction, the effects of turbulence on the soot formation lead to three distinct paths in deviating the data points away from the laminar flame conditions. It is found that turbulence has twofold effects of increasing the overall soot yield by generating additional flame volume and of reducing soot by dissipating soot pockets out of high-temperature regions. The relative importance between the two effects depends on the relative length scales of turbulence and flame, suggesting that a nonmonotonic response of soot yield to turbulence level may be expected in turbulent combustionclose 201...|$|R

Thermal and chemical effects of CO 2 addition on soot growth was numerically identified by using a fictitious CO 2 species, which was treated as inert in terms of chemical reactions. The results showed that CO 2 addition reduces soot formation both thermodynamically and chemically. In terms of chemical effect, the addition of CO 2 decreases soot formation through various pathways, including: (1) reduced soot precursor (PAH) formation leading to lower inception rates and <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density, which in turn results in lower surface area for soot mass addition; (2) reduced H, CH 3, and C 3 H 3 concentrations causing lower H abstraction rate and therefore less active site per surface area for soot growth; and (3) reduced C 2 H 2 mole fraction and thus a slower C 2 H 2 mass addition rate.

The heat release rate demonstrated the transition from mixing controlled combustion at high ambient temperature to premixed combustion mode at low ambient temperature. At lower ambient temperature, soot formation and oxidation mechanism were both suppressed. But finally soot mass concentration reduced with decreasing initial ambient temperature. Although the drop in ambient temperature did not cool the mean in-cylinder temperature during the combustion, it did shrink the total area of local high equivalence ratio, in which soot usually generated fast. At 700 K initial ambient temperature, soot emissions were almost negligible, which indicates that sootless combustion might be achieved at super low initial temperature operation conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModeling the {{oxidation}} of soot {{particles in}} flames is a challenging topic both from a chemical {{point of view}} and regarding the statistical treatment of the evolution of the <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density function (NDF). The method of moments is widely-used for the statistical modeling of aerosol dynamics in various applications, and a number of different moment methods have been established and successfully applied to the modeling of soot formation and growth. However, a shortcoming of existing moment methods is the lack of an accurate, numerically robust, and computationally efficient way to treat soot oxidation, especially regarding the prediction of the particle number density. In this work, the recently developed Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) is integrated with a physico-chemical soot model and combined with a treatment for particle removal by oxidation. This leads to a modeling framework for the simulation of coupled inception, growth, coagulation, and oxidation of soot in flames. In EQMOM, the moment equations are closed by reconstructing the soot NDF with a superposition of continuous kernel functions. Various standard distribution functions can be used as kernel functions, and the algorithm has been implemented here using gamma and lognormal distributions. It is shown that and discussed why gamma distributions are more suitable as kernel functions than lognormal distributions in order to accurately predict soot oxidation.

40|$|Turbulence {{statistics}} from two three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of planar n-heptane/air turbulent jets are compared {{to assess the}} effect of the gas-phase species diffusion model on flame dynamics and soot formation. The Reynolds number based on the initial jet width and velocity is around 15, 000, corresponding to a Taylor scale Reynolds number in the range 100 ≤ Reλ ≤ 150. In one simulation, multicomponent transport based on a mixture-averaged approach is employed, while in the other the gas-phase species Lewis numbers are set equal to unity. The statistics of temperature and major species obtained with the mixture-averaged formulation are very similar to those in the unity Lewis number case. In both cases, the statistics of temperature are captured with remarkable accuracy by a laminar flamelet model with unity Lewis numbers. On the contrary, a flamelet with a mixture-averaged diffusion model, which corresponds to the model used in the multi-component diffusion three-dimensional DNS, produces significant differences with respect to the DNS results. The total mass of soot precursors decreases by 20 - 30 % with the unity Lewis number approximation, and their distribution is more homogeneous in space and time. Due to the non-linearity of the soot growth rate with respect to the precursors' concentration, the soot mass yield decreases by a factor of two. Being strongly affected by coagulation, <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density is not altered significantly if the unity Lewis number model is used rather than the mixture-averaged diffusion.

Car manufacturersneed therefore accurate soot models for piston engine emissions prediction {{in order to}} developfuture engine concepts. This paper addresses this question by coupling a sectional soot model with a tabulatedcombustion model for RANS simulations of Diesel engines. The sectional soot model, based on thework of Netzell et al. (2007), is implemented in the IFP-C 3 D RANS CFD code. At each time and location,transport equations are solved for several soot sections, including source terms for collisional and chemicalprocesses. The soot model is coupled to a tabulated combustion model derived from the EngineApproximated Diffusion Flame one (EADF) (Michel and Colin, 2013). It allows to represent the minor speciesrequired by the soot model with a much lower computational cost than a kinetic solver. In order toevaluate the soot model coupled to the resulting combustion model called Variable PressureHomogeneous Tabulated Chemistry (VPTHC), it is compared to the same soot model directly coupledto a complex chemistry solver. As this comparison can hardly be performed on a real Diesel engine casedue to the very high CPU time involved by the chemical solver, it is performed on a variable volume andfuel/air ratio case which retains the essential features of a Diesel engine.

To gain improved knowledge of contrail and contrail-induced cirrus cloud formation, understanding of contrail ice particle formation immediately after aircraft engines is needed. Despite many efforts spent in modeling the microphysics of ice crystal formation in jet regime (with a plume age &lt; 5 s), systematic understanding of parametric effects of variables affecting contrail ice particle formation is still limited. In this work, we apply a microphysical parcel modeling approach to study contrail ice particle formation in near-field aircraft plumes up to 1000 m downstream of an aircraft engine in the soot-rich regime (<b>soot</b> <b>number</b> emission index &gt; 1 &times; 10 15 (kg-fuel) &minus; 1 ) at cruise. The effects of dilution history, ion-mediated nucleation, ambient relative humidity, fuel sulfur contents, and initial soot emissions were investigated. Our simulation results suggest that ice particles are mainly formed by water condensation on emitted soot particles. The growth of ice coated soot particles is driven by water vapor emissions in the first 1000 m and by ambient relative humidity afterwards. The presence of chemi-ions does not significantly contribute {{to the formation of}} ice particles in the soot-rich regime, and the effect of fuel sulfur contents is small over the range typical of standard jet fuels.

40|$|In this article, we {{combine the}} large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) concept with the population balance equation (PBE) for predicting, in a Eulerian fashion, {{the evolution of}} the soot particle size distribution in a turbulent non-premixed hydrocarbon flame. In order to resolve the interaction between turbulence and chemical reactions/soot formation, the transport equations for the gas phase scalars and the PBE are combined into a joint evolution equation for the filtered pdf associated with a single realization of the gas phase composition and the <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density distribution. With view towards an efficient numerical solution procedure, we formulate Eulerian stochastic field equations that are statistically equivalent to the joint scalar-number density pdf. By discretizing the stochastic field equation for the particle number density using an explicit adaptive grid technique, we are able to accurately resolve sharp features of evolving particle size distributions, while keeping the number of grid points in particle size space small. Compared to existing models, the main advantage of our approach is that the LES-filtered particle size distribution is predicted at each location in the flow domain and every instant in time and that arbitrary chemical reaction mechanisms and soot formation kinetics can be accommodated without approximation. The combined LES-PBE-PDF model is applied to investigate soot formation in the turbulent non-premixed Delft III flame. Here, the soot kinetics encompass acetylene-based rate expressions for nucleation and growth that were previously employed in the context of laminar diffusion flames. In addition, both species consumption by soot formation and radiation based on the assumption of optical thinness are accounted for.

The results are used to discuss the interaction of turbulence, chemistry, {{and the formation of}} soot. Compared to temperature and other species controlled by oxidation chemistry, naphthalene is found to be affected more significantly by the scalar dissipation rate. While the mixture fraction and temperature fields show fairly smooth spatial and temporal variations, the sensitivity of naphthalene to turbulent mixing causes large inhomogeneities in the precursor fields, which in turn generate even stronger intermittency in the soot fields. A strong correlation is apparent between <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density and the concentration of naphthalene. On the contrary, while soot mass fraction is usually large where naphthalene is present, pockets of fluid with large soot mass are also frequent in regions with very low naphthalene mass fraction values. From the analysis of Lagrangian statistics, it is shown that soot nucleates and grows mainly in a layer close to the flame and spreads on the rich side of the flame due to the fluctuating mixing field, resulting in {{more than half of the}} total soot mass being located at mixture fractions larger than 0. 6. Only a small fraction of soot is transported towards the flame and is completely oxidized in the vicinity of the stoichiometric surface.

40|$|A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of soot {{formation}} in an n-heptane/air turbulent nonpremixed flame has been performed to investigate unsteady strain effects on soot growth and transport. For {{the first time}} in a DNS of turbulent combustion, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) are included via a validated, reduced chemical mechanism. A novel statistical representation of soot aggregates based on the Hybrid Method of Moments is used [M. E. Mueller, G. Blanquart, H. Pitsch, Combust. Flame 156 (2009) 1143 - 1155], which allows for an accurate state-of-the-art description of <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> density, volume fraction, and morphology of the aggregates. In agreement with previous experimental studies in laminar flames, Damköhler number effects are found to be significant for PAH. Soot nucleation and growth from PAH are locally inhibited by high scalar dissipation rate, thus providing a possible explanation for the experimentally observed reduction of soot yields at increasing levels of mixing in turbulent sooting flames. Furthermore, our data indicate that soot growth models that rely on smaller hydrocarbon species such as acetylene as a proxy for large PAH molecules ignore or misrepresent the effects of turbulent mixing and hydrodynamic strain on soot formation due to differences in the species Damköhler number. Upon formation on the rich side of the flame, soot is displaced relative to curved mixture fraction iso-surfaces due to differential diffusion effects between soot and the gas-phase. Soot traveling towards the flame is oxidized, and aggregates displaced away from the flame grow primarily by condensation of PAH on the particle surface. In contrast to previous DNS studies based on simplified soot and chemistry models, surface reactions are found to contribute barely to the growth of soot, for nucleation and condensation processes occurring in the fuel stream are responsible for the most of soot mass generation. Furthermore, the morphology of the soot aggregates is found to depend on the location of soot in mixture fraction space. Aggregates having the largest primary particles populate the region closest to the location of peak soot growth. On the contrary, the aggregates with the largest number of primary particles are located much further into the fuel stream. © 2011 The Combustion Institute...|$|R

40|$|Two laser {{diagnostic}} {{techniques were}} used to measure <b>soot</b> volume fractions, <b>number</b> densities and <b>soot</b> particle radii in premixed propane/oxygen flat flames. The two techniques used were two wavelength extinction, using 514. 5 nm to 632. 8 nm and 457. 9 nm to 632. 8 nm wavelength combinations, and extinction/scattering using 514. 5 nm light. The flames were fuel-rich (equivalence ratios from 2. 1 to 2. 8) and had cold gas velocities varying from 3. 4 to 5. 5 cm/s. Measurements were made at various heights above the sintered-bronze, water-cooled flat flame burner with the equivalence ratio and cold gas velocity fixed. Also, measurements were made at a fixed height above the burner and fixed cold gas velocity while varying the equivalence ratio. Both laser techniques {{are based on the}} same underlying assumptions of particle size distribution and soot optical properties. Full Mie theory was used to determine the extinction coefficients K sub ext, and the scattering efficiencies, Q sub vv. Temperature measurements in the flames were made using infrared radiometry. Good agreement between the two techniques in terms of <b>soot</b> particle radii, <b>number</b> density and volume fraction was found for intensity ratios (I/I sub o) between 0. 1 and 0. 8. For intensity ratios higher or lower than this range, the differences in extinction coefficients at the wavelengths chosen for the two-wavelength method are too small to give accurate results for comparing particle radii and number densities. However, when comparing only soot volume fractions, the agreement between the two techniques continued to be good for intensity ratios up to 0. 95...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an extended flamelet approach for modelling of soot formation in turbulent hydrocarbons diffusion flames. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms {{are used to}} compute species concentrations, temperature, density and soot formation rates as functions of flamelet coordinates {{in the space of}} mixture fraction and scalar dissipation rate. An ensemble average based on a presumed probability density function of the mixture fraction and scalar dissipation rate provides the mean density, species concentrations, mixture enthalpy, temperature and soot formation rates. A semi-empirical two-equation model of finite rate soot formation is applied to methane/air turbulent diffusion flames at different pressures and to propane/air turbulent flames with different air temperatures. <b>Soot</b> <b>number</b> density and <b>soot</b> volume fraction are modelled by transport equations with empirical expressions for source terms, which represent soot formation and oxidation rates. It is shown that the model gives reasonable results for the flames at atmospheric pressure. It, however, over-predicts the soot yield, if the model parameters calibrated for the atmospheric pressure flames are used. It is shown that a decrease of the surface growth rate constant in proportion to 1 /p leads to good agreement with the experiment. Models of soot oxidation due to different chemical species, such as O 2, H 2 O, CO 2, OH, O and H, are evaluated at the pressure range from 1 to 3 atm. It is found that oxidation of soot by hydroxyl radicals, OH, is the dominating factor in soot burnout. The ability of an extended flamelet approach, with semi-empirical modelling of soot formation, to reproduce the effect of residence time in the process of soot formation is examined. A decrease in residence time is achieved by controlling fuel injection diameter while fuel mass flow rate is kept the same. It is shown that the semi-empirical soot model is able to predict a decrease in soot volume fraction when there is a decrease in the residence time. The effect of air preheat on soot formation is investigated numerically for propane/air diffusion flames at two incoming air temperatures Ta= 323 K and Ta= 773 K. The air preheat leads to an increase in the flame temperature and in the concentration of soot precursor species, which leads to an increase in soot concentration in the flame. However, the increase in temperature in the post flame zone leads to an increase in the soot oxidation rate and the amount of soot in the exhaust gases is drastically reduced. To account for the temperature effect on the soot formation modifications to an existing semi-empirical model are proposed, which take into account bell-shape soot dependence on temperature. A presumed probability density function and flamelet library approach is developed further in order to incorporate the influence of turbulence on soot formation. The numerical calculations are compared with experimental measurements and previous numerical simulations with a simple model for calculating mean source terms...|$|R

40|$|A high {{concentration}} of volatile nucleation mode particles (NUP) formed in the atmosphere when the exhaust cools and dilutes has hazardous health effects and it impairs the visibility in urban areas. Nucleation mechanisms in diesel exhaust are only poorly understood. We performed model studies using two sectional aerosol dynamics process models AEROFOR and MAFOR on the formation of particles in the exhaust of a diesel engine, equipped with an oxidative after-treatment system and running with low fuel sulfur content (FSC) fuel, under laboratory sampling conditions where the dilution system mimics real-world conditions. Different nucleation mechanisms were tested. Based on the measured gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) and non-volatile core and <b>soot</b> particle <b>number</b> concentrations of the raw exhaust, the model simulations showed that the best agreement between model predictions and measurements in terms of particle number size distribution was obtained by barrier-free heteromolecular homogeneous nucleation between the GSA and a semi-volatile organic vapour combined with the homogeneous nucleation of GSA alone. Major growth of the particles was predicted to occur due to the similar organic vapour at concentrations of (1 - 2) x 10 (12) cm(- 3). The pre-existing core and soot mode concentrations had an opposite trend on the NUP formation, and the maximum NUP formation was predicted if a diesel particle filter (DPF) was used. On the other hand, the model predicted that the NUP formation ceased if the GSA concentration in the raw exhaust was less than 10 (10) cm(- 3), which was the case when biofuel was used...|$|R
40|$|The Gasoline Direct Injection {{engines are}} an {{important}} source of ultra-fine particulate matter. Significant research effort is still required as improved understanding of soot formation is critical in considering further development or adoption of new technologies. Experimental measurements of engine-out soot emissions have been taken from a modern Euro IV GDI engine at part-load operating conditions. The engine speed and torque were varied in the range 1600 – 3700 rev/min, and 30 – 120 Nm, respectively. The engine was invariably operated in stoichiometric and homogeneous combustion mode, with fuel injection early in the intake stroke. The results indicate that for engine load in excess of 3 bar Brake Mean Effective Pressure, due to incomplete gas-phase mixture preparation, a consistent linear correlation establishes between combustion duration and <b>soot</b> particle <b>number.</b> On average, a sixfold increase in number concentration between 1. 0 and 6. 0 × 106 particle per cc, arises from shortening the rapid duration of 4 crank angle degrees. For engine speed in excess of 3000 rev/min and load in excess of 7 bar BMEP, this correlation appears to be superseded by the effects of spray-to-piston impingement and consequent pool-fire. Three main areas of concern have been identified within the part-load running envelope: (1) the higher load-lower speed range and (2) the mid load-mid speed range, where high nucleation rates induce copious increases of engine-out soot mass; (3) the upper part-load range where, most likely as a result of spray impingement, high levels of soot concentration (up to 10 million particles per cc) are emitted with very small size (23 – 40 nm) ...|$|R

This was undertaken at various loads while introducing cooled exhaust gas into the combustor reactant stream as a diluent. Operating conditions included primary reaction zone equivalence ratios from 0. 42 to 0. 64 and reactant oxygen concentration from 15. 4 to 20. 7 % at an average combustion pressure of 34. 8 psia. The results demonstrated a power relationship between soot volume fraction and the oxygen concentration in the reactant gas mixture. Soot formation was reduced by {{an order of magnitude}} when oxygen concentration was reduced to 17. 5 %. Two predictive models, based on data regression analysis, were developed for soot temperature as a function of combustion pressure and oxygen concentration and for soot volume fraction, normalized to the maximum observed, as a function of equivalence ratio, oxygen concentration, soot temperature and combustion pressure. The models demonstrate a close agreement with data and predict both soot temperature and soot volume fraction will increase with primary zone oxygen concentration.

40|$|En combustion, la {{formation}} d'espèces mineures clés, comme les polluants, peut être interprétée par des modèles mécanistiques de cinétique chimique. Les informations que fournissent ces modèles, même s'il ne s'agit que de tendances, sont suffisamment fiables pour définir des choix technologiques. Toutefois, compte-tenu de la complexité des phénomènes traités, leur emploi fait appel à une méthode indirecte décrite dans cet article et illustrée par la conception d'un réacteur autotherme destiné à la préparation d'un syngaz (gaz de synthèse). Dans l'exemple proposé comme application, l'objectif est de faire fonctionner à l'air un réacteur opérant actuellement à l'oxygène pur. Le modèle mécanistique choisi établit très clairement les contraintes imposées par ce choix. During {{the development of}} a partial combustion reactor for natural gas [1], Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) has made use of a mechanistic model to determine the impact of operational parameters on the formation of soot. The model we chose deals with the oxidation and pyrolysis of light hydrocarbons by several hundred elementary reactions, some of which are shown in Table 1. All the species taken into consideration as well as their linking are shown in the flowchart in Fig. 3. Our data mainly came from References [2] and [8], from which we took all the reactions of species having three carbon atoms or less as well as the pyrolysis reactions of hydrocarbons with four carbon atoms. In this database, the kinetic coefficients of reactions between CH 4 and the C 2 H 5, C 2 H 3 and C 2 H radicals were replaced by the values published in Reference [9]. This set of reactions is not sufficient to analyze the formation of soot, and so we added on the pyrolysis reactions of acetylene from Reference [10]. The model assimilated the total mass of carbon contained in C 5 and C 6 hydrocarbons with a <b>soot</b> <b>number</b> assumed to be proportional to the mass of soot formed by the actual process simulated. This procedure was first checked by applying the model to various published experimental results. Mechanistic models are not calibrated, which opens up the possibilities of their use in very wide fields. On the other hand, to save computer time, they can be used only to deal with ideal reactors such as plugflow reactor and stirred reactor as well as with one-dimensional flames. It is thus important to know the similarities and differences between reactors of this type and actual combustion. To do this, reference is made to Figs. 4 and 5. As a geometric parameter, the model can take only the volume of the combustion chamber into consideration. Despite these restrictions, we wanted to know whether a stirred reactor could represent the behavior of a partial-oxidation industrial reactor. For this we simulated tests performed in a pilot plant having the characteristics shown in Table 2. Figs. 8 and 9, which compare the measurements and computing, give encouraging results, especially for evolution of soot with the 02 /C ratio. As an applied exercise, we dealt with the partial oxidation of natural gas in air. The partial oxidation of oxygen is applied industrially and served as a reference, even though there is no commercial process operating in air. The model indicates that such a process must operate with a very unusual preheating level, which a standard heat exchanger cannot reach. We thus show {{how important it is to}} undertake such a procedure before starting an experimental program...|$|R
