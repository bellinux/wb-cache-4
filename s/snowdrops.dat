Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with <b>snowdrops</b> at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the lancet window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the {{relationship}} between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic <b>Snowdrops</b> From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.|$|E

25|$|Snowdrop were {{uncovered}} when a {{small area}} of garden was cleared. They have reappeared as carpets covering {{large areas of the}} leisure grounds from January to March each year. They were introduced to the gardens after the Crimean War in 1856 and have since spread across the estate. The <b>snowdrops</b> have cross pollinated and the variety has expanded, some of them are rare and have been removed off-site for protection until the hall is restored. New displays and paths were created for the 2010 season. Throughout February the gardens opened on Sundays for visitors to view the snowdrop carpets spread over the estate. In 2007 the United Kingdom Snowdrop Society visited the gardens and viewed a temporary display of rare <b>snowdrops</b> brought back for the occasion.|$|E

25|$|<b>Snowdrops</b> figure {{prominently}} {{in art and}} literature, often {{as a symbol of}} spring, purity and religion in poetry (see Symbols), such as Walter de la Mare's poem The Snowdrop (1929). In this poem, he likened the triple tepals in each whorl ("A triplet of green-pencilled snow") to the Holy Trinity. He used snowdrop imagery several times in his poetry, such as Blow, Northern Wind (1950) - see Box.|$|E
25|$|<b>Snowdrops</b> {{have been}} known since the {{earliest}} times under various names but were named Galanthus in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased various {{attempts were made to}} divide the species into subgroups, usually {{on the basis of the}} pattern of the emerging leaves (vernation). In the era of molecular phylogenetics this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven moleculary defined clades are recognised corresponding to the biogeographical distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.|$|E

25|$|<b>Snowdrops</b> are hardy {{herbaceous}} {{plants that}} perennate by underground bulbs. They {{are among the}} earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of G. nivalis are autumn flowering. In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile, found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites. The leaves die back {{a few weeks after}} the flowers have faded. Galanthus plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb offsets. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.|$|E
25|$|Celebrated {{as a sign}} of spring, <b>snowdrops</b> {{can form}} {{impressive}} carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. These displays may attract large numbers of sightseers. There are a number of snowdrop gardens in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Several gardens open specially in February for visitors to admire the flowers. Sixty gardens took part in Scotland's first Snowdrop Festival (1 Feb–11 March 2007). Several gardens in England open during snowdrop season for the National Gardens Scheme (NGS) and in Scotland for Scotland's Gardens. Colesbourne Park in Gloucestershire {{is one of the best}} known of the English snowdrop gardens, being the home of Henry John Elwes, a collector of Galanthus specimens, and after whom Galanthus elwesii is named.|$|E

The Lambroughton woods beyond (until recently the property of the Montgomery / Southannan Estate) are not shown on the older maps including the 1911 OS, they are shown in the 1960 OS map as a pine plantations amongst what was scrub or partial woodland cover containing elder, gean, ash, etc. Before this time the area above the river was not even fenced off at the top where it becomes 'level' with the field.|$|E

50|$|The front-angled bridge {{windows on}} the Royal Iris and the <b>Snowdrop</b> {{have been subject to}} much criticism, as they are {{contradictory}} to the classic ferry design, especially that on <b>Snowdrop,</b> which is extremely square and box like. Although the Royal Iris also has a large front-angled wheelhouse, it greatly matches the contours of the ship as does much of the steelwork replacement by Cammell Laird. Generally, <b>Snowdrop's</b> refit has been well received, but criticisms lie with the stark contrasts between the fine lines of the original Dartmouth builders and the somewhat crude welding of Mersey Heritage Ship Repair contractors; this is coupled with extensions to the forward promenade deck, which appears to be somewhat 'stuck on'. <b>Snowdrop's</b> refit results are {{in stark contrast to the}} excellent work carried out on Royal Daffodil.|$|R

The Bank Hall Action Group has tended the grounds since its formation in 1995. the group has planted specimen trees and identified the flora and fauna. The group opened the gardens to the public in 1999 after building a security fence, erecting scaffolding to secure the building and clearing the overgrowth. New varieties of <b>snowdrops,</b> some of which are unique to the gardens were uncovered. After a visit from the Snowdrop Society in 2007 the garden has become nationally known for snowdrop carpets during February.|$|E
