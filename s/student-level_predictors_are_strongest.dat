Both peer nominations and students 2 ̆ 7 self-reports of victimization were utilized. The sample consisted of 6731 Finnish elementary school students (3386 girls and 3345 boys) nested in 358 classrooms in 74 schools. The participants were from Grades 3, 4, and 5 (mean age 11. years). The results of multilevel analyses indicated that there was considerable variability in, and distinctive risk factors associated with, both peer- and self-reported victimization at all the three levels investigated. Social anxiety and peer rejection synergistically predicted victimization at the student level. At the classroom level, negative social outcome expectations of defending the victim were associated with an increased risk of a student being bullied. Victimization was also common in classrooms and schools where students perceived their teachers to have less disapproving attitudes toward bullying. Furthermore, the effects of the <b>student-level</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>were</b> found to vary across classrooms, and classroom size moderated the effects of social anxiety and peer rejection on victimization. By identifying the risk factors at the multiple levels, and looking into cross-level interactions among these factors, research can help to target interventions at the key ecological factors contributing to victimization, making it possible to maximize the effectiveness of interventions...|$|R

One hundred twelve children, aged 14 – 36 months (M = 25. 17, SD = 6. 06), randomly selected from 30 toddler child care classrooms from the district of Porto, Portugal, participated. Levels of engagement were coded, and sophisticated engagement, but not nonengagement, was consistent across settings. Consistency in children’s sophisticated engagement was primarily accounted for by chronological age. Children spent more time in sophisticated behaviors and less time nonengaged during mother–child dyadic play than in center-based child care. For sophisticated engagement, effects of child <b>predictors</b> <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than effects of environmental features; whereas for nonengagement, effects of environmental features <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than effects of child predictors.

40|$|Background: Students’ {{motivation}} {{is known to}} influence academic outcomes. However, there is a paucity of research showing the relative influences of motivational factors on short-term and long-term outcomes. Purpose: The study investigates the relative influences of motivational factors – mastery goal orientation, value of schooling, and academic self-concepts (perceived competence in and affect to schoolwork) on four outcomes – rule acceptance, identity, general self-efficacy and achievement. Sample: Students in grades 3 to 6 from six primary schools in the Sydney were surveyed (N = 979). The ages of the participants varied from 8 to 13 years (mean = 9. 78). Design and methods: Students completed a questionnaire and literacy and numeracy achievement tests. Structural equation modelling {{was used to examine}} the paths from four predictors to four outcomes. Results: Whereas all four <b>predictors</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with all four outcomes, students’ mastery goal had stronger positive influences on self-efficacy and identity. Value, perceived competence and affect were found to influence outcomes in different ways – positive influences were found for value on achievement, rule-acceptance, and identity; for perceived competence on achievement and efficacy; and for affect on rule-acceptance and identity. Conclusion: Mastery goal had stronger influences on long-term outcomes while other <b>predictors</b> <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> for short-term outcomes.

40|$|As life {{expectancy}} continually increases, {{it is imperative}} to identify determinants of survival to the extreme end of the lifespan and more importantly to identify factors that increase the chance of survival free of major morbidities. As such, the current study assessed 45 common disease factors as predictors of survival and morbidity-free survival to age 85  years. Within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort, we evaluated morbidity-free participants who were able to attain age 85 within the study duration (n[*]=[*] 2, 008). Risk factors were assessed at baseline (1990 – 1993), and mortality and morbidities were then collected continuously until mortality or the occurrence of their 85 th birthday (average time of 7. 9  years). Risk factors included demographic and lifestyle variables, health and morbidity indicators and physiological makers. Major morbidities examined included dementia, cancer, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure and myocardial infarction. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that many of the variables were independently predictive for survival and for morbidity-free ageing to 85  years. These included being female, absence of left ventricular abnormalities, stable body weight, unimpaired instrumental activities of daily living, lower C-RP levels and higher levels of femoral neck bone mineral density and albumin. Relative to non-survival, <b>predictors</b> <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> for morbidity-free survival than for total survival or survival with morbidity. This suggests that lifespan and healthy survival to older age can be relatively well predicted. Understanding predictors of a long and healthy lifespan is vital for developing primary and secondary preventions to help {{improve the quality of life}} of older adults and for reducing the financial burden of the rapidly escalating ageing population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Conventional renal cell {{carcinoma}} (cRCC) accounts {{for most of the}} deaths due to kidney cancer. Tumor stage, grade, and patient performance status are used currently to predict survival after surgery. Our goal was to identify gene expression features, using comprehensive gene expression profiling, that correlate with survival. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Gene expression profiles were determined in 177 primary cRCCs using DNA microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis segregated cRCC into five gene expression subgroups. Expression subgroup was correlated with survival in long-term follow-up and was independent of grade, stage, and performance status. The tumors were then divided evenly into training and test sets that were balanced for grade, stage, performance status, and length of follow-up. A semisupervised learning algorithm (supervised principal components analysis) was applied to identify transcripts whose expression was associated with survival in the training set, and the performance of this gene expression-based survival <b>predictor</b> <b>was</b> assessed using the test set. With this method, we identified 259 genes that accurately predicted disease-specific survival among patients in the independent validation group (p < 0. 001). In multivariate analysis, the gene expression <b>predictor</b> <b>was</b> a <b>strong</b> <b>predictor</b> of survival independent of tumor stage, grade, and performance status (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: cRCC displays molecular heterogeneity and can be separated into gene expression subgroups that correlate with survival after surgery.

METHODS: Standardised quality assessment criteria were utilised to assess the evidence of psychosocial predictors of breast cancer development in the following domains: (a) stressful life events, (b) coping style, (c) social support, and (d) emotional and personality factors. RESULTS: Few well-designed studies report any association between life events and breast cancer, the exception being two small studies using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) reporting an association between severely threatening events and breast cancer risk. Seven studies show anger repression or alexithymia <b>are</b> <b>predictors,</b> the <b>strongest</b> evidence suggesting younger women are at increased risk.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies nonparametric statistical techniques toMachine Translation (MT) Evaluation {{using data}} from a MT Evaluation experiment conducted through a joint Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and Center for the Advanced Study of Language (CASL) project. In particular, the relationship between human task performance on an information extraction task with translated documents and well-known automated translation evaluation metric scores for those documents is studied. Findings from a correlation analysis {{of the connection between}} autometrics and task-based metrics are presented and contrasted with current strategies for evaluating translations. A novel idea for assessing partial rank correlation within the presence of grouping factors is also introduced. Lastly, this dissertation presents a framework for task-based machine translation (MT) evaluation and predictive modeling of task responses that gives new information about the relative predictive strengths of the different autometrics (and re-coded variants of them) within the statistical Generalized Linear Models developed in analyses of the Information Extraction Task data. This work shows that current autometrics are inadequate with respect to the prediction of task performance but, near adequacy can be accomplished through the use of re-coded autometrics in a logistic regression setting. As a result, a class of automated metrics that are best suitable for predicting performance is established and suggestions are offered about how to utilize metrics to supplement expensive and time-consuming experiments with human participants. Now users can begin to tie the intrinsic automated metrics to the extrinsic metrics for task they perform. The bottom line {{is that there is a}} need to average away MT dependence (averaged metrics perform better in overall predictions than original autometrics). Moreover, combinations of recoded metrics performed better than any individual metric. Ultimately, MT evaluation methodology is extended to create new metrics specially relevant to task-based comparisons. A formal method to establish that differences among metrics as <b>predictors</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> enough not to be due by chance remains as future work. Given the lack of connection in the field of MT Evaluation between task utility and the interpretation of automated evaluation metrics, as well as the absence of solid statistical reasoning in evaluating MT, there is a need to bring innovative and interdisciplinary analytical techniques to this problem. Because there are no papers in the MT evaluation literature that have done statistical modeling before or that have linked automated metrics with how well MT supports human tasks, this work is unique and has high potential for benefiting the Machine Translation research community...|$|R

Over the past decades medical advancements in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) led to improved survival and increased life expectancy. As short-term survival from AMI improves, more attention is being shifted toward understanding and improving long-term outcomes. AimTo evaluate age-associated variations in the long-term (up to 10 years) prognostic factors following AMI in “real world” patients, focusing on improving risk stratification of elderly patients. MethodsA retrospective analysis of 2763 consecutive AMI patients according to age groups: ≤ 65 years (n= 1230) and > 65 years (n= 1533). Data were collected from the hospital's computerized systems. The primary outcome was 10 -year postdischarge all-cause mortality. ResultsHigher rates of women, non-ST-elevation AMI, and most comorbidities were found in elderly patients, while the rates of invasive treatment were lower. During the follow-up period, mortality rate was higher among the older versus the younger group (69. 7 % versus 18. 6 %). Some of the parameters included in the interaction multivariate model had stronger association with the outcome in the younger group (hyponatremia, anemia, alcohol abuse or drug addiction, malignant neoplasm, renal disease, previous myocardial infarction, and invasive interventions) while others <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>predictors</b> in the elderly group (higher age, left main coronary artery or three-vessel disease, and neurological disorders). The c-statistic values of the multivariate models were 0. 75 and 0. 74 in the younger and the elder groups, respectively, and 0. 86 for the interaction model. ConclusionsLong-term mortality following AMI in young as well as elderly patients can be predicted from simple, easily accessible clinical information. The associations of most <b>predictors</b> and mortality <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> in younger patients.
