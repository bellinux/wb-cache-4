25|$|There {{are various}} methods of calculating the engine {{displacement}} of a Wankel. The Japanese regulations for calculating displacements for engine ratings use the volume displacement of one rotor face only, and {{the auto industry}} commonly accepts this method as the standard for calculating the displacement of a rotary. When compared by <b>specific</b> <b>output,</b> however, the convention resulted in large imbalances {{in favor of the}} Wankel motor. An early revised approach was to rate the displacement of each rotor as two times the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its <b>specific</b> <b>output,</b> because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

40|$|An {{irreversible}} cycle {{model of}} a Braysson heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs is used to investigate {{the performance of the}} cycle affected by the finite-rate heat transfer between the working fluid and the heat reservoirs, heat leak loss between the heat reservoirs and irreversibility inside the cycle. The <b>specific</b> power <b>output</b> is maximized with respect to the cycle temperatures along with the isobaric temperature ratio. The <b>specific</b> power <b>output</b> is found to be a decreasing function of the internal irreversibility parameter and isobaric temperature ratio while there exist the optimal values of the state point temperatures at which the <b>specific</b> power <b>output</b> attains its maximum value for a typical set of operating parameters.

The optimally operating regions of the important parameters in the cycle are determined.

2500|$|In 2010, Yamaha was {{the only}} {{snowmobile}} manufacturer to use four-stroke engines across its range. In Canada though, there are still three models that Yamaha manufactures that are still two-stroke. They are the Bravo, VK 540 and the Venture XL. Yamaha had introduced four-strokes to their line-up in 2003, and the line-up became four-stroke based for model year 2005. The RX-1, released in 2003, was the first performance-oriented four-stroke snowmobile on the market. It was not, however, the first modern four-stroke snowmobile produced.

However, Yamaha received much criticism for its weight disadvantage when compared to similar two-strokes, despite its fuel economy and low-range torque.
