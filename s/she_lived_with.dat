5|$|Born on June 20, 1974, Sharon Collins {{grew up in}} Madison, Wisconsin. Having been {{abandoned}} by her father, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her mother, Doris Collins (Karen Hensel), who was {{confined to a wheelchair}} after chasing a rebellious Sharon years earlier. Sharon became pregnant by high-school boyfriend Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), but gave the child up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{was married}} to Hipparete, the {{daughter}} of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce him because he consorted with courtesans but he dragged her away from her court appearance. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, Alcibiades the Younger. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, {{of which he was}} inordinately vain.|$|E
5|$|In her childhood, {{she would}} ride on horseback {{to visit her}} grandmother, who bought the young girl a {{newspaper}} to read every day and became {{a role model for}} the rest of her life. She began her education at a local one-room school, and gained local attention for her softball skill. In order to attend high school, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her older sister in the neighboring town, where the school was located, and then began to drive every day despite being only 14. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941, aged 16.|$|E

5|$|In the Shatapatha Brahmana, Manu {{performed}} a fire-sacrifice {{in order to}} have children. Idā emerged from the sacrifice. She was claimed by Mitra-Varuna, but <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Manu and together they initiated the race of Manu. In this text, Idā is the goddess of the sacrificial meal. She is described as the Mānavi (daughter of Manu) and Ghṛtapadī (with the ghee-dripping foot) and she is represented by a cow, also known as Idā during a sacrifice. Pururavas is mentioned as the son of Ilā in the text.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{lived in}} Durham {{until the age}} of 16, at which point she moved to New York to finish high school and prepare for college. There <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> the family of her cousin Maude. The family was passing for white in their white neighborhood. Murray's {{presence}} discomfited Maude's neighbors, however, as Murray was more visibly of partial African descent. She nonetheless was graduated with her second high school diploma and honors in 1927, and was able to enroll at Hunter College for two years.|$|E
5|$|Una Aue / Frau Von Üxküll – Una Aue is Maximilien's twin sister. She {{is married}} to the aristocrat Berndt von Üxküll, and {{although}} she appears only briefly in person, she dominates Aue's imagination, particularly his sexual fantasies and hallucinations. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her husband on his estate in Pomerania, but apparently moved to Switzerland with him {{towards the end of}} the war. Like her husband, she is critical of Germany's National Socialist regime which, along with his hatred of their mother and stepfather, and his attraction to her, led to her being estranged from Aue following the war.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} White House, the couple {{returned}} to California, where they purchased {{a home in}} the wealthy East Gate Old Bel Air neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles, dividing their time between Bel Air and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Ronald and Nancy regularly attended the Bel Air Church as well. After leaving Washington, Reagan made numerous public appearances, many on behalf of her husband. She continued to reside at the Bel Air home, where <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her husband until he died on June 5, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Born in Stanford, California, Li {{now lives}} in Redwood Shores. Her father, Warren Li, is a San Francisco Bay Area {{computer}} consultant and stockbroker.

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, who {{was running}} for the United State Senate {{in the spring of}} 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married {{president}} of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E
5|$|In late 1873, Brunner {{suffered}} a paralysis {{of his left}} side which prevented him from working. By mid-April 1874, he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting the provincial government for suitable employment. However, {{on the morning of}} 22 April he {{suffered a}} stroke and died few hours later. His funeral service was held at Nelson Cathedral and was attended by several hundred people. A large Māori contingent, including his long-time friend Kehu, was also present. Brunner was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, who moved to England soon after his death. <b>She</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her brother until her death in 1895. The couple had no children.|$|E

5|$|Jane Williams (née Jane Cleveland; 21 January 1798 8 November 1884) was a British woman {{best known}} for her {{association}} with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Jane was raised in England and India, before marrying a naval officer and settling in London. She soon left him for another military officer, Edward Ellerker Williams. After Edward and she left England for Italy, they became acquainted with Percy and Mary Shelley. Though she never had a romantic relationship with Shelley, {{near the end of his}} life he became deeply infatuated with her and addressed several of his poems to her. After Shelley and Edward Williams perished in a boating accident, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Thomas Jefferson Hogg, also a close friend of Shelley, and had two children with him. The rest of her life was spent as a housewife in London.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient {{historians and}} modern {{scholars}} agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelian's 274 triumph; Zosimus {{was the only}} source {{to say that the}} queen died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable. A public humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion. Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia's beheading; according to the other historians, her life was spared after Aurelian's triumph. The Augustan History recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian's Villa, where <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her children. Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman, and Syncellus that she married a Roman senator. The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Josephus records three {{short-lived}} {{marriages in}} Berenice's life, the first {{which took place}} sometime between 41 and 43, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria. On his early death in 44, {{she was married to}} her father's brother, Herod of Chalcis, with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. After her husband died in 48, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted. According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers. Whether this was based on truth remains unknown. Berenice indeed spent much of her life at the court of Agrippa, and by all accounts shared almost equal power. Popular rumors may also have been fueled by the fact that Agrippa himself never married during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about their {{marriage}} comes from an account Mao gave to the American reporter Edgar Snow in 1936, which Snow included in his book Red Star Over China. According to Mao, he and Luo Yixiu were the subject of an arranged marriage organised by their respective fathers, Mao Yichang and Luo Helou. Luo was eighteen and Mao just fourteen {{years old at the time}} of their betrothal. Although Mao took part in the wedding ceremony, he later stated that he was unhappy with the marriage, never consummating it and refusing to live with his wife. Socially disgraced, <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Mao's parents for two years until she died of dysentery, while he moved out of the village to continue his studies elsewhere, eventually becoming a founding member of the Communist Party of China. Various biographers have suggested that Mao's experience of this marriage affected his later views, leading him to become a critic of arranged marriage and a vocal feminist. He would marry three more times throughout his life, to Yang Kaihui, He Zizhen and Jiang Qing, the last of whom was better known as Madame Mao.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decade the house was {{likely to have been}} let, as Maria Davenport {{preferred}} to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where <b>she</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.|$|E
