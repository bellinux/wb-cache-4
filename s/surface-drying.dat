30|$|Healthy roots {{from wild}} plants of D. officinale were selected, rinsed under tap water, and washed again in sterile {{distilled}} water. Once segmented, they were surface-sterilized by consecutive immersions for 8 to 10  min in 0.1 % HgCl 2, and then rinsed five times with sterile distilled water. After <b>surface-drying,</b> the root segments were aseptically cut into approximately 0.5 - to 1 -cm sections, {{and transferred to}} 9 -cm Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA: 20 % potato, 2 % glucose, and 1.5 % agar). The dishes were incubated in the dark at 25 °C until fungal hyphae emerged from inside the roots. Pure cultures were obtained by transferring the hyphae onto fresh PDA and storing them in PDA slant tubes at 4 °C. In all of these isolates, two fungi (named S 1 and S 3) were found to stimulate the growth of tissue-cultured seedlings of D. officinale through artificial inoculation, so they were selected for further study.|$|E

PC- 02 Submitting for Outstanding Paper Award CompetitionOBJECTIVES: Phytic acid (inositol hexakisphosphate, IP 6) {{effectively}} {{removes the}} smear layer, producing high resin-dentin bond strength. This study aimed at demonstrating {{the effect of}} IP 6 in stabilizing dentin collagen and preventing their collapse induced by strong air-dry. METHODS: Dentin beams were fully demineralized with 1 % IP 6 (pH 1. 2) or 10 % phosphoric acid (PA). The PA-demineralized beams were untreated or treated with 5 % glutaraldehyde (GA) fixation or 1 % IP 6 (pH 7) for 1 h, while IP 6 -demineralized beams underwent no further GA fixation. The beams were subjected to ultimate tensile strength (UTS) testing. For microscopic observation, dentin disks were etched with 1 % IP 6 or 35 % PA. The PA-etched dentin disks were untreated or treated with GA fixation or IP 6 for 1 min, while IP 6 -etched disks were not fixed with GA. The etched surfaces and longitudinal sections were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). For bonding test, flat dentin surfaces etched with IP 6 or PA were blot-dried (mild) or air-dried for 10 s (strong) and bonded with Single Bond Plus (3 M ESPE) followed by composite build-ups for microtensile bond strength (μTBS) testing. RESULTS: The IP 6 -demineralized dentin beams showed significantly higher UTS than PA-demineralized dentin beams. GA and IP 6 significantly improved UTS of PA-demineralized dentin beams. FE-SEM observation revealed that dentin collagen network was preserved by GA and IP 6. For IP 6 -etched dentin, {{there was no significant}} difference in μTBS between mild and strong air-dried groups; whereas, the μTBS of PA-etched strong air-dried group significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: IP 6 showed the same effect as GA to improve UTS of demineralized dentin and to prevent collapse and shrinkage of collagen fibrils. The <b>surface-drying</b> technique, mild or strong, did not influence μTBS when IP 6 was used. IP 6 may not only properly demineralize dentin but also preserve demineralized dentin matrix simultaneously, which should alleviate risk of collagen-collapse induced by strong air-drying...|$|E

The results indicated that about 91. 44 % information could be explained using the previous four PC. The Los Angeles abrasion test (LAAT) and loss of sodium sulfate soundness test (LSSST) mainly contributed to the first PC, meanwhile the saturated <b>surface-dry</b> specific gravity (SSDSG) contributed mainly to the second PC. The significant physical properties of EAF slag including LAAT, LSSST, and SSDSG could be identified according to PCA.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} work accomplished under Project HR- 142 {{during the}} period from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1969. Pore characteristics of six limestones were studied in relation to their absorption of two asphalt cements. Porosity and pore size distribution were determined by a mercury penetration porosimeter and asphalt absorption was determined by immersion and bulk-impregnated specific gravity methods. A special study was conducted to develop new, simple and more reproducible methods for bulk specific gravity determination. As a result, a new chemical indicator method was developed to determine the saturated <b>surface-dry</b> condition, and a glass mercury pycnometer was designed to determine coarse·and fine aggregates. Asphalt absorption history of one asphalt mixture on campus has been studied since September 1968. Chemical and/or radiation treatments of absorptive aggregates were conducted on four chemicals and two aggregates...|$|R

40|$|A native gentian relative, Sebaea ovata, was {{discovered}} in a dry dune hollow at the Whangaehu River mouth near Wanganui, in January 1989 after being "missing " in New Zealand for 17 years. This event has had some media attention through newspaper and TV news items, and is detailed by me in the latest Wellington Botanical Society Bulletin (Ogle 1989). The find has focussed attention on {{the place where it}} occurs. Why should Sebaea remain here after disappearing from a string of locations between Hokianga and Lake Ellesmere over the past 150 years? Since writing up the Sebaea story, I have re-visited the plant's habitat every few weeks, and through winter and spring was impressed by the wetland character of the dune hollows. From January to June the parallel dune hollows (dune slacks) were <b>surface-dry,</b> though they support indigenous and adventive plants that indicate a high water table: Coprosma propinqua, cabbage tree (Cordyline australis), toetoe (Cortaderia toetoe), sand gunnera (Gunnera var.

40|$|Lignin fibers {{typically}} {{influence the}} mixture performance of stone matrix asphalt (SMA), such as strength, stability, durability, noise level, rutting resistance, fatigue life, and water sensitivity. However, limited studies {{were conducted to}} analyze the influence of fibers on the percent voids in mineral aggregate in bituminous mixture (VMA) during the mixture design. This study analyzed the effect of different fibers and fiber contents on the VMA in SMA mixture design. A <b>surface-dry</b> condition method test and Marshall Stability test were applied on the SMA mixture with four different fibers (i. e., flocculent lignin fiber, mineral fiber, polyester fiber, blended fiber). The test {{results indicated that the}} bulk specific gravity of SMA mixtures and asphalt saturation decreased with the increasing fiber content, whilst the percent air voids in bituminous mixtures (VV), Marshall Stability and VMA increased. Mineral fiber had the most obvious impact on the bulk specific gravity of bituminous mixtures, while flocculent lignin fiber had a minimal impact. The mixture with mineral fiber and polyester fiber had significant effects on the volumetric properties, and, consequently, exhibited better VMA over the conventional SMA mixture with lignin fiber. Modified fiber content range was also provided, which will widen the utilization of mineral fiber and polyester fiber in the applications of SMA mixtures. The mixture evaluation suggested no statistically significant difference between lignin fiber and polyester fiber on the stability. The mineral fiber required a much larger fiber content to improve the mixture performance than other fibers. Overall, the results can be a reference to guide SMA mixture design...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} asphalt {{mixtures}} {{is a complex}} phenomenon that involves mechanical, chemical, physical and thermodynamic processes. This damage contributes significantly to the premature deterioration of asphalt pavements, which leads to extra cost in highway maintenance and vehicle operations. One key mechanism of how moisture reaches the asphalt-aggregate interface is by its permeation or diffusion through the asphalt binder or mastic. Different techniques are available for diffusion coefficient measurement {{of a wide variety}} of polymersolvent systems. For the asphalt-water system studied, the focus is on two techniques: (i) Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) -Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) spectrometry and (ii) Gravimetric Sorption Measurements. In the FTIR-ATR experiments, asphalt binders are under investigation. Water shows strong absorption in the infrared region and the FTIR-ATR technique has the ability to monitor both the kinetics of moisture ingress as well as any chemical changes occurring during the test. The changes in concentration can be directly related to change in the absorbance measured during the experiment. The hysteresis of water diffusion in asphalt binders is also monitored through this technique. In the gravimetric sorption experiments, cylindrical Fine Aggregate Mixtures (FAM) were investigated. The gravimetric techniques, which directly follow mass change with time, are among the most used techniques probably because of their simplicity. In this experiment, the Saturated <b>Surface-Dry</b> (SSD) weight of FAM samples at room temperature and at 100 degrees F is monitored until it reaches the equilibrium. The measurements of: (i) water uptake and (ii) the diffusion coefficient were made at both temperatures. A dual mode diffusion model was shown to better represent the diffusion of water through asphalt binders. The rate of moisture diffusion in asphalt binders was proved to be dependent on the history of exposure of the asphalt binder to the moisture. Moisture uptake and diffusivity of water through FAM is dependent on the type of aggregate and asphalt binder used to prepare the FAM...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) {{standard}} specifications require a minimum density {{for the construction}} of dense-graded hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. Currently, the {{standard specifications}} call for density measurements for quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) testing to be made using nuclear density gauges that are calibrated using reference blocks and correlated (adjusted) to densities from pavement cores. QC measurements (performed by the contractor) are verified by QA measurements (performed by ODOT); then ODOT utilizes the contractor’s QC results for determining acceptance of the pavement (in conjunction with other specification criteria). Hence, appropriately accepting an HMA pavement, based on the in-place density criterion, relies on the accuracy of the density measurements. However, density measurement results using nuclear gauges have been observed by ODOT to be questionable on a number of projects, and repeatability and reproducibility with the same gauge and between gauges has been unattainable. The overall objective of the project described herein was to develop a system that accurately quantifies density of dense-graded HMA pavements. More specifically, the objectives were to: 1) investigate the efficacy of the various methods used by ODOT and other agencies for determining in-place HMA density; 2) assess current practices used by ODOT and other agencies for determining in-place HMA density using nuclear gauges; 3) conduct field and laboratory testing and analyses to determine the most accurate and reliable state-of-the-practice means for determining in-place HMA density; 4) provide recommendations for changes to current practices to improve accuracy and reproducibility of in-place HMA density measurements using nuclear gauges; and 5) provide recommendations for alternate means for determining in-place HMA density. To satisfy the first objective, a literature review was conducted and summarized herein. For the second objective, practices employed by ODOT were observed and assessed. For the third objective, state-of-the-practice methods used to measure HMA density (i. e., tests on core samples using the saturated <b>surface-dry</b> and automatic vacuum sealing methods, nuclear density gauge measurements and electromagnetic density gauge measurements) were investigated. Numerous statistical comparisons of the results were made to determine the best combination of measurement methods to ensure accurate assessment of HMA density for a variety of construction scenarios. Finally, the findings from the first three objectives were used to formulate the recommendations identified in the fourth and fifth objectives. Some of the significant findings that are based on the supporting evidence from the research are as follows: 1) Nuclear gauge densities should be adjusted to core densities for future in-place density testing of HMA pavements; 2) Cores should be tested in accordance with CoreLok testing procedure and not by using the SSD methods; 3) Cores should be extracted from the overlapping portion of the footprints of the nuclear gauge measurements; 4) It is sufficient to take two nuclear gauge readings (perpendicular and parallel to the direction of paving) rather than four readings; 5) Under certain conditions, the core adjustment factors obtained from the bottom lift can be used to adjust the nuclear gauge densities on at least the next two overlying lifts of the same pavement; and 6) The electromagnetic gauge adjustment factors could be used on more lifts than nuclear gauge adjustment factors to adjust measurements; and, electromagnetic gauge densities were not significantly different from core densities...|$|R
