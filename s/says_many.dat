Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field <b>says</b> <b>many</b> designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E

The young prince resembled his father, {{particularly}} in his face, hair and eyes. Because of his gender and position as heir apparent, he became the center of attention, particularly for PedroII. A letter written by PedroII to his elder sister MariaII {{a few months after the}} birth of his second child—a daughter named Isabel—displayed his happiness: [...] "No news here save the good state of health of myself, of the empress, and of the little ones, who are becoming increasingly cute, principally little Afonso, who is already walking and who <b>says</b> <b>many</b> words, still half incomprehensible, the which increases their charm." ...|$|E
500|$|Rampersad {{suggests}} that Haley understood autobiographies as [...] "almost fiction". In [...] "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's Malcolm and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America, {{and makes the}} general point that {{the writing of the}} Autobiography is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should [...] "not be held utterly beyond inquiry". To Rampersad, the Autobiography is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. [...] "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know." [...] Rampersad {{suggests that}} since his 1965 assassination, MalcolmX has [...] "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them." [...] Further, Rampersad <b>says,</b> <b>many</b> admirers of MalcolmX perceive [...] "accomplished and admirable" [...] figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. DuBois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, [...] "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of MalcolmX.|$|E

2500|$|In France, {{this concept}} was popularized by Denis Salas, judge and {{university}} fellow, who defines it as a [...] "sympathetic discourse towards the victims", {{which leads to}} a perversion of justice.

He <b>says</b> <b>many</b> new criminal statutes have been passed which can be traced to their impact on public opinion, rather than their actual effectiveness at reducing crime.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1920 the Watch Tower Society has {{required}} all congregation members {{participating in the}} preaching work to turn in written reports {{of the amount of}} their activity, explaining that the reports help the Society to plan its activities and identify areas of greater need and help congregation elders to identify those who may need assistance. In 1943 the Society imposed personal quotas, requiring all active Witnesses to spend at least 60 hours of door-to-door preaching per month, claiming these were [...] "directions from the Lord". Although these quotas were subsequently removed, Raymond Franz claims [...] "invisible" [...] quotas remained, obliging Witnesses to meet certain levels of preaching work to remain in good standing in the congregation or to qualify for eldership. Franz describes repeated urging for adherents to [...] "put kingdom interests first" [...] and devote increasing amounts of time to door-to-door preaching efforts as coercive pressure. He <b>says</b> <b>many</b> Witnesses constantly feel guilty that they are not doing more in [...] "field activity".|$|E

2500|$|Confucius Institutes are {{described}} as transmitting political influence in a [...] "sublimely veiled manner". Canada's Globe and Mail reported, [...] "Despite their neutral scholarly appearance, the new network of Confucius Institutes does have a political agenda." [...] For example, teaching with the simplified Chinese characters used in the PRC rather than the Traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan [...] "would help to advance Beijing’s goal of marginalizing Taiwan {{in the battle for}} global inﬂuence.” An article in China Heritage Quarterly criticizes teaching only simplified characters in the context of Confucius Institutes as [...] "semi-literacy in Chinese". In response to the PRC's CI program, the Republic of China announced plans in 2011 to establish [...] "Taiwan Academies" [...] in America, Europe, and Asia as part of its cultural diplomacy. The Taiwan Academy program is designed to promote [...] "Taiwanese-favored" [...] Mandarin Chinese, traditional Chinese characters, and Taiwanese topics. Marshall Sahlins also makes this claim about simplified characters, which scholars have disputed; George Washington University historian Edward McCord <b>says</b> <b>many</b> Chinese language departments teach simplified characters of their own volition, and Lewis & Clark College anthropologist Jennifer Hubbert says Sahlins overlooked the fact that most trained sinologists can read Chinese in both character sets, and training in one does not preclude access to the other.|$|E

Remember what Poor Richard says: Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries. And again, At a great pennyworth pause awhile. He means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or, the bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he <b>says,</b> <b>Many</b> have been ruined by buying good pennyworths.
