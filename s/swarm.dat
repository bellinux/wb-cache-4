5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a <b>swarm,</b> with the dominant pair at the <b>swarm</b> being the pair which holds the territory that the <b>swarm</b> is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a <b>swarm,</b> the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the <b>swarm,</b> which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko <b>swarm</b> zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake <b>swarm</b> to renew information about the Nazko <b>swarm,</b> collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake <b>swarm.</b> Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko <b>swarm</b> did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} <b>swarm</b> {{began in}} 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a <b>swarm</b> of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko <b>swarm,</b> Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
2500|$|Enthusiasts of <b>swarming</b> {{sometimes}} {{apply it}} to situations that have superficial similarities, but really do not qualify as <b>swarms.</b> While <b>swarms</b> do converge on a target, not every military action, where multiple units attacked from all sides of a target, constitute <b>swarming.</b> [...] Other conflicts, especially historical ones, fit a <b>swarming</b> paradigm, but the commanders involved {{did not use the}} concept. Nevertheless, historical examples help illustrate what modern analysts do and do not consider <b>swarming.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Swarming</b> {{motility}} {{is considered}} to be a social phenomenon that enables groups of bacteria to move coordinately atop solid surfaces. The differentiated <b>swarmer</b> cell population is embedded in an extracellular slime layer, and the phenomenon has previously been linked with biofilm formation and virulence. The gram-negative nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Rhizobium etli CNPAF 512 was previously shown to display <b>swarming</b> behavior on soft agar plates. In a search for novel genetic determinants of <b>swarming,</b> a detailed analysis of the <b>swarming</b> behavior of 700 miniTn 5 mutants of R. etli was performed. Twenty-four mutants defective in <b>swarming</b> or displaying abnormal <b>swarming</b> patterns were identified and could be divided into three groups based on their <b>swarming</b> pattern. Fourteen mutants were completely <b>swarming</b> deficient, five mutants showed an atypical <b>swarming</b> pattern with no completely smooth edge and local extrusions, and five mutants displayed an intermediate <b>swarming</b> phenotype. Sequence analysis of the targeted genes indicated that the mutants were likely affected in quorum-sensing, polysaccharide composition or export, motility, and amino acid and polyamines metabolism. Several of the identified mutants displayed a reduced symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a <b>swarm</b> fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the <b>swarm</b> when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} <b>swarm</b> settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole <b>swarm</b> acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} wosA, a Proteus mirabilis gene identified by {{its ability to}} increase <b>swarming</b> motility when overexpressed. At various times during the <b>swarming</b> cycle, the increased expression of wosA resulted in a 4 - to 16 -fold upregulation of the transcription of flhDC, encoding the master regulator of the flagellar cascade. In turn, the expression of flaA, encoding flagellin, was substantially increased in wosA-overexpressing strains. The overexpression of wosA also resulted in constitutive <b>swarmer</b> cell differentiation in liquid medium, a normally nonpermissive condition. However, in wosA-overexpressing strains, the onset of <b>swarming</b> was not altered. A null wosA allele resulted in a slight decrease in <b>swarming</b> motility. The expression of wosA was growth phase dependent during growth in liquid and on agar plates during <b>swarmer</b> cell differentiation. Increasing the viscosity of liquid medium {{by the addition of}} polyvinylpyrrolidone induced <b>swarmer</b> cell differentiation and resulted in a fourfold increase in wosA transcription. A fliL mutation that results in constitutive <b>swarmer</b> cell elongation also increased wosA transcription. In this study, we discuss the possible role of the wosA gene product in signal transduction from solid surfaces to induce <b>swarmer</b> cell differentiation, possibly via alterations in the motor switch complex. This study also suggests that despite constitutive <b>swarmer</b> cell differentiation in wosA-overexpressing strains, there are additional regulatory and/or environmental conditions that may control the onset of <b>swarming</b> migration...|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko <b>swarm.</b> In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake <b>swarm.</b> Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E

Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to <b>Swarm.</b> <b>Swarm</b> picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle.

40|$|Most marine {{bacteria}} secrete exopolysaccharide (EPS), {{which is}} important for bacterial survival in the marine environment. However, it is still unclear whether the self-secreted EPS is involved in marine bacterial motility. Here we studied the role of EPS in the lateral flagella-driven <b>swarming</b> motility of benthic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM 9913 (SM 9913) by a comparison of wild SM 9913 and ΔepsT, an EPS synthesis defective mutant. Reduction of EPS production in ΔepsT {{did not affect the}} growth rate or the swimming motility, but significantly decreased the <b>swarming</b> motility on a <b>swarming</b> plate, suggesting that the EPS {{may play a role in}} SM 9913 <b>swarming.</b> However, the expression and assembly of lateral flagella in ΔepsT were not affected. Instead, ΔepsT had a different <b>swarming</b> behavior from wild SM 9913. The <b>swarming</b> of ΔepsT did not have an obvious rapid <b>swarming</b> period, and its rate became much lower than that of wild SM 9913 after 35 h incubation. An addition of surfactin or SM 9913 EPS on the surface of the <b>swarming</b> plate could rescue the <b>swarming</b> level. These results indicate that the self-secreted EPS is required for the <b>swarming</b> of SM 9913. This study widens our understanding of the function of the EPS of benthic bacteria...|$|R
