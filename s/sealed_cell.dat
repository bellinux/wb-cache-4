40|$|Background: Marine Brucella spp. {{have been}} {{isolated}} from numerous pinniped and cetacean species, but pathological findings {{in association with}} infection with Brucella pinnipedialis in pinnipeds have been sparse. The capacity of brucellae to survive and replicate within host macrophages underlies their important ability to produce chronic infections, but previous work has shown that B. pinnipedialis spp. are rapidly eliminated from hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) alveolar macrophages. Results: To investigate if multiplication could take place in other hooded <b>seal</b> <b>cell</b> types, primary epithelial cells were isolated, verified to express the epithelial marker cytokeratin and challenged with three different strains of B. pinnipedialis; B. pinnipedialis sp. nov., B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain B 17, and B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain 22 F 1. All strains were steadily eliminated and the amounts of intracellular bacteria were reduced to less than one-third by 48 h post infection. Intracellular presence was verified using immunocytochemistry. Conclusions: So far, intracellular multiplication in <b>seal</b> <b>cells</b> has not been documented for B. pinnipedialis. The lack of intracellular survival in macrophages, {{as well as in}} epithelial cells, together with the fact that pathological changes due to B. pinnipedialis infection is not yet identified in seals, suggests that the bacteria may only cause a mild, acute and transient infection.
