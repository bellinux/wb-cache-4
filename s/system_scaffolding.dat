40|$|Steel {{scaffolds}} collapse {{quite often}} {{in many places}} with {{a considerable number of}} reported casualties, but their behaviour has not been studied to the extent of many other permanent structures. This paper investigates the effect of eccentric loads on steel <b>scaffolding</b> <b>systems</b> used in construction sites. The type of scaffold considered here is the door-shaped steel scaffold with an inner reinforced gable sub-frame. The single-side cross-brace <b>scaffolding</b> <b>systems</b> with various eccentric loads are mainly focused on two issues, namely, the unrestrained boundary and the removal of cross-braces at the access location. This study shows that regardless of the lowest layer of cross-brace in a scaffold being removed or not, the critical load of a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> under an eccentric load is the lowest, whereas that of <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> under a concentric load is the maximum. If the bottom jack base of a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> in construction sites is strengthened to a fixed end, the critical load of this <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> will be greatly increased. If a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> is erected more than 8 stories high, the critical load of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> with the fixed end base can be increased to 2. 4 times that with the hinged base. However, whether the cross-braces at the lowest story of a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> are removed or not, the simulated scaffolding test indicates that the critical load of a used <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> under the eccentric load is the lowest and its load reduction also appears significant.

In turn, allied industries {{face the challenge of}} meeting construction needs for required structures, including product facilities, pipe lines, on/offshore platforms, and marine jetties.

As such, this research project focused on the opportunity for the civil/construction discipline to cooperate with natural gas facility construction, more specifically productivity studies on their scaffolding operations. The productivity study in this paper presents an investigation of the effect of resource configurations on on-site measures during a scaffolding operation on an actual liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant construction, which, in turn, aims for the continuous improvement of relevant worker performance.

In Mega City of Central Gujarat region of India particularly Ahmedabad and Vadodara, a variety of <b>scaffolding</b> <b>systems</b> are available. The bamboo scaffolding is regarded to be the dominant type in the local construction industry over the years chiefly because of its low costs. Local buildings have been constructed with the ever increase in height.

This study aims at investigating the opportunity of <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> and hence determining its success in Mega City of Central Gujarat region of India particularly Ahmedabad and Vadodara.

The steel rebar of grade 3 is used {{in place of the}} patent anchor rod in this study. The results show that the critical load of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> increases by 1. 5 times when anchor rods of a length of 30 cm are used on two sides of each story of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system.</b> The critical load increases by 4 times when the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> has both the anchor rods and plank. The critical load of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system</b> with the anchor rods placed on each story is twice as large as that with anchor rods added every two stories; the failure mode of the system also switches from the in-plane to out-of-plane mode. The 30 -cm-long anchor rod, used in place of a steel bar of grade 3, provides a good lateral restraint to the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, the setup plank can significantly elevate the critical load of the scaffolding system; the critical load increases approximately 1. 5 times under the concentric load, and increases up to 2. 2 times under the TL/ 4 eccentric load, defined as a load applied at a quarter distance from the end.

Scaffolding system is defined as the planning for the design, erection and the inspection of the use and the dismantling of any scaffolding. By law, worker must have safe working environment. And most construction work involves working at heights which cannot be safely or easily reached from the ground or part of the building. The scaffolding design criteria consider the strength; stability; rigidity of the supporting structure and the safety of persons engaged in the erection, alteration and dismantling of the scaffold. When any material is transferred on or to a scaffold it shall be moved or deposited without imposing any violent shock. Scaffold system shall be properly maintained and every part shall be kept so fixed, secured or placed in a position as to prevent, as far as is practicable, accidental displacement. Thus, it must be designed for the most adverse combination of dead loads, live loads, impact loads and environmental loads that can reasonably be expected during the service life of scaffolding.

40|$|Throughout {{recent history}} {{scientists}} {{have struggled to}} elucidate the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that guide the assembly of macromolecular structures. The early models of "sub-assembly" or "self assembly" attempted to explain how individual components could interact in a precisely regulated manner to form higher-ordered complex biological structures. Subsequent studies, using viral systems as assembly models, demonstrated how protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions assist in lowering the thermodynamic barriers that typically disfavor assembly. Due to their simplicity, viruses provide an ideal system to investigate the biophysical mechanisms that drive the assembly of complex biological structures. Proper virion assembly requires numerous macromolecular interactions that proceed along an ordered morphogenetic pathway.
