50|$|ABG Shipyard {{builds a}} range of {{commercial}} vessels. These include self-loading and self-discharging bulk carriers, container ships, floating cranes, <b>split</b> <b>barges,</b> anchor handling tugs, dynamic positioning ships, offshore supply vessels and diving support vessels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>barges</b> {{serve the}} same purpose, {{but instead of}} a door in the hull's bottom, the hull of the whole <b>barge</b> <b>splits</b> {{longitudinally}} between the end bulkheads. The vessel consists of two major parts (port and starboard halves), both are mostly symmetrical in design. Both parts of the vessel are hinged at the deck and operated by hydraulic cylinders. When the vessel splits the load is dumped rapidly, which means the barge {{has to be very}} stable in order not to capsize or otherwise get damaged.|$|R
50|$|Jan De Nul has a {{fleet of}} 75 vessels, {{including}} 14 cutter suction dredgers, 28 trailing suction hopper dredgers, 20 <b>split</b> <b>barges,</b> 6 backhoe dredgers, 1 oil recovery vessel, 5 rock installation vessels and one cable installation vessel under construction. This includes the Cristobal Colon, launched in 2008, and the world's largest dredger with a capacity of 46,000 m³. It can dredge to a water depth of 155m. Joined by her near-sister ship Leiv Eiriksson in 2010, Jan De Nul {{has one of the}} world's largest, if not the largest, fleets of hopper dredgers.|$|R
40|$|A <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge</b> is a {{dredging}} {{vessel that}} can split over its longitudinal axis to discharge its cargo. To allow {{for such an}} operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges {{at the top and}} hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the workability limits of <b>split</b> hopper <b>barges</b> in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated {{to determine the effects of}} roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge.</b> From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a closed <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge</b> and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the workability limits of the <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge</b> is drawn. For the barge carrying a solid cargo only one resonance frequency is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two resonance frequencies. As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3 -hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the workability limits of the <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge</b> in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo...|$|R
50|$|When the ship’s width {{is greater}} than the {{combined}} effective length of two air bags, or for special ship such as catamaran HSC or <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge,</b> the two lines arrangement shall be selected.

50|$|With {{the formal}} {{delivery}} on 31 March 2010, DEME completed the widening and deepening {{works in the}} port of Durban, South Africa that had begun in mid-2007. The existing northern breakwater was demolished and rebuilt; the existing southern breakwater was strengthened; the port entrance channel was widened from 120m to 220m; and deepened from 12.8m to 19m in the outer channel and 17m in the inner port. A {{total of more than}} 10 million m3 of material was dredged, part of which was used for the foundation and reinforcement of the breakwaters. Apart from the mega-dipper Pinocchio and two <b>split</b> <b>barges,</b> DEME assigned the trailing suction hopper dredgers Marieke, Krankeloon, Orwell and Pallieter to the €220 million project. DEME was the managing partner in a consortium that included South African civilian contractor Group Five.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the Narrowneck or Gold Coast Reef in August 1999. This {{structure}} was much larger (70,000 m3) in size and scope than the Cable Station Reef. The reef was designed primarily as a shoreline stabilization structure with a secondary purpose as a surfing structure; as such {{it was the first}} true 'multipurpose reef' structure. The reef was built as part of the Gold Coast City Council's 'Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy' which included a large volume of beach nourishment to be placed on the beach in addition to the construction of the reef. The Gold Coast Reef was built from large, sand-filled geotextile containers ('sandbags') which were dropped into position from a <b>split</b> hull <b>barge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{the voyage}} {{got off to}} a bad start. After {{repeatedly}} <b>splitting</b> sails, the <b>barge</b> was sent back to Wager Island, where there were additional stores. Two midshipmen, John Byron and Alexander Campbell, formed part of the nine who returned. Once back at Wager Island, they were greeted by Captain Cheap, who was delighted to hear of their wish to remain with him. By the time Bulkley sailed back to Wager Island in search of the now missing barge and men, all had disappeared.|$|R
25|$|Lytham Pier is {{a former}} pier in the seaside town of Lytham, Lancashire, England. Having opened in 1865 as both a {{pleasure}} pier and a working pier despite reservations from local residents, the pier underwent several renovations during the 1890s-1900s prior to being badly damaged by a storm in 1903, involving two <b>barges</b> <b>splitting</b> the pier into two. A considerably worse disaster occurred in 1928, when a fire caused extensive damage to the pavilion which was not rebuilt, although the pier did reopen several months later. Following a period of decline and closure to the public shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the pier was ultimately demolished in 1960, despite thousands of signatures from local residents opposed to the demolition.|$|R
40|$|A barge is {{a vessel}} which is {{designed}} to transport very heavy loads. Barge sterns therefore have steep inclination angles which will yield a large displacement and hence maximize the cargo capacity. In this thesis the barge stern of the <b>split</b> hopper <b>barge</b> D 14 design made by Fartygskonstruktioner AB has been analysed using SHIPFLOW, a CFD software. It is of interest to investigate how the inclination angle affects the resistance of the barge. Since this analysis will focus on the stern, the flow right behind the hull is of importance. Considering that, a zonal approach was chosen for the CFD computations. This approach uses viscous flow computations (or RANS computations) to solve the wake flow at the stern. Two different conditions of the barge have been analysed, a fully loaded condition and a ballast condition. When the barge is fully loaded there is no trim while at ballast condition there is a large trim. As a first step in the analysis computations were run on the initial hull design and the results where then verified with existing results from a resistance test made on a model of the full scale barge. When accurate results had been achieved for the initial stern the analysis continued with computations run on modified sterns where the inclination angle was systematically changed. Unfortunately the analysis could not be completed for ballast condition since a bug in SHIPFLOW was revealed {{and it turned out that}} largely trimmed conditions could not be handled by the software. For the analysis of modified sterns, computations were run on two sterns with a steeper inclination than for the initial stern and two sterns with lesser inclination. The outcome of the computations was that in the speed interval from 9 to 12 knots the initial hull has the lowest total resistance when comparing to the modified sterns, but at speeds lower than 9 knots the steepest inclination resulted in the lowest total resistance...|$|R
