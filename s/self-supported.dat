40|$|MA (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 A notable paucity in {{practice}} interventions and literature currently exists {{in regard to}} <b>self-support</b> in first-time mothers. Recent literature and practice interventions seem to focus largely on social support resources, highlighting the deficiency {{in the investigation of}} <b>self-support</b> in first-time mothers as an integral and holistic concept and/or focus point for intervention. Literature continues to illustrate the many challenges first-time mothers encounter and therefore this study focuses on <b>self-support</b> experiences of the first-time mother in relation to her environment by providing an original stance of enquiry. The investigator aimed to explore and describe the experiences of <b>self-support</b> in first-time mothers in the Cape Metropole. The study was conducted qualitatively and according to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) research design. This provided the researcher with a dual method of investigation: The first undertaking was to describe actual accounts of the participants‟ <b>self-support</b> experiences, while the second was to give an interpretation of these accounts which would reflect their experiences in an understandable, yet authentic manner. The meta-theoretical framework of Gestalt Therapy Theory (GTT) was applied due to its holistic and integrative nature, while the additional theoretical frameworks of Self Determination Theory (SDT) and Positive Psychology (PP) served as contributors to deepen understanding. The sample consisted of thirteen first-time mothers from moderately diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The study succeeded in giving in-depth exploratory descriptions of their <b>self-support</b> experiences during {{the first two years of}} motherhood. Findings displayed that the participants‟ <b>self-support</b> cannot be separated from their constantly shifting environments and that <b>self-support</b> is an integrated and dynamic process of development. Internal elements as well as environmental factors prove to disrupt this process of <b>self-support</b> development. Vital components for developing <b>self-support</b> were assuming responsibility for own well-being as a mother; as well as arriving at insight. Joy and gratefulness as experienced by the participants were proven to serve as motivators to sustain <b>self-support.</b> The study further exhibits that a supportive relationship is able to exist between the first-time mother‟s <b>self-support</b> and her environment when she is able to effectively identify, reach out and utilise social support resources available in her environment. <b>Self-support</b> serves as an experiential process (as an alternative to a fixed outcome) where the first-time mother is able, through experience, to mature and become more self-supportive. Findings argue that ideal <b>self-support</b> during novel motherhood is the capability to be in a mature interactive relationship with the environment, constantly adapting according to the organisation of the environmental field.

60|$|In one of {{the most}} secluded {{portions}} of the valley, within a stone’s cast of Fayaway’s lake—for so I christened the scene of our island yachting—and hard by a growth of palms, which stood ranged in order along both banks of the stream, waving their green arms as if to do honour to its passage, was the mausoleum of a deceased warrior-chief. Like all the other edifices of any note, it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones, which, being of unusual height, was a conspicuous object from a distance. A light thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves hung over it like a <b>self-supported</b> canopy; for it was not until you came very near that you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboo, rising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man. A clear area of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi, and was enclosed by four trunks of cocoa-nut trees, resting at the angles on massive blocks of stone. The place was sacred. The sign of the inscrutable Taboo was seen, {{in the shape of a}} mystic roll of white tappa, suspended by a twisted cord of the same material from the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure.(3) The sanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated. The stillness of the grave was there, and the calm solitude around was beautiful and touching. The soft shadows of those lofty palm trees—I can see them now—hanging over the little temple, as if to keep out the intrusive sun.|$|E
60|$|The {{opening on}} the side of Ullswater Vale, down which this Stream flows, is adorned with fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, that agreeably unite with the {{transverse}} views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind, will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfalls to a silent Tarn in the recesses of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the solitary angler. It also derives a melancholy interest from the fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished some years ago, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months, <b>self-supported,</b> and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master. But to return to the road in the main Vale of Ullswater.--At the head of the Lake (being now in Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck: this would conduct through a woody steep, where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies, up to the level area of the Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for foot-travellers, and along which a horse may be led to Grasmere. A sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending the bed of this valley, and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn. Having retraced the banks of the Stream to Patterdale, and pursued the road up the main Dale, the next considerable stream would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct to Deep-dale, the character of which Valley may be conjectured from its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss, with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it, by the west wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of Brotherswater and passed Hartsop Hall, a Stream soon after issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never explored by Travellers; but, from these sylvan and rocky recesses, whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of Brotherswater, or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of Dove Crag, &c., will be equally pleased with the beauty, the grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery.|$|E

The generative approach intends to build a notion of desirable and possible future, by means of dialogic strategies. These dialogues strengthen community ties, show new action strategies and stimulate metaphors in relation to violent affectation amid the conflict. The research sample was formed by 11 people divided into two groups, residents {{in the city of}} Bucaramanga, Colombia. The advantaged actions inside the <b>self-support</b> groups were the identification of the discursive links among the participants, the clarification of the thematic nodes among them, the selection of metaphors and the transformation of narratives. The results point out that the intervention generated the observation and identification of resources, action planning, search of new experiences, reflexivity, and recognition of the novelty to transform conflict affectation. It is concluded that through <b>self-support</b> groups, people transform the meaning of their experience by sharing stories and action resources for the future, which verifies the purposes of the generative approach. The psychologist was a facilitator of the process amid the relevance of languageas a means of transformation.

The study sample comprised 282, 103 sickness benefit spells exceeding four weeks. The intervention group with 110, 291 spells received the intervention, and the control group with 171, 812 spells received ordinary sickness benefit case management. Using register data, we fitted Cox proportional hazard ratio models, estimating hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI). Results We found no joint effect of the intervention on the sickness benefit duration (HR 1. 02, CI 0. 97 – 1. 07) or the duration until <b>self-support</b> (HR 0. 99, CI 0. 96 – 1. 02).
