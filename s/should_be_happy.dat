I have suffered much lately but you again encourage me.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|The prime universe's Peter succumbs to {{his illness}} and dies, and Walter {{and his wife}} Elizabeth (Orla Brady) mourn their loss, {{supported}} by Walter and William's friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and Walter's lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong). Walter, through his window, shows Elizabeth the other Peter, and asserts they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> knowing another Peter exists. Later, Walter watches Walternate explore other cures. Walternate is distracted {{by the arrival of}} an Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), and fails to see the telltale color change indicating a cure. Walter is able to recreate and stabilize Walternate's cure, and then decides to use untested equipment to cross over to give the cure to Peter. Carla tries to stop Walter, knowing the technology could damage the fabric of space-time, and contacts Nina for help. Separately, September informs his fellow Observers that he may have made a mistake and assures them he will correct it.|$|E

25|$|La Réunion capitulates {{almost without}} loss after a landing by Army troops joined by sepoys under the British East India Company, {{all under the}} active and decisive Lieutenant Colonel Harry Keating, with ships of the convoy {{on both sides of}} the island. Their path is eased by Maturin's {{propaganda}} and political meetings to explain why the locals <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> to accept the British, with Farquhar as interim Governor. Mauritius proves more challenging. Maturin has an accident boarding HMS Néréide, which is part of the force sent to Île de la Passe. He is seriously injured, so he observes Clonfert during this recuperation aboard. The action is successful. Maturin is put down on Mauritius to continue his work. A small group of ships, under the command of Captain Pym, puts soldiers on Mauritius to staff the fort. The French appear with three ships Bellone, Minerve, Victor and two Indiamen Ceylon and Windham. They boldly attack the fort and then sail into the port; the British are caught unprepared but decide to attack. The struggle goes on for days with heavy casualties and in the end two British ships run aground. Sirius and Magicienne are burnt to prevent their capture, and Iphigenia and the fort at Île de la Passe are abandoned to be retaken by the French. Néréide is taken and Clonfert is severely wounded in the neck and head by a splinter. A messenger vessel, with Maturin aboard, reaches La Réunion to inform Aubrey of the losses and the failed attack on Port Southeast.|$|E
500|$|According to Boyd, Harrison's {{mother was}} {{particularly}} supportive: [...] "All she wanted {{for her children}} is that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music." [...] An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, [...] "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to {{the baby in the}} womb." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Ray of Light" [...] {{has been}} {{featured}} in the set lists of three Madonna tours– 2001's Drowned World Tour, 2006's Confessions Tour and 2008–09's Sticky & Sweet Tour. In February 1998 she premiered [...] "Ray of Light" [...] during her surprise concert at the Roxy NYC nightclub for promoting the parent album. Three months later she appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and performed [...] "Ray of Light" [...] and [...] "Little Star" [...] from the same album. During the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards Madonna started performing [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", sporting black hair and wearing an Indian sari. Lenny Kravitz then appeared playing the guitar, which paved way to [...] "Ray of Light". A religious group called the World Vaishnava Association (WVA) claimed that Madonna offended Hindus with the performance by wearing Hinduism symbols on her head. A spokesperson for the association stated that the mark (called an Om) {{is a symbol of}} chastity, harmony and purity, and is designed to show [...] "dedication to God". The representative also said that because Madonna simulated a sexual act and wore a see-through tank top onstage while wearing the mark, she offended both Hindus and Yogis. A spokesperson for Madonna stated that the singer did not understand why WVA was upset as she had not done anything insulting, and did not wish to insult anyone. However, the vice president of WVA [...] claimed that [...] "the Hindu community and Eastern spiritual seekers the world over <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> for Madonna personally in terms of her genuine interest in enlightened life, and grateful to her for her sincere efforts to attract others to the same".|$|E

The other reason is that readers may take this as a confirmation that all analysis can do is to convince patients that their defects or 'immoralities' do not matter and that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with them. That would be unfortunate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Fairly OddParents, Cosmo {{has been}} known to sink the Lost City of Atlantis nine times and was known as [...] "The Accursed One". When Timmy Turner, as a merperson with the powers of Wet Willie (an Aquaman parody superhero), Cosmo, and Wanda explore underwater, they come upon Atlantis where its people are now merpeople and when Cosmo is spotted, their leader King Greg plans to {{sentence}} Cosmo to be eaten by one of the Kraken that Atlantis owns. After showing King Greg the reasons they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> underwater (the Wet Willie movie film persuaded him), Cosmo is no longer [...] "The Accursed One". Unfortunately, a giant squid that Timmy tried to call to prove to the Atlanteans it existed had appeared and demolished Atlantis causing the Atlanteans to target Timmy ("The New Accursed One") now and the group escapes with some fish to [...] "Clevelandlantis".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
