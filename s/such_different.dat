5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among <b>such</b> <b>different</b> species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from <b>such</b> <b>different</b> sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from <b>such</b> <b>different</b> musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E

25|$|Origins for the {{earliest}} constellations likely {{goes back to}} prehistory, whose now unknown creators collectively used them to related important stories of either their beliefs, experiences, creation or mythology. As <b>such,</b> <b>different</b> cultures and countries often adopted their own set of constellations outlines, some that persisted into the early 20th Century. Adoption of numerous constellations have significantly changed throughout the centuries. Many have varied in size or shape, while some became popular then dropped into obscurity. Others were traditionally used only by various cultures or single nations.|$|E
25|$|Faraday's law {{describes}} {{two different}} phenomena: the motional EMF {{generated by a}} magnetic force on a moving wire (see Lorentz force), and the transformer EMF generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation). James Clerk Maxwell {{drew attention to the}} separate physical phenomena in 1861. This is believed to be a unique example in physics of where such a fundamental law is invoked to explain two <b>such</b> <b>different</b> phenomena.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{instruments}} of the lute-family (among <b>such</b> <b>different</b> instruments like the mandolin and the sitar) the player makes the sound by picking the strings with a plectrum (pick). The Arabian {{term for the}} pick is reesha, which originally was made of a pinfeather of an eagle. One impressive aspect of Bashir was the precision of his risha. His style emphasized a clean risha, while most other oud players have a heavy risha. The reesha is held {{in the palm of}} one's hand, resulting in a difficultly learnable picking technique; furthermore the doubled strings have a less controllable attack than single strings.|$|E

A defense could request a lesser-charge instruction later in the trial as the facts became clearer, yet a prosecution making the same motion could well fail on the grounds that the defendant had not received sufficient prior notice such as is usually given in the indictment. Yet, the judge observed, there was no language in Rule 31(c) that would support <b>such</b> <b>different</b> treatment.|$|E

500|$|The single-reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 27, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, theaters {{are known to have}} shown the film in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Indiana, and South Dakota. The film received positive reviews from trade publications including The Moving Picture World, which praised the acting and the execution of the film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was less enthusiastic, writing that [...] "The production gave a very praiseworthy portrayal of the period, but a moving picture needs <b>such</b> <b>different</b> treatment from a novel that its interpretation in a picture is bound to lose much of the original interest. The acting was in every way adequate, although not great." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise <b>such</b> <b>different</b> American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
