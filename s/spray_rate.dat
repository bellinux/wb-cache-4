Regression analysis showed that a <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) reduced PM 10 concentrations by 44 % and PM 10 emissions by 48 %. At 24 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1), the reduction was 82 % for PM 10 concentrations and 87 % for PM 10 emissions. For PM 2. 5, the lowest <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) was sufficient to reduce concentrations by 68 % and emissions by 84 %. The reduction achieved at higher <b>spraying</b> <b>rates</b> was not significantly greater. Emissions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 increased exponentially with {{the age of the}} broilers.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} Taguchi Method in optimizing coating hardness in a tangential fluidized bed coater using modified biopolymer. During the coating process, granular ureas collide among themselves and the wall surface at high velocity. This led to excessive attrition and likely to break the granular ureas into smaller sizes. Hence, hardness is the critical properties during operations such as packaging and stacking.

RESULTS: A gene encoding a glyphosate-tolerant EPSP synthase (aroA(1398)) from bacterial strain ATX 1398 was cloned and characterized. The protein is initiated at a GTG translational start codon {{to produce a}} protein that provides robust glyphosate resistance in Escherichia coli (Mig) Cast & Chalm. The aroA(1398) protein was expressed and purified from E. coli, and key kinetic values were determined (K(i) = 161 microM; K(m) (PEP) = 11. 3 microM; k(cat) = 28. 3 s(- 1)). The full-length enzyme is 800 -fold more resistant to glyphosate than the maize EPSP synthase while retaining high affinity for the substrate phosphoenol pyruvate.

40|$|AbstractFluidized bed spray {{granulation}} is {{an important}} process for the transformation of liquids into solid materials. Especially product properties like final particle size {{and structure of the}} granules are important. These properties are closely related to the selected process parameters such as temperature and <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> By knowing the relationship between the thermal process conditions and resulting particle structure, the final product can be designed according to the wishes of the consumers. In the presented work, a correlation between the thermal process conditions and the achieved shell porosity, which is relevant for the particle structure, is revealed. Therefore two experimental series with different materials (non-porous glass particles and porous alumina) were performed in a lab-scale fluidized bed spray granulator. The lab-plant allows the precise measurement of the inlet and outlet temperatures and moisture contents of the gas. All process parameters were kept constant except the inlet gas temperature and the <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> Although the amount of initial material as well as the amount of injected solution was the same for all experiments, the final particle size distribution and the structure of the formed shell were clearly different. The obtained experimental results were compared with a process model including a new expression for the growth kinetics, which takes into account an acceleration of the growth velocity due to the formation of a porous structure. The used model also considers the separation of the fluidized bed into two different zones, namely the spraying zone and the drying zone. With the given initial process conditions, the model calculates the time evolution of the particle size distribution, the theoretical outlet temperature and the moisture content of the gas. The introduction of the shell porosity into the growth kinetics reduces the underestimation of the particle size in the model, which occurs if the formed layer on the particle surface is assumed to be compact...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} manufacturing conditions and polymer ratio on water permeability and morphology of free-films. A novel spray method for producing ethyl cellulose (EC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) free-films was developed where several process parameters was controlled. The process was optimised by pre-spraying solvent until the system reached a steady-state temperature. This minimised the variation of outlet air temperature to < 2. 5 °C. Coating time was approximately 4 minutes excluding drying. Free-films were produced using 94 wt% solvent (95 %-ethanol) and 6 wt% polymer. The amount of HPC in the films was varied (wt% HPC defined as HPC/(HPC+EC) * 100). Films with 30 - 40 - 50 - 57 wt% HPC were studied. Phase diagrams was constructed to study the phase transformation of polymer mixtures. Results show that all polymer mixtures with HPC content above 30 wt% were phase separated prior to film manufacturing. Temperature {{had an effect on}} the polymer phase transformation. In the phase diagram, the 2 -phase area was larger for temperatures above 40 °C. The investigated manufacturing conditions were outlet air temperature (°C) and <b>spray</b> <b>rate</b> (g/min). Outlet air temperature was controlled by adjusting the inlet air temperature. The films were characterized by measuring water permeability (m 2 /s). Cross section structure of the films was analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). FITC-HPC was added for enhanced contrast between the domains. Higher outlet air temperature gave higher water permeability of the film whereas higher <b>spray</b> <b>rate</b> gave lower water permeability. The outlet air temperature had an impact on evaporation rate. The evaporation rate together with <b>spray</b> <b>rate</b> affected the solidification and hence the structure of the film. Images show that longer solidification time smeared the domains into larger domains. Lower water permeability was caused by less connectivity between the pores.

Further tests showed that coats formed at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the mass transfer of coats and dissolution of tablet core surfaces by the coating material.

40|$|Abstract]: Over {{the last}} decade, traffic volumes, tyre pressures, wheel loads and the {{percentage}} of heavy vehicles using the Australian road network has increased significantly. This has led to increased challenges for road designers to provide economical and durable pavement surfaces with adequate surface texture. A particular solution for improving surface texture on spray sealed surfaces is transverse variable <b>spray</b> <b>rates</b> (TVSR). In this technique bitumen spray-rates are varied across the lane width to account for the impact of traffic in the wheel-paths. This leads to designs where higher binder application rates are used on the shoulders and between the wheel-paths and lower rates in the wheel-paths. An extensive literature review has revealed very little quantitative data has been analysed to verify the technique is beneficial in providing roads with improved and more uniform surface texture. Undesirable surface texture issues generally consist of flushing or bleeding of bitumen in the wheel-paths, and stripping of aggregate between the wheel-paths and on the shoulders. The Queensland Department of Main Roads collects annual survey data of their road network, including surface macro-texture data. This project aims to retrieve and compare survey data over a number of years, and collate it with other relevant data to verify if TVSR technology has provided an improvement in surface texture characteristics. Carefully selected road sections were studied to identify the effect of the TVSR technology when compared with similar areas sprayed with uniform single spray-rates. The study concluded that transverse variable <b>spray</b> <b>rates</b> were successful in increasing the transverse surface macro-texture uniformity of the analysed sections, and when used in conjunction with polymer modified binders, the surface macro-texture depth in the wheel-paths was increased also. Due to the limited scope of the study, further analysis would be required to verify the results across a wider area. ...|$|R

The optimum conditions for the obtaining of optically clear, compact and adherent CuS thin films, showing different colors in reflected light (violet, yellow, brawn, green) and exhibiting in VIS and NIR light appropriate reflectance and transmittance for utilization for solar control applications were established. The film thickness falls in the range 10 - 50 nm...|$|R
30|$|In wire flame spraying, {{the main}} purpose of flame is to melt the {{feedstock}} material which is then driven with the stream of atomized air onto the workpiece [84]. The <b>spray</b> <b>rates</b> are generally in the range of 0.5 – 9  kg/h. Again, the material such as zinc and tin alloys which have lower melting point sprays at much higher rates. Substrate temperature varies from 95 to 205  °C because of the extra energy input essential for flame melting. Less than 10 % of the input energy is actually used to melt the feedstock material in most of the thermal spray processes. The spraying cost is low and the particle velocity is from 50 to 100  m/s. The efficiency of spray is quite low due to overspray and other losses. With this technique, coatings with high porosity are obtained [85].|$|R
40|$|Strategies to {{eradicate}} the vector-borne infectious diseases (e. g. malaria and Japanese encephalitis) are often directed at controlling vectors with insecticides. Spraying insecticide, however, opens {{the way for the}} development of insecticide resistance in vectors, which may lead to the failure of disease control. In this paper, we examine whether the combined use of insecticide spray and zooprophylaxis can limit the development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Zooprophylaxis refers to the control of vector-borne diseases by attracting vectors to domestic animals in which the pathogen cannot amplify (a dead-end host). The human malaria parasite Plasmodium spp. has a closed transmission cycle between humans and mosquitoes, and hence cattle can serve as a dead-end host. Our model reveals that, by a suitable choice of insecticide <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> and cattle density and location, malaria can, in some situations, be controlled without mosquitoes developing insecticide resistance...|$|R
