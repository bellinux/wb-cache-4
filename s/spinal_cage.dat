40|$|Anterior corpectomy and {{reconstruction}} using a plate with locking screws are standard {{procedures for the}} treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Although adding more screws to the construct will normally result in improved fixation stability, several issues need to be considered. Past reports have suggested that increasing the number of screws can result in the increase in spinal rigidity, decreased spine mobility, loss of bone and, possibly, screw loosening. In order to overcome this, options to have constrained, semi-constrained or hybrid screw and plate systems were later introduced. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the stability achieved by four and two screws using different plate systems after one-level corpectomy with placement of cage. A three-dimensional finite-element model of an intact C 1 -C 7 segment was developed from computer tomography data sets, including the cortical bone, soft tissue and simulated corpectomy fusion at C 4 -C 5. A <b>spinal</b> <b>cage</b> and an anterior cervical plate with different numbers of screws and plate systems were constructed to a fit one-level corpectomy of C 5. Moment load of 1. 0 N m was applied to the superior surface of C 1, with C 7 was fixed in all degrees of freedom. The kinematic stability of a two-screw plate was found to be statistically equivalent to a four-screw plate for one-level corpectomy. Thus, it can be a better option of fusion and infers comparable stability after one-level anterior cervical corpectomy, instead of a four-screw plate...|$|E
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{recently}} attracts {{many applications}} in orthopaedics such as intervertebral spacer, <b>spinal</b> <b>cage</b> and prosthesis. However, literatures suggest {{this material is}} bio-inert in nature. Its inferior bioactivity may lead to poor bone-implant interaction. Some researchers incorporated hydroxyapatite or tri-calcium phosphate in PEEK to enhance its bioactivity. Mechanical properties such as elasticity and fatigue may, however, alter as material micro-structure has been changed. To avoid it, surface modification is therefore an alternative. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of bioactivity enhancement of PEEK using an advance surface technique named plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). PEEK discs were polished and undertaken PIII treatment with plasma sources such as water, ammonia and strontium at 15 kV at 50 Hz for 2 hours. Afterwards, surface morphology, roughness, elemental chemical profile, chemical bonding and hydrophilicity were examined by SEM, AFM, XPS, FT-IR, and contact angle measurement respectively. Bioactivity was evaluated by simulated body fluid immersion test at day 21 and cytotoxicity was assessed by MC 3 T 3 E 1 cell culturing at day 2 and 5. The surface roughness slightly decreases after water and ammonium PIII, whereas it increases after strontium PIII. The surface contact angle of the treated samples reduces, but surface energy increases. Literatures suggested these changes favour cell attachment and proliferation. In our cell culture experiment, cells have attached more on the treated surfaces. All these results preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of PIII treatment to enhance bioactivity of PEEK.

40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose Thoracoscopic-assisted ventral {{stabilisation}} for thoracolumbar fractures {{has been}} shown to be associated with decreased recovery time and less morbidity when compared with open procedures. However, there are a limited number of studies evaluating late clinical and radiological results after thoracoscopic spinal surgery. Methods We performed an analysis of the late outcomes of thoracolumbar fractures after minimally invasive thoracoscopic ventral instrumentation. Between August 2003 and December 2008, 70 patients with thoracolumbar fractures (T 5 -L 2) underwent ventral thoracoscopic stabilisation. Tricortical bone grafts, anterior plating systems (MACS-System), and cage implants were used for stabilisation. Outcomes measured include radiologic images (superior inferior endplate angle), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), VAS Spine Score, quality of life scores SF- 36 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results Forty seven patients (67 %, 47 out of 70) were recruited for the follow up evaluation (2. 2 ± 1. 5 years). Lower VAS Spine scores were calculated in patients with intra- or postoperative complications (44. 7 (± 16. 7) vs. 65. 8 (± 24. 5), p= 0. 0447). There was no difference in outcome between patients treated with bone graft vs. cage implants. Loss of correction was observed in both bone graft and titanium cage groups. Interpretation The present study demonstrates diminished long-term quality of life in patients treated with thoracoscopic ventral spine when compared with the outcome of german reference population. In contrast to the other patients, those patients without intra-operative or post-operative complications were associated with improved outcome.

Powder 1 was in size range of between 45 - 150. m and Powder 2 in size range of between 30 - 90. m. The foams were sintered under argon atmosphere in a tightly enclosed tube furnace. The resulting cellular structure of the foams showed bimodal pore size distribution, comprising macro pores (300 - 500. m) and micro pores (1 - 30. m). Compression tests of foam samples have shown that increasing sintering temperature or decreasing porosity increased the elastic modulus, yield and compressive strength and failure strain. The improvement in the mechanical properties of foams prepared using smaller size Ti 6 Al 4 V powder with bimodal particle distribution were attributed to the increased number of sintering necks and contact areas between the particles.

40|$|Introduction Lumbar interbody fusion using cages {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} treatment options for degenerative spinal diseases. Currently, many cage designs are available in the market; however none of them is completely successful, as reflected by non-union rates ranging from 7 to 30 %. Cages are made of very different materials (e. g. metals, polymers) and they present a large range of morphological configurations (e. g. solid, ring), leading to distinct mechanical conditions within the fusion region. Mechanical conditions are known to largely influence bone regeneration [Klein, 2003] in long bones, however their role on spinal fusion remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how the local mechanical conditions (strains, stress, fluid flow) created by different cage designs might influence bone tissue formation during the spinal fusion process. Methods We developed an iterative computer model to simulate the time course of tissue formation during spinal fusion. The model included the vertebral bodies, the intervertebral space and a <b>spinal</b> <b>cage</b> (Fig. 1). In each time step, tissue formation was regulated by the local mechanical conditions [Prendergast, 1997] within the regenerating region, determined using finite element techniques. The temporal and spatial evolution of tissue formation was investigated for two different cage designs (a solid and a ring cage) and two different levels of stiffness: 1 (soft) and 100 (stiff) GPa. Results Bone formation and maturation started in the most inner region of the intervertebral space and extended over time to the outer region, forming a defined callus shape (Fig. 1 a). Model predictions showed a strong influence of cage stiffness and configuration on the fusion outcome (Fig 1 b-e). A softer cage showed a more favourable mechanical stimulation for the regeneration of bone, leading to higher amounts of bone tissue formation. For the stiffer cage, better fusion outcome was predicted with a centered solid cage compared to a ring cage (Fig. 1 c & e). Stress shielding was observed in the central hollow region of the ring cage, which was more pronounced for the stiffer cage (Fig. 1 c). Discussion Mechanical conditions have an influence on bone regeneration. We investigated the effect of the mechanical environment created by different cage designs on the fusion outcome. We observed that cage design, both morphology and material properties, play a key role in the mechanical conditions within the fusion region and therefore the time course of the fusion process. In the future such understanding may be used to optimize the design of spinal fusion implants to guide and foster bone formation and inter-body fusion.

40|$|Polylactides are {{commonly}} praised for their excellent mechanical properties (e. g. a high modulus and yield strength).

Models with between zero and ten side holes were developed. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to simulate compression of the cage, made from the polymer PEEK (polyetherether-ketone), between two adjacent vertebrae. The analyses were validated by experimental tests. In all of the models, the von Mises stress was highest at the cage–vertebrae interface with peak stresses of between 14 and 18 MPa. Increasing the Young’s modulus of the vertebrae from 12 to 30 GPa increased the peak stress on average by 29 per cent. The stresses in the models were lower than the compressive strength of PEEK (118 MPa), and are well within the PEEK fatigue strength reported (60 MPa at 10 million cycles). This study suggests that the number of side holes had a negligible effect on the stress distribution within the cage; the stress magnitudes were fairly constant across all of the models and did not change substantially with the number of holes. Hence, a cervical cage with side holes is unlikely to fail in compression...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> fusion <b>cages</b> {{are used}} to aid spinal fusion where the joint between the {{vertebrae}} is fused by bone graft. The design and material of these cages are of great importance to the fusion process. Methods such as screw fixation are sometimes used to secure these cages in vivo. However, access to the cage screw holes is partially obscured by the vertebral bodies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of side-holes {{on the design of}} a cage, assess the feasibility of a bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material and develop an instrument to aid screw access to the cage screw holes. Computer models of cages with between 0 and 10 side-holes were produced to model compression between adjacent vertebrae. The bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material was analysed using a range of Young’s modulus values for the composite. The results suggested that the number of side-holes had a negligible effect on the stress distribution within the cage and the bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cervical cage material is unlikely to fail in static compression. A cutter instrument was developed in compliance with regulatory standards. It neatly removed the targeted vertebral edge adjacent to the cage screw holes allowing screw insertion...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Seventy {{patients}} (average age, 13. 8 years) with adolescent idiopathic right thoracic scoliosis had full {{assessment of}} pulmonary functions and radiographic evaluation of <b>spinal</b> and thoracic <b>cage</b> deformities and their flexibilities. Objectives. To determine how measurements of <b>spinal</b> and thoracic <b>cage</b> deformities related to pulmonary function. Summary of Background Data. Pulmonary functions {{have been evaluated}} in relation to lateral curvature of the spine {{in most of the}} published studies. Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity. There is a need to evaluate these changes in pulmonary functions, reflecting not only spinal curvature but also rotational deformity, thoracic cage deformity, and their flexibilities. Methods. Radiographic measurements obtained from anteroposterior and lateral standing and anteroposterior supine bending radiographs included lateral curvature, vertebral rotation, kyphosis, maximum sternovertebral distance, and apical rib-vertebral angles. Using previous measurements, the flexibility of the curve, vertebral rotation, and rib-vertebral angle were calculated. A pulmonary function assessment was performed using a computerized pulmonary function system (5000 V; Gould, Dayton, Ohio). We analyzed pulmonary functions in relation to deformity. Results. Measurements reflecting spinal deformities obtained from anteroposterior radiographs, such as Cobb angle, vertebral rotation, and vertebral rotation flexibility, were significantly correlated with the percent of predicted values of vital capacity and forced vital capacity, whereas kyphosis measured from lateral radiographs was significantly correlated with absolute values of residual volume, total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and forced expiratory flow from 25 - 75 % of the forced vital capacity (FEF 25 - 75). Of the measurements reflecting thoracic cage deformity obtained from anteroposterior radiographs, rib-vertebral angle asymmetry (measured from supine bending radiographs) showed significant correlation with the percent of predicted values of vital capacity, forced vital capacity, and functional residual capacity, whereas the sternovertebral distance that was measured from lateral radiographs correlated significantly with absolute values of vital capacity, total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and FEF 25 - 75. Conclusions. Deformities in coronal and transverse plane influence changes in pulmonary functions expressed as the percent of predicted values, whereas sagittal plane deformities influence mainly those absolute volumes in which residual volume is a component. It is suggested that rotational flexibility combined with other deformities could be evaluated in future studies on prediction of pulmonary function from the measurements of the deformity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{computational}} design framework {{was developed}} and demonstrated for hierarchical scaffold mechanical, mass transport and degradation properties. As a composite, multiscale structure, the tissue engineering scaffold should be designed to match tissue specific requirements such as tissue elastic modulus and diffusivity/permeability, for better tissue regeneration. In addition to these functional properties, {{the design of the}} tissue engineering scaffolds should include the time dependent change of the functions along with material degradation and erosion. With the aid of multiscale homogenization method and topology optimization technique, scaffold microstructures were designed and applied to the design of biodegradable <b>spinal</b> fusion <b>cages.</b> The degradation characteristics by the presence of microstructures were addressed using multiscale homogenization model of diffusion reaction system. The mechanical properties (bulk modulus) of the topology optimized microstructures range from 10 % to 37 % of base material property, whereas the mass transport properties (diffusivity) range from 12 % to 41 % of free diffusivity. The designed properties were optimal within known cross-property bounds connecting diffusivity and bulk modulus. Mechanical compression test confirmed the good correlation between the designed and experimentally measured Young’s moduli. As a clinical application, the topology optimization technique was adapted to the design of biodegradable fusion cages with the integrated global-local topology optimization. The mechanical strength of the fusion cage made of PCL was demonstrated to support physiological loads at human lumbar spine. Degradation of the porous scaffolds was characterized using a multiscale homogenization technique, demonstrating the effect of the release profiles of acidic products from polymer hydrolysis at local microstructure scale on the release at the global scaffold scale. The precise characterization and controlled design and fabrication within same theoretical framework will provide the basis of a consistent knowledge regarding the correlation between scaffold design parameters and the tissue regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), {{which has}} biomechanical {{performance}} {{similar to that}} of human cancellous bone, is used widely as a spinal implant material. However, its bioinertness and hydrophobic surface properties result in poor osseointegration. This study applies a novel modification method, arc ion plating (AIP), that produces a highly osteoblast compatible titanium dioxide (TiO 2) coatings on a PEEK substrate. This PEEK with TiO 2 coating (TiO 2 /PEEK) was implanted into the femurs of New Zealand white male rabbits to evaluate its in vivo performance by the push-out test and histological observation. Analytical results show that AIP can prepare TiO 2 coatings on bullet-shaped PEEK substrates as implant materials. After prolonged implantation in rabbits, no signs of inflammation existed. Newly regenerated bone formed more prominently with the TiO 2 /PEEK implant by histological observation. The shear strength of the bone/implant interface increases as implantation period increases. Most importantly, bone bonding performance of the TiO 2 /PEEK implant was superior to that of bare PEEK. The rutile-TiO 2 coatings achieved better osseointegration than the anatase-TiO 2 coatings. Therefore, AIP-TiO 2 can serve as a novel surface modification method on PEEK for <b>spinal</b> interbody fusion <b>cages...</b>|$|R
