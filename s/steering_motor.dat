50|$|A {{hydraulic}} power steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than {{hydraulic power}} steering, since the electric power <b>steering</b> <b>motor</b> only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of {{hydraulic power steering}} fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Synchro drive uses chain {{sprocket}} mechanism to drive three wheels at vertex of triangular chaises and has limited load bearing capacities due to asymmetry. The driving and <b>steering</b> <b>motors</b> fixed {{near to the}} vertex of the triangular chassis and wear in chains {{over a period of}} time results in increased dead reckoning. The concept of simple pivot based mobile platform using two drives overcasts a conventional synchro drive omnidirectional mobile platform in many aspects. This mobile platform has symmetric chassis with six wheels that makes platform stable irrespective of any configuration. Gear trains to steer the four corner wheels in tandem with pivot wheel adds omnidirectional feature along with increased load bearing capacities and reduced dead reckoning.

40|$|The {{omni-directional}} {{vehicle is}} an innovative vehicle, {{in which the}} in-wheel <b>steering</b> <b>motor</b> and in-wheel driving motor are integrated into each wheel of the vehicle so that each wheel can be independently controlled to have traction, braking, and turning motions to improve the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s mobility, handling and stability. To realize good performance, various control strategies have been proposed, like the active steering control and the direct yaw moment control, where the accurate slip angle information is critical to these control strategies. However, in practice, the side slip angle is hard or expensive to be measured for a passenger vehicle, therefore, different estimation methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, a novel side slip angle estimation method is proposed for the omni-directional vehicle that has four independent steering motors. This method includes the estimation of total alignment torque and side slip angle, and only needs the measurements of steering angles and <b>steering</b> <b>motor</b> currents, which are available by using angle sensors and current sensors embedded with the in-wheel steering motors.

50|$|To help an AGV {{navigate}} it can use {{three different}} steer control systems. The differential speed control {{is the most}} common. In this method there are two independent drive wheels.

More often than not, this is seen on an AGV that is used to transport and turn in tight spaces or when the AGV is working near machines. This setup for the wheels is not used in towing applications because the AGV would cause the trailer to jackknife when it turned.|$|R
