5|$|At {{that point}} in the investigation, the crash was {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} caused by faulty wiring in the cockpit after the entertainment system started to overheat. Certain groups issued Aviation <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendations.</b> The TSB released its preliminary report on 30 August 2000 and the final report in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> {{related to}} {{locating}} aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

50|$|In a {{preliminary}} investigation {{report of the}} engine failure of Qantas Flight QF32, released 3 December 2010, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined safety actions taken already, including the issuing of a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> about potential engine problems with the Trent 900. The <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> relates to a possible manufacturing issue with a misaligned counterbore in some pressured oil pipes, {{which could lead to}} fatigue cracking, oil leakage, oil fire, and engine failure.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> A-83-71, which {{asked the}} FAA {{to require the}} {{installation}} of automatic fire extinguishers adjacent to and in lavatory waste receptacles; ...|$|R
25|$|The AAIB {{made three}} <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> to UK and European {{regulators}} {{based on the}} findings of their investigation of this accident. They are quoted below.|$|E
25|$|The RSSB report made {{recommendations}} including improving emergency {{communications at}} the level crossing and moving a set of points whose position {{was a factor in}} the train's derailment. Network Rail implemented all the <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} and subsequent investigation prompted {{the release of}} NTSB <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendations</b> A-80-59 and A-80-60. The recommendations required explicit published runway approach procedures for airport approaches involving sidesteps; and distribution of documentation of sidestep approach procedures in general.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June the AIBN {{released}} an update to the preliminary investigation report including an urgent <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to the European Aviation <b>Safety</b> Agency. The <b>recommendation</b> {{was based on}} metallurgical examinations where signs of fatigue {{in parts of the}} second stage planet gear were found.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{preventative}} <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation,</b> aside from simply ensuring maintained {{control of the}} wheel while the vehicle is in motion, is the installation of an automatic kill switch.|$|R
25|$|Exxon Shipping Company {{failed to}} {{supervise}} the master and provide a rested and sufficient crew for Exxon Valdez. The NTSB found this was widespread throughout the industry, prompting a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to Exxon and to the industry.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued fifteen <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations,</b> mostly {{covering}} fuel tank and wiring-related issues.

25|$|The Department for Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{investigated}} the accident, with the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Boeing and Rolls-Royce also participating. The investigation {{took two years}} to complete, and the AAIB published its final report on 9 February 2010. Three preliminary reports and eighteen <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> were issued {{during the course of}} the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{the need}} to issue <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> 2008-009, {{affecting}} all 777 airframes which had yet to incorporate the Boeing Service Bulletin (SB 777-28-0025) – {{as was the case}} with G-YMMM – was given as the main reason for issuing the first special bulletin, well before the accident investigation itself was complete.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 June 2005, a light {{aircraft}} safely landed on taxiway 'T' after its pilot had mistaken it for runway 36R. Following that incident, a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> was issued. It suggested {{the use of}} different numbers to help differentiate between runways. This change was enacted {{at the beginning of}} July 2007, when 18R/36L became 17/35 and 18L/36R became 18/36.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950, as {{a direct}} result of the inquiry, the Department of Local Government issued a forty-seven-page fire <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> {{entitled}} Fire Protection Standards for Public Buildings and Institutions.

25|$|On 28 January 2014, the AAIU {{released}} its final {{report on the}} accident. The report confirmed details previously released in the two interim statements published in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The final report, 244 pages long, comprised 54 findings (detailed in the final report), a probable cause, 9 contributing factors and 11 <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> – all detailed in sections below.|$|E
25|$|The FAA {{began an}} {{aggressive}} safety evaluation in July 2005. The evaluation is performing a detailed review of accidents, incidents, airworthiness directives, service difficulty reports, <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> and safety reports. It also is examining pilot training requirements, {{the history of}} the aircraft's commercial operators and possible engine problems. The goal is to identify the root causes of MU-2 accidents and incidents and determine what, if any, additional safety actions are needed.|$|E
25|$|The Taylor Report {{had a deep}} {{impact on}} safety {{standards}} for stadiums in the UK. Perimeter and lateral fencing was removed and many top stadiums were converted to all-seated. Purpose-built stadiums for Premier League and most Football League teams since the report are all-seater. Chester City F.C.'s Deva Stadium was the first English football stadium to fulfil the <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> of the Taylor Report, with Millwall F.C.'s The Den being the first new stadium to be built that fulfilled the recommendations.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2012, the TAIC {{released}} an urgent <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> after investigators found apparent anomalies {{in the maintenance}} of the crash balloon. The recommendation to the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that they urgently check the maintenance practices and airworthiness, especially in relation to the inspection of burners, fuel systems and envelopes, and maintenance record-keeping, of the other 74 hot air balloons registered in New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1996, the NTSB {{issued a}} formal <b>Safety</b> <b>Recommendation</b> (A-96-120), which {{requested}} the FAA to require all airlines to provide simulator training for flight crews, which would {{enable them to}} recognize and recover from [...] "unusual attitudes and upset maneuvers, including upsets that occur while the aircraft is being controlled by automatic flight control systems, and unusual attitudes that result from flight control malfunctions and uncommanded flight control surface movements." ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 7, 2011, the NTSB {{issued a}} <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> {{based on the}} results of its {{investigation}} into the crash of Flight 331. [...] The NTSB recommended that the FAA take actions to ensure adequate pilot training in simulator training programs on tailwind approaches and landings, particularly on wet or contaminated runways, and revise its advisories on runway overrun prevention to include a discussion of risks associated with tailwind landings.|$|R
25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The left outboard engine lost power, and shortly afterwards the right outboard engine also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} into the {{accident}} was released in October 2010, concluding {{that the cause of}} the crash was attempting the landing approach in conditions worse than the meteorological minima of the airfield, the aircraft, and the commander. The crew failed to make a timely decision to go-around. They descended below the established minimum safe altitude in the absence of reliable visual contact with runway or approach lights, which led to a collision of the aircraft with trees and terrain. The MAK commented that had the recommendations following the crash of UTair Flight 471 been implemented, the accident may have been prevented. A total of 19 <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> were made.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the pilot and passengers had become incapacitated and had been suffering from hypoxia, a lack of oxygen to the body, meaning the pilot would {{have been unable to}} operate the aircraft. Towards the end of the flight, the left engine began to be starved of fuel and the aircraft crashed into the ground. The accident report said that, due to extensive damage to the aircraft, investigators were unable to conclude if any of the eight aboard had used the oxygen system. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) final report could not determine what incapacitated the occupants. A number of <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> were made following the accident.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> 2006-101 (regarding {{shoulder}} harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air transport community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all commercial air transport aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring shoulder harnesses as described in the AAIB's <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> 2006-101 became law for commercial air transport operators in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Scientific {{research}} has shown that the mattress influences SIDS outcomes; a firm, clean and well-fitting mattress lowers SIDS risk. However, neither mattress materialsnor using a second-hand mattressaffect SIDS risk. It is common to place a waterproof membrane between the mattress and the bedding to prevent uncontained bed wetting from damaging the mattress. Bed sheets ought to fit the mattress tightly so that the child cannot become entangled and suffocate; a common <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> is to short sheet the bed.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{were also}} carried out {{that showed that}} aircrew could have {{difficulty}} recognising that incorrect data had been entered in avionic equipment resulting in poor take-off performance. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has issued a <b>safety</b> <b>recommendation</b> to the United States Federal Aviation Administration and a safety advisory notice to the International Air Transport Association and the Flight Safety Foundation. In addition Airbus are investigating the development of software to help pilots recognise unusual or poor performance on take-off.|$|R
500|$|The Rail Accident Investigation Branch {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the incident, which it called a [...] "dangerous occurrence". One aspect of the investigation was whether the seals on the TPWS equipment were already broken before the train departed from Bristol, or were not in place at the time. In March 2016, the RAIB published an update on their investigation. The final report was released in May 2016. Five <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> were made and one learning point was identified.|$|E

[...] Under CAP, the local jurisdictions will fund capital projects (through {{the sale of}} municipal bonds) with matching funds provided by the federal government. CAP projects include purchasing new rail cars, rehabilitating three rail lines, replacing three bus garages, implementation of NTSB <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> and purchasing new track maintenance equipment and overhauling Metrorail station elevators and escalators.|$|E
500|$|On {{completing}} this work, Feynman {{was sent}} to the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project had its uranium enrichment facilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents could be avoided, especially when enriched uranium came into contact with water, which acted as a neutron moderator. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they would realize the dangers. He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of <b>safety</b> <b>recommendations</b> for the various grades of enrichments. He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos [...] "could not be responsible for their safety otherwise".|$|E
