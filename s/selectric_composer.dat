50|$|Thomas W. Phinney II, {{program manager}} for fonts at Adobe Systems, responded to Glennon's {{statement}} {{by saying that the}} memos could not have been produced with either the IBM Executive or IBM <b>Selectric</b> <b>Composer,</b> which had been suggested as possibilities, due to differences in letter width and spacing. Phinney says that each time a typeface was redeveloped for mechanical technologies with different width factors, the width and designs are altered, which is why even if Press Roman had been intended to look like Times Roman, the result is significantly different.|$|E
5000|$|Frutiger (with Howard [...] "Bud" [...] Kettler) adapted Univers for the IBM <b>S{{electric}}</b> <b>Composer</b> in the 1960s. This was an ultra-premium electric 'golfball' typewriter system, {{intended to}} be used for producing high-quality office documents or copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects. Unlike most typewriters, the Composer produced proportional type, rather than monospaced letters. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers. The release was somewhat compromised due having to be made to fit a 9-unit escapement system.|$|E

50|$|Offset {{lithography}} {{allows the}} bright and dark areas {{of an image}} (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press. This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed. Type could be set with a typewriter, or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine. The IBM <b>Selectric</b> <b>Composer,</b> for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including proportional fonts), and with text justification. With photoengraving and halftone, physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, {{rather than relying on}} hand-made engravings.|$|E
5000|$|The MT/ ST was {{followed}} by the Magnetic Tape <b>Selectric</b> <b>Composer,</b> which differed only in output device, and for which it served as input. (Tapes prepared or edited on the MT/ST could be played back on the MT/SC.) Thus automated line justification, with three type sizes (10, 12, and 15 characters per inch), bold, italic, and a variety of type styles (implemented using type [...] "balls" [...] {{similar to those of the}} Selectric typewriter) were made available within the budget of a medium-sized office or publisher. When printing a document, the machine would pause printing at the stop code and wait for an operator to change the Selectric type ball and press a button telling the device to continue.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, a [...] "Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer" [...] appeared, and in 1978, a [...] "Magnetic Card Selectric Composer."

50|$|As Phinney explained, the letterspacing of the Times New Roman font used by Microsoft Word with {{a modern}} {{personal}} computer and printer employs {{a system of}} 18 units relative to the letter height (em), with common characters being 5 to 17 units wide. (The technology allows even finer variability of character widths, but the 18 unit system was chosen for compatibility with the Linotype phototypesetting and earlier hot-metal versions of the font.) In contrast, the variability of character widths available on early 1970s typewriters using proportional letterspacing was more limited, due to the mechanical technology employed. The most sophisticated of these machines, the IBM <b>Selectric</b> <b>Composer,</b> used a system of 9 units relative to the letter height, in which all characters were 3 to 9 units wide. Less complex machines used fewer widths.|$|E
