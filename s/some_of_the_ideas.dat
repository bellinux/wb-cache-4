5|$|For {{the design}} of the Festspielhaus, Wagner {{appropriated}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich. Wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at Bayreuth; these include darkening the auditorium during performances, and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience.|$|E
5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of the prominent naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She {{was sent to}} reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|The expeditions and {{the making}} of the {{attraction}} were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery's cable television channels in April 2006. The first was Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands, broadcast on the Travel Channel on April 9 to coincide with the attraction's grand opening. The second, Building A Thrill Ride: Expedition Everest, was aired on April 10 and detailed the planning and construction of the ride, along with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> that made it possible. (During construction, for example, instead of traditional scaffolding the Imagineers used interior poles that poked through the outside of the mountain and were connected by wooden platforms.) This documentary also featured survival tips from Les Stroud. The third, , was broadcast on Animal Planet on April 15 and featured American animal and nature conservationist Jeff Corwin.|$|E

This was ultimately shelved because the band were unable to obtain formal permission from Holst's estate, although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a concept album dealing with the solar system could {{be seen on the}} band's 1973 album Solar Fire.|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> {{outlined in the}} Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of}} the war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E

Kelly liked <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but changed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others. The story involved a shadowy organisation called The Network, and Kelly initially came out with an <b>idea</b> that <b>The</b> Network might {{be responsible for the}} rise in conspiracy theories because they thought it would {{be the best way to}} hide an actual conspiracy. Kelly said he doesn't believe in conspiracy theories, but is fascinated by them. The series took about two years to come to fruition.|$|R

25|$|The basic script, {{although}} many scenes were improvised, {{was written by}} Johannes Grenzfurthner and Roland Gratzer {{in a couple of}} days in November 2013, based on their theatre performance Campaign (Volkstheater, 2006). <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> were brainstromed at a coffee shop in Vienna with the entire production crew. The film contains dialogues in English, German, a variety of slangs, dialects, accents, and fictitious languages. Subtitles are an integral part of the story.|$|E
25|$|Hardy's first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, {{finished}} by 1867, {{failed to find}} a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, George Meredith, who felt that The Poor Man and the Lady would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice {{and he did not}} try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> in his later work.|$|E
25|$|The project allowed Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis {{to explore}} {{some aspects of}} the {{original}} films that they otherwise {{had not been able to}} in the past, such as the history of the Librarian ghost, and pursue <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> left out of the original script, including the appearance of Ivo Shandor as Gozer, who was intended to appear in the finale of the film as the ghost of a man in a business suit. Other concepts used in the game, such as the alternate dimensions that open up during the latter half of the game, are based on the original Ghostbusters 3 concept Hellbent which was in development hell during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the people}} in these {{countries}} have become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{first began}} {{plans for a}} sequel to his 1986 hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera, in 1990. Following a {{conversation}} with Maria Björnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected this when he saw a TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The ancient period {{introduced}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> {{that led}} to integral calculus, but {{does not seem to}} have developed these ideas in a rigorous and systematic way. Calculations of volume and area, one goal of integral calculus, can be found in the Egyptian Moscow papyrus (13th dynasty, BC), but the formulas are simple instructions, with no indication as to method, and some of them lack major components. From the age of Greek mathematics, Eudoxus (BC) used the method of exhaustion, which foreshadows the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and volumes, while Archimedes (BC) developed this idea further, inventing heuristics which resemble the methods of integral calculus. The method of exhaustion was later discovered independently in China by Liu Hui in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle. In the 5th century AD, Zu Gengzhi, son of Zu Chongzhi, established a method that would later be called Cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere.|$|E

25|$|Star Fox {{has become}} a Nintendo franchise, with five more games and {{numerous}} appearances by its characters in other Nintendo games such as the Super Smash Bros. series. A sequel titled Star Fox 2 was developed but never released for the Super NES, although programmer Dylan Cuthbert says that the game was actually completely finished. Although Star Fox 2 was never released, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> and gameplay were salvaged for 1997's Star Fox 64 (released in Europe under the title Lylat Wars) for Nintendo 64. Eventually, a handful of ROM dumps of Star Fox 2 at various stages of its development were leaked onto the internet, and a fan-made translation of Star Fox 2 from Japanese to English was released {{in the form of}} a patch that could be applied to one of the ROM dumps. A finalized version of the game, obtained from a complete ROM located in Nintendo archives, was released on the Super NES Classic Edition on September 29, 2017. However, players are required to complete the first stage of the first game to 'unlock' it.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E
