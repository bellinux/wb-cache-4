The 5 to 7 <b>S</b> T antigen <b>form</b> bound more efficiently and tightly to DNA and had specific affinity for sequences at the viral origin of replication, whereas the 16 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> bound less efficiently to DNA and exhibited very little specificity for origin-containing DNA sequences.

The 6. 5 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> is solubilized by bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from intact schistosomula. It is thus located on the outer surface of the schistosomal tegument and is most probably analogous to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored G(2) form of acetylcholinesterase found in the electric organ of Torpedo, on the surface of mammalian erythrocytes, and elsewhere. Both forms are fully solubilized by the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100. Upon passing such a detergent extract over a heparin-Sepharose column, only the 8 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> was retained on the column. The bound acetylcholinesterase could be progressively eluted by increasing the salt concentration, with approx. 0. 5 - 0. 6 M NaCl being needed for complete elution.

40|$|The binding protein for 15 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25 -OH-D 3) was {{isolated}} from chick serum. The molecular weight was 60, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, without {{the existence of}} sub-units. Its sedimentation coefficient was 4. 3 S. The isoelectric points of the major and minor components were 6. 1 and 5. 9, respectively. Addition of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 causes an anodal shift in the isoelectric point of the two forms of the binding protein. Heating at 60 degrees C slowly destroys the binding protein but the addition of vitamin D metabolites increases its thermostability. The binding protein has probably a single binding site for all vitamin D metabolites and its association constant for 25 -OH-D 3 at 4 degrees C and pH 7. 4 is 10 (9) M- 1. The same affinity is found for 24, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 but 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 have a 3 - and 10 -fold lower affinity, respectively. The amino acid composition {{is very similar to}} that of the human and rat binding protein. The concentration of chick 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein was higher in egg-laying hens (10 microM) than in immature hens (4 microM) or immature or adult roosters (4 microM). Chick plasma contains virtually only a 4 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> of the 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein but partially hemolyzed chick serum also contains a 6 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> Addition of pure actin to chick plasma or serum converts all 4 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> to the 6 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> The serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein is thus heterogenous since it exists in two 4 <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> (with different pI) and a 6 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> (complexed with actin).

Adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were followed with an automated drop tensiometer (ADT) and ellipsometer. The changes in surface concentration, surface pressure, dilational modulus and layer thickness were determined. At acidic pH where glycinin is in the 3 S/ 7 <b>S</b> <b>form,</b> it adsorbs much faster at the air/water interface giving a higher surface concentration and a higher dilational modulus than at pH 6. 7 (where glycinin is in the 11 <b>S</b> <b>form).</b> Surface shear viscosity measurements showed that after short ageing times glycinin gives a protein network that is much more resistant to deformation in shear at pH 3 than at pH 6. 7. After ageing for 24 h, the surface shear viscosity {{is about the same}} at both pH. Foaming experiments failed to give a glycinin stabilised foam at pH 6. 7 while at pH 3 glycinin behaves as a good foaming agent. All results indicate that changing the pH influences the conformation of glycinin and that this has a great impact on the interfacial rheological properties and foaming properties.

(Diptera: Culicidae), its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms,</b> and Anopheles arabiensis among and within larval breeding habitats in Banambani, Mali were investigated under varying conditions of {{water quality and}} rainfall. The intent was to elucidate on niche partitioning of these taxa. Methods Immatures of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae s. s., and its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> were sampled every alternate day for a month in mid-rainy season from three sampling sites {{in each of the}} larval breeding habitats (rock pools, swamp, and puddles). Water quality was characterized by alkalinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (D. O.), nitrate, orthophosphate, pH, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity. A type 3 analysis of the GENMOD model was used to examine the {{associations between}} the proportional frequencies of young (first and second instar larvae) and old (third and fourth instar larvae and pupae) or total immatures of species or forms among sampling sites within and among larval breeding habitats during a category of rainfall as influenced by water quality. Results Of the 4, 174 immatures sampled, 1, 300 were molecularly identified to species and forms. Significant association between the proportional frequencies of young larvae of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae s. s., its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> was found among sampling sites within habitats but not among larval breeding habitats. The proportional frequencies of young larvae of M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> varied daily perhaps due to recruitment, mortality, and dispersal within habitats. Conductivity and TDS had significant effects when the proportional frequencies of young larvae of M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> among sampling sites within habitats were significantly associated. Alkalinity, D. O., orthophosphate, pH, nitrate, temperature and turbidity had no effects on niche partitioning of species and forms among sampling sites within habitats. Rainfall did not affect the frequencies of these immatures.

The affinities of the three forms for SV 40 DNA and for a synthetic 19 -base-pair sequence from binding site I are very similar (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD], 0. 3 to 0. 4 nM). The specific activity of DNA binding was greatest for the 5 S and 7 S subclasses and least for the 14 S subclass. Moreover, the specific activity of the 5 S and 7 S subclasses increased sharply at about 40 h after infection, whereas the activity of the 14 S subclass was maintained at a constant low level throughout infection.

We had shown that arylsulfatase C actually consists of two biochemically distinct isozymes, s and f. Only the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> has steroid sulfatase activity. The f and <b>s</b> <b>forms</b> were thought to be related through posttranslational or posttranscriptional modification of the same gene product. In part consistent with this hypothesis, we now report that in a panel of 28 rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, expression of both s and f was concordant only with the human X chromosome, thus showing that the f form is also X linked. In three separate somatic hybrids containing human X chromosomes in an inactive state, the f form was still expressed. Thus, similar to the <b>s</b> <b>form,</b> the f form also escapes from X inactivation. However, contrary to expectations, the <b>s</b> and f <b>forms</b> were not related by posttranslational modification of the same gene product. A full-length cDNA for the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> failed to hybridize to transcripts produced from an f-expressing cell line, showing that there is little sequence identity between the two. They are also not related by differential splicing of a common primary transcript, since fibroblasts from some patients with steroid sulfatase deficiency due to gene deletion of the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> continue to express the f form. Therefore, although the f and s isozymes of arylsulfatase C are X linked and escape from X inactivation, they are products from separate genes, thus providing a unique isoenzyme system to study possible gene duplication and regulation in the part of the human X chromosome that escapes inactivation...|$|R

Monkey cells infected with a tsA mutant of simian virus 40 at 41 degrees C contained only 5 to 6 S large T antigen, implying that this form is not active in the initiation of simian virus 40 DNA replication. In pulse-chase, shift-down experiments, DNA replication resumed, and the 5 to 6 S large T antigen which had accumulated at 41 degrees C was partially converted at 33 degrees C to a fast-sedimenting form. However, shift-up experiments demonstrated that the fast-sedimenting large T antigen, once formed, remained stable at 41 degrees C, although it was unable to function in initiation.
