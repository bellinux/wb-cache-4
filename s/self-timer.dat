25|$|In 1984 the Zenit-automat entered production. This had a Pentax K mount (which was {{proposed}} as an open standard by Pentax and distributed freely) and a focal shutter with horizontal-travel cloth curtains. The only operation mode was aperture-priority. The camera was modified in 1988, to include shutter FZL-84 with vertical-travel metal curtains, and was reissued as the Zenit-AM. The Zenit-AM2 was a cheaper {{version of the}} AM without the <b>self-timer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>self-timer</b> on the OM2S was electronic. On {{activation}} {{the mirror}} would lock-up until exposure. If cancelled {{at any point}} the shutter would complete the exposure. The <b>self-timer</b> switch, placed where the previous-generation models had a mechanical <b>self-timer</b> arm, permitted the battery check/self-timer beep to be silenced.|$|E
5000|$|A unique 'two shot' <b>self-timer.</b> This {{allowed a}} second shot {{to be taken}} by the <b>self-timer</b> a couple of seconds after the first, giving a more 'relaxed' and unposed picture.|$|E
40|$|Nas últimas décadas têm-se feito várias tentativas em conceptualizar a Natureza,num esforço por enfrentar a nossa condição sócio-ecológica. Tentando fixar umsentido para o conceito, várias áreas do saber têm vindo a concordar com teoriasfalaciosas que culminam em acções em nome do ambiente, mas que mais nãovisam que o lucro, a ilusão da salvação social, ou a fantasia de alcançar, com novastécnicas e tecnologias, uma Natureza sustentável, que na sua suposta basefundacional, espera apenas a nossa salvação. O que aparenta ser Uma VerdadeInconveniente 1 revela-se antes uma falácia, muitas vezes conveniente para os quebuscam numa errónea interpretação do conceito o aval para aplicar políticas emedidas que, em regra, se benefícios trazem, mais não são que aos próprios,favorecendo a polarização da nossa condição social, e induzindo a sociedade emfalsas ideias de sustentabilidade, que parecem assim garantir, por si só, que oambiente é levado a sério, e evitam formular a pergunta sensível e vital acerca dotipo de soluções que desejamos e de que forma desejamos alcançá-las. Como reflexo, de forma simplista, mas ideologicamente poderosa, o Verdeenquanto conceito passou a representar a sustentabilidade, tornando-se a suaencarnação no Mundo Moderno. Edifícios cobertos de tecnologia, painéis solares,temporizadores ou simplesmente vegetação ou materiais reciclados ou ditosnaturais entraram na arquitectura legitimados em campos de saber extrínsecos àmesma, tornando-se o grande entrave à solução que assumem (masaparentemente não pretendem) ser. No verde, tudo parece calmo e harmonioso,mas há algo de inquietante [...] . de podre [...] . é a mentira comum, o crime perfeito [...] . toda a gente sabe que não pode ser assim tão bom, que a solução não pode ser tãofácil, mas para quê preocuparmo-nos? Ele vende, e há que chegue para todos. 2 Neste trabalho exploraremos a expressão desta arquitectura esverdeada,perpetrando as suas origens, motivações e consequências, de forma a perceber quetipo de legitimidade lhe podemos realmente, se é que podemos, de todo,reconhecer. Fá-lo-emos sem renunciar ao espírito crítico que entende a relaçãoentre o Homem e a Natureza como indissociável, heterogénea e imprevisível, eportanto, acima de tudo, um momento político e socialmente complexo. In {{the last}} few decades many {{attempts}} to conceptualize Nature have been made,in an effort to face our social and ecological condition. Trying to establish a sensefor the concept, many different disciplines have been agreeing with some fonnytheories, ending in interventions {{in the name of the}} environment, but whichpursuit only the profit, the ilusion of social salvation, or the fantasy to reach,through new techniques and technologies, a sustainable Nature, which, in itssupposed foundational principles, is only awaiting our salvation. That whichseems to be Un Inconvenient Truth reveals itself as a lie, often convenient forthose who seek in a false interpretation of the concept the reason to dictatepolitics and measures which, in general, if they are to be profiting, it is only forthose who apply them, inducing society into a polarized situation and into falseideas of sustainability, those of which seem to assure by themselves that theenvironmental issue is taken serious, and those of which avoid us to ask the vitaland sensitive question about the kind of solutions we really wish to achieve, andthe best way to achieve them. As a consequence, in a simplistic but ideologically powerfull way, the concept ofGreen has become to represent sustainability, becoming its incarnation in theModern World. Buildings fullfilled with technology, solar panels, <b>self-timers</b> orsimply vegetation or recicled materials, so called natural ones, have been invadingthe architectonic field, backed up by concepts which are exogenous to thediscipline's field of knowledge, becoming the problem to the very same solutionthey claim (but apparently do not intend) to be. But the Green also hides aperverse dimension [...] . everything appears to be calm and harmonious but there issomething disturbing [...] . rotting [...] . The Green is the common lie, the secretconsensus, the perfect crime; everybody knows that it cannot be that good, that itcannot be that easy, but why bother? It sells, and there is enough Green foreverybody. In this work, we'll explore the expressions of this Green Architecture,perpetrating its origins, motivations and consequences, in such a way that we canunderstand what legitimacy can we really, if there is any whatsoever, give it. Wewill do such without renouncing to the critic attitude which understands theMan/Nature relation as unseparable, heterogeneous and unpredictable, andtherefore, above all, a complex political and social moment...|$|R
