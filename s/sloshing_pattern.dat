40|$|We {{measure the}} non-axisymmetry in the {{luminosity}} {{distribution in the}} central few kpc of a sample of advanced mergers of galaxies, by analyzing their 2 MASS images. All mergers show a high central asymmetry: the centres of isophotes show a striking <b>sloshing</b> <b>pattern</b> with a spatial variation of upto 30 % within the central 1 kpc; and the Fourier amplitude for lopsidedness (m = 1) shows high values upto 0. 2 within the central 5 kpc. The central asymmetry {{is estimated to be}} long-lived, lasting for ~ a few Gyr or ~ 100 local dynamical timescales. This will significantly affect the dynamical evolution of this region, by helping fuel the central active galactic nucleus, and also by causing the secular growth of the bulge driven by lopsidedness...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} from Suzaku Key Project {{observations}} of the Virgo Cluster, the nearest galaxy cluster to us, mapping its X-ray properties along four long `arms' extending beyond the virial radius. The entropy profiles along all four azimuths increase with radius, then level out beyond 0. 5 r_ 200, while the average pressure at large radii exceeds Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements. These results {{can be explained by}} enhanced gas density fluctuations (clumping) in the cluster's outskirts. Using a standard Navarro, Frenk and White (1997) model, we estimate a virial mass, radius, and concentration parameter of M_ 200 = 1. 05 ± 0. 02 × 10 ^ 14 M_, r_ 200 = 974. 1 ± 5. 7 kpc, and c = 8. 8 ± 0. 2, respectively. The inferred cumulative baryon fraction exceeds the cosmic mean at r∼ r_ 200 along the major axis, suggesting enhanced gas clumping possibly sourced by a candidate large-scale structure filament along the north-south direction. The Suzaku data reveal a large-scale <b>sloshing</b> <b>pattern,</b> with two new cold fronts detected at radii of 233 kpc and 280 kpc along the western and southern arms, respectively. Two high-temperature regions are also identified 1 Mpc towards the south and 605 kpc towards the west of M 87, likely representing shocks associated with the ongoing cluster growth. Although systematic uncertainties in measuring the metallicity for low temperature plasma remain, the data at large radii appear consistent with a uniform metal distribution on scales of ∼ 90 × 180 kpc and larger, providing additional support for the early chemical enrichment scenario driven by galactic winds at redshifts of 2 - 3.

40|$|We {{measure the}} non-axisymmetry in the {{luminosity}} {{distribution in the}} inner few kpc of the remnants of advanced mergers of galaxies {{with a view to}} understand the relaxation in the central regions. For this, we analyse the images from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2 MASS) archival data for a selected sample of 12 merging galaxies, which show signs of interaction but have a single nucleus. The central regions are fitted by elliptical isophotes whose centres are allowed to vary to get the best fit. The centres of isophotes show a striking <b>sloshing</b> <b>pattern</b> with a spatial variation of up to 20 - 30 per cent within the central 1 kpc. This indicates mass asymmetry and a dynamically unrelaxed behaviour in the central region. Next, we Fourier-analyse the galaxy images while keeping the centre constant and measure the deviation from axisymmetry in terms of the fractional Fourier amplitudes (A(1), A(2), etc.) as a function of radius. All the mergers show a high value of lopsidedness (up to A(1) similar to 0. 2) in the central 5 kpc. The m = 2 asymmetry is even stronger, with values of A(2) up to similar to 0. 3, and in three cases these are shown to represent bars. The corresponding values denoting non-axisymmetry in inner regions of a control sample of eight non-merger galaxies are found to be several times smaller. Surprisingly, this central asymmetry is seen even in mergers where the outer regions have relaxed into a smooth elliptical-like r(1 / 4) profile or a spiral-like exponential profile. Thus, the central asymmetry is long lived, estimated to be similar to 1 Gyr, and hence lasts for over 100 local dynamical time-scales. These central asymmetries are expected to {{play a key role in}} the future dynamical evolution of the central region of a merger, and can help in feeding of a central active galactic nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of 1 D Burgers equation and 2 D sloshing problem {{were carried out}} to study numerical discrepancy between serial and parallel computations. The numerical domain was decomposed into 2 and 4 subdomains for parallel computations with message passing interface. The numerical solution of Burgers equation disclosed that fully explicit boundary conditions used on subdomains of parallel computation {{was responsible for the}} numerical discrepancy of transient solution between serial and parallel computations. Two dimensional sloshing problems in a rectangular domain were solved using OpenFOAM. After a lapse of initial transient time <b>sloshing</b> <b>patterns</b> of water were significantly different in serial and parallel computations although the same numerical conditions were given. Based on the histograms of pressure measured at two points near the wall the statistical characteristics of numerical solution was not affected by the number of subdomains as much as the transient solution was dependent on the number of subdomains...|$|R
40|$|Neural field {{equations}} are integro-differential systems {{describing the}} macroscopic activity of spatially extended pieces of cortex.
