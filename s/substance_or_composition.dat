5000|$|Besides {{the general}} {{principle}} that something cannot be patented {{if it was}} already known {{in the state of}} the art (because not new), there are cases wherein a <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> <b>composition</b> may be notionally considered new (i.e. by virtue of a legal fiction) even when the <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> <b>composition</b> is as such already comprised {{in the state of the}} art. Namely, Article 54(4) and (5) EPC [...] "acknowledges the notional novelty of substances or compositions even when they are as such already comprised in the state of the art, provided they are claimed for a new use in a method which [...] excludes as such from patent protection." [...] Article 53(c) EPC excludes from patentability methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body, but this provision does not apply to products, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods. Article 54(4) and (5) EPC is complementary to Article 53(c) EPC.|$|E

5000|$|A {{protective}} {{finishing coat}} is a <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> chemical <b>composition</b> {{applied to the}} surface of an object that provides a barrier of protection from external elements. Polishes use a highly refined abrasive (generally finer than 4,000 grit) that is suspended in a liquid carrier. The polish wears away the surface to create a smooth surface. The smoother the surface the higher the resulting gloss or perceived [...] "shine". A protective finishing coat is applied after polishing to preserve the surface and help resist further oxidation or weathering. Effective finishing coatings penetrate the surface pores and use these pores to which the protective film anchors to.|$|R

5000|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{of mixing}} (or heat of mixing) is the enthalpy liberated or absorbed from a substance upon mixing. When a <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> compound {{is combined with}} any other <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> compound the enthalpy of mixing is the consequence of the new interactions between the two <b>substances</b> <b>or</b> compounds. This enthalpy if released exothermically can in an extreme case cause an explosion.|$|R
50|$|Homogeneity and {{heterogeneity}} are concepts {{often used}} in the sciences and statistics relating to the uniformity in a <b>substance</b> <b>or</b> organism. A material or image that is homogeneous is uniform in <b>composition</b> <b>or</b> character (i.e. color, shape, size, weight, height, distribution, texture, language, income, disease, temperature, radioactivity, architectural design, etc.); one that is heterogeneous is distinctly nonuniform {{in one of these}} qualities.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe process streams refined from {{petroleum}} {{crude oil}} {{for use in}} petroleum products are among those designated by USEPA as UVCB <b>substances</b> (unknown <b>or</b> variable <b>composition,</b> complex reaction products and biological materials). They are identified on global chemical inventories with unique Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) numbers and names. The chemical complexity of most petroleum substances presents challenges when evaluating their hazards and can result in differing evaluations due to the varying level of hazardous constituents and differences in national chemical control regulations. Global efforts to harmonize the identification of chemical hazards are aimed at promoting the use of consistent hazard evaluation criteria. This paper discusses a systematic approach for the health hazard evaluation of petroleum substances using chemical categories and the United Nations (UN) Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of classification and labeling. Also described are historical efforts to characterize the hazard of these substances and how they {{led to the development}} of categories, the identification of potentially hazardous constituents which should be considered, and a summary of the toxicology of the major petroleum product groups. The use of these categories can increase the utility of existing data, provide better informed hazard evaluations, and reduce the amount of animal testing required...|$|R
