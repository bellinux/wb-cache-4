40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{requested}} a two-axis pan tilt mechanism be designed, built, and tested for shipboard deployment of a sensor payload. Of paramount consideration to this design was the robustness {{of the system}} {{in the face of}} wave impact loading from "green water" taken over the superstructure of naval vessels. Central to providing such a system is the prevention of drive train failures given wave or other forms of impact loading. Through the course of work completed for his Master's thesis, Nathan M. Mills brought the design effort through initial bench testing. Several failures were experienced due to minor design flaws and mechanical component selection. One component selection that required improvement was the torque limiting <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> used in both the pan and tilt drive sections. The unit selected induced positioning errors resulting from backlash inherent to its design. The backlash encountered is unavoidable when using the type of <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> selected, as it is with many of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutches</b> available to the machine designer. <b>Slip</b> <b>clutches</b> are available that have limited backlash, but the majority of these are friction based and have setpoints that either do not have tight tolerances or change as the component is cycled. The goal of the present work was to design a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> that maintains its setpoint and minimizes backlash to allow for its shipboard use in the NRL sponsored pan tilt system. The design was completed in a manner that supports the use of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> in other systems that require accurate positioning and torque overload protection in both marine and non-marine environments. by Thomas Patrick Finley.

40|$|Start up of a {{vertical}} axis wind turbine causes transient torque oscillations {{in the drive}} train with peak torques which may be over two and one half times the rated torque of the turbine. A computer code, based on a lumped parameter model of the drive train, was developed and tested for the low cost 17 meter turbine; the results show excellent agreement with field data. The code was used to predict the effect of a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> on transient torque oscillations.

50|$|<b>Slipping</b> the <b>clutch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering the clutch) is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called <b>slipping</b> because the <b>clutch</b> plate will <b>slip</b> against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. <b>Slipping</b> the <b>clutch</b> {{is known to be}} hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 33 - 48 The {{successful}} {{application of}} synchronous motors requires special design consideration {{to account for}} their speed-dependent characteristics, such as the large oscillating torque levels that occur during startup. This paper focuses on the torsional design and analysis process associated with revamping a 7000 hp synchronous motor-driven compressor train with an 8000 hp synchronous motor driver. Torsional analyses indicated that the replacement motor?s startup torque would produce unacceptable levels of torsional vibration. An accurate overtorque protection <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> was integrated into the low-speed coupling assembly to limit startup peak torque to about three times the normal operating torques. The paper details multiple issues associated with revamping the compressor drive train, including {{the selection of the}} replacement driver and low-speed coupling assembly, torsional vibration analysis, and the mechanical operation of the controlled <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> mechanism. The paper also presents the acquired torsional field measurements that were used to confirm the clutch?s operation...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is done with the methods learned in our education, Technical Design at the Luleå University of technology. The project {{took place in the}} town of Katrineholm and with the {{plumbing}} company PCT Systems AB. The method that is being used while cleaning pipes consists of a tool that is rotating by a wire connected to a power drill. When the tool is rotating in the pipe it cleans the inner wall, also known as milling. If the tool is stuck the power drill is twisted and the user loses their grip. With that {{there is a possibility that}} the user gets hurt. If the tool starts to lose momentum there is a risk that the wire is damaged. The result in this thesis is to remove these problems and to improve the usability of a power drill in work. The work was done with a part of the creative process that applies segregation of duties, with main function, part function and support functions. The main function in this thesis is a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> and apart from that there are support functions that will ease the usability of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutch.</b> The final concept is a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> that may be applied on a variety of power drills to be used in the cleaning and milling of pipes. The final product shall solve the problems that occur when a tool is stuck or struggling to maintain speed in the pipes. That way it will improve the work environment for the user.

50|$|Also {{known as}} a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> or safety clutch, this device allows a {{rotating}} shaft to slip when higher than normal resistance is encountered on a machine.

5000|$|Reverse: The car reverses as in an {{automatic}} car. To reverse, depress brake pedal, {{and change the}} gear to R. Gradually lift off the brake pedal to allow the car to creep backwards.

In this case, the car must not be held still using the accelerator pedal, as the excessive clutch slipping will lead to clutch damage.

5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and take-up spools of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and <b>slip</b> <b>clutches</b> was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head.
