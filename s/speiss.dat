The urbanized part of the Little Cottonwood Creek drainage basin includes that part {{from the mouth of}} Little Cottonwood Canyon to the confluence with the Jordan River. The stream provides electrical power generation for Murray City.The first legitimate mining operation in Little Cottonwood Canyon was established in 1865. The ore deposits in Little Cottonwood Canyon yielded principally silver and lead with some copper, gold, and zinc. These ore deposits were formed mainly in shale, limestone, and dolomite. Galena or lead sulfide was the common primary lead mineral of the area. Argentite was found in most of the primary ores and was probably an abundant primary silver mineral. Ore production varied with time {{because of the nature of}} the deposits and the scattered control of holdings. The 1870s were especially productive, when rich deposits were mined.

40|$|To {{cope with}} current {{trends in the}} base metals {{industry}} {{due to the lack}} of pure mining resources, booming metals prices, and growing demand for base metals: new thinking regarding the nature of metal resources as well as novel recycling technologies is needed. Slags from base metals' production can be a superior material for recycling. Currently, at the Rönnskär smelter plant, copper slag is recycled in a continuous procedure, including fuming, settling, and granulation. The main product is called Iron Sand with smaller amounts of matte and <b>speiss.</b> These two phases contain a considerable amount of Cu, Ni, and precious metals. Investigating the distribution of elements and oxides in these separate phases and the effect of CaO as a common impurity, is the main aim of this study. The original materials, including settling slag, matte, and <b>speiss,</b> were delivered by Boliden AB, Rönnskär Smelter Plant. Each material was dried, crushed, milled, and separated in the mineral processing laboratory of Luleå University of Technology for later analysis with X-ray diffractometery (XRD) and thermal treatment. Six different samples were prepared by homogenously mixing these three phases along with different ratios of CaO. Then, the six samples were placed in alumina crucibles and remelted in a Tamman furnace under N 2 atmosphere at 1400 °C for one hour to attain maximum settling. After cooling, slag, matte, and <b>speiss</b> were carefully separated from solidified material. A fraction of the materials were mounted and prepared for light optical microscopy (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations. The remaining material was crushed and milled for X-ray diffractometery (XRD) and chemical analysis. XRD analysis disclosed that the matte and <b>speiss</b> result in very complicated patterns, which are not easily interpreted. Treated samples along with original samples were sent to Rönnskär smelter plant for accurate chemical analysis of Cu, Ni, Fe, Zn, Pb, Sn, Sb, As, Ag, S, Al 2 O 3, MgO, CaO, and Fe 3 O 4. The results of XRD, LOM, SEM, Chemical Composition, and Thermodynamic studies reveal that the distribution of elements and components change with respect to CaO content. The results have been extracted and tabulated in this thesis work. The higher the lime content the greater the formation of Augite [Ca (Mg, Fe) Si 2 O 6] in the slag phase, whereas little or no affect was noticed on distribution of elements in matte and <b>speiss.</b> Iron content in the <b>speiss</b> phase did decrease with addition of lime into the system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{temperature}} {{evolution and}} crystallization sequences in matte and <b>speiss</b> from Pb metallurgy at Príbram (Czech Republic) were determined {{using a combination}} of microscopic observations (optical microscopy, SEM/EDS), chemical microprobe data (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) of original samples collected at the dumps, and samples studied by heating experiments (temperature steps 25, 400, 700, 900, 1100, 1200 C) and quenching experiments (400, 700 and 900 °C). Immiscibility of sulphide and metallic melts was observed. Identification of the major phases (sulphides, metals and intermetallic compounds) helped in estimation of the temperature of the matte and <b>speiss</b> solidification. Microscopic observations indicate that the crystallization sequences begin with high-temperature phases, such as Ni 3 Sn 2 or NiSb (with melting temperatures of 1264 °C and 1147 °C, respectively) and, in sulphide melts, with crystallization of a high-temperature spinel phase (magnetite, Fe 3 O 4), Fe-rich wurtzite/sphalerite (ZnS) and pyrrhotite (Fe 1 x S). The solidification sequence ends either with the formation of galena + Cu sulphide eutectic (500 - 600 °C) within the sulphide melt (matte), or with low-temperature Pb + Sb myrmekitic assemblage formation (247 °C) in the <b>speiss.</b> Possible geological implications related to the crystallization of sulphide ore bodies or their partial melting induced by regional metamorphic processes are discussed...|$|E

Generally, the gSCR is physically and mathematically extended from conven-tional SCR by decomposing the multi-infeed system into n inde-pendent single infeed systems. Then the operation gSCR (OgSCR) is proposed based on gSCR {{in order to take}} the variation of op-eration point into consideration. The participation factors and sensitivity are analyzed as well.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{has been}} carried out within an {{interdisciplinary}} cooperational project between the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum and the Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, which is dedicated to ancient Pb-Ag mining and metal production in the hinterland of the municipium Ulpiana in central Kosovo. Geochemical analysis (OM, XRD, EMP, MC-ICP-MS) of ores, metallurgical (by-) products and metal artefacts allowed to reconstruct the local chaîne opératoire and to decipher significant chronological differences between presumably Roman/late antique and medieval/early modern metallurgical processing. Pb isotope provenance studies documented the relevance of local metal production within the Roman Empire and confirmed the actual existence of a Metalla Dardanica district, which until now solely has been suspected on basis of epigraphy. The predominant abundance of the by-products matte (Cu, Pb, Fe and Zn sulphides) and <b>speiss</b> (ferrous speiss: Fe-As compounds; base metal speiss: (Cu,Ni,Fe,Ag) x(Sb,Sn,As) y) at smelting sites with a preliminary Roman/late antique dating points to treatment of complex polymetallic ore. Pb isotope analysis demonstrated that the mining district of Shashkoc-Janjevo (partially) supplied six of the ten investigated metallurgical sites. In this mineralisation, parageneses with elevated Cu, As and Sb abundances comprise significant proportions of particularly tennantite-tetrahedrite minerals, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and were generated during the early and main stages of ore formation. Later precipitated ore in contrast is marked by a significantly less versatile mineralogy and consists almost exclusively of galena, sphalerite and pyrite/marcasite. Besides increased Cu, As and Sb contents, ore from the main formation stage also exhibits generally higher Ag abundances, which are mainly hosted by fahlore and locally abundant secondary Cu sulphides (chalcocite, digenite and covellite) and oxidised phases (e. g. malachite, azurite). The higher precious metal grades of this ore type, whose geochemical signature (i. e. higher proportions of Cu, As and Sb) is mirrored by the abundance of the metallurgical by-products matte and <b>speiss</b> (almost exclusively found at potentially Roman/late antique smelting sites; see above), presumably were a pivotal factor leading to its preferential exploitation in earlier times. Matte and base metal-rich <b>speiss</b> contain notable amounts of Ag, which are mainly present in Cu-(Fe) sulphides and particularly antimonides ((Cu,Ni) 2 Sb, Ag 3 Sb), respectively. While the <b>speiss</b> compounds due to their close association with Pb bullion presumably were cupelled automatically, the metallurgical treatment of matte could not have been proven unambiguously, but overall certainly is highly likely. The beneficiated ore (i. e. crushed and sorted, potentially also treated by more lavish techniques such as grinding, sieving or wet-mechanical methods) possibly was partially roasted and subsequently together with fluxes and charcoal submitted to the furnaces. The working temperatures approximately ranged between 1100 and 1400 °C. Slags from all presumably Roman/late antique dated and few of their potentially medieval/early modern analogues were produced from smelting of (partially roasted) ore with charcoal and added siliceous material, thus resulting in fayalite-dominant phase assemblages or rarely observed glassy parageneses. Even though several subtypes of fayalite slags have been established on basis of the abundance of Fe-rich oxide phases (i. e. spinel ss and wüstite), late clinopyroxene and the general solidification sequence of the slags, the process conditions (i. e. temperature, fO 2, added fluxing agents) must have been widely similar; chemical variations could be explained by varying degrees of interaction of the slag melt with charcoal ash and furnace material. The other investigated metallurgical remains indicate employment of a calcareous flux, which led to formation of Ca-rich olivine-, olivine+clinopyroxene-, clinopyroxene- or melilite-type slags. These types as well as glassy slags were generated at more oxidising conditions outside the fayalite stability field (FMQ buffer equilibrium, cf. Lindsley, 1976) than their olivine-dominant analogues. Conclusions on the furnace construction could be drawn on basis of the typology of the slags, which mostly were tapped into a basin located outside the furnace, but partially (at two presumably medieval/early modern sites) also accumulated in a reservoir within the smelter. Lead artefacts excavated in Ulpiana could be isotopically related to ores from mineralisations in its vicinity and demonstrate that the resources were at least utilised for local metal production. However, also ship wreck cargo from Israel - including several lead ingots with the inscription 'MET DARD' (Raban, 1999) - and late antique lead-glazed pottery from Serbia and Romania (Walton & Tite, 2010) could be related to a possible Kosovarian/Serbian provenance of the raw material and thus indicate flourishing trade of metal from the Metalla Dardanica district within the Roman Empire.

For this case, solvent extraction was chosen as a potential method of recovering these valuables, {{as it is a}} method considered to be ideal for separation of trace elements from large amounts of other substances. The goal for this work was to execute manual extraction experiments as a preparation for a bigger project at LTU. The objectives of this thesis included the investigation of the selectivity for extraction of tin and antimony, using different concentrations of hydrochloric acid in the feed solution, analysis of the equilibrium isotherms for Sn and Sb at 8 M of HCl as well as the evaluation of the number of steps needed for future extraction experiments, using the McCabe- Thiele method. By executing manual experiments with a <b>speiss</b> precipitate dissolved in hydrochloric acid, the results obtained indicated that the selectivity increased with a higher content of HCl in the feed solution. Using different ratios between the aqueous and organic phase, the equilibrium curves denoted a pushback effect, causing antimony to migrate back into the aqueous phase at the saturation level of tin. By constructing a McCable-Thiele diagram according to the equilibrium curves, the number of steps could be evaluated to three. ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{outlined}} here is {{an investigation}} of mining and smelting evidence across eastern Macedonia in northern Greece particularly through the Byzantine (AD 324 - 1453) and Ottoman (AD 1453 - 1912) periods. Diverse evidence for mineral exploration and metallurgical extraction in the ancient and medieval past exists throughout this region bounded by the Strymon and Nestos river valleys. Through an integrated approach to survey, site characterization and scientific analysis of metallurgical debris it has been intended to approach issues of interrelatedness between subsistence and production sectors, and address questions relating to Byzantine economy and technological complexity. Documentary evidence from antiquity, late Byzantine Mount Athos charters and Ottoman cadastral registers refer to local, large-scale iron production in the region. Although at present there exists no {{clear understanding of the}} chronology for the various production sites, surveys and analytical studies carried out elsewhere have been proven enlightening towards that end. Further, the actual practices represented at these sites remains to be established. Although the mainstay of the metallurgical traditions seems to be iron metallurgy, analyses of slag from sites across Macedonia, particularly high arsenic concentrations, and the occurrence of <b>speiss</b> among the debris, suggested that precious metal extraction could have been an important but peripheral activity. This coupled with documentary evidence allows for the potential of eastern Macedonia to be a minor but significant source of precious metals in the Byzantine world. The current study focuses on the survey and sampling of four smelting sites in the region and scientific analysis by various instrumental techniques undertaken in view to characterizing the metallurgical processes represented in each case. The production sites are characterized by spatial and scalar variation reflecting distinct modes of organizing labour and fluctuations in specialization, intensity and time-length of operations. Analytical data provide an overview of the technical parameters which in turn represent human capacities and choices deeply rooted in social and cultural information. Eventually the dynamics of practice and technical choices for organizing seasonal smelting ventures are being perceived as identity forging incidents among the medieval rural communities of the region...|$|E
40|$|In copper extraction, the Cu-Fe-S {{minerals}} {{from which}} about 80 % of world’s copper originates from are insoluble in aqueous solutions hence {{much of the}} copper extraction is through the pyrometallurgical route. In this pyrometallurgical route, the Cu-Fe-S and Cu-S mineral particles are separated from gangue minerals by froth flotation to obtain a copper concentrate (20 - 30 % Cu) which is then melted at about 1200 oC and oxidised (smelting) to produce a sulphide-rich melt called matte (45 - 75 % Cu), and an oxide-rich melt called slag (1 - 2 % Cu). The separation of these two melts (matte and slag) in the smelting process is enhanced by addition of silica (SiO 2) flux which makes them immiscible. The molten matte from the smelting process is further oxidised in the converting process where blister copper (99 % Cu) and slag (4 - 8 % Cu) are produced. Boliden Mineral AB is a metals company with two of its five smelters being copper smelters namely Rönnskär and Harjavalta, which use the copper extraction processes (smelting and converting) described above. Rönnskär smelter {{is located on the}} coast of Skellefteå in Sweden, while Harjavalta smelter is located in Finland with operations in Harjavalta and Pori. The separation of different molten phases (matte, white metal, metal, <b>speiss</b> and slag) in copper and other base metals production is critical in that it affects the efficiency of the smelting and converting processes as the direct and total yield of the processes get affected. Since in both smelting and converting processes the phase separation is mostly mechanical through settling (gravity separation), these processes are collectively being referred to as settling processes in this study. It is therefore, important to have an in-depth understanding of the degree of separation of the molten phases in these settling processes, and the factors that could influence the settling. The known factors that could influence settling are time, temperature, density, viscosity, composition and vessel geometry. Therefore, in this dissertation, mapping (graphic symbolic representation of the degree of separation) of different settling processes at the Boliden Rönnskär and Harjavalta smelters is done to enable assessment of the quality of settling in each process studied, and compare the different settling processes. The result of this study could then be used to improve processes efficiency as the yields would be improved. Also, process operating parameters that affect separation such as settling time would be optimised. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the selected slag samples from Boliden Rönnskär and Harjavalta smelters settling processes gave an understanding of the characteristics of the different slags. Based on this understanding, Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) slag characterization was used {{to come up with a}} mapping of the different settling processes at the two smelters which included the electric smelting furnace, flash furnace, electronic scrap kaldo (E-Kaldo) furnace, lead kaldo furnace, precious metals (PMs) kaldo furnace, and Peirce-Smith (PS) converter. Comparing LOM micrographs of smelting processes to converting processes proved that the degree of separation was better in smelting processes. Slag composition was observed to be a key factor in settling processes as with it other factors such as viscosity, temperature and settling time become interlinked. As slag composition would be controlled to improve settling, it would also indirectly help manage impurities in the processes. It is recommended that the degree of separation be quantified so that a proper assessment of process optimization is made. Validerat; 20150706 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
