5|$|June 23, 2001: An {{isolated}} supercell produced three tornadoes in the state. The first, an F1, hit a {{golf course}} in Washington, demolishing a storage building and a tennis court, and injuring one person. The second tornado, rated an F2, touched down in Torrington near Torrington Middle School, damaging the roof and destroying bleachers and a storage <b>shed.</b> <b>The</b> final tornado, an F0, produced minor damage to the East Hartland fire station.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{director}} Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American {{soldier in}} the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights {{his way out of}} a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana <b>shed</b> <b>the</b> weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} <b>shed</b> <b>the</b> passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E

5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool <b>shed.</b> <b>The</b> alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy Rees started Arnolfini {{with the}} {{assistance}} of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E <b>Shed,</b> <b>the</b> current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated {{on the side of the}} Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} for feathers in tyrannosauroids {{came from the}} small species Dilong paradoxus, found in the Yixian Formation of China, and reported in 2004. As with many other theropods discovered in the Yixian, the fossil skeleton was preserved with a coat of filamentous structures which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers. Because all known skin impressions from larger tyrannosauroids known at the time showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size—that juveniles may have been feathered, then <b>shed</b> <b>the</b> feathers and expressed only scales as the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation to stay warm. Subsequent discoveries showed that even some large tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis {{that they were a}} size-related feature.|$|E
50|$|Another {{effect of}} {{boundary}} layer separation is shedding vortices, known as Kármán vortex street. When the vortices begin to <b>shed</b> off <b>the</b> bounded surface {{they do so}} at a certain frequency. <b>The</b> <b>shedding</b> of <b>the</b> vortices then could cause vibrations in the structure that they are <b>shedding</b> off. When <b>the</b> frequency of <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> vortices reaches <b>the</b> resonance frequency of the structure, it could cause serious structural failures.|$|R

5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges {{to go up}} and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a <b>shed.</b> <b>The</b> gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} slid slowly northwestward {{between the}} contiguous upper vortex {{and a large}} high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, {{as well as an}} anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65mph (105km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation—a feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately 112°F (80°C) occurred over the center. Having <b>shed</b> <b>the</b> last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200UTC that day.|$|E
