50|$|Finally, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) {{bring the}} {{asymmetric}} information framework {{to bear in}} analyzing the issue of advertising and pricing. Traditionally, economists have thought of advertising as being either informative (as for example classified ads, which describe {{the characteristics of the}} product for sale), or persuasive (as for example many television commercials which seem to provide little or no information about a product’s characteristics). Following earlier ideas by Nelson (1970, 1974), Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show that even “uninformative” advertising, that is, advertising expenditures that provide no direct information about a product’s characteristics, may be informative in equilibrium {{to the extent that they}} work as a signal of the advertiser’s quality level. Methodologically, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) also make an important contribution: the study of signaling equilibria when the informed party has more than one available <b>signal</b> (<b>price</b> and advertising, in the present case).|$|E

We compare consumer evaluation of offline and online LPS {{as a function}} of how deeply they process the signals. Results of an experiment indicate that regardless of retail media consumers accept an LPS as an indicator of low price when they do not elaborate sufficiently on the signal. However, at high levels of elaboration, consumers challenge the assumptions underlying their acceptance of the signal at lower levels of elaboration whereby they become more skeptical of an online signal than an offline signal resulting in lower efficacy of the former. Implications of these findings for consumer vulnerability to false low <b>price</b> <b>signaling</b> are discussed along with other theoretical and managerial implications.

40|$|Stock repurchases (or share buy-backs) {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular among Australian companies. One of the main aims of announcing a stock repurchase by a listed company is signalling the market that its shares are currently underpriced. When market reacts to the <b>signal,</b> <b>price</b> of the shares {{is expected to increase}} immediately after the announcement. While there are several ways of repurchasing shares, 2 ̆ 7 on-market buy-backs 2 ̆ 7 is the most popular method of stock repurchases in Australia. Australian listed companies have announced more than two hundred on-market share buy-backs over the past three years. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the information signalling effects of these on-market buy-back announcements. If the signal is considered positively (negatively) by the market, the price of the repurchasing company 2 ̆ 7 s shares should increase (decrease) immediately after the announcement. If there is no information content in the announcement, the price will remain the same. In this study, signalling effect of share buy-back announcements was examined using most recent Australian data. The total population of on-market buy-back announcements during the period from January 1, 2000 to March 10, 2003 was included. The abnormal market return over the short-run (announcement day and 9 trading days centred on the announcement date) was computed using the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index as the reference portfolio. The daily Abnormal Returns (AR) and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) during the event period were computed.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} retail price image by offering an explanation for how and when stores can use their advertised <b>prices</b> to <b>signal</b> the <b>prices</b> of other products in the store. A model of a two-product retail market is presented in which stores advertise {{the price of one}} product and customers do not know the price of the other product before selecting which store to visit. In a model with full customer information, stores with different marginal costs charge different prices for each product. When customers do not know each store's marginal cost type, an opportunity arises for each store to signal its cost type using its advertised prices. In such a model, additional equilibria exist. In particular, stores with different costs may charge the same advertised price while continuing to charge different prices for the unadvertised product. Data from competing drycleaning stores is generally consistent with the model predictions. A number of additional properties of the equilibria are discussed and possible extensions to the model are proposed. <b>signalling,</b> <b>pricing,</b> price image, advertising...|$|R

40|$|Sale signs {{increase}} demand. The apparent {{effectiveness of}} this simple strategy is surprising; sale signs are inexpensive to produce and stores generally make no commitment when using them. As a result, they can be placed on any products, and as many products, as stores prefer. If stores can place sale signs on {{any or all of}} their products, why are they effective? We offer an explanation for the effectiveness of sale signs by arguing that they inform customers about which products have relatively low prices, thus helping customers decide whether to purchase now, visit another store, or perhaps return to the same store in the future. This explanation raises two additional issues. First, why do stores prefer to place sale signs on products that are truly low priced (stores could use sale signs to increase demand for any of their products) ? Second, how many sale signs should a store use; should they limit sale signs to just their relatively low priced products or should they also place them on some of their higher priced products? The paper addresses each of these questions and in doing so investigates how much information sale signs reveal. Our arguments are illustrated using a formal game-theoretic model in which competing stores sell imperfect substitutes in two-period overlapping seasons. Stores choose price and sale sign strategies and new customers arrive each period and decide whether to purchase immediately or delay and return in the future (to the same store or a different store). Customers who delay purchasing risk that the product will not be available in the following period and incur an additional transportation cost when they return. Two factors balance these costs. First, customers correctly anticipate that the price will be lower if the product is available in the next period. Second, customers who return to a different store may find a product that better suits their needs. In deciding how to respond, customers use price and sale sign cues to update their expectations about which products will be available in the next period. Stores' sale sign and price strategies are entirely endogenous in the model, as is the impact of sale signs on demand. In our discussion we highlight the information revealed by sale signs, including the source of its credibility, its sensitivity to the number of sale signs that are used, and the resulting shift in customer demand. We point to two key results. First, we show that the underlying signal is self-fulfilling: if customers believe that products with sale signs {{are more likely to be}} relatively low priced, then firms prefer to place sale signs on lower priced products. Second, we demonstrate that sale signs are self-regulating. Stores may introduce noise by placing sale signs on some more expensive products. However, if customers' price expectations are sensitive to the number of products that have sale signs, this strategy is not without cost. Using additional sale signs may reduce demand for other products that already have sale signs. Our model is unique in several respects. First, we describe how stores use multiple signals to communicate with customers and recognize that customers vary in how much they learn from each <b>signal.</b> <b>Price</b> alone resolves uncertainty for some customers, but other customers use both prices and sale signs to resolve their uncertainty. Second, although previous signaling models have recognized that signals may be noisy (not always accurate), noise in these signals is typically exogenous, resulting from uncontrolled environmental distortions. In our model, stores endogenously choose to introduce noise so that sale signs only partially reveal which products are discounted. Our explanations are supported by several examples. Although we focus on fashion products, our findings have application to any market in which customers are uncertain about relative price levels.

This "mixed" strategy induces buyers to send more informative signals in equilibrium than if the seller were to always price discriminate.

30|$|Appliance {{management}} can {{be carried}} out by Demand Response (DR). DR optimizes consumption patterns by, for example, using external <b>signals</b> (e.g., <b>pricing</b> <b>signals,</b> direct controlling signals). Optimization is then performed by shifting or managing loads based on incentive-based or price-based programs (Merkert et al. 2015), the latter are often realized through dynamic pricing (e.g., time-of-use pricing (TOUP), critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing (RTP) (Siano 2014; Steen et al. 2012)). DR can also “transform domestic customers from static consumers into active participants” ((Molderink et al. 2010), p., 109), which especially promotes the implementation of decentralized energy generation (e.g., PV, storages) in the grid. Nevertheless, since DR is a complex task and <b>pricing</b> <b>signals</b> may change during the day (cf., RTP), it can hardly be carried out manually by the users without assistance. Especially the reaction on changing <b>price</b> <b>signals</b> would require significant user efforts regarding time and participation as consumption plans need to be adapted on multiple times throughout the day. Therefore, applying DR in the residential context requires supporting infrastructure, including, for instance, a Smart Meter and a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) (e.g. (Chaudhari et al. 2014)).|$|R
