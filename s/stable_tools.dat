40|$|Abstract: Model-driven {{engineering}} (MDE) is {{a promising}} paradigm {{to deal with}} the ever increasing complexity of modern software systems. Its powerful abstrac-tion mechanisms allow developers to focus on the essential challenges hiding away irrelevant aspects of the system under development. Within the last few years, noti-cable {{progress has been made in}} putting the vision of MDE into practice, where the activity of textual coding is substituted by modeling. With matured concepts and <b>stable</b> <b>tools</b> available, MDE becomes more and more ready to be applied in software engineering projects. Nevertheless, the best available technology is worthless, if it is not accepted and used by the developers. Also in MDE profound training is needed to fully exploit its power. In this paper, we discuss the efforts taken in educational environments to promote the application of modeling and MDE technologies for the software devel-opment process and discuss several challenges which still have to be faced...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In model-based development, the {{software}} de-velopment effort is centered around a formal {{description of the}} proposed software system; a description that can be subjected to various types of analysis and code gen-eration. Based on years of experience with model-based development and formal modeling {{we believe that the}} following conjectures describe fundamental obstacles to wide adoption of formal modeling and the potential for automation that comes with it; (1) no single modeling notation will suit all, or even most, modeling needs, (2) no analysis tool will fit all, or even most, analysis tasks, and (3) flexible and <b>stable</b> <b>tools</b> must be made available for realistic evaluations and technology transfer. These conjectures form the basis for the call to arms outlined in this report. To make automated software engineering techniques more useful for more types of developers and allow us to move forward as a community it is crucial that we develop the foundation for building extensible and flex-ible modeling language processing tools. New common-infrastructure-based approaches are needed as traditional approaches based on file-based processing of intermedi-ate language representations are not adequate. In this re-port we outline and illustrate the problem and discuss a possible solution. To initiate the discussions in the com-munity, we hypothesize that languages and tools built using higher-order attribute grammars with forwarding can serve as a basis for such flexible language processing tools; tools {{that will allow us to}} unify our efforts and help bring our collective work to a broader audience...|$|E

40|$|Transient {{accumulation}} of extracellular ATP reflects both release of ATP from intracellular stores and altered rates of ATP metabolism by ecto-enzymes. Ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (eNTPDases) and ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatases (eNPPs) degrade ATP, while ecto-nucleotide diphosphokinases (eNDPKs) synthesize ATP from ambient ADP. Although the methylene ATP analogs βγ-meATP and αβ-meATP {{are widely used}} as metabolically <b>stable</b> <b>tools</b> {{for the analysis of}} purinergic signaling, their specific effects on eNTPDase, eNPP, and eNDPK activities have not been defined. This study compared the actions of these analogs on extracellular ATP metabolism by human 1321 N 1 astrocytes, rat PC 12 pheochomocytoma cells, and rat C 6 glioma cells. Both analogs significantly reduced clearance of extracellular ATP by 1321 N 1 cells that express both eNTPDases and eNPPs, as well as by C 6 cells that exclusively express eNPPs. In contrast, both analogs were much less efficacious in inhibiting ATP clearance by PC 12 cells that predominantly express eNTPDases. βγ-meATP, but not αβ-meATP, was effectively hydrolyzed by the 1321 N 1 and C 6 cells; PC 12 cells did not significantly degrade this analog. αβ-meATP, but not βγ-meATP, acted as a substrate for purified yeast NDPK to generate ATP via trans-phosphorylation of ADP. αβ-meATP also acted as substrate for the eNDPK activities expressed by 1321 N 1, PC 12, and C 6 cells and thereby induced extracellular ATP accumulation in the presence of ambient or exogenously added ADP. These results indicate that methylene ATP analogs exert complex and cell-specific effects on extracellular ATP metabolism that can significantly modify interpretation of studies that use these reagents as probes of purinergic signal transduction in intact tissues...|$|E

Iterative optimization {{is a popular}} approach to adapting programs to a new architecture automatically using feedback-directed compilation. However, {{the large number of}} evaluations required for each program has prevented iterative compilation from widespread take-up in production compilers. Machine learning has been proposed to tune optimizations across programs systematically but is currently limited to a few transformations, long training phases and critically lacks publicly released, <b>stable</b> <b>tools.</b> Our approach is to develop a modular, extensible, self-tuning optimization infrastructure to automatically learn the best optimizations across multiple programs and architectures based on the correlation between program features, run-time behavior and optimizations. In this paper we describeMilepostGCC, the first publicly-available open-source machine learning-based compiler. It consists of an Interactive Compilation Interface (ICI) and plugins to extract program features and exchange optimization data with the cTuning. org open public repository. It automatically adapts the internal optimization heuristic at function-level granularity to improve execution time, code size and compilation time of a new program on a given architecture. Part of the MILEPOST technology together with low-level ICI-inspired plugin framework is now included in the mainline GCC. We developed machine learning plugins based on probabilistic and transductive approaches to predict good combinations of optimizations. Our preliminary experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} automatically reduce the execution time of individual MiBench programs, some by more than a factor of 2, while also improving compilation time and code size.

They may {{ultimately lead to}} drug-like analogues to intervene in disease. Recent advances in chemical biology tools available to probe Ca 2 + signalling are described, with a particular focus on those synthetic analogues from our group that have enhanced biological understanding or represent a step towards more drug-like molecules. Adenophostin (AdA) is the most potent known agonist at the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) and synthetic analogues provide a binding model for receptor activation and channel opening. 2 -O-Modified inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) derivatives that are partial agonists at the IP 3 R reveal key conformational changes of the receptor upon ligand binding. Biphenyl polyphosphates illustrate that simple non-inositol surrogates can be engineered to give prototype IP 3 R agonists or antagonists and act as templates for protein co-crystallization. Cyclic adenosine 5 '-diphosphoribose (cADPR) can be selectively modified using total synthesis, generating chemically and biologically <b>stable</b> <b>tools</b> to investigate Ca 2 + release via the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and to interfere with cADPR synthesis and degradation. The first neutral analogues with a synthetic pyrophosphate bioisostere surprisingly retain the ability to release Ca 2 +, suggesting a new route to membrane-permeant tools. Adenosine 5 '-diphosphoribose (ADPR) activates the Ca 2 + -, Na + - and K + -permeable transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM 2) cation channel. Synthetic ADPR analogues provide the first structure-activity relationship (SAR) for this emerging messenger and the first functional antagonists.

40|$|When {{machining}} {{high precision}} mechanical parts, self-excited chatter vibrations must be absolutely avoided since they cause unacceptable surface finish and dimensional errors. Such unstable vibrational phenomena typically arise when the overall machining system stiffness is relatively low, {{as in the}} case of internal turning operations performed with slender boring bars. In general, it is not easy to determine <b>stable</b> <b>tooling</b> system configurations for a given machining operation, since data available in literature are often incomplete or inaccurate. In this paper, a new probabilistic algorithm for a robust analysis of stability in internal turning is presented. In this approach, model parameters are considered as random variables, and robust analysis of stability is carried out in order to estimate system’s probability of instability for a given boring bar geometry and material, tool geometry, workpiece material and cutting parameters. By so doing, robustly <b>stable</b> <b>tooling</b> system configurations and cutting conditions may be identified in the preliminary production planning phase. The proposed approach was experimentally validated by considering different boring bar geometries and materials (including special boring bars made of high-damping carbide), tool geometries, workpiece materials and cutting conditions. For each machining system configuration, the developed approach was capable of successfully estimating the maximum ratio between boring bar overhang L and bar diameter D which assures process stability for most cutting parameters combinations...|$|R

Data from these measures were analyzed in SPSS using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) model (2, k) to measure the test-retest reliability. Cronbach's α was used to examine the internal consistency of the items within the WcS-DAT. Concurrent validity with similar measures was analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlations. ICC scores for all analyses were above the established lower bound of. 80, indicating a highly <b>stable</b> and reliable <b>tool.</b> In addition, alpha scores indicated good consistency of all items without redundancy.

30|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical model}} of forces during shearing with angled tools {{was developed by}} Atkins (1990) in guillotining of copper plates. In that model, the force can be computed provided the materials shear yield stress, work hardening index, and fracture toughness in the plane of cut are known. The latter two parameters are, however, often not so readily available as the yield stress. Therefore, in this paper, a simple model is developed, {{based on the assumption}} of plane strain, in which the forces in shearing with angled tools are calculated from forces measured with parallel tools. The main purpose of this work is to compare the forces predicted by the model, with forces measured with inclined tools. Forces were accurately measured, both with parallel and angled tools, using an experimental set-up with a high stiffness and a <b>stable</b> <b>tool</b> clearance providing reliable reproducible results, as previously demonstrated by Gustafsson et al.
