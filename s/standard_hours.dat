(Example: $40,000/year periodic salary divided by 50 weeks equals $800/week. Divide $800/week by 40 <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> equals $20/hour).|$|E
2500|$|Cate S. Hennessy (née Egan), {{portrayed by}} Katey Sagal, is the wife, mother, nurse, and {{easily the most}} sane and {{composed}} person in the family. She takes a nursing job at the kids' school so she can work <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> and {{spend more time with}} the kids. Cate starts dating her kids' high-school principal, Ed Gibb (portrayed by Adam Arkin), towards the end of season three. During her teens, she was more or less just as popular, scheming, and rebellious as Bridget, thus she is usually the first to notice when Bridget is up to something. She received her middle name [...] "Stinky" [...] {{as a result of her}} father promising his best friend he would name one of his children after him after accidentally stabbing him with a bayonet while they were drunk in Korea; to hide this, she claims that the S stands for [...] "Stacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish day {{is of no}} fixed length. The Jewish day {{is modeled}} on the {{reference}} to [...] "...there was evening and there was morning..." [...] in the creation account in {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. Based on the classic rabbinic interpretation of this text, a day in the rabbinic Hebrew calendar runs from sunset (start of [...] "the evening") to the next sunset. In most populated parts of the world this is always approximately 24 <b>standard</b> <b>hours,</b> but, depending on the season of the year, it can be slightly less or slightly more. Halachically, a day ends and a new one starts when three stars are visible in the sky. The time between true sunset and the time when the three stars are visible (known as 'tzait ha'kochavim') is known as 'bein hashmashot', and there are differences of opinion as to which day it falls into for some uses. This may be relevant, for example, in determining the date of birth of a child born during that gap.|$|E

50|$|Elizabeth Quat of Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), {{believed}} that <b>standard</b> working <b>hour</b> was a labor policy {{and was not}} related to family-friendly policies.

He thought that the government should discuss the topic with public more before legislating the <b>standard</b> working <b>hour.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lee Shu-Kam, Associate Professor of the Department of Economics and Finance of HKSYU, {{believed}} <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> cannot achieve ‘work-life balance’. He referenced {{the research}} to the US by the University of California, Los Angeles in 1999 {{and pointed out}} that in the industries and regions which the wage elasticity is low, the effects of <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> on lowering actual working time and increasing wage is limited: for regions where labor supply is inadequate, <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> can protect employees’ benefit yet cause unemployment; but for the regions, such as Japan, where the problem does not exist, <b>standard</b> working <b>hour</b> would only lead to unemployment. In addition, he said the effect of <b>standard</b> working <b>hour</b> {{is similar to that of}} giving overtime pay, say, making employees to favor overtime work more. In this sense, <b>standard</b> working <b>hour</b> does not match its principle: to shorten work time and increase recreation time of employees. He believed that the key point is to help employees to achieve work-life balance and get a win-win situation of employers and employees.|$|R

50|$|Francis Lui, Head and Professor of the Department of Economics of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, {{believed}} that the <b>standard</b> working <b>hour</b> may not lower work time but increase unemployment.
