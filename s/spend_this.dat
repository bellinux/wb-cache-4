The results {{on the final day}} of the 2013–14 season meant Tranmere were relegated from League One and were to <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> season in League Two for the first time since promotion from it in 1988–89. On 11 August, former Football Association chief executive and ex-Tranmere Rovers player Mark Palios and his wife Nicola took a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of British newspapers on creating {{the public perception}} of mods as having a leisure-filled club-going lifestyle {{can be seen in}} a 1964 article in the Sunday Times. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod who went out clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had the time and money to <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argue that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.|$|E
25|$|The time {{commitment}} of exclusive breastfeeding {{is also an}} economic constraint. The time required per week to breastfeed rather than bottle-feed or feed solids to children can be a significant burden for women without other childcare or who need to <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> time doing paid work. However, some {{evidence suggests that the}} long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the short-term costs. In the United States, workplace policy surrounding breastfeeding and parental leave often does not reflect these benefits. In addition, women are often unable to risk the loss of their jobs or loss of income due to breastfeeding adherence, so bottle-feeding is the best solution for the short-term.|$|E

25|$|Producers and producer-groups <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> social {{premium to}} support {{socioeconomic}} {{development in a}} variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.|$|E

[...] Cornell, who had been poor {{for most of his}} life, suddenly found himself looking for ways that he could do the greatest good for with his money. He wrote, [...] "My greatest care now is how to <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> large income to do the greatest good to those who are properly dependent on me, to the poor and to posterity." [...] Cornell's self-education and hard work would lead him {{to the conclusion that the}} greatest end for his philanthropy was in the need of colleges for the teaching of practical pursuits such as agriculture, the applied sciences, veterinary medicine and engineering, and in finding opportunities for the poor to attain such an education.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} get the Bill passed through Parliament, a number of {{concessions}} had to be made to its original content. [...] The compromises made included limiting the Act to boroughs with populations of more than 10,000 where at least two-thirds of local ratepayers had to vote in favour of provision in a local referendum. [...] The Bill would repeal the Museums Act 1845 and so, in order to continue funding museums of arts and science as well as the new free libraries, local rates could be increased, but by no more than ½d per £1. [...] As stated in the Bill however, it was only permitted to <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> levy on library and museum buildings and staff but not on books and other stock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{length and}} format of {{specialist}} anaesthesiologist training programmes varies {{from country to}} country, but can range from four to ten years, on top of initial medical school training to be awarded a medical degree. Anesthesiologists in training <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> time gaining experience in various different subspecialties of anesthesiology and undertake various advanced postgraduate examinations and skill assessments. These lead to the award of a specialist qualification {{at the end of}} their training indicating that they are an expert in the field and may be licensed to practise independently. Other healthcare professionals likes nurses and dentists provide some anesthesia services, but they have other titles such as [...] "certified registered nurse anesthetist,” “anesthesia assistant,” etc which also note their training path and are not eligible and do not take the expert anesthesiology examinations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{particularly}} significant production – from Beckett's perspective – {{took place in}} Lüttringhausen Prison near Remscheid in Germany. An inmate obtained {{a copy of the}} French first edition, translated it himself into German and obtained permission to stage the play. The first night had been on 29 November 1953. He wrote to Beckett in October 1954: [...] "You will be surprised to be receiving a letter about your play Waiting for Godot, from a prison where so many thieves, forgers, toughs, homos, crazy men and killers <b>spend</b> <b>this</b> bitch of a life waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting. Waiting for what? Godot? Perhaps." [...] Beckett was intensely moved and intended to visit the prison to see a last performance of the play but it never happened. This marked [...] "the beginning of Beckett's enduring links with prisons and prisoners ... He took a tremendous interest in productions of his plays performed in prisons ... He even gave Rick Cluchey, a former prisoner from San Quentin, financial and moral support over a period of many years." [...] Cluchey played Vladimir in two productions in the former Gallows room of the San Quentin California State Prison, which had been converted into a 65-seat theatre and, like the German prisoner before him, went on to work on a variety of Beckett's plays after his release. (The 1953 Lüttringhausen and 1957 San Quentin Prison productions of Waiting For Godot were the subject of the 2010 documentary film The Impossible Itself, produced and directed by Jacob Adams.) ...|$|E
