500|$|According to Reiser, Cameron {{cast him}} against type as a villain. The actor said that Cameron failed to {{introduce}} Burke as a surprising villain {{because of his}} suspicious demeanor and dialogue in his first scenes. In Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley, a 2004 literary analysis of the Alien franchise, Jason Smith and Ximena Gallardo-C. describe Burke as a [...] "monster" [...] who is the by-product of organizational culture and willing to have Ripley and Newt impregnated for capital gain because of their [...] "'natural' wombs". In a deleted scene during Ripley's incursion into the Alien hive, shown in the 2010 Blu-ray edition of the Alien Anthology, she discovers a cocooned Burke who reveals {{that he has been}} impregnated; he begs Ripley to kill him, but instead <b>she</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> a grenade for him to detonate.|$|E

It is revealed early on that Rita was physically and sexually abused by Paul Bennett (Mark Pellegrino), her ex-husband {{and the father of}} her children, Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey). Dexter's sister Debra Morgan answered a domestic violence call and saved her life. Rita, who is ignorant of Dexter's secret life as a serial killer, appears regularly throughout the first season as his main source of support. She plays a much larger role in the episode [...] "Return to Sender", in which Paul is released from prison and demands to be at Astor's birthday party. Rita asks that he not come to the party. In [...] "Circle of Friends", Rita tells Paul he can see his children only through supervised visits for six months before she will consider letting him have unsupervised visitation rights. <b>She</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> divorce papers that include that clause, and Paul signs them. In [...] "Father Knows Best", however, Paul begins threatening Rita again when she prevents him from seeing the children. He forces his way into her house, where she defends herself by hitting him over the head with a baseball bat. In [...] "Seeing Red", Paul presses charges against Rita for assault.

After Paul loses consciousness, Dexter drives him back to his hotel and plants drugs on him. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
500|$|In the present, Ana Lucia starts {{questioning}} Henry Gale in the hatch, {{but suddenly}} he attacks her, {{and is only}} stopped when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) knocks him unconscious. Locke asks Henry why he attacked Ana Lucia, but has never tried to hurt him. Henry says that Locke is [...] "one of the good ones". Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia {{not to try to}} get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after <b>she</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too. Michael then walks into the armory where Henry is being held. Instead of shooting Henry, Michael shoots himself in the arm.|$|E

This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, {{to the tune of}} Martin Luther's hymn [...] "Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein" [...] (Oh God, look down from heaven). Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. <b>She</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> the magic flute to help them through the trials (""). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.|$|E

2500|$|Sophia [...] "Sophie" [...] Aubrey meets Jack Aubrey in Post Captain, {{the second}} novel, {{when he is}} ashore in England due to the Peace of Amiens. She is the eldest of the three Williams sisters. She is {{described}} as very beautiful, fair, tall and with a perfect complexion. She and Maturin develop a close friendship lasting {{to the end of}} the series. Sophia followed Maturin's advice to tell Aubrey her true feelings, which advice proves wise. Her similar advice to Maturin to propose to Diana Villiers is dismissed by Maturin in Post Captain, and he misses the moment (later said also by Villiers in HMS Surprise). She grows in the courage of her convictions, agreeing to meet Aubrey aboard HMS Lively in Post Captain to agree not to marry anyone else; at Madeira (HMS Surprise) by travelling on a frigate with his friend Heneage Dundas as captain; en route, the frigate, and thus Sophia, sees some action. She is Jack's wife beginning in the fourth novel, The Mauritius Command. Her upbringing and values ensure that she does not share Aubrey's history of affairs, and they have a happy marriage and three children (twin girls, Charlotte and Fanny, and a boy, George). Sophia proves to be very competent at keeping accounts, in addition to successfully managing a household whose main provider (Jack) is often absent for months at a time. She is the stable person in his life. Sophia has two younger sisters, Cecelia and Frances, who appear in Post-Captain and are mentioned in HMS Surprise. Cecelia's young daughter is raised with her twin cousins, as Cecelia travels with her husband, in The Mauritius Command. Frances is said to be having a child in Ulster in book seven of the series, The Surgeon's Mate (112). Sophia meets her husband's son from a youthful romance when, full grown, he seeks out his father for his blessing in The Reverse of the Medal. This meeting does not upset her; <b>she</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> a note to bring to her husband in the event the two meet at the West Indies station. In The Letter of Marque, Sophia visits fictional Shelmerston to train and otherwise aid the newly hired purser for the privately owned ship Surprise.|$|E

6000|$|PROSERPINE (coming at {{him again}} {{on her way back}} to her work). Yes, you do: you IMITATE him. Why do you tuck your {{umbrella}} under your left arm instead of carrying it in your hand like anyone else? Why do you walk with your chin stuck out before you, hurrying along with that eager look in your eyes--you, who never get up before half past nine in the morning? Why do you say [...] "knoaledge" [...] in church, though you always say [...] "knolledge" [...] in private conversation! Bah! do you think I don't know? (She goes back to the typewriter.) Here, come and set about your work: we've wasted enough time for one morning. Here's a copy of the diary for to-day. (<b>She</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> a memorandum.) ...|$|E

But he is glued to the high horse, and won't come down. Well, <b>she</b> <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> back the ring, proper enough; and George goes away and hits the booze. Yep. That's what done it. I bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left. George boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown.
