40|$|Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) {{estimation}} of a received signal {{is an important}} and essential information for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. This is because in OFDM system, robustness in frequency selective channels can be achieved using adaptable transmission parameters. Therefore, to reckon these parameters, knowledge of SNR estimates obtained by channel state information is required for optimal performance. The performance of SNR estimation algorithm is contingent on channel estimates obtained through channel estimation schemes. In this project, two estimators which are Least Square (LS) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimators are simulated and analyzed. From the result obtained, LS shows better performance than MMSE in terms of Symbol Error Rate (SER) and Mean Square Error (MSE) via computer simulation. With different number of <b>sub</b> <b>carriers</b> implemented for the system model, 16, 32, 64, the result apparently shows that the SER curve of the estimator with {{the highest number of}} <b>sub</b> <b>carriers,</b> 64 is significantly lower compare with the other estimators with <b>sub</b> <b>carriers</b> of 16 and 32.

A true dual-standard PAL and SECAM video recorder therefore requires two color processing circuits, adding to complexity and expense.

40|$|Multicarrier {{systems are}} {{advantageous}} for {{high data rate}} transmissions in wireless environments due to their ease of implementation and tolerance for multipath delay spread. Currently, these systems as specified by the IEEE 802. 11 standards do not adapt to frequency-selective fading but simply choose a constant data modulation scheme and transmit power level for all <b>sub</b> <b>carriers</b> in the available signal bandwidth. Although these implementations maintain acceptable performance when channel conditions are poor, they do not efficiently utilize the full capacity of a transmission channel. In the prototype system of the Wireless Gigabit Local Area Network (WiGLAN) project at MIT, a more efficient scheme is demonstrated where the modulation scheme of each subcarrier is selected individually based on the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). To further improve the data rate of the WiGLAN system, this thesis describes the design of an adaptive transmit power allocation scheme that involves redistributing the power of "null" <b>sub</b> <b>carriers</b> with extremely low SNRs to the <b>sub</b> <b>carriers</b> that are utilized for data transmission.

Camcorders and VCRs of these standards sold in SECAM countries are internally PAL. They use an internal SECAM to PAL converter for recording of broadcast TV transmitted in SECAM. The result could be converted back to SECAM in some models; most people buying such expensive equipment would have a multistandard TV set and as such would not need a conversion. Digital camcorders or DVD players (with the exception of some early models) do not accept or output a SECAM analog signal.

Its high spectral efficiency, low inter symbol interference and very less cross talk makes it highly used in TV broadcasting or wire line systems like ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line). The increasingly useful OFDM (Orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplexing) systems too suffer from one major disadvantage of having a high PAPR, which is due to the superposition of N <b>sub</b> <b>carriers.</b> In this letter we counter the high PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio) using PTS (Partial Transmit Sequence) algorithm, which is a more efficient technique than some other PAPR reducing techniques like SLM (Selected Mapping), clipping and amplitude filtering.
