5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from <b>some</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, <b>some</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led <b>some</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and <b>some</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Lawrence Hill {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways, which oversaw a gradual decline of services at Lawrence Hill. Passenger numbers along the Clifton Extension Railway, now known as the Severn Beach Line, also dropped, and in 1963 the Beeching report suggested that all services along the line be withdrawn. In the end, services continued to Severn Beach but were discontinued via Henbury and Pilning. Staff were withdrawn from the station from 17 July 1967 as a cost-saving measure. The footbridge was demolished by 1970, forcing passengers to change platform via the steps to Church Road at the south end of the station. Most of the station buildings were demolished in August 1970, but there were still <b>some</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> westernmost platform in 1979. By 1974 the platforms serving the eastern tracks had been removed, with the tracks themselves removed in 1984. Plans to use the disused trackbed as part of a light rail scheme linking the city centre to the northern suburbs were formed in the late 1990s, with the aim of an operational scheme by 2008, but the plans had been shelved by 2004. It was suggested in 2008 that the trackbed could be used as a cycle path to join together communities which had been separated by the construction of the M32 motorway, however this was dropped due to Network Rail asserting that the trackbed might be necessary for future rail expansion.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because of}} its working methods to ensure strict privacy, the Bilderberg Group has been criticised for its lack of {{transparency}} and accountability.
