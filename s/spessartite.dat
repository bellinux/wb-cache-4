In such a layer, the earlier formed birnessite is transformed into nsutite along with minor cryptomelane. These latter minerals can locally evolve into ramsdellite or pyrolusite.

40|$|Abstract: Permo-Carboniferous rifting in Europe was {{accompanied}} by the widespread emplacement of mantle-derived magmas forming regional dyke swarms and sills in northern England, Scotland, Norway and southern Sweden during the late Stephanian and early Autunian. The trends of the dyke swarms intersect at a focal point in the Kattegat south of the Oslo Graben, and are probably all related to a single magmatic entre that could be plume-related. The WNW- to NW-trending dyke swarm at the SW margin of the Fennoscandian Shield in southern Sweden is composed mainly of tholeiitic dolerites, with lesser amounts of alkaline mafic rocks (camptonites, alkali basalts and <b>spessartites)</b> and trachytes. The alkaline mafic rocks are enriched in Ba, Sr, Nb, P and CO 2, implying ametasomatic enrichment of their upper-mantle source prior to melting. After generation of alkaline melts by relatively small degrees of partial melting, increased xtension {{was accompanied}} by the formation of subalkaline tholeiitic magmas. Whole-rock compositions (Mg-numbers between 55 and 30) and mineral chemistry (olivine Fo 60 -Fo 40; clinopyroxene approximately Wo 30 En 45 Fs 15; plagioclase An 70 -Ans 0) indicate relatively evolved melts that have undergone crystal fractionation of olivine and clinopyroxene.

40|$|The Grownnedal-Ika ring complex (1299 +/- 17 Ma) in the Gardar province, South Greenland is {{composed}} {{of a range of}} layered nepheline syenites which were intruded at a late stage by xenolithic syenite and a plug of carbonatite. The complex was subsequently intruded by a variety of basic dykes, including olivine dolerites, kersantites, vogesites, <b>spessartites,</b> camptonites and an alnoite, and then extensively faulted. The nepheline syenite magmas produced by fractional crystallisation of basic magmas, show a range in delta(13) C (- 3. 86 to - 7. 57 parts per thousand) and delta(18) O (8. 27 to 15. 12 parts per thousand), distinctly different to the carbonatites which form a tight group with average delta(13) C = - 4. 31 +/- 0. 22 parts per thousand, (1 s. d.) and average delta(18) O = 7. 18 +/- 0. 41 parts per thousand (1 s. d.). Initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 isotope ratios (typically 0. 703) suggest the syenites and carbonatites have not assimilated crustal rocks, and therefore the C and O isotope variation within each group is a result of isotopic evolution during fractional crystallisation. A suite of lamprophyre dykes (delta(13) C - 3. 86 to - 7. 86 parts per thousand and delta(18) O 9. 12 to 10. 81 parts per thousand) form a coherent group whose stable isotope compositions overlap part of the syenite field, and again are distinctly different from the carbonatites. A single alnoite has delta(13) C = - 3. 32 parts per thousand and delta(18) O = 12. 34 parts per thousand. C and O isotope ratios are consistent with origins of syenitic and lamprophyric magmas from a similar source. Despite geochemical evidence which suggests a genetic link between nepheline syenites and carbonatites. C and O isotopic evidence shows that they are not related directly by liquid immiscibility.

40|$|Mafic and silicic dyke rocks, which {{occur in}} the Ag-U ore {{district}} of Jachymov (Joachimsthal) in the Krusne hory (Erzgebirge) belong to kersantites, diorite porphyries, and granite porphyries, subordinately to <b>spessartites.</b> Dykes of minettes are located outside the district and penetrate the Nejdek-Eibenstock granitic massif. Mafic and silicic dykes exhibit diverse cross-cutting relationships and form in places composite dykes. Lamprophyres correspond to shoshonitic magmas with high abundances of compatible (Cr, Ni) and incompatible elements (Rb, Ba, P). All mafic dykes were affected by a postmagmatic alteration manifested by replacement of primary olivine and pyroxenes by amphibole, biotite and chlorite. Granite porphyries crystallized from leucocratic, weakly peraluminous, low-P magmas with moderate enrichments in Rb and depletions in Ca, Sr and Zr. By contrast, diorite porphyries are intermediate rocks containing 62 - 65 wt. % SiO 2 whose geological occurrence and major-element composition suggest origin by magma mixing involving lamprophyric and silicic melts, with simultaneous fractionation of biotite. The Th/U ratios in all dyke rocks correspond to chondritic and crustal values and demonstrate that whole-rock uranium contents were neither significantly increased nor affected by contemporaneous mineralization events. The stable isotope composition has been determined for whole rocks (O, C, S) and carbonate minerals (C, O). Wholerock δ 18 O values range between 1. 6 to 7. 8 Ã¢Â€Â° SMOW and do not show any systematic variations with the rock types. The isotopic composition of carbonates {{is represented by the}} following values: δ 18 O = 19. 6 to 25. 0 Ã¢Â€Â° SMOW and δ 13 C = - 5. 7 to - 9. 0 Ã¢Â€Â° PDB. The high positive values of δ 18 O of carbonates are in a remarkable contrast to compositions of primary magmatic carbonates and indicate the carbonate formation during low-temperature hydrothermal event(s). Sulphides in kersantites and diorite porphyries yielded δ 34 S = 0. 5 to 6. 6 Ã¢Â€Â° CDT, which document crustal in addition to mantle source of sulphur consistent with average value in the Saxothuringian crust (~ 5 Ã¢Â€Â° CDT). Bulk magnetic susceptibility of dyke rocks shows a general decrease from mafic to silicic magmas in a sequence as follows: kersantites - 500, minettes - 350, diorite porphyries - 350 and granite porphyries - 50 Ã¢ÂˆÂ™ 10 - 6 [SI]. Local increases up to 5000 Ã¢ÂˆÂ™ 10 - 6 [SI] are due to accessory pyrrhotite in kersantites and diorite porphyries. Mafic dykes in the Western Krusne hory (Erzgebirge) are preferentially found within the Jachymov-Gera tectonic zone and demonstrate spatial focusing of ascending mantle-derived melts.

New zircon SHRIMP ages for the Lindeques Drift Intrusion (2054. 8 ± 5. 7 Ma) and Roodekraal Complex (2053 ± 9. 2 Ma) are indistinguishable from that of the Bushveld magmatic event (∼ 2. 06 to 2. 05 Ga). The dominant rock types in the Lindeques Drift and Heidelberg Intrusions are even-grained and porphyritic spessartites which essentially are clinopyroxene-magnetite (-ilmenite) ± olivine cumulates with variable fractions (estimated 15 to 30 %) of interstitially crystallized magma. The concentration of magmatic amphibole (edenite-magnesiohastingsite), responsible for the porphyritic texture of the <b>spessartite,</b> is directly proportional to the fraction of trapped magma, which also crystallized interstitial plagioclase, sphene, sulphide, apatite, microperthite and biotite. The Lindeques Drift <b>spessartite</b> is cut by fine-grained dykes and sills(?) of diorite and syenodiorite. Low-silica diorite in the Lindeques Drift Intrusion was produced by the reaction of the parental magma with the dolomitic country rock of the Chuniespoort Group through desilicificaton and de-alumination.

The gneissic rocks are interrupted by acidic and basic igneous rocks, such as white and pink pegmatite, aplites granodiorites, and dykes (Ahmed et al. 1977). Typically, the granitoids are associated with many enclaves of schists and gneisses. The Cape Coast granitic units are sometimes well foliated and often magmatic potash-rich granitoids in the form of muscovite, biotite, granite and granodiorite, granodiorites biotite gneiss, aplites and pegmatites (Ahmed et al. 1977).

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of varying cover gas compositions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of single run gas-metal arc welds (GMAW) on HSLA- 100 plate and seven different cover gas compositions containing varying amounts of argon, oxygen, and carbon dioxide were evaluated. A statistical and quantitative analysis of the nonmetallic inclusions in the welds metal was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive analysis of x-rays (EDX). These results showed that increasing the oxygen content of the cover gas reduced the inclusion size but increases the number density compared with pure argon cover gas, and that this was reflected in the weld metal microstructure since increasing amounts of acicular ferrite were detected predominantly to be of the <b>spessartite</b> composition (3 MnO, Al 2,O 3 3 SiO 2). As a result of increasing cover gas oxygen the strength of the weld metal appeared to be lowered due to the oxidation of aluminum, silicon, manganese, and possibly titanium.

40|$|The {{epigenetic}} lead-zinc-barium-strontium mineralisation of the Loch Sunart area of Argyllshire {{has taken}} place along channels provided by dykes and faults. Dolerite and lamprophyre dykes of Permo-Carboniferous age constitute the most important structural controls. These were intruded along lines of displacement {{some of which were}} initiated before and some after the intrusion of the Strontian Caledonian Granitic Complex. The re-opening of certain faults after dyke intrusion and prior to mineralisation was connected with movements of probable Permian age. The dykes are strongly altered at mineral vein contacts Mafic minerals have been replaced by chlorites, serpentines and carbonates, plagioclases severely albitised, magnetite-ilmenite grains converted to leucoxene and rock textures disintegrated. In rare cases, potash feldspar and iron-magnesian carbonates have been formed. During mineralisation, iron, magnesium and sodium have been lost to the mineralising fluids and carbon-dioxide, potassium, sulphur and sometimes calcium, bariurn and water gained by the dyke-rocks. Comparative data for mineralised dykes from Lanarkshire, Linlithgowshire and Shropshire have been collected. The important Blackcraig Vein dyke (Kircudbrightshire) is not significantly mineralised. In the geological history of the Loch Sunart area, numerous lamprophyre sheets, hornblendic schist bands and amphibolites were formed within the Moine Basement Complex before the emplacement of the strontian Granite. Small numbers of minette, <b>spessartite</b> vogesite, kersantite and. felsite dykes are of post-Granite, (probably Devonian) age. Later abundant W. N. W. trending dykes, often mineralised, are considered to be connected with Carboniferous and Permian volcancity. Among them are broad quartz-dolerite intrusives which have thermally altered the adjacent country-rocks to a marked degree. Narrow dykes of normal dolerite, olivine- dolerite and hornblende-bearing olivine-dolerite display a complete petrographical gradation into camptonite through camptonitic dolerite.

Lava flows that are largely basaltic, but range in composition from basalt to alkali rhyolite, compose about 10 to 15 percent of the 1, 000 -m thickness of the Liberty Hills Formation of the Heritage Group. Eighty-four samples have been analyzed for major, minor, and trace elements by x-ray fluorescence. Field relations and comparison of chemical composition of intrusive and extrusive rocks suggest that all igneous rocks {{in the southern}} Heritage Range except the dacite stock were emplaced in Cambrian time; all have undergone pumpellyite-actinolite or greenschist facies metamorphism. A four-point Rb-Sr isochron yields a mid-Devonian (369 ± 18 Ma) emplacement age for the dacite stock. The extrusive igneous rock suite is dominated by basalts but also includes rhyolites, dacites, and sparse andesites and is thus bimodal. The relict primary mineralogy, distribution of alteration-resistant trace elements (Nb, Ti, Y, Zr), and incorporation within a thick sequence of carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks all suggest that the mafic igneous rocks are continental basalts whose original chemical compositions were largely mildly tholeiitic or transitional between tholeiitic and alkali basalt; some calc-alkaline traits are also evident. Discrimination diagrams based on alteration-resistant trace elements and distribution of large ion lithophile elements (Ba, Rb, Sr) suggest that the felsic and intermediate rocks also possess tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, and alkaline traits. Age relations and comparison of chemical compositions indicate that the southern Heritage Range igneous rocks are not correlative with either the Jurassic Ferrar Super-group or the Jurassic Kirwan Volcanics of the Transantarctic Mountains. The most likely possible correlatives might be diabasic sills and dikes and subordinate plugs and sills of felsic porphyry intrusive into the upper Precambrian Patuxent Formation, which crops out in the Neptune Range of the Pensacola Mountains 500 km to the southeast. Tholeiitic suites with contemporaneous calc-alkaline and alkaline traits are unusual but have been reported from the Yellowknife volcanic belt in Canada’s Northwest Territories and from southeastern Maine.

40|$|The Port Cygnet {{alkaline}} complex {{consists of}} small scattered concordant and discordant intrusions of Cretaceous age emplaced in Jurassic dolerite and Permian fluvioglacial sediments {{in the vicinity}} of Port Cygnet, southern Tasmania. The alkaline rocks are miaskitic and fall into two main groups: one is a group of slightly oversaturated syenites with a porphyritic texture rich in phenocrysts of oligoclase (syenite porphyries), and the other consists of nepheline syenites, characteristically with a flow structure and containing phenocrysts of euhedral sanidine crystals, with feldspathoids in the groundmass, and occasionally as phenocrysts. These are the sanidine rocks or sanidine porphyries. The primary magma was a potash-rich upper mantle or lower crustal, partial melt (of a mafic alkali parent) probably equivalent ultimately to a tinguaite which began crystallizing in a magma chamber with subsequent successive injections of magma containing coarser sanidine phenocrysts.. This gave rise to the nepheline syenites. The intrusion of the potassic magma was accompanied by volatiles with evidence of the presence of water, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, demonstrated by the presence of both primary and secondary reaction mineral products. The porphyritic syenites seem to have been derived by the mixing of a potassic upper mantle or lower crustal partial melt, with a crustal partial melt of the feldspathic matrix of an amphibolite followed by subsequent initial crystallization at depth before injection into the country rocks. The model is based on microscopic and textural characteristics, chemical compositions, mineralogy and initial strontium isotope ratios. Variation of the syenite porphyries due to addition of recrystallized amphibole from the parent amphibolite formed a horn-blende porphyry. Fractionation of the syenitic melt has resulted in a group of mixed feldspar phenocryst rocks showing potash feldspar reacting with plagioclase phenocrysts in a brown matrix. Assimilation of mineralized carbonates by the magma has produced one rock unique in having phenocrysts of <b>spessartite</b> and epidote. Sulphur from the country rocks was mobilized by this intrusion. At Regatta Point, on the western shore of Port Cygnet, the. potassic magma reacted with Jurassic dolerite to form hybrid rocks.

40|$|Introduction Lamprophyres are mesocratic to melanocratic igneous rocks, usually hypabyssal, with a panidiomorphic {{texture and}} {{abundant}} mafic phenocrysts of dark mica or amphibole (or both) {{with or without}} pyroxene, with or without olivine, set in a matrix of the same minerals, and with alkali-feldspar restricted to the groundmass (Woolley et al., 1996). Lamprophyres are frequently associated with orogenic settings and a mantle modified by dehydration of subducted slab (Gibson et al., 1995). Small outcrops of lamprophyres with Paleozoic to Oligocene age are reported from the central parts of Iran (Torabi 2009 and 2010). The primary magmas of these lamprophyres were derived from decompression melting of the mantle induced by a tensional regime of continental crust (Torabi, 2010). Bayat and Torabi (2011) called {{the western part of}} the CEIM (Central-East Iranian Microcontinent) (Anarak to Bayazeh) a “Paleozoic lamprophyric province” and suggested that the lamprophyre magmas were formed by subduction of Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust from the Early to late Paleozoic which resulted in the mantle metasomatism and enrichment. Lamprophyric dykes and stocks of the Kal-e-kafi area (Central Iran, Northern part of Yazd Block) cross-cut the Eocene volcanic rocks and other older rock units such as Cretaceous limestone. These lamprophyres are mainly composed of hornblende (magnesio-hastingsite), clinopyroxene (diopside) and plagioclase (labradorite to bytownite) as phenocryst, in a matrix of fine to medium grained of the same minerals and orthoclase, apatite, magnetite, chlorite and epidote. In this paper that is a report on the first study on the calc-alkaline lamprophyres of Central Iran, the petrography and mineral chemistry of calc-alkaline lamprophyric dykes of the Kal-e-kafi area are discussed. Materials and methods Chemical composition of minerals were conducted at Kanazawa University (Kanazawa, Japan) using the wavelength-dispersive electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) (JEOL JXA- 8800 R), with 20 kV accelerating potential, 20 nA beam current and a counting time of 40 seconds. Natural minerals and synthetic materials were used as standards. The ZAF program was used for data correction. The Fe 3 + content of minerals was estimated by stoichiometry. The Mg# and Fe# were calculated as [Mg/(Mg+Fe 2 +) ], and [Fe 2 +/(Fe 2 ++Mg) ] atomic ratio of minerals, respectively. Trace element values of phenocrystic clinopyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) using an ArF 193 nm Excimer Laser coupled to an Agilent 7500 S at the Earth Science Department of the Kanazawa University (Japan). The diameter of the analyzed points was 60 micrometers for clinopyroxene and 120 micrometers for amphibole and plagioclase. Mineral abbreviations are adopted from Whitney and Evans (2010). Results and Discussion Lamprophyres of the Kal-e-kafi area (Central Iran, West of Yazd Block) are exposed as dykes and stocks which cross-cut the Eocene volcanic rocks and other older rock units such as Cretaceous limestone. Field studies indicate that calc-alkaline lamprophyric dykes of the Kal-e-kafi (east of Anarak) are younger than the other igneous rocks. According to the results of petrography and mineral chemistry, the mesocratic lamprophyres of Kal-e-kafi area are calc-alkaline <b>spessartite.</b> Unique values of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 associated with oscillatory zoning of clinopyroxenes reveal the crystallization of clinopyroxenes during ascending of magma. Plagioclase phenocrysts are labradorite to bytownite in composition and the plagioclases of matrix are labradorite. Chemical composition diversity of plagioclase indicates the fractional crystallization of these lamprophyres. Amphibole thermometry estimate average temperature of 860 °C and barometry by Anderson and Smith (1995) shows 1. 5 to 3 kbars pressure. Clinopyroxene thermobarometry calculate 1150 °C temperature and pressure between 2 to 5 kbars. The geochemical features and thermobarometry of the Kal-e-kafi <b>spessartite</b> minerals suggest that the primary lamprophyric magma was derived from partial melting of a lithospheric mantle spinel lherzolite. Changes in values of pressure, water content, and Oxygen fugacity during magma ascending lead to oscillatory zoning minerals. Based on the mineral chemistry, it can be concluded that the Kal-e-kafi lamprophyres were formed in a subduction-related environment by a calc-alkaline magmatism. References Anderson, J.

40|$|The Ramona {{pegmatite}} {{district of}} central San Diego County, California, {{has been known}} {{as a source of}} gem garnet, tourmaline, and topaz since the early 1900 's. All the occurrences of known commercial importance lie within an area of about 1. 5 square miles. The dominant rocks of the district are tonalites and granodiorites of the Cretaceous southern California batholith. The nearest outcrop of older rocks, the Triassic Julian schist, is about one mile from the main group of pegmatites. Eocene Poway conglomerate caps hills and ridges in a west-trending belt that lies south of the district. The pegmatite bodies, ranging from small stringers to large dikes about 8 feet thick, are remarkably persistent along their strike. They form a pattern of subparallel anastomosing units with a general northwest strike and a westward dip of 35 to 45 degrees. The dikes occur mainly in the tonalites, and appear to have been emplaced along a well-developed set of fractures. These fractures are not systematically related to other structural features of the area, and they transect a major contact between plutons of different composition. Most of the pegmatite dikes are asymmetrically zoned, each with a footwall unit of layered aplite and a hanging-wall unit rich in graphic granite. Typical inner zones of the dikes consist of quartz-perthite pegmatite, pocket-bearing pegmatite, and albite-quartz rock. Aplite generally constitutes about one-third of the containing pegmatite body. It is a soda-rich rock, with about 40 percent of modal albite. Garnet-tourmaline layers in the aplite are roughly parallel to the footwall of the pegmatite body. Typical graphic granite, which also forms about one-third of the containing pegmatite body, has a quartz-perthite ratio of 1 : 3. The microcline-albite ratio within the perthite is about 2 : 1. Studies of mineral orientation show that the quartz rods in a single specimen of graphic granite have a common crystallographic orientation, but that this orientation is different for different specimens and is not consonant with any crystallographic law. Moreover, the c axis of quartz is generally not the axis of elongation of the rod, nor does the c axis have a systematic angular relation to the walls of the pegmatite dike. Successive surfaces cut in a block of graphic granite show many interconnections of the quartz rods. The quartz-perthite pegmatite commonly contains large euhedral crystals of perthite and ragged-edged blocks of graphic granite in an allotriomorphic groundmass consisting mainly of quartz, perthite, and albite. Albite-quartz rocks occur as fracture fillings and irregular masses within the pegmatite dikes. The albite commonly has a curved cleavelandite form. Modally these rocks have an albite-quartz ratio of 2 : 1. The pocket pegmatite, which ordinarily occurs in the quartz-perthite rock, consists mainly of smoky quartz with some cleavelandite and topaz. The pockets themselves form spherical voids to thin openings with irregular outlines. A period of corrosion and secondary mineralization followed crystallization of the pegmatites. The sequence of removal of minerals was quartz [...] ->microcline [...] ->albite, and the sequence of secondary mineralization was albite [...] ->orthoclase (with an adularia habit) [...] ->quartz with a typical low-temperature crystal form. <b>Spessartite</b> and secondary tourmaline most likely crystallized during the end stages of the corrosion or the beginning of the albite mineralization. Pseudomorphs of manganese oxide after garnet (?), as well as pseudomorphs of muscovite after tourmaline, are present in otherwise unaltered quartz-feldspar rocks. The bulk mineralogical composition of the pegmatite bodies is 30 to 35 percent for each of the minerals quartz, microcline, and albite. Muscovite, garnet, and tourmaline form about 5 percent of the total rock. The experimentally determined liquidus for a composite sample of the pegmatite under various water-vapor pressures is about 50 °C, higher than the corresponding liquidus for the ternary minimum of the system KAlSi 3 O 8 -NaAlSi 3 O 8 -SiO 2 -H 2 O. Similarly, the pegmatite solidus is about 50 degrees lower than that for the ternary minimum, and it can be further lowered by the addition of fluorine-bearing minerals to the rock melt. Water is soluble in a melt of the composite sample of pegmatite to the extent of about 3. 5 and 5. 0 weight percent at 1 and 2 kilobars, respectively, of water-vapor pressure. Laboratory crystallization of the pegmatite melts was found to be a fairly slow process, requiring several weeks to form 1 or 2 percent of crystals. The crystals are larger and form more rapidly in melts under high water-vapor pressure and with little undercooling. Spherulitic crystal aggregates form with undercooling of 75 degrees or more. The natural pegmatites probably crystallized from a magma and a coexisting vapor that were residual from the magma forming the large composite southern California batholith. An hypothesis of crystallization in a restricted system best explains the features of the pegmatite bodies. Spatial relationships indicate that the dikes crystallized from the walls inward. Hypotheses are presented to explain the layered aplites either as products of rhythmic crystallization and crystal settling or as products of in-situ rhythmic crystallization progressing upward from the footwalls of the dikes. The rhythmic crystallization could have been a result of pressure fluctuations. Graphic granite cocrystallized with the layered aplite. All available evidence indicates simultaneous crystallization of quartz and feldspar, with the graphic texture a result of accelerated growth of one mineral alternating with accelerated growth of the other mineral. Temperature and water vapor-pressure during crystallization of the graphic granite and layered aplite were most likely about 690 ° to 715 °C. and 3000 to 4500 bars, respectively. The graphic granite and the quartz-perthite pegmatite probably crystallized from a melt and a coexisting vapor, and the layered aplite from the melt. The other pegmatite units are thought to be products of crystallization from a hydrothermal fluid that was mainly {{in the form of a}} vapor...|$|E
