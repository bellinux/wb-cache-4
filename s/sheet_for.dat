5|$|The {{production}} of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly {{at the beginning of}} the episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The beat <b>sheet</b> <b>for</b> the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back <b>sheet</b> <b>for</b> the cab, and was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E
