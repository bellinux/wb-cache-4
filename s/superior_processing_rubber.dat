40|$|The major {{chemical}} changes during the <b>processing</b> of <b>rubber</b> occur with the breakdown in mastication and during vulcanization of the molded tire. There is little chemical change daring the compounding, calendering, extrusion, and molding steps. Reclaiming {{is the process}} of converting scrap rubber into an unsaturated, processible product that can be vulcanized with sulfur. Pyrolysis of scrap rubber yields a complex mixture of liquids, gas, and residue in varying ratios dependent {{on the nature of the}} scrap and the conditions of pyrolysis. The literature has little information on the chemistry of <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> and disposal; it has been necessary to draw from various sources to develop a picture of the chemical events that may occur. This review is limited to natural rubber and to the important synthetic rubbers of the tire industry. <b>Processing</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>processing</b> consists of operations performed on materials or systems to increase their utility through chemical reaction, flow, or permanent change in a physical property (1). The major processing steps wherein most chemical changes occur in tire production are: polymer breakdown by mastication on a mill or in a Banbury, extrusion, calendering, and curing. The tire building process and molding in the curing operation do not normally involve chemical reactions. Mastication In 1820 Hancock discovered the effect of mastication on rubber. The process has become basic in the commercial <b>processing</b> of <b>rubber.</b> Mastication gradually renders the rubber more plastic and decreases its solution viscosity. It is now known that the high molecular wveight of rubber is reduced during this degradation. Even a light mastication can reduc...|$|R

50|$|The City {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} area, and its products include rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, legumes, root crops and commercial {{crops such as}} rubber, coffee, banana and pineapple. During the past years, corn {{used to be the}} pre-dominant crop in the city.

These products are usually sold in the local market, or in nearby municipalities of the province. There are also farmers producing larger volume of corn and rice who sell their products in Cagayan de Oro.Agri-based industries primarily poultry and piggery, now flourish in the City.

40|$|SummaryThree {{classes of}} perceptual {{phenomena}} have repeatedly {{been associated with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) : <b>superior</b> <b>processing</b> of fine detail (local structure), either inferior processing of overall/global structure or an ability to ignore disruptive global/contextual information, and impaired motion perception. This review evaluates {{the quality of the}} evidence bearing on these three phenomena. We argue that while <b>superior</b> local <b>processing</b> has been robustly demonstrated, conclusions about global processing cannot be definitively drawn from the experiments to date, which have generally not precluded observers using more local cues. Perception of moving stimuli is impaired in ASD, but explanations in terms of magnocellular/dorsal deficits {{do not appear to be}} sufficient. We suggest that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) may provide a neural basis for the range of motion-processing deficits observed in ASD, including biological motion perception.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{occupational}} exposure to <b>rubber</b> <b>processing,</b> smoking, and alcohol drinking on lymphocyte DNA damage. Subjects and Methods: Of 371 employees (197 men and 174 women) from a rubber factory in Guangzhou, 281 were <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers from five production sections and 90 were managerial workers. Information on occupational exposure, smoking, and drinking was collected by interviews. Blood samples were taken in the morning by venipuncture. DNA damages were measured by the Comet assay. Possible DNA-protein crosslinks were broken down by proteinase K. Tail moment, measured by Komet 4. 0 image analysis software, was the measure of DNA damage. Results: The <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers had larger tail moment than the managerial workers (Geometric mean, 95 %CI) [1. 77 μm (1. 64 - 1. 90) versus 1. 52 μm (1. 36 - 1. 71), P = 0. 04]. Both smoking [1. 93 μm (1. 74 - 2. 13) versus 1. 59 μm (1. 47 - 1. 71), P = 0. 003] and alcohol drinking [2. 21 μm (1. 87 - 2. 62) versus 1. 63 μm (1. 53 - 1. 74), P < 0. 001] increased tail moment. Tail moment differed significantly among job categories (F = 3. 21, P = 0. 008), the largest was observed in mixers. In the non-smoking and non- drinking workers, <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers had larger tail moment than managerial workers after adjusting for age (P = 0. 033). General linear model analysis showed that after adjusting for each other, occupational exposure (P = 0. 027), smoking (P = 0. 012), and alcohol drinking (P = 0. 013) was associated with larger tail moment, whereas age and gender had no effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Brominated phosphate, {{brominated}} polycarbonate oligomer, and brominated polystyrene {{were compared}} as flame retardants for glass-filled polybutylene terephthalate resin.

The brominated phosphate flame retardant {{was shown to}} give the best bal-ance of properties for glass-filled polybutylene terephthalate. The viscosity and shear sensitivity data indicate that the PBT/brominated phosphate resin should have the best mold flow. Normalized output data show the extrusion pro-cess to be Zone 3 controlled.
