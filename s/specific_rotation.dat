25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid.

40|$|In this work, four isohexide-derived {{isomeric}} dianhydrides were synthesized {{through a}} four-step procedure using isohexide and chloro-N-phenylphthalimides {{as the starting}} materials. The one-step solution polymerization of these dianhydrides with petroleum- or bio-based diamines enabled the synthesis of poly(ether imide) s (PEIs), which had viscosities of 0. 41 to 2. 40 dL∙g− 1. The isohexide-derived PEIs were characterized based upon their solubility and their thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. The results showed {{that most of the}} isohexide-derived PEIs possessed comparable glass transition temperatures (Tg), tensile strengths, and moduli to petroleum-based PEIs. However, the thermo-oxidative stability of the PEIs was found to be lower than that of the common petroleum-based PEIs. Moreover, the PEIs displayed good optical activity, which originated from their unique chiral isohexide moieties. The isomeric effects of dianhydride monomers on the properties of the resulting PEIs were comparatively studied. The results suggested that the corresponding 4, 4 ′-linked PEIs possessed lower Tg, higher mechanical properties, and higher <b>specific</b> <b>rotations</b> compared to 3, 3 ′-linked polymers. Meanwhile, the polyimides with isomannide residue displayed higher Tg and more <b>specific</b> <b>rotations</b> than the corresponding polymers with isosorbide residue.

50|$|An anomer {{is a type}} of {{stereoisomer}} and epimer {{found in}} carbohydrate chemistry. While an epimer is a stereoisomer that differs in configuration at any single stereogenic center, an anomer is a cyclic saccharide and an epimer that differs in configuration, specifically at the hemiacetal/acetal carbon, also called the anomeric carbon. The anomeric carbon is the carbon derived from the carbonyl carbon (the ketone or aldehyde functional group) of the open-chain form of the carbohydrate molecule. Anomerization is the process of conversion of one anomer to the other. Anomers have different physical properties, melting points and <b>specific</b> <b>rotations.</b>|$|R
