40|$|This article {{contends that}} {{what appear to}} be the dystopic {{conditions}} of affective capitalism are just as likely to be felt in various joyful encounters as they are in atmospheres of fear associated with post 9 / 11 securitization. Moreover, rather than grasping these joyful encounters with capitalism as an ideological trick working directly on cognitive systems of belief, they are approached here by way of a repressive affective relation a population establishes between politicized <b>sensory</b> <b>environments</b> and what Deleuze and Guattari (1994) call a brain-becoming-subject. This is a radical relationality (Protevi, 2010) understood in this context as a mostly nonconscious brain-somatic process of subjectification occurring in contagious <b>sensory</b> <b>environments</b> populations become politically situated in. The joyful encounter is not therefore merely an ideological manipulation of belief, but following Gabriel Tarde (as developed in Sampson, 2012), belief is always the object of desire. The discussion starts by comparing recent efforts by Facebook to manipulate mass emotional contagion to a Huxleyesque control through appeals to joy. Attention is then turned toward further manifestations of affective capitalism; beginning with the so-called emotional turn in the neurosciences, which has greatly influenced marketing strategies intended to unconsciously influence consumer mood (and choice), and ending with a further comparison between encounters with Nazi joy in the 1930 s (Protevi, 2010) and the recent spreading of right wing populism similarly loaded with political affect. Indeed, the dystopian presence of a repressive political affect in all of these examples prompts an initial question concerning {{what can be done to}} a brain so that it involuntarily conforms to the joyful encounter. That is to say, what can affect theory say about an apparent brain-somatic vulnerability to affective suggestibility and a tendency toward mass repression? However, the paper goes on to frame a second (and perhaps more significant) question concerning what can a brain do. Through the work of John Protevi (in Hauptmann and Neidich (eds.), 2010 : 168 - 183), Catherine Malabou (2009) and Christian Borch (2005), the article discusses how affect theory can conceive of a brain-somatic relation to <b>sensory</b> <b>environments</b> that might be freed from its coincidence with capitalism. This second question not only leads to a different kind of illusion to that understood as a product of an ideological trick, but also abnegates a model of the brain which limits subjectivity in the making to a phenomenological inner self or Being in the world...|$|R

5000|$|Radial glia are now {{recognized}} as key progenitor {{cells in the}} developing nervous system. During the late stages of neurogenesis, radial glial cells divide asymmetrically in the ventricular zone, generating a new radial glial cell, {{as well as a}} postmitotic neuron or an intermediate progenitor (IPC) daughter cell. Intermediate progenitor cells then divide symmetrically in the subventricular zone to generate neurons. Local environmental cues such as Notch and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, developmental period, and differing abilities of radial glia to respond to environmental cues have all been shown to influence the type of radial glia and radial glia-derived daughter cells that will be produced. FGF and Notch signaling regulate the proliferation of radial glia and the rate of neurogenesis, which affects the surface area expansion of the cerebral cortex and its ability to form surface convolutions known as gyri (see gyrification). Radial glial cells show high levels of calcium transient activity, which is transmitted between RGCs in the ventricular zone and along the radial fibers bidirectionally to/from the cortical plate. [...] The calcium activity is thought to promote RGC proliferation and could be involved in radial communication before synapses are present in the brain. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that cues from the external <b>sensory</b> <b>environment</b> can also influence the proliferation and neural differentiation of radial glia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sensory {{experience}} {{alters the}} functional organization of cortical networks. Previous studies using behavioral training motivated by aversive or rewarding stimuli {{have demonstrated that}} cortical plasticity is specific to salient inputs in the <b>sensory</b> <b>environment.</b> Sensory experience associated with electrical activation of the basal forebrain (BasF) generates similar input specific plasticity. By directly engaging plasticity mechanisms and avoiding extensive behavioral training, BasFstimulation {{makes it possible to}} efficiently explore how specific sensory features contribute to cortical plasticity. This review summarizes our observations that cortical networks employ a variety of strategies to improve the representation of the <b>sensory</b> <b>environment.</b> Different combinations of receptive-field, temporal, and spectrotemporal plasticity were generated in primary auditory cortex neurons depending on the pitch, modulation rate, and order of sounds paired with BasFstimulation. Simple tones led to map expansion, while modulated tones altered the maximum cortical following rate. Exposure to complex acoustic sequences {{led to the development of}} combination-sensitive responses. This remodeling of cortical response characteristics may reflect changes in intrinsic cellular mechanisms, synaptic efficacy, and local neuronal connectivity. The intricate relationship between the pattern of sensory activation and cortical plasticity suggests that network-level rules alter the functional organization of the cortex to generate the most behaviorally useful representation of the <b>sensory</b> <b>environment.</b> ...|$|E

Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers' tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour...|$|R

Research has looked at the influence of exposure to such environments on time perception, reporting that the greater the environmental variation, the shorter is the time estimation obtained by the method of production. Most conditions for creating an altered <b>sensory</b> <b>environment,</b> however, have not facilitated an immersive experience, one that directly impacts both time perception and subjective experience. In this study, we invited our participants to enter a whole-body altered <b>sensory</b> <b>environment</b> for a 20 -min session, wherein they were asked to relax without falling asleep. The session included white-colored illumination of the chamber with eyes closed (5 min), followed by 10 min of illuminating the room with color, after which a short report of subjective experience was collected using a brief questionnaire; this was followed by an additional 5 min of immersion in white light with closed eyes.

Research has shown that the instability experienced by many neurologically impaired individuals is a result of inappropriate interaction among the three major sensory systems (somatosensory, visual, and vestibular) that provide orientation information to the postural control system. Very few studies, however, have documented the effects of changing sensory information on the postural control system of normal individuals across a bro d spectrum of ages. This normative, descriptive study was designed for the purpose of determining how postural stability changes with age when individuals are presented with altered <b>sensory</b> <b>environments.</b> Fifty eight normal, healthy individuals, 17 males and 41 females, ranging in age from 18 to 84 years, participated in this study. In the study each subject was exposed to six different sensory conditions which were designed by Dr. Ann Shumway-Cook and Dr. Faye Bahling Horak. For each of those six different sensory conditions, in which somatosensory and/or visual information was in some way altered, each subject was measured for standing postural sway area. A computerized standing forceplate, developed by Lewis Nashner, ScD at Neurocom International Inc. was used for measuring total postural sway area for each 3 D-second testing condition. A Student 2 ̆ 7 s unpaired two-tailed t-test indicated that under all six sensory conditions, individuals 60 years and older showed significantly greater postural sway than that of individuals younger than 60. In addition, under conditions of greatest intersensory conflict in which support-surface input was inaccurate and visual input was either eliminated or inaccurate, older individuals showed significantly greater changes in sway than did younger individuals. These findings suggest that the ability of the aging individual to adjust to alterations in <b>sensory</b> <b>environments</b> and to maintain postural stability under altered sensory conditions declines with age...|$|R
