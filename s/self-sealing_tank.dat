2500|$|Prototypes for the Ki-43-II flew in February 1942. The Ha-25 {{engine was}} {{upgraded}} with the 2-stage supercharger, thus becoming {{the more powerful}} Nakajima Ha-115 engine, which was installed in a longer-chord cowling. The new engine turned a three-bladed propeller. The wing structure, which had suffered failures in the Ki-43-I, was strengthened and equipped with racks for drop tanks or bombs. The Ki-43-II was also fitted with 13mm armor plate for the pilot's head and back, and the aircraft's fuel tanks were coated in rubber to form a crude <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tank.</b> This was later replaced by 3-layer rubber bladder, 8mm core with 2mm oil-proof lamination. The [...] bladder {{has proven to be}} highly resistant against 7.7mm bullets, but was not as effective against larger calibers. The pilot also enjoyed a slightly taller canopy and a reflector gunsight in place of the earlier telescopic gunsight. Nakajima commenced production of the Ki-43-II at its Ota factory in November 1942. Production was also started at the Tachikawa Hikoki KK and the 1st Army Air Arsenal (Tachikawa Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho), also at Tachikawa. Although Tachikawa Hikoki successfully managed to enter into large-scale production of the Ki-43, the 1st Army Air Arsenal was less successful – hampered by a shortage of skilled workers, it was ordered to stop production after 49 Ki-43s were built. Nakajima eventually ceased production in mid-1944 in favor of the Ki-84, but the Tachikawa Hikoki continued to produce the Ki-43.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{fighters were}} fitted with the {{relatively}} new invention. <b>Self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> {{tended to be}} heavier with lower capacity than non-sealed tanks. Nonetheless, aircraft that were fitted with <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> regularly took more punishment than those without, {{and were able to}} return to base. Combat experience in the Pacific war showed that the heavily protected American aircraft could sustain far more damage than the lightly armored Japanese designs without <b>self-sealing</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> (for instance, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero).|$|R

25|$|After {{completing}} service trials, and originally designated P-45, a {{first order}} for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation reverted to P-39C before deliveries began. After assessing aerial combat conditions in Europe, {{it was evident}} that without armor or <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks,</b> the 20 production P-39Cs were not suitable for operational use. The remaining 60 machines in the order were built as P-39Ds with armor, <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> and enhanced armament. These P-39Ds were the first Airacobras to enter into service with the Army Air Corps units and would be the first ones to see action.|$|R
50|$|The Ki-43 (Oscar) was {{initially}} produced in November 1939, given the designation Ki-43-I. Deliveries from Nakajima's Ota factory commenced in February 1941. In addition to outstanding maneuverability, the Ki-43-I had an impressive {{rate of climb}} due to its light weight. Power {{was provided by the}} Nakajima Ha-25 engine turning a two-bladed, two-position variable-pitch metal propeller. Top speed was 495 km/h (308 mph) at 4,000 m (13,160 ft). The Ki-43 was equipped with two synchronized cowling machine guns in various configurations, with either two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, one 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine gun and one 7.7 mm (.303 in) gun, or two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 guns; the aircraft was given various sub-designations to reflect these differences. The configuration that appears to have been most prevalent {{at the outset of the}} war was the first configuration with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, while as the war progressed the heavier combinations gained popularity and the version with the heaviest armament was sometimes given the designation Ki-43-Ic. The Ho-103 was often loaded with explosive ammunition to increase target effect; its penetrative effect against later Allied aircraft armor appears to have been marginal.Prototypes for the Ki-43-II flew in February 1942.

50|$|Typical <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> have {{multiple}} layers of rubber and reinforcing fabric, one of vulcanized rubber and one of untreated natural rubber, which can absorb fuel, swell and expand when it comes {{into contact with the}} fuel. When a fuel tank is punctured, the fuel seeps into the layers, causing the untreated layer to swell and thus seal the puncture.|$|R

50|$|In {{the newer}} generations of pre-war and early-war aircraft, <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> were tanks used to {{minimize}} the damage from leaking or burning fuel. A conventional fuel tank, when hit by gunfire, could leak fuel rapidly. This would not only reduce the aircraft's effective range, but was also a significant fire hazard. Damaged fuel tanks could also rupture, destroying the airframe or critically affecting flight characteristics.|$|R

50|$|In the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) {{patented}} a <b>self-sealing</b> fuel <b>tank</b> {{design in}} 1941; {{one of many}} companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing <b>self-sealing</b> <b>tanks</b> using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft. In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, {{as well as other}} aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the MkIX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.|$|R

50|$|The He 111 {{was nearly}} 100 mph {{slower than the}} Spitfire and did not present much of a {{challenge}} to catch, although the heavy armour, <b>self-sealing</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> and progressively uprated defensive armament meant that {{it was still a}} challenge to shoot down.

The Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber was badly outclassed in all respects and, after taking some savage beatings, the Sturzkampfgeschwader were withdrawn from the Battle.|$|R
