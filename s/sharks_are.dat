5|$|A popular myth is that <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> {{immune to}} disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{only a few}} <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers {{has been}} reported, but they remain {{at a safe}} distance. Under most circumstances, these timid <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> not {{regarded}} as highly dangerous to humans. However, they may become aggressive {{in the presence of}} food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species. Blacktip <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, a goblin <b>shark</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} a fishery net in Sri Lanka, {{reported}} in Valaichchenai eastern coastal line in Sri Lanka. The <b>shark</b> <b>was</b> about [...] long and weighed about [...] The <b>shark</b> <b>was</b> given to the NARA (National Aquatic Resource Research & Development Agency) for further research.|$|R
50|$|During {{the same}} period 38 {{potentially}} aggressive <b>sharks</b> <b>were</b> also hooked, including tiger sharks (34) and bull sharks (4). The overall survival rate of potentially aggressive <b>sharks</b> <b>was</b> 70% (relocated and released).|$|R
50|$|In 1979, The <b>Sharks</b> <b>were</b> {{formed in}} Harrisburg. In 1986, {{they won the}} MTV Basement Tape Competition. The <b>Sharks</b> <b>were</b> regular {{performers}} at the iconic Metron, a large concert venue/nightclub in Harrisburg.|$|R
5|$|During the day, zebra <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> {{sluggish}} {{and usually}} found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include habitat alteration, {{damage and}} loss from coastal development, {{pollution}} {{and the impact}} of fisheries on the seabed and prey species. The 2007 documentary, Sharkwater exposed how <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> being hunted to extinction.|$|E
50|$|This <b>shark</b> <b>was</b> first {{identified}} by the famous Swiss Naturalist Louis Agassiz, in 1843, as Cretoxyhrina mantelli. However, the most complete specimen of this <b>shark</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1890, by the fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg, who published his findings in 1907. The specimen comprised a nearly complete associated vertebral column and over 250 associated teeth. This kind of exceptional preservation of fossil <b>sharks</b> <b>is</b> rare, because a <b>shark's</b> skeleton <b>is</b> made of cartilage, which is not prone to fossilization. Charles dubbed the specimen Oxyrhina mantelli. This specimen represented a 20 ft <b>shark.</b> It <b>was</b> excavated from Hackberry Creek, Gove County, Kansas.|$|R
40|$|Rhincodon typus {{commonly}} known as whale <b>shark</b> <b>is</b> a pelagic species. Though whale <b>shark</b> <b>is</b> the largest fish, it mainly feeds on plankton. They are locally called as ‘dev mushi’ or ‘bhari’ in Maharashtra. Whale <b>shark</b> <b>is</b> listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN Red List, 2000) and is {{also included in the}} Appendix II of CITES since 2003...|$|R
50|$|The Sharks come in {{the colors}} Red, Orange, Yellow, Purple, and White. Each color {{represents}} a fruit flavor. It is unknown whether the White <b>Shark</b> <b>is</b> supposed to taste {{like one of the}} other flavors each time, or if it is a flavor of its own. Popular belief leans towards the latter. Also interesting, the yellow <b>shark</b> <b>is</b> not the expected lemon flavor; oddly enough the yellow <b>shark</b> <b>is</b> strawberry.|$|R
5|$|According to {{estimates}} from local animal welfare organisation Mundo Azul released in October 2013, between 1,000 and 2,000 dolphins are killed annually for consumption, with a further 5,000 to 15,000 being killed {{for use as}} shark bait. <b>Sharks</b> <b>are</b> captured both for their meat and for use of their fins in shark fin soup.|$|E
5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the}} strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{abundance}} in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark {{is one of}} the least-studied large requiem sharks. They are believed {{to play a major role}} in shaping Caribbean reef communities. These <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> more active at night, with no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or migration. Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E

5|$|Epaulette <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> preyed upon by larger fishes such {{as other}} sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} {{in one study}} that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> abundant.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{great white}} sharks {{were added to}} California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific {{was estimated to be}} fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Many sharks, {{including}} the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey. These social <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> often migratory, traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools. These migrations may be partly necessary {{to find new}} food sources.|$|E
5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon <b>sharks</b> <b>are</b> the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E

5|$|Shark fin soup is {{a status}} symbol in Asian countries, and is {{considered}} healthy and full of nutrients. <b>Sharks</b> <b>are</b> also killed for meat. European diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. However, the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras.
