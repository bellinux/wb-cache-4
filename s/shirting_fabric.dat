In the experiment, five mechanical properties which are considered significant in knitted fabric softness were evaluated, including Compression Resilience (RC), Surface Friction (MIU), Geometrical Roughness (SMD), Thickness (T) and Weight (W). The result implies that softness property is a feeling of springy (i. e., High in RC) with a smooth hand (i. e., Low in MIU and SMD). Also, knitted fabrics which are thin and light in weight are preferred in softness property. Fabric construction was also identified as a significant factor affecting softness with plain knitted ranked better than tuck knitted fabrics.

40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} effect of repeated laundering on the comfort-related and low stress mechanical properties of polo <b>shirt</b> <b>fabrics</b> with and without wrinkle-free treatments. Comparisons are made of untreated fabrics, fabrics treated with a hydrophobic wrinkle-free treatment, and fabrics treated with a hydrophilic wrinkle-free treatment. The results show that a wrinkle-free treatment can reduce the adverse effects of washing on many low stress mechanical properties. In general, the surface water absorption rate, waron/cool feeling, and low-stress mechanical properties of wrinkle-free treated fabrics are more stable against repeated laundering, because untreated fabrics tend to shrink and become more compact. The extensibility of a wrinkle-free treated fabric decreases significantly after twelve washing cycles. Application of a hydrophilic softener in the wrinkle-free finish can improve the surface water absorption rate, but the durability of the hydrophilic softener to repeated laundering should be further improved to prevent deterioration of fabric properties after washing.

This research also examined preferences of judges for hand of <b>shirt</b> <b>fabrics</b> for the judge 2 ̆ 7 s own sex and for the other sex. The psychological approach was used for this research because human judgments of fabric hand provide multi-dimensional understanding of fabric properties. Stimuli were selected to represent a variety of <b>shirting</b> <b>fabrics</b> for U. S. and Korean males and females. Judges could see and touch fabrics simultaneously. All instruments for these procedures were in English for native English speakers and in Korean for native Korean speakers. The procedure for this research included four phases: focus group interviews, word list development, trial, and final data collection. Final data were collected using an 11 -point certainty scale, with responses transformed to normalized ranks. Subjects were 70 each of Korean males and females and 70 U. S. males and 68 U. S. females. Based on analyses of variance {{as well as other}} information such as comments made during focus group interviews, three hypotheses were examined. The responses to fabric hand differed by country. Generally the main effect for country suggested meaning differences between English and Korean words.

In addition, sex and cultural differences for fabric preferences for the judges themselves and for the other sex were supported.

40|$|Water {{absorption}} {{and transport}} property of textiles is important since it affects wear comfort, efficiency {{of treatment and}} functionality of product. This paper introduces an accurate and reliable measurement tester, {{which is based on}} gravimetric and image analysis technique, for characterising the transplanar and in-plane wicking property of fabrics. The uniqueness of this instrument is that it is able to directly measure the water absorption amount in real-time, monitor the direction of water transport and estimate the amount of water left on skin when sweating. Throughout the experiment, water supply is continuous which simulates profuse sweating. Testing automation could even minimise variation caused by subjective manipulation, thus enhancing testing accuracy. This instrument is versatile in terms of the fabrics could be tested. A series of <b>shirting</b> <b>fabrics</b> made by different fabric structure and yarn were investigated and the results show that the proposed method has high sensitivity in differentiating fabrics with varying geometrical differences.

The double knit blends, constructed of a French pique stitch, were developed into pre-school boys' golf-style <b>shirts.</b> <b>Fabric</b> serviceability was tested through ten weeks of actual wear by seven nursery school boys, and in the textile laboratory for abrasion resistance, wrinkle recovery and for actual thickness.

Garments in these studies are commercially available exercise T-shirts and shorts, routine-wear T-shirts, and longsleeved pullover <b>shirts.</b> <b>Fabric</b> composition (cotton, polyester, light-weight, superfine Merino wool, modacrylic, cotton/rayon, polyester/Cocona, modacrylic/Xstatic, modacrylic/rayon, modacrylic/lyocell/aramid), construction (open knit, tight knit, open weave, tight weave), and finishing treatment (none, quaternary ammonium salt) are the independent variables. Eleven studies are reported here: five studies of exercise T-shirts, three of exercise shorts, two of routine wear Tshirts, and one of shirts used as sleep-wear. All studies are conducted in a climate-controlled environment, similar to a space vehicle's. For exercise clothing, study participants wear the garments during aerobic exercise. For routine wear clothing, study participants wear the T-shirts daily in an office or laboratory. Daily questionnaires collected data on ordinal preferences of nine sensory elements and on reason for retiring a used garment. Study 1 compares knitted cotton, polyester, and Merino exercise T-shirts (61 participants), study 2, knitted polyester, modacrylic, and polyester/Cocona exercise T-shirts (40 participants), study 3, cotton and polyester exercise shorts, knitted and woven (70 participants), all three using factorial experimental designs with and without a finishing treatment, conducted at the Johnson Space Center, sharing study participants.
