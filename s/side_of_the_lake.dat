5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager.

As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower.
