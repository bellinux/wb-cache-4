Various percentages of pulverized steel slag were ap-plied to a soil, having poor engineering properties, {{with the aim of}} improving the engineering properties of the <b>soil.</b> <b>Sieve</b> anal-ysis, consistency limits, specific gravity, compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compression and permeability tests were performed on the soil and each of the soil-slag mix-tures. The plasticity and the uncured strength of the soil were re-duced and increased, respectively, by the addition of an optimal steel slag content of 8 %. Pulverized steel slag is therefore rec-ommended as a low-cost modifier or stabilizer of lateritic soils with poor engineering properties, because it made the soil sam-ple in this study better suited for use as a road pavement layer material.

Many plant–soil feedback experiments start from inoculating relatively small amounts of natural soil to sterilized bulk soil. These soil inocula may include a variety of size classes of soil biota, each having a different role in the observed soil feedback effects. In order to examine {{what may be the}} effect of various size classes of soil biota we compared inoculation with natural field <b>soil</b> <b>sieved</b> through a 1 mm mesh, a <b>soil</b> suspension also <b>sieved</b> through a 1 mm mesh, and a microbial suspension sieved through a 20 µm mesh.

Plant-feeding nematodes were almost exclusively found in the <b>sieved</b> <b>soil</b> treatment. We show that processing the soil to obtain a microbial suspension reduces the strength of the soil effect in both the first and second growth phase.

40|$|Annual horticultural systems rely on {{frequent}} and intensive tillage to prepare beds, manage weeds and control insects. But this practice reduces soil organic carbon (SOC) through accelerated CO 2 emission. Crop residue incorporation could counteract this loss. We investigated whether vegetable systems {{could be made}} more resilient by including a high-residue grain crop such as sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa), in the rotation {{through the use of}} conventional (no residue, no <b>soil</b> <b>sieving)</b> and organic (residue incorporated and <b>soil</b> <b>sieved)</b> <b>soil</b> management scenarios. We evaluated short-term emission of CO 2 -C and soil C content in incubated Chromosol and Vertosol soils (Australian Classification) with and without sieving (simulated tillage) or the incorporation of ground sweet corn residue. Residue treatment emitted 2. 3 times more CO 2 -C compared to the no-residue treatment, and furthermore, <b>sieved</b> <b>soil</b> emitted 1. 5 times more CO 2 -C than the unsieved across the two soil types. The residue incorporation had a greater effect on CO 2 -C flux than simulated tillage, suggesting that C availability and form can be more important than physical disturbance in cropping soils. The organic scenario (with residue and sieved) emitted more CO 2 -C, but had 13 % more SOC compared with the conventional scenario (without residue and unsieved), indicating that organic systems may retain more SOC than a conventional system. The SOC lost by soil disturbance was more than offset by the incorporation of residue in the laboratory conditions. Therefore, the possible SOC loss by tillage for weed control under organic management may be offset by organic residue input...|$|R

In the heterogenous treatment, the root internode length and biomass was significantly higher in rich patches than in poor patches, Our results indicate that fine-root production assessment using conventional ingrowth-cores where the <b>soil</b> is <b>sieved</b> and homogenized may underestimate the true production found in undisturbed soil, Fine-root architectural parameters in the patchy treatment were more similar to those found in the undisturbed soil cores.

The effects of <b>soil</b> <b>sieved</b> crumbs and duration of pre-saturation were investigated during the crust formation. For some soils crusting decreases along the sprinkling events, with the diameter of aggregates presenting high values; sometimes significant structural deterioration in the aggregate of higher diameter occurs after a initial resistance to crusting as evidenced by a sharp reduced hydraulic conductivity. The role of the pre-saturation time seem more important for less resistant soils...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSplash is an {{essential}} process in interrill erosion because it detaches soil fragments from their substrate and transports them. However, splash measurements are difficult to interpret and relatively {{little is known about}} the influence of particle characteristics on the spatial distribution of splash. The objective of this work is to study the splash distribution of different size fractions for aggregated soils. We used a recently proposed theory for spatial distribution by splash to interpret experimental data on the radial distribution of soil fragments splashed by simulated rainfall. A laboratory device with five concentric rings was used to determine average splash lengths for 16 fragment size fractions (0. 05 to > 2000 µm) of four <b>soils.</b> <b>Sieved</b> <b>soil</b> (3 - to 5 -mm size fraction) was exposed to simulated rainfall at 29 mm h– 1 and with a time-specific kinetic energy of 252 J m– 2 h– 1. We interpreted the measured masses of fragments splashed into the different rings using an approximate solution of the exponential splash distribution theory applied to the experimental design. We demonstrated that the theory is valid for bulk aggregated soil as well as for individual fragment size fractions. The derived average splash lengths ranged from 4 to 23 cm, depending on the fragment size and soil. Splash lengths were greatest for soil fragments of 100 to 200 µm, and decreased for finer and coarser size fractions. Comparison of these findings with physically-based theory suggests that the coarser fragments, 50 to 2000 µm, are transported as single airborne particles, whereas the smaller ones, < 50 µm, are transported in groups in splash droplets. This interpretation is consistent with observations reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|In {{agrosystem}} field experiments, earthworm inoculation did not impede {{depletion of}} soil organic stocks in most cases, in spite of increased carbon inputs through enhanced primary production. Slight evidence of soil organic matter (SOM) protection was found in poorly structured soil, such as a yam plot in Ivory Coast (<b>soil</b> <b>sieved</b> before experimentation), and a pasture plot on Martinique. Aggregation inherited from past earthworm activities probably maintains SOM protection after earthworms have disappeared; longer term experiments are necessary to observe C dynamics after the disappearance of inherited earthworm structures. In two experiments with maize in Ivory Coast and Peru, the activity of earthworms led to a small increase in the incorporation of organic matter from surface mulch in the SOM. Most of the C incorporated into the SOM originated from root material, and earthworm activities only slightly modified this pattern. Earthworm activity had significant effects {{on the distribution of}} C among particle size fractions. The general trend was a depletion of large (greater than 50 micrometers) particles and an accumulation of small (less than 2 micrometers) particles.

Understanding the functional link between soil heterotrophic respiration and soil water content is relevant for the estimation of climate change impacts on soil CO 2 emissions. In order to quantify the effect of air-drying and sieving with 2 mm meshes on the soil heterotrophic respiration response to water content we incubated intact cores and sieved samples of two loamy and two sandy agricultural topsoils for six levels of effective soil water saturation.

Escherichia coli transport to the drain was observed with either open surface connected or buried biopores. In surface connected biopores, E. coli transport was a function of the soil type and the layer thickness between the end of the biopore and drain. Buried biopores contributed flow and E. coli in the less sorptive soil (loamy sand) and the sorptive soil (sandy loam) containing a wide (i. e., with mesopores) pore space distribution prevalent due to the moist soil packing technique.

Whether this heat pulse is strongly moderated by soil moisture or soil texture is not fully understood, however. We measured soil heat profiles during 60 experimental burns, identifying changes in maximum soil temperature and heat duration above 60 °C as a function of soil moisture and soil texture. Experimental treatments included a factorial combination of soil moisture (~ 5, 15, 30, and 45 % v/v) and soil textural (sandy loam, sandy loam–pumice, loam, clay loam) gradients, with a surface fuel load comprised of a dense layer of masticated wood. Soil moisture had a strong influence on heat transfer. A volumetric moisture content of 20 % or greater quenched the heat pulse in all soils at depths of 2. 5 cm and lower. In comparison, soil temperatures in dry soil far exceeded the lethal threshold to a depth of 10 cm. Differences in heating characteristics among the four soil types were minor despite their dissimilarities in texture, porosity, bulk density, and presumed thermal conductivity. It was also shown that intact soil cores were required to produce accurate heat profiles during burning, as maximum soil temperatures in the surface 5 cm were overestimated by 40 to 100 °C using disturbed <b>soil</b> (<b>sieved</b> and packed).

40|$|International audienceThe {{conventional}} railway substructure in France {{was built}} by emplacing ballast directly on subgrade. Over years of operation, the interpenetration of ballast and subgrade created a soil layer between them. Under different conditions, this naturally formed layer, namely interlayer, can contain different quantities of fine particles, becoming more or less sensitive to changes in water content. As the water content changes are governed by the hydraulic behavior of the interlayer soil, assessing the influence of fine particle content on the hydraulic behavior of interlayer soil is of importance. To this end, the hydraulic behavior of an interlayer soil taken from Senissiat (near Lyon, France) was investigated using two infiltration columns, a large-scale column equipped with tensiometers and a time domain reflectometer (TDR) for suction and volumetric water content measurements, respectively, and a smaller column equipped with high-capacity tensiometers only. Different fines contents were considered and wetting-drying cycles were applied to the soil specimens. The hydraulic conductivity was determined by applying the instantaneous profile method. The results obtained showed that (i) hysteresis exists for both the soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity changes with suction; (ii) the effect of wetting-drying cycles is insignificant; (iii) adding 10 % fine particles to the natural interlayer soil gives rise {{to changes in the}} soil water retention curve but does not induce significant changes in hydraulic conductivity; (iv) the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of interlayer soil with 10 % fine particles added is close to that of <b>soil</b> <b>sieved</b> at 2 mm, suggesting that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of interlayer soil is mainly governed by fine particles through the suction effect. By contrast, in a saturated state, the value for the interlayer soil with 10 % fine particles added was found to be higher, suggesting that in this case the hydraulic conductivity is mainly governed by the water transfer through macropores...|$|R
40|$|Potential C and N {{mineralization}} {{and soil}} microbial biomass C were determined following disturbance (i. e. drying and sieving) pretreatments in five soils varying in texture (30 – 350 mg clay gÿ 1 soil) {{from the southern}} Piedmont USA. Soil disturbance by drying (i. e. rewetting following drying at 558 C for 72 h) of intact soil cores resulted in a flush of C mineralization (70 % to 2. 5 -fold greater) during 0 – 3 d of incubation, but was not significantly dierent during 3 – 10 and 10 – 24 d periods compared with field-moist-intact soil cores. <b>Soil</b> disturbance by <b>sieving</b> resulted in greater C mineralization earlier than later in the incubation and led to significant immobilization of N of surface soil where respiration was highest. Increasing soil disturbance through smaller sieve openings resulted in a 10 – 60 % greater flush of C mineralization {{that may have been}} due to disruption of macroaggregates, which protected soil organic C. With a conditioning period of 10 d following rewetting of dried soil, soil microbial biomass C was unaected by drying or extent of <b>sieving.</b> <b>Soil</b> texture (i. e. clay content) did not interact with disturbance eects. Immobilization of N was predominant in surface soils (0 – 40 mm) of this bermudagrass pasture, where mineralizable C was very high. Carbon mineralization during 0 – 3 d was highly related (r 2 = 0. 9620. 04) to C mineralization during 0 – 24 d, basal soil respiration and soil microbial biomass C, although increasing soil disturbance (i. e. drying and extent of sieving) altered these relationships in a predictable manner. I conclude that dried and coarsely <b>sieved</b> <b>soil</b> compares favorably to field-moist-intact soil cores for estimating soil microbial biomass and potential activity in landscapes scoured by various degrees of erosion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{study of}} the effects of {{cropping}} systems on buried weed seed is very costly. Most of the experiments of this nature were conducted prior to the introduction of herbicides. New techniques, material and methods are needed and could result in more research in this area of study. A polyester material was experimented with which provided a means for mechanically washing buried weed seed packets. This was accomplished through the development of an experimental seed packet washer. The washer and the polyester material made it possible to wash the soil from delicate seedlings growing inside the packets without damage to them. They in turn could be examined without removal from the seed packets making the procedure many times more economical. A seed removal technique was also developed which worked well in separating weed seed from mineral soil samples. This was accomplished by making slight modifications in the experimental seed packet washer regarding screening,. slope, water volume and the usage of various sizes of <b>soil</b> <b>sieves.</b> An economical bioassay method for studying the effects of crop leachates on red sorrel and rice germination and growth was also developed while simultaneously testing cropping system effects on buried weed seed in the greenhouse and field. This method and technique holds promise for other types of plant experiments involving liquid and culture media. Thirty-seven monoculture cropping systems were tested in the greenhouse and fourteen in the field for their effects on nine different buried weed seed species. Evidence is provided to show that broccoli, beans, asparagus, quackgrass, tomatoes and other plants fray be inhibitory to the subsequent germination and viability of the buried seed of Rumex acetosella L., Rumex crispus L., Brassica campestris L. and Amaranthus retroflexus L...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 200 years ago, North American landscapes were {{dominated}} by vast expanses of grassland. The Great Plains, an ecologically complex and diverse ecoregion, extended from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Rocky Mountains to {{the border of the}} eastern hardwood forest in Indiana. Now the original tallgrass prairie exists in small widely dispersed remnant patches surrounded by agroecosystems. This study is an effort to characterize soil nematode diversity and population structure within those remnant patches. The plant parasitic nematode family Criconematidae serves as our indicator for nematode diversity, due to its global distribution, high abundance in natural areas, broad host range, limited dispersal capabilities, and the availability of a highly resolved COI gene tree. Thirty-one grassland sites representing 13 ecoregions were sampled by extracting soil cores within a 40 x 40 m grid. Criconematid nematodes were screened and isolated using <b>soil</b> <b>sieves</b> and centrifugation. Nematodes were individually photographed, measured and amplified with a primer set that, after removing primers, results in 721 nucleotides of the COI mitochondrial gene. Diversity was studied at different levels, from morphospecies to haplotype lineages and haplotype diversity within lineages. Grassland lineages were investigated using phylogenetic methods and species delimitation methods. One hundred and ninety five nematodes conforming morphologically to Mesocriconema curvatum of broad geographic distribution, spanning the central tallgrass ecoregion were analyzed as cryptic species. Where morphological analysis would indicate the presence of a widespread, cosmopolitan species, species delimitation analyses, including the construction of phylogenetic trees, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, the Species Delimitation Plugin implemented through Geneious R 8, and statistical parsimony networks indicate approximately ten well-supported, genetically distinct clades. Two of these clades contain over seventy specimens each and are characterized by distinct intra-specific population structures, suggesting unique evolutionary forces responsible for their speciation and diversification. While these two clades, or cryptic species possess independent population structures, they are both associated with sister clades of southern sites, indicative of ancestral origins in states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
