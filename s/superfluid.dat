However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are <b>superfluid</b> and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E

A <b>superfluid</b> is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction.

During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
40|$|Topological Fermi <b>superfluids</b> {{have played}} the central role in various fields of physics. However, all {{previous}} studies focus on the cases where Cooper pairs have zero center-of-mass momenta (i. e. normal <b>superfluids).</b> The topology of Fulde-Ferrell <b>superfluids</b> with nonzero momentum pairings have never been explored until recent findings that Fulde-Ferrell <b>superfluids</b> in a spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas can accommodate Majorana fermions in real space in low dimensions and Weyl fermions in momentum space in three dimension. In this review, we first discuss the mechanism of pairings in spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases in optical lattices subject to Zeeman fields, showing that spin-orbit coupling as well as Zeeman fields enhance Fulde-Ferrell states while suppress Larkin-Ovchinnikov states. We then present the low temperature phase diagram including both FF <b>superfluids</b> and topological FF <b>superfluids</b> phases in both two dimension and three dimension. In one dimension, Majorana fermions as well as phase dependent order parameter are visualized. In three dimension, we show the properties of Weyl fermions in momentum space such as anisotropic linear dispersion, Fermi arch, and gaplessness away from k_= 0. Finally, we discuss some possible methods to probe FF <b>superfluids</b> and topological FF <b>superfluids</b> in cold atom systems.

25|$|In 1938, Pyotr Kapitsa, John Allen and Don Misener {{discovered}} that helium-4 became {{a new kind}} of fluid, now known as a <b>superfluid,</b> at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the lambda point). <b>Superfluid</b> helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of <b>superfluid</b> helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). <b>Superfluid</b> helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the <b>superfluid</b> properties of helium-4.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address {{the ratio of the}} shear {{viscosity}} to entropy density η/s in bosonic and fermionic <b>superfluids.</b> A small η/s is associated with nearly perfect fluidity, and more general measures of the fluidity perfection/imperfection are of wide interest to a number of communities. We use a Kubo approach to concretely address this ratio via low temperature transport associated with the quasi-particles. Our analysis for bosonic <b>superfluids</b> utilizes the framework of the one-loop Bogoliubov approximation, whereas for fermionic <b>superfluids</b> we apply BCS theory and its BCS-BEC extension. Interestingly, we find that the transport properties of strict BCS and Bogoliubov <b>superfluids</b> have very similar structures, albeit with different quasi-particle dispersion relations. While there is a dramatic contrast between the power law and exponential temperature dependence for η alone, the ratio η/s for both systems is more similar. Specifically we find the same linear dependence (on the ratio of temperature T to inverse lifetime γ(T)) with η/s ∝ T/γ(T), corresponding to imperfect fluidity. By contrast, near the unitary limit of BCS-BEC <b>superfluids</b> a very different behavior results, which is more consistent with near-perfect fluidity. Comment: v 2 : 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

We derive a set of equations of motion which describe novel low energy dynamics in <b>superfluids</b> and obtain a new distinct branch of gapped collective modes in <b>superfluids</b> which involve anti-symmetric phase oscillations in fermionic and bosonic channels. We also find that Mott states in general are unstable with respect to fermion-boson conversion; particles become delocalized and the off-diagonal long-range order of <b>superfluids</b> can be developed when a finite conversion is present. We further point out a possible hidden order in Mott states. It is shown that the quantum dynamics of Fermi-Bose states can be characterized by either an effective coupled U(1) ⊗ U(1) quantum rotor Hamiltonian in a large-N limit or a coupled XXZ ⊗ XXZ spin Hamiltonian in a single-orbit limit.
