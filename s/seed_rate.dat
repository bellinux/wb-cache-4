Heterosis for grain NYg in Hyno Esta was lower at zero-N, suggesting that it did not achieve higher yields through more efficient capture or utilization of N.

A fourth experiment was designed to determine the optimum time to spray fungicide to control powdery mildew and septoria and to maximize grain yield. A range of disease epidemics were created by spraying with different fungicides at various stages of crop growth. The highest <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> (140 kg ha- 1) and narrowest row spacing (9 cm) considered in this study produced the highest winter wheat grain yields. Increasing the <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and decreasing the row spacing together produced a 21 % increase in grain yield over the more conventional combination of 70 kg ha- 1 <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and 18 cm row spacing. A higher <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> also produced slightly earlier crop maturity. Increased nitrogen fertility, high <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and narrow row spacing were associated with higher levels of grain protein. Nitrogen rate, <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and row spacing all affected the pattern of soil moisture use. Increasing nitrogen promoted water use throughout the growing season. Increasing <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> increased water use {{over the course of the}} growing season especially before anthesis. Narrow row spacing also increased water use over the course of the growing season. Highest grain yield and highest water use efficiency were associated with the combination of 140 kg/ha <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and 9 cm row spacing. Powdery mildew and septoria development were both a greater problem on the semi-dwarf cultivar Norwin than the tall cultivar Norstar. However, it was not possible to determine whether this was due to shorter plant height, a more susceptible genotype, or a combination of both factors. Powdery mildew development was promoted by increased nitrogen fertility and increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate.</b> Wide row spacing also aided powdery mildew development, particularly in the dispersal phase of its infection cycle; the effect of wide row spacing was most evident in the early stages of the epidemic. Narrow row spacing may promote powdery mildew development after the pathogen is established on a leaf. Septoria development was promoted by increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> while reduced nitrogen fertility promoted septoria development under some environmental conditions. Higher wind speed within the crop canopy was associated with wide row spacing. This may be important in aiding the dispersal of powdery mildew spores and it may explain the higher levels of powdery mildew that were associated with wide row spacing in the early stages of an epidemic. The highest minimum daily relative humidity was associated with increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced row spacing which may explain the higher levels of powdery mildew at the higher <b>seed</b> <b>rate.</b> Increased duration of leaf wetness was favoured by increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and to a lesser extent, by reduced row spacing. Increased duration of leaf wetness could be particularly important for septoria development, because spore germination requires the presence of water.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{row spacing}} and <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> effects on yield and plant stand characteristics of high-biomass sorghum, a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar was sown at three different row spacings (76, 38, and 19 cm) and <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> (218, 000, 306, 000, and 393, 000 seeds ha− 1 for one site-year and 116, 000, 204, 000, and 291, 000 seeds ha− 1 for three site-years) from 2009 to 2010 in Alabama and Arkansas, USA. Measurements included above-ground dry matter production, plant height, stem density, and stem diameter. Narrower row spacing (i. e. 19 cm) produced the highest biomass for all site-years. Increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> {{did not affect}} yield for three of the site-years, and decreased yield for one. The 19 cm row spacing produced the highest stem densities. Plant height increased with increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> at one site and decreased with higher <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> at another site. At one location, stem diameter declined as <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> and stem density increased. It was concluded that narrower row spacing (19 cm) provides the maximum yield benefit by significantly increasing stem density, and low <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> (116, 000 <b>seeds</b> ha− 1) are preferable because higher <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> do not positively affect yield and may cause morphological changes (i. e. taller plants with thinner stems) conducive to lodging...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to assess and give empirical evidences of farmers ’ knowledge and their trend of <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> usage in sugarcane cultivation. Fifty six percent respondent farmers did not know the recommended <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> instead they knew it in terms of area specified for seed production (Merla). None of the farmers weighed seed before sowing. The actual average <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly (p= 0. 05) less (28 %) than recommended (100 Maunds/acre).

40|$|Soybeans have {{traditionally}} been grown in rows wide enough to allow mechanical cultivation and to increase lodging resistance. Improved cultivars and herbicides have permitted farmers to obtain yield advantages from narrower rows. The growth response of soybeans to variations in row width and <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> depends upon the cultivar and geographic location. “Williams,” “Mitchell,” and “Essex” cultivars were planted at row widths of 18, 36, 54, and 72 cm. at <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> of 33, 67, 100 and 134 kg/ha in multi-row plots.

40|$|The general {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate various management practices in order to design a relay cropping system of spring barley and winter wheat with high yielding capacity and good weed suppressive capability under Swedish conditions. The work consisted of two greenhouse experiments, one small-scale field experiment and two field experiments. The factors investigated were <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> of barley and wheat, undersowing time of wheat and timing of nitrogen fertilisation. Wheat <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> varied from 187 kg ha- 1 to 50 % and 25 % of that rate, while barley <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> varied from 328 kg ha- 1 to 67 %, 45 % and 29 % of that rate. The plant stand at the highest wheat <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> was most competitive against perennial weeds and total weeds in the first growing season and total weeds in the second growing season. In addition, this plant stand was most productive in terms of {{biomass and grain yield}} of wheat. Moreover, increased wheat <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> did not negatively influence barley biomass or grain yield and therefore the high wheat <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> could be used in the relay cropping system for weed control purposes. Increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> of barley reduced wheat biomass production in the absence of weeds, but less so in the presence of weeds. However, wheat biomass was reduced by weed competition, independent of seed rates. In order to promote wheat performance, a lower barley <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> than normally employed in monoculture can be used. However, only in situations with weakly competitive weeds. By utilizing the time of nitrogen application and time of undersowing of wheat, it was possible to alter the competitive balance between barley and wheat. Winter wheat affected barley more negatively when the two crops were sown simultaneously than when wheat was sown one week later than barley. When sown immediately after barley, winter wheat was independent of the nitrogen application time. However, winter wheat undersown one week later than barley was at a disadvantage, while the barley was favoured. Spring barley and winter wheat grown in the field system had grain yields within the normal range, for barley 2655 kg ha- 1 to 4580 kg ha- 1. For the <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> 187 kg ha- 1, the grain yield of wheat was 5610 kg ha- 1. Thus the results indicate that relay cropping of spring barley–winter wheat is possible. However, before the system can be used optimally, it still remains many basic issues to be resolved...|$|E

In this study, the effects of various row spacings and <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> on dry matter and seed yield in berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) were evaluated in two consecutive years. The experimental design was a split-plot with four row spacings as main plot treatments in a randomized complete block design with four replications, and five <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> were allocated to subplots. Combined analysis of variance of the two-year data showed that both row spacings and <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> influenced dry matter yield (DM), seed yield, plant height, 1000 -seed weight and harvest index. Years, as well as two- and three-factor interactions did not affect the seed yield whereas row spacing × <b>seeding</b> <b>rate,</b> and year × <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> significantly affected the DM. The mean comparisons indicated that row spacings of 30 and 45 cm produced the highest DM of 3912. 2 and 3900 kg/ha; 45 and 60 cm spacings showed the highest seed yield of 1045. 4 and 1093. 3 kg/ha, respectively. 24 and 20 kg/ha <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> ranked the best in giving 1244. 7 and 1223 kg/ha seed yield, respectively.

A similar experiment was conducted at the Sherman Experiment Station, Moro in Eastern Oregon, using only two winter wheat cultivars, Stephens and Jackmar. Data were obtained on grain yield, tillers and spikes per square meter, heading and anthesis date, plant height, kernels per spike, 1000 kernel weight, test weight and harvest index. At Hyslop Experiment Station, Stephens, Bezostaya and Roussalka produced maximum grain yield at 10 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha <b>seeding</b> <b>rate,</b> and Maris-Hobbit at 24 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha <b>seeding</b> <b>rate.</b> At Sherman Experiment Station, 30 cm row spacing and 90 Kg/ha <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> constitutes the best combination for Stephens, and 30 cm row spacing and 120 Kg/ha <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> for the club wheat Jackmar.
