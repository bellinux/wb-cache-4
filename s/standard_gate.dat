40|$|In {{an effort}} to better {{understand}} impacts with gates during ski racing competition, on-snow measurements and observations were made of both standard gates and inflatable gates. These observations highlighted the importance of impact force and time. Two additional experiments were done to analyze these factors and compare their values for standard gates and inflatable gates. Gates were hit with a controlled weighted pendulum and force sensor to measure the impact force. To measure time, slow motion footage was taken of the gates clamped in a baseball pitching machine. The baseball's velocity was scaled to model the skier using conservation of energy principles. The footage was analyzed with position tracker software. Inflatable gates {{were found to have}} a lower mean impact force of 28. 55 ± 5. 89 N compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>gate</b> impact force of 44. 55 ± 7. 12 N. Although they exhibited lower impact force, the inflatable gates had a longer time to clear out of the skier travel path due to isolated bending in the small area of impact. The time for the tip of the inflatable gate to clear was 0. 63 ± 0. 1 s compared to the 0. 43 ± 0. 03 s it took for the tip of the <b>standard</b> <b>gate</b> to clear. From these results, it can be concluded that inflatable gates have a softer impact force, but require a modification in racing form in order to increase the impact area and thus decrease momentum and balance losses due to gate bending around extremities. by Meaghan Fitzgerald.

An integrated gate protection technique and a MIS-HEMT technology have been developed in order to improve the device reliability and make the E-mode GaN power transistors more compatible with <b>standard</b> <b>gate</b> drive ICs that demand large gate swing and low gate leakage.

This gate protection scheme introduces negligible degradation to the switching performance in MHz range, and thus, is suitable for most of the targeted applications of GaN power switches. By integrating the F-implantation technique with SiNx gate dielectric, high-performance 600 V normally-off GaN MIS-HEMTs with large gate swing, low current collapse and good threshold voltage stability are successfully demonstrated. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

In this study a less than 5 min gated SPET acquisition protocol is proposed. Perfusion characteristics (defect severity) and left ventricular ejection fraction Introduction (LVEF), end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV), wall motion (WM) and wall thickening (WT) were calculated, checked for reproducibility and compared with data obtained using a <b>standard</b> <b>gated</b> SPET acquisition protocol. Gated SPET images were recorded in 20 patients starting 60 min after the administration of 925 MBq technetium- 99 m tetrofosmin at rest. The 5 min gated SPET studies were acquired with a three-head camera equipped with Cardiofocal collimators. This protocol was repeated twice. In addition gated SPET studies were acquired according to a standard protocol using parallel-hole collimators. The severity of perfusion defects was quantified on polar maps using the non-gated image data and a normal database. LVEF EDV, ESV, WM and WT were calculated from the gated images. The agreement between 5 -min and <b>standard</b> <b>gated</b> SPET acquisitions was excellent for all investigated parameters. The reproducibility of repeated 5 -min acquisitions for the quantification of perfusion defect severity was excellent (r= 0. 97). The agreement for segmental WT scores between repeated 5 -min gated SPET acquisitions was good: kappa= 0. 71; major differences in segmental classification were observed in 2. 5 %. For WM a good agreement was found for segments with a tracer uptake {{greater than or equal}} to 30 % of the maximum: kappa= 0. 65, major differences = 7. 7 %.
