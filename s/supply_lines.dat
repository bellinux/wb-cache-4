5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} <b>supply</b> <b>lines,</b> which {{stretched across the}} Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly carried out to protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{a turning point in the}} war for North Korean forces, which had seen {{previous}} victories owing to superior numbers and equipment, with the distances and demands exacted on them at P'ohang-dong rendering their <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> untenable.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a heat dissipation device with a closed-loop heat-pipe effect, comprising a biphasic loop, consisting of: an evaporator (1) for vapourising a heat-transfer fluid; a condenser (2) for liquefying the heat-transfer fluid; a vapour <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> (31) between the evaporator and the condenser, said vapour <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> being arranged downstream of the evaporator and upstream of the condenser {{so as to}} allow {{the passage of the}} vapour heat-transfer fluid from the evaporator to the condenser; and a liquid <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> (32) between the condenser and the evaporator, said liquid <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> being arranged downstream of the condenser and upstream of the evaporator so as to allow the passage of the liquid heat-transfer fluid from the condenser to the evaporator. The invention is characterised in that the device also comprises a tank (4) connected between the vapour <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and the liquid <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> said tank comprising an adsorbent material for the adsorption/desorption of the heat transfer fluid...|$|R
50|$|Once the {{pressure}} switch monitoring main <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> pressure indicates a preset pressure in the line has been reached, the system is hydraulically closed. The controller shuts off the pump and signals a changeover valve to redirect lubricant to the second main <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|If, for example, someone flushes {{a toilet}} while the shower is in use, the fixture {{suddenly}} draws {{a significant amount}} of cold water from the common <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> causing a pressure drop. In the absence of a compensating mechanism, the relatively higher pressure in the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> will cause the shower temperature to rise just as suddenly, possibly reaching an uncomfortable or even dangerous level. Conversely, if someone opens a hot water faucet elsewhere, the relatively higher pressure in the cold water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> will cause the shower temperature to drop suddenly.|$|R
5|$|Although a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, {{the naval}} {{campaign}} in the Adriatic may have had far reaching consequences for the wider conflict. In particular, the events of 1811 were studied closely by Napoleon; in a chance meeting with Murray Maxwell in 1817, the former Emperor recalled Maxwell's action on 29 November 1811 intimately and commended Maxwell on his victory. The agreement between France and Russia to support each other in operations against the Ottoman Empire {{could not have been}} fulfilled without secure <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> from France to the Balkans and those <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> could not be assured without naval control of the Adriatic. British historian James Henderson has linked the action of November 1811 to this strategic problem, suggesting that the loss of the convoy and its 200 cannon may have been a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the emphasis of his planned campaign of 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Clarke was promoted to lieutenant colonel and began working on intelligence tasks.

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing it back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which {{had been placed in}} reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.|$|E

5|$|Operation Flax was a Western Allied air {{operation}} executed during the Tunisia Campaign, {{as part of}} the larger North African Campaign of the Second World War. The operation was designed to cut the air <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> between Italy and the Axis armies in Tunis, Tunisia, in April 1943. The parallel Allied naval effort was Operation Retribution.|$|E
5|$|Over two weeks, North Korean and South Korean ground units {{fought in}} several bloody back-and-forth battles, taking and retaking ground in which neither {{was able to}} gain the upper hand. Finally, {{following}} {{the breakdown of the}} North Korean <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> and amidst mounting casualties, the exhausted North Korean troops were forced to retreat.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{rise in the number of}} product {{liability}} cases involving the failure of toilet water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> acetal plastic nuts. These nuts can fail in service, causing water leaks that result in significant property and financial losses. This study examines three possible failure modes of acetal plastic toilet water supply nuts. The three failure modes tested were all due to over load failure of the acetal nut and are as follows: (1) Overtightening of the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> acetal nut, (2) <b>Supply</b> <b>line</b> lateral pull and, (3) Embrittled <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> lateral pull. Additionally, a “hand-tight” torque survey was conducted. The fracture surfaces and characteristics of these failure tests were examined with Stereo Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The failure modes were compared and contrasted to provide guidance in determination of cause in these investigations...|$|R
50|$|The pressure-balanced {{shower valve}} {{compensates}} {{for changes in}} water pressure. It has a diaphragm or piston inside that reacts to relative changes in either hot or cold water pressure to maintain balanced pressure. As water pressure drops on one <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> the valve reduces the pressure in the other <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to match. A side effect {{of this is that}} the pressure and flow at the shower head or tub spigot will drop twice as much as if only one <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> had been affected, but without a large temperature change. There are ball bearings in the valves to regulate forces.|$|R

5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He swung his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong {{and that the}} vast distances were a big problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{resistance}} was praised by contemporaries for {{its contribution to}} the Allied war effort; particularly during the later period.

The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being able to use the country as a secure base, never fully becoming pacified.|$|E

5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their <b>supply</b> <b>lines.</b> Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E
5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} strategic objective because Allied <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port near the front lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance. Despite taking control of the city, the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships. The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the Scheldt completed in November.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN <b>supply</b> <b>lines,</b> and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside.

50|$|Following {{the capture}} of the port of Rabaul {{during the battle of}} Rabaul, Japanese forces {{proceeded}} {{to turn it into a}} major base. The allied command was concerned the fall of Rabaul threatened the San Francisco-Australia sea lane <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and ordered the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to be patrolled. Admiral Chester William Nimitz and Admiral Brown devised a plan to solve the threat on the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> by attacking the newly captured Rabaul. Task Force 11 (TF 11) and the ANZAC Squadron were tasked with undertaking the raid. Unfortunately, the ANZAC Squadron fuel oil supply was inadequate to accompany TF 11 to its launching point north-east of Rabaul for the planned 21 February air strike.|$|R
