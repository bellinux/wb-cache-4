5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.

The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining <b>sheep</b> <b>in</b> the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs.

5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, the European communities of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising <b>sheep</b> <b>in</b> the main but also breeding horses and growing grain.

In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established town with a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.|$|E

5|$|Overgrazing by <b>sheep</b> <b>in</b> Grisedale Common has {{damaged the}} {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard <b>sheep.</b> <b>In</b> addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|Icelandic horses {{still play}} {{a large part}} in Icelandic life, despite {{increasing}} mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed's use. The first official Icelandic horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are still held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop and pace races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed's unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling {{into the water and}} needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906.

40|$|A {{specific}} binding protein {{for human}} corticotrophin-releasing hormone (hCRH), {{which does not}} bind to the ovine hormone (oCRH), has recently been demonstrated in human plasma. No such binding protein has been found <b>in</b> <b>sheep</b> plasma. We have investigated the half-life of human and ovine CRH in man and <b>in</b> <b>sheep.</b> Peptides were measured directly in plasma with two-site immunoradiometric assays, as these assays are unaffected {{by the presence of}} inactivated peptide fragments. In man, the half-life of hCRH (30. 5 +/- 3. 3 min; mean +/- S. E. M.) was significantly (P less than 0. 001) less than that of oCRH (42. 8 +/- 6. 4 min). <b>In</b> <b>sheep,</b> {{there was no significant difference}} between the half-life of hCRH (46. 5 +/- 7. 2 min) and that of oCRH (39. 8 +/- 10. 1 min); these half-lives were also significantly (P less than 0. 001) longer than that of hCRH in man. One possible explanation for the shorter half-life of hCRH in man is that the clearance of hCRH is enhanced by CRH-binding protein, although other binding proteins often have the opposite effect. Peak ACTH and cortisol responses occurred earlier <b>in</b> <b>sheep</b> than <b>in</b> man, although no differences were found in the response times to oCRH or hCRH within either species. The responses were more sustained <b>in</b> <b>sheep</b> than <b>in</b> man, and the previously reported biphasic response was only seen in some of the <b>sheep</b> and not <b>in</b> man. Absolute responses to either peptide were greater <b>in</b> <b>sheep</b> than <b>in</b> man; however, in man an 8. 1 -fold rise in ACTH was measured in response to oCRH, while hCRH gave a significantly (P = 0. 043) smaller 4. 4 -fold response.
