This body, created by N. Petrașcu, officially admitted him in December 1904. With Dumitru Karnabatt as his secretary, Streitman was putting out a new Bucharest newspaper, Observatorul ("The Observer").|$|E

25|$|Several awards {{held their}} {{nominations}} before the December release of The Force Awakens, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards {{and some other}} awards ceremonies. However, the film {{was added to the}} 21st Critics' Choice Awards's slate of best picture nominees after a <b>special</b> <b>vote</b> by the board of directors, and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of The Force Awakens, where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Judge Landis was {{a leading}} {{candidate}} when American League and National League team owners, embarrassed by the Black Sox scandal and other instances of players throwing games, sought someone to rule over baseball. Landis was given full power {{to act in the}} sport's best interest, and used that power extensively over the next quarter-century. Landis was widely praised for cleaning up the game, although some of his decisions in the Black Sox matter remain controversial: supporters of [...] "Shoeless Joe" [...] Jackson and Buck Weaver contend that he was overly harsh with those players. Others blame Landis for, in their view, delaying the racial integration of baseball. Landis was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by a <b>special</b> <b>vote</b> shortly after he died in 1944.|$|E
60|$|It {{was through}} this pastor, Mr. Wilks, that John Williams first imbibed his {{interest}} in the missionary cause,--an interest that gradually grew upon him so much, that in his twentieth year he decided upon devoting himself to the task. Good Mr. Wilks freely gave the young ironmonger assistance in supplying the deficiencies of his education, and in July 1816 he was presented to the directors of the London Missionary Society, and passed an examination, after which he was accepted, before he was out of his apprenticeship. According to rule, so young and so insufficiently instructed a man would ordinarily have had some years of training before actually undertaking to labour among the heathen, but there was at the moment an urgent call for aid from various branches, and it was decided, by a <b>special</b> <b>vote</b> of the committee, to send him out as soon as possible to the South Sea Islands. His master willingly released him from the seven months that remained of his term; nor had his time of apprenticeship been by any means wasted, for the mechanical skill he had acquired was of great importance to his success as a civilizer. Marriage was always recommended to the missionaries of the Baptist Societies, and Williams's fate was no sooner decided than he chose Mary Channer, a constant attendant at the Tabernacle, and a woman helpful, kind, and brave, as befitted a missionary's wife.|$|E

50|$|All voting papers, counterfoils and electoral rolls are {{returned}} to the electorate's returning officer for a compulsory recount; this also includes approving and counting any <b>special</b> <b>votes,</b> and compiling a master roll to ensure no voter has voted more than once. Official results, including all recounted ordinary <b>votes</b> and <b>special</b> <b>votes,</b> were released at 14:00 on Saturday 4 October 2014.

50|$|Those {{in another}} {{electorate}} {{on election day}} can cast a <b>special</b> <b>vote</b> at any polling place, after filling in a form explaining their reason for needing a <b>special</b> <b>vote.</b> Special polling places are set up in hospitals, maternity homes and rest homes and voting can take place in these places during the two weeks before election day and on election day itself. Voters who are overseas or otherwise unable to vote on election day, {{and do not have}} access to a hospital polling place, can vote by mail or at an advance voting facility. Some New Zealand High Commissions and Embassies provide polling places.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{according}} to the initialization procedure described above, when an EMR-ARP node sends the first <b>special</b> <b>voting</b> request packet after reboot or initial deployment, if an attacker replies with a false MAC address for the queried IP address, then the new node will try to avoid {{the use of the}} IP address in conflict. Thus, the voting replies from the attackers advertising false IP/MAC mapping cannot help one-way eavesdropping for the packets going to the new EMR-ARP node. Conversely, if there is no reply for the first <b>special</b> <b>voting</b> request, then all the normal EMR-ARP nodes will accept the mapping between the sender protocol address and the sender hardware address of the <b>special</b> <b>voting</b> request packet by the algorithm in Figure 6. Thus, the proposed initialization procedure can effectively prevent one-way eavesdropping of the packets destined to the newly attached nodes.|$|R

50|$|The {{final vote}} count {{included}} 436 <b>special</b> <b>votes,</b> {{which were not}} included in the election-night results. Sheat's majority of 24 on election night was only 18 after the final count.|$|R

50|$|The 1974 {{election}} {{was famous for}} its close result. With a provisional majority that was small enough to be potentially eroded by <b>special</b> <b>votes</b> the final result was not known for nearly a month following several re-counts due to {{the closeness of the}} polling. Michael Fowler had an election night lead of 387 while over 4,000 <b>special</b> <b>votes</b> were cast which ended up being very evenly distributed between the two top contenders. In the end Fowlers majority was reduced by only 20 votes and he was duly declared elected as Wellington's new mayor. Sir Frank Kitts lost the Mayoralty after a record 18 years in the role.|$|R
50|$|Albert Butler is an American {{politician}} {{who is currently}} a Mississippi state senator. He was sworn into post in March 2010.

50|$|In the 1999 election, Blincoe {{missed out}} on a seat, as a list {{candidate}} under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, by a narrow margin once <b>special</b> <b>votes</b> had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, {{as well as a}} party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of <b>special</b> <b>votes,</b> however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament. In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire extra list seats in Parliament.|$|R
50|$|On September 11, 2012, the East Central School and Preston School districts held a <b>special</b> <b>vote</b> to {{determine}} whether or not to merge their school districts.
