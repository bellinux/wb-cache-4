40|$|ABSTRACT. Here, we have {{utilized}} Lateral Force Microscopy (LFM) based mechanical pushing of micro/nano-objects to study adhesion and friction characterization at the micro/nanoscale. Continuum micro/nano-friction models for particle rolling, <b>spinning</b> and <b>sliding</b> cases are discussed for general particle-substrate interfaces. A rolling resistance model using the Double-Hertz model is devoloped for such general interfaces. Using the friction models, {{the effect of}} work of adhesion, effective Young’s modulus, and contact radius at the particle-substrate interface are studied in detail. Combining friction models with experimental particle pushing vertical and lateral force data, the critical frictional interface parameters such as critical rolling distance and the interfacial shear strength are measured for a polystyrene particle and glass substrate interface. Results show that the critical rolling distance varies with the particle radius, and it is measured to be 42 nm, 84 nm, and 128 nm on average for 5 µm, 10 µm, and 15 µm radius particles, respectively. Next, using the particle spinning experimental data, the interfacial shear strength of the particle-substrate interface is measured as 9 - 15 MPa...|$|R

40|$|Sensory-motor {{difficulties}} are usually {{considered as a}} part of larger pictures, such as specific learning disabilities, autism, ADD, ADHD, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc. However, many researchers argue that these difficulties can emerge in child’s development on their own as well, and can be identified from the age of 3 and ½ years of the child. However, the official diagnostic manuals have so far accepted only the difficulties in motor areas, referring to e. g. developmental dyspraxia, developmental coordination disorder, or specific developmental disorder of motor function. There are researchers who argue that motor and sensory functioning and development influence each other and consequently other areas as well. Nevertheless, the children with such difficulties need to be identified, regardless what “diagnose” would they get. The diagnosis is not supposed to be a goal, but the help to optimize child’s development already in early years. This way, focusing on the identification of children with sensory-motor difficulties, I chose to contact kindergarten teachers to get answers to my research questions: Are children (from 3 and ½ to 6 years old) with sensory-motor difficulties recognized in kindergarten settings? How are they recognized? How are kindergarten teachers concerned about sensory-motor difficulties in a preschool child? Are kindergarten teachers generally more concerned about a particular type of sensory-motor difficulties? Do kindergartens have any special routines for screening/assessment children for any sensory-motor skills or difficulties? The survey design of this research used questionnaire research technique, yielding both quantitative and qualitative data. The research was conducted in the capital city of Norway, Oslo. The sample of 31 kindergarten teachers was obtained and analyzed, using statistical measurements. The collected data shown that the participating kindergarten teachers were generally most concerned about child’s anxiety, lack of balance, oversensitivity to touch, noise, temperatures, tastes, hyposensitivity to pain, problems with articulation, orientation, or clumsiness in fine motor activities. They would follow up the children with such difficulties, consult with parents and cooperate with specialists for further assessment. If the child tended to chew on everything (e. g. toys, blankets), the majority of participating kindergarten teachers would think it might be a little problem now, but still thought the child can “grow out of it”. And if the child had aversion to certain physical activities (e. g. jumping, walking stairs, hopping, swinging, <b>spinning,</b> <b>sliding),</b> the majority of these kindergarten teachers would think it was a problem, but didn’t think someone can do anything about it. They would most likely work with the child on this issue in their kindergarten, but they would not refer the child for further assessment. The majority of participating kindergarten teachers has some kind of tests/ assessment methods for gross motor skills, fine motor skills, balance, speech – articulation and anxiety issues. Tests/ assessment routines for posture and sensitivity were less frequent among participating kindergartens. As I explained in data analysis, these data might be biased, with one exception, speech – articulation category. It seemed the majority of participants have a test called TRAS. Unfortunately, these results are not significant enough to be drawn to entire population of kindergarten teachers in Norway and therefore the main research questions can’t be answered.

40|$|Speakers of English habitually encode motion events using manner-of-motion verbs (e. g., <b>spin,</b> roll, <b>slide)</b> whereas Spanish {{speakers}} rely on path-of-motion verbs (e. g., enter, exit, approach). Here, we {{ask whether}} the language-specific verb representations used in encoding motion events induce different modes of “thinking-for-speaking” in Spanish–English bilinguals. That is, assuming that the verb encodes the most salient information in the clause, do bilinguals find the path of motion to be more salient than manner of motion if they had previously described the motion event using Spanish versus English? In our study, Spanish–English bilinguals described a set of target motion events in either English or Spanish and then participated in a nonlinguistic similarity judgment task in which they viewed the target motion events individually (e. g., a ball rolling into a cave) followed by two variants a “same-path” variant such as a ball sliding into a cave or a “same-manner” variant such as a ball rolling away from a cave). Participants had to select {{one of the two}} variants that they judged to be more similar to the target event: The event that shared the same path of motion as the target versus the one that shared the same manner of motion. Our findings show that bilingual speakers were more likely to classify two motion events as being similar if they shared the same path of motion and if they had previously described the target motion events in Spanish versus in English. Our study provides further evidence for the “thinking-for-speaking” hypothesis by demonstrating that bilingual speakers can flexibly shift between language-specific construals of the same event “on-the-fly. ...|$|R

50|$|Sliding is {{the most}} {{effective}} braking technique for downhill skateboarders. It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than footbraking, but requires a wider area depending on his ability to control the slide. It has also evolved into its own discipline of skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. A few names of these slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendelum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide. Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as UHMWPE, Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider's speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check. Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to trim speed and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position {{over the course of the}} slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as laybacks, pressure <b>spins,</b> 5-0 <b>slides,</b> and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide {{is the most}} popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as you do a complete 180 degree turn with one hand on the ground.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Circulating {{tumor cells}} (CTCs) have been {{proposed}} as a monitoring tool in patients with solid tumors. So far, automated approaches are challenged by the cellular heterogeneity of CTC, especially the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recently, Yu and colleagues showed that shifts in these cell populations correlated with response and progression, respectively, to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. In this study, we assessed which non-hematopoietic cell types were identifiable in the peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and whether their distribution during treatment courses is associated with clinical characteristics. METHODS: Subsequent to few enrichment steps, cell suspensions were <b>spun</b> onto glass <b>slides</b> and further characterized using multi-immunofluorescence staining. All non-hematopoietic cells were counted and individual cell profiles were analyzed per patient and treatment. RESULTS:We detected a remarkable variation of cells with epithelial, mesenchymal, liver-specific, and mixed characteristics and different size ranges. The distribution of these subgroups varied significantly between different patient groups and was associated with therapeutic outcome. Kaplan-Meier logrank test showed that {{a change in the}} ratio of epithelial to mesenchymal cells was associated with longer median time to progression (1 vs 15 months; P =. 03; hazard ratio = 0. 18; 95 %confidence interval = 0. 01 - 2. 75).

40|$|Stimuli-responsive fibers {{were created}} by {{incorporating}} pH-sensitive nanoparticles into electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fibers. The fluorescent silica nanoparticles, Cornell dots (C dots), have both a fluorescent core (518 nm emission), and a fluorescent pH-sensitive shell (572 nm emission). Using confocal microscopy, the signaling effectiveness of these fibers was studied by varying several parameters: fiber diameter, substrate, and surface hydrophilicity. For the CA fibers, fiber diameter was varied by changing the feed rate during the electrospinning process to 0. 03 mL/hr, 0. 30 mL/hr and 0. 30 mL/min, producing fibers with average diameters of 1. 1 [MICRO SIGN]m, 1. 8 [MICRO SIGN]m and 9. 5 [MICRO SIGN]m, respectively. It was found that fibers with larger surface area had a greater sensitivity to pH change than fibers with smaller surface area. The response of the pH-sensitive fibers also varied when both the nanoparticles and CA fibers were applied/electrospun {{onto the surface of}} four different substrates: optical glass slides, cotton, cotton/polyester, and nylon/spandex fabrics. Fibers <b>spun</b> onto glass <b>slides</b> and cotton/polyester showed an improvement in sensitivity to pH change, while the cotton and nylon/spandex samples were greatly influenced by the chemistry inherent to these substrates. Poly(lactic acid) - b - poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-b-PEG) copolymers with block lengths of 1000 - 750, 5000 - 1000 and 1000 - 5000 and bulk PEG were added to PLA electrospinning dopes to create hydrophilic but non-water soluble nanofibers. PLA-b-PEG block lengths strongly affected the total amount of PEG that could be incorporated, spinnability and fiber morphology. Solutions containing > 1 % w/w of the lowest molecular weight copolymer PLA (1000) - b - PEG (750) formed an unspinnable, cloudy gel. Addition of the PLA (5000) - b - PEG (1000) to the base spinning solution influenced fiber diameters and spinnability {{in the same manner as}} simply increasing PLA concentration in the spinning dope. Addition of PLA (1000) - b - PEG (5000) resulted in decreased fiber diameters, and allowed for the highest overall copolymer loading. In final fiber formulations, maximums of 0. 9, 2. 9 and 9. 3 wt% PEG could be added to the fibers using the PLA-b-PEG 1000 - 750, 5000 - 1000 and 1000 - 5000 respectively. PEG (MW = 3350 g/mol) homopolymer was added to the spinning dopes to result in 1. 0 and 5. 0 wt% PEG in the final fibers. These spinning dopes were electrospun with more non-uniform and variable morphology and diameter size than occurred with the addition of PEG in block copolymer form. Water absorbance by electrospun nonwoven fabrics increased by four times over the control PLA with the addition of 1. 0 wt% PEG, and by eighteen times with the addition of 9. 3 wt% PEG with the block copolymers. At similar overall PEG loadings, the addition of PLA-b-PEG resulted in a two to four fold increase in water wicking over the addition of PEG homopolymer. The improvement in water wicking was mirrored in the pH-measurement data compiled for these samples on glass slides. It was found that response to pH change was influenced by PEG content, copolymer chain length, fiber geometry and water wicking. Finally, incorporating CA and PLA/PLA-b-PEG fibers into a prototype fluidic chip created a pH-sensing device. The response of the fibers was consistent with the increases in surface area and wicking rate, just as in the glass slides experiments, and proved to be a functional method for measuring pH change...|$|R
