5000|$|<b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose are {{distinct}} from <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> limitation, though their effects are very similar. Deadlines imposed by <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> repose are enforced much more strictly than those <b>of</b> <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> limitation. In {{contrast to a}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations, a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose [...] "is designed to bar actions after a specified period of time has run from the occurrence of some event other than the injury which {{gave rise to the}} claim." ...|$|R
50|$|In many cases, both a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> {{limitations}} and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose will {{apply to the}} same case, and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations may cut off liability even if the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations has not run. For example, a defect in an airplane might cause a crash twelve years after the date of initial sale, with the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations for a personal injury claim commencing on {{the date of the}} crash, but where a ten year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose on product liability claims will have already expired. The earlier expiration <b>of</b> the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose will prevent the personal injury claim even before the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations starts to run.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{states have}} a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> {{ultimate}} repose (similar to, but {{not to be confused}} with, a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations) that limits the length of time after which a party can legally be held liable for their negligent act or defective product. Many {{states have a}} [...] "useful life" [...] <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose. Therefore, a determination of the length of time the product would normally be expected to be used before wearing out needs to be made. For example, a refrigerator might have a longer [...] "useful life" [...] than an electric fan; an airplane might have a longer useful life than a car. Some states pick an arbitrary number of years for the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose. It may be short (six or seven years) or longer 15 or 25 years. If a coffee maker starts on fire after the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose has expired, the manufacturer can no longer be held liable for manufacturing or design defects. The <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose is different from the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations. In a state with a short <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose, it is common that a person's right to bring a claim in court expires before their injury ever occurs. Thus, if a defective product (for example a car) caused a collision when the steering failed, but the collision occurred after the expiration <b>of</b> a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> ultimate repose, no claim could be brought against the manufacturer for selling a defective product. The right to bring the claim expired before the claim even occurred.|$|R
50|$|The Galician <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy (Estatuto de autonomía de Galicia) (1936) was a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> {{autonomy}} for Galicia.
