40|$|Abstract — Recovering {{the symbols}} in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{receiver}} is a computationally-intensive process. The layered space-time (LST) algorithms provide a reasonable tradeoff between complexity and performance. Com-mercial digital signal processors (DSPs) {{have become a}} key component in many high-volume products such as cellular tele-phones. As an alternative to power-hungry DSPs, we propose to use a moderately-parallel <b>single-instruction</b> <b>stream,</b> multiple-data stream (SIMD) co-processor architecture, called DSP-RAM, to implement an LST MIMO receiver that offers high performance with relatively low power consumption. For a typical indoor wireless environment, a 100 -MHz DSP-RAM can potentially provide more than 10 times greater decoding throughput at the receiver of a (4, 4) MIMO system compared to a conventional 720 -MHz DSP. The DSP-RAM processor has been coded in a hardware description language (HDL) and synthesized for both available field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and for a 0. 18 −µm CMOS standard cell implementation.

40|$|Motion {{estimation}} is {{a temporal}} image compression technique where an n x n block of pixels {{in the current}} frame of a video sequence is represented by a motion vector {{with respect to the}} best matched block in a search area of the previous frame, and the DCT coefficients of the estimated error terms. In this paper, a fast technique for motion estimation is proposed and later mapped onto the SIMD structure of the Computational*RAM (C*RAM). C*RAM is a conventional computer DRAM (or SRAM) with built-in logic circuitry at the sense-amplifier {{to take advantage of the}} high on-chip memory bandwidth and massively parallel SIMD (<b>Single-Instruction</b> <b>stream,</b> Multiple-Data stream) operations.

40|$|Motion {{estimation}} is {{a temporal}} image compression technique, where an n x n block of pixels {{in the current}} frame of a video sequence is represented by a motion vector {{with respect to the}} best matched block in a search area of the previous frame, and the DCT coefficients of the displaced block differences. In this paper, a low complexity technique for motion estimation is proposed. The proposed technique, first, reduces the n-bit grayscale frames into 1 -bit binary frames using morphological filters, and determines the displacement of the edge features of the adjacent frames. While reduction in bit-depth requires a small percentage of computation using the full pixel resolution, the search procedure is performed by simple XOR logic operations and 1 -b distortion accumulations on the entire search area. Compared to other low complexity techniques, the proposed technique yields better frame reconstruction, operates using simpler arithmetic/logic operations, and possesses a higher degree of parallelism when implemented on a 2 -D <b>Single-Instruction</b> <b>stream,</b> Multiple-Data stream (SIMD) architecture. Key words: motion estimation, morphological image processing, SIMD architecture, parallel processing. 1...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Real World Computing (RWC) Project aims at {{developing}} "flexible information processing" {{technologies for}} real world applications. Main research areas are optical computing, theoretical basis, novel functions, and massively parallel computing. A series of massively parallel computers are {{planned to be}} developed to serve {{as part of the}} infrastructure of the project. The first in the series, RWC- 1, is now under development [4]. RWC- 1 is based on the "RICA architecture" in which computation and communication is closely coupled. The close coupling enables efficient fine-grain parallel computation, which is desirable in flexible computational tasks. Multiple-instruction, multiple-data stream (MIMD) type parallel computers [...] - RWC- 1 is one such [...] - allow more flexible computation than <b>single-instruction,</b> single-data <b>stream</b> (SIMD) type parallel computers, since constituent processors does not run in a lock-step manner but and asynchronously and freely.

40|$|Earlier {{encouraging}} {{test results}} of a contextual classifier that combines spatial and spectral information employing a general statistical approach are expanded. The earlier results were of limited meaning because they were produced from small (50 -by- 50 pixel) data sets. An implementation of the contextual classifier on NASA Goddard's Massively Parallel Processor (MPP) is presented; {{for the first time}} the MPP makes feasible the testing of the classifier on large data sets (a 12 -hour test on a VAX- 11 / 780 minicomputer now takes 5 minutes on the MPP). The MPP is a <b>Single-Instruction,</b> Multiple Data <b>Stream</b> computer, consisting of 16, 384 bit serial microprocessors connected in a 128 -by- 128 mesh array with each element having data transfer connections with its four nearest neighbors so that the MPP is capable of billions of operations per second. Preliminary results are given (with more expected for the conference) and plans are mentioned for extended testing of the contextual classifier on Thematic Mapper data sets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{architectural}} {{landscape of}} high-performance computing stretches from superscalar uniprocessor to explicitly parallel systems to dedicated hardware implementations of algorithms. Single-purpose hardware can achieve {{the highest performance}} and uniprocessors {{can be the most}} programmable. Between these extremes, programmable and reconfigurable architectures provide a wide range of choice in flexibility, programmability, computational density, and performance. The UCSC Kestrel parallel processor strives to attain single-purpose performance while maintaining user programmability. Kestrel is a <b>single-instruction</b> <b>stream,</b> multipledata stream (SIMD) parallel processor with a 512 -element linear array of 8 -bit processing elements. The system design focuses on efficient high-throughput DNA and protein sequence analysis, but its programmability enables high performance on computational chemistry, image processing, machine learning, and other applications. The Kestrel system has had unexpected longevity in its utility due to a careful design and analysis process. Experience with the system leads to the conclusion that programmable SIMD architectures can excel in both programmability and performance. This paper presents the architecture, implementation, applications, and observations of the Kestrel project at the University of California at Santa Cruz...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{image and}} video {{processing}} algorithms, especially the compression algorithms, are first studied {{in their natural}} formats to appreciate the needs for real-time operations and hence, parallel computing. The computational intense, memory-bound problems are next approached from two directions: algorithmic and architectural. Algorithmic approach tends to systematically analyze the flow independence and data independence of a program, while architectural approach tends to gain speed-up by resource multiplicity and time sharing. The majority of image and video processing algorithms are inherently data-parallel in nature. The vectorization of these algorithms requires consistent practices, and new challenge in parallel programming seems endless. The data-parallel nature of image/video processing algorithms map well onto the <b>Single-Instruction</b> <b>stream,</b> Multiple-Data stream (SIMD) of an increasingly popular Memory-Embedded Array Processor classified as the Intelligent RAMS, specifically, the Computational*RAM (C*RAM). C*RAM is a SIMD-memory hybrid where the processing elements are pitch-matched to memory columns of a conventional computer RAM at the sense-amplifiers {{to take advantage of}} the inherently high memory bandwidth, and the emulation of the massively parallel processors. Throughout the thesis, speed-ups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude are obtained. Memory-bound algorithms such as Motion Estimation, and Mean-Absolute-Error for Nearest Neighbor Distortion Computation are among the most efficient implementations. At its best, this thesis will, definitely, put forward the promising research direction which involves fast and efficient in-memory parallel computing for visual communications...|$|E

This article investigates {{the feasibility of}} using muscle thickness deformation SMG as a new signal source to control a prosthetic hand in real time. Thickness deformation SMG of the extensor muscle was measured by a block-matching algorithm during wrist extension-flexion; the amplitude of the deformation was used to control the prosthetic hand.

The two-dimensional logarithmic search (TDL) algorithm, with and without <b>streaming</b> <b>single-instruction</b> multiple-data extensions, showed excellent execution efficiency, with an overall mean correlation coefficient of about 0. 99, a mean standard root-mean-square error < 0. 75, and a mean relative root-mean-square error < 8. 0 % referenced to the cross-correlation algorithm baseline. The mean frame rates were greater than the ultrasound sampling rate (12 Hz), indicating that TDL could be implemented in real-time control. These results demonstrate that only one muscle position is needed to control a prosthetic hand, allowing for proprioception of muscle tension, and that the SMG provides good control of the prosthetic hand, allowing it to proportionally open and close with a fast-search algorithm...|$|R
