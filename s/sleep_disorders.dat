5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders.</b> Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders,</b> inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the release}} of nonbenzodiazepines in 1992 in {{response}} to safety concerns, individuals with insomnia and other <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders</b> have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines (2.3% in 1993 to 13.7% of Americans in 2010), less often prescribed benzodiazepines (23.5% in 1993 to 10.8% in 2010). It is not clear {{as to whether the}} new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines. Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line long-term treatment of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.|$|E
25|$|A sleep {{disorder}}, or somnipathy, is {{a medical}} disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Polysomnography is a test commonly used for diagnosing some <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders.</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>disorders</b> are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders,</b> and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and sleeping sickness. Some common <b>sleep</b> <b>disorders</b> include insomnia (chronic inability to sleep), sleep apnea (abnormally low breathing during sleep), narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), cataplexy (sudden and transient loss of muscle tone), and sleeping sickness (disruption of sleep cycle due to infection).

40|$|A <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> is {{a medical}} <b>disorder</b> of <b>sleep</b> {{patterns}} of a person. Polysomnography is usually used to determine <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> {{but it is a}} partly invasive and interfering method.

But a whole night sleep video is 6 - 8 hours long and thus very difficult to examine such a lengthy video.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Sleep {{disturbance}} is {{prominent in}} many neuropsychiatric disorders and may precipitate or exacerbate {{a range of}} psychiatric conditions. Few studies have investigated <b>sleep</b> <b>disordered</b> breathing and in particular obstructive sleep apnoea in community psychiatric patients and the commonly used screening instruments have not been evaluated in patients with psychiatric disorders. The objective is to evaluate the prevalence of <b>sleep</b> <b>disordered</b> breathing in a community cohort with chronic mental illness on long term psychotropic medication, and to assess the effectiveness of commonly used screening instruments to detect abnormal sleep. Methods: 52 patients completed sleep questionnaires and 50 undertook overnight oximetry. Results: 52 % (n = 26) had sleep-disordered breathing; 20 % (n = 10) had moderate/severe sleep apnoea. The Epworth Sleepiness Score and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory did not predict <b>sleep</b> <b>disordered</b> breathing.

In the present study, {{the relationship between}} the tongue and the qi and blood in conditions with no apparent disease was investigated. Methods.

Two Korean oriental medicine doctors classified subjects into a normal group (n = 402) and a <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> group (n = 52). Three to five weeks after the experiment, 153 subjects were rerecruited for a second experiment.

Results. The color of the tongue body in the <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> group appeared paler than that in the normal group, and the tongue coating in the normal group was less widely distributed compared with that in the <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> group. The differences in tongue color between the normal at first experiment and <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> at second experiment conditions were similar to the differences between the normal and the <b>sleep</b> <b>disorder</b> groups.
