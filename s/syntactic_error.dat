50|$|SAE J2450 Translation Quality Metric (2001)'s {{approach}} to quality assurance is quite straightforward, which bases quality scores on seven types of errors, i.e. wrong term, <b>syntactic</b> <b>error,</b> omission, word structure or agreement error, misspelling, punctuation error and miscellaneous error. Errors {{in each category}} can be classified as either major or minor, with a numeric score attached to each error and severity level (ibid.). The composite score, which decides the translation quality of a text, is the weighted sum of the errors normalized {{by the number of}} words in the source text (ibid.). This simple statistical approach makes comparison of the quality figures of different texts easy, while examination of the errors in specific categories can assist in the identification of particular problem areas.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Compiler writers continue {{to search for}} a reliable method of <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> recovery. Spurious error reports and confusing diagnostics are common problems confronting the programmer. Innumerable error possibilities have made recovery design a frustrating task. This thesis implements a method of <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> recovery using recursive calls on the error recovery routine. Parsing is accomplished by traversing transition diagrams which are created from syntax charts. Key language symbols and dynamically generated recovery positions are used in restoring the parse. High-quality error diagnostics give a clear, accurate, and thorough description of each error, providing an excellent instructional software tool. Approach and implementation issues are discussed, and sample output listings are included. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

The system has been tested on a corpus of real texts, containing both correct and incorrect sentences, with promising results. Introduction The problem of <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> detection and correction has been addressed since the early years of natural language processing. Different techniques have been proposed for the treatment of the significant portion of errors (typographic, phonetic, cognitive and grammatical) that result in valid words (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983; Heidorn et al. 1982). However, although most currently used word-processors actually provide a grammar checking module, little work has been done on the evaluation of results. There are several reasons for this:. Incomplete coverage. Some of the best parsers at the moment can a [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{experiment}} investigated cortical {{responses of}} native Italian subjects during reading of short sentences including semantic or morphosyntactic violations. Given {{the specificity of}} the Italian language in which the sequencing of words is relatively more free than in English or other languages, we investigated whether syntactic and semantic violations were able to elicit event-related potential (ERP) components {{similar to those found}} in other languages. Cortical potentials evoked by the anomalous target word were recorded at frontal, central and parietal electrodes. Results showed that, in Italian, semantic anomaly elicited a negative wave (N 400) in the 400 - 500 ms time-window and <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> evoked a slower positive wave (P 600) in the 500 - 700 ms time-window. <b>Syntactic</b> <b>error</b> also evoked a significant left anterior negativity in the 350 - 450 ms time-window, supporting the view that syntactic processes precedes semantic analysis. Thus, Italian language, notwithstanding its specificity, shows ERPs responses to semantic and syntactic violations, with effects, scalp distribution and latency similar to those found in German, Dutch and English. Results point to a cross-linguistic consistency of the semantic and syntactic ERP components associated with the detection of linguistic anomalies...|$|E

A total of 30 Jordanian English foreign language learners participated in the study. The participants were instructed to write a composition {{of no more than}} one hundred and fifty words on a selected topic. Essays were collected and analyzed statistically to obtain the needed results. The results of the study displayed that <b>syntactic</b> <b>errors</b> produced by the participants were varied, in that eleven types of <b>syntactic</b> <b>errors</b> were committed as follows; verb-tense, agreement, auxiliary, conjunctions, word order, resumptive pronouns, null-subject, double-subject, superlative, comparative and possessive pronouns. Amongst <b>syntactic</b> <b>errors,</b> verb tense errors were the most frequent with 33 %. The results additionally revealed that two types of semantic errors were made; errors at sentence level and errors at word level.

The data are collected from 48 compositions which were written by the students of Ta?miriyah Junior High School, {{who were in the}} third A class. In this case, all categories of morphological and <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> types are classified and described based on the theory of two descriptive taxonomies which are Linguistic Category and Surface Strategy Taxonomy. Based on the result of the analysis, morphological error types in this study, viewed from Linguistic Category Taxonomy, fall into indefinite article case, possessive case, simple verb problems, third person singular case, simple past verb problems, past participle problems, Adjective superlative form, noun, verb, adjective, and adverb form; while the syntactic errors fall into the use of noun phrase, verb phrase, verb and verb construction, word order, transformation, and other four categories of errors, which are fragment, conjunction, modifier, and unidentified error types classified in miscellaneous. Based on the Surface Strategy Taxonomy, those kinds of errors are described as omission, addition, misformation and misordering. The result of the analysis shows that both morphological and syntactic errors comprise big number of errors in this study. However, the occurrence of <b>syntactic</b> <b>error</b> is higher than the morphological one.
