40|$|We study Earth matter {{effect in}} {{oscillation}} of supernovae neutrinos. We show that detecting Earth matter effect gives an independent measurement of spectra of supernovae neutrinos, i. e. the flavor difference of the spectra of supernovae neutrinos. We study {{the effect of}} energy resolution and angular resolution of final electron or positron on detecting the <b>signal</b> of <b>Earth</b> matter effect. We show that varying the widths of energy bins in analysis can change the <b>signal</b> strength of <b>Earth</b> matter effect and the statistical fluctuation. A reasonable choice of energy bins can both suppress the statistical fluctuation and make out a good signal strength relative to the statistical fluctuation. Neutrino detectors with good energy resolution and good angular resolution are therefore preferred {{so that there are}} more freedom to vary energy bins and to optimize the <b>signal</b> of <b>Earth</b> matter effect in analyzing events of supernovae neutrinos.

50|$|In {{parabolic}} trough plants, copper is {{specified in the}} solar collector field (power cables, <b>signals,</b> <b>earthing,</b> electrical motors); steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans, cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, motors), electricity generators (alternator, transformer), and storage systems (circulating pumps, cabling to consumption points). A 50 MW plant with 7.5 hours of storage contains approximately 196 tonnes of copper, of which 131,500 kg are in cables and 64,700 kg are in various equipment (generators, transformers, mirrors, and motors). This translates to about 3.9 tonnes/MW, or, in other terms, 1.2 tonnes/GWh/year. A plant {{of the same size}} without storage can have 20% less copper in the solar field and 10% less in the electronic equipment.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in herbivorous mammals {{during the late}} Cenozoic is classically regarded as an adaptive response to the near-global spread of grass-dominated habitats. Precocious hypsodonty in middle Eocene (~ 38 million years (Myr) ago) faunas from Patagonia, South America, is therefore thought to <b>signal</b> <b>Earth’s</b> first grasslands, 20 million years earlier than elsewhere. Here, using a high-resolution, 43 – 18 million-year record of plant silica (phytoliths) from Patagonia, we show that although open-habitat grasses existed in southern South America since the middle Eocene (~ 40 [*]Myr ago), they were minor floral components in overall forested habitats between 40 and 18 [*]Myr ago. Thus, distinctly different, continent-specific environmental conditions (arid grasslands versus ash-laden forests) triggered convergent cheek–tooth evolution in Cenozoic herbivores. Hypsodonty evolution is an important example where the present is an insufficient key to the past, and contextual information from fossils is vital for understanding processes of adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Fuller (Fuller, M., Geomagnetic field intensity, excursions, {{reversals}} and the 41, 000 -yr obliquity <b>signal,</b> <b>Earth</b> Planet. Sci. Lett. 245 (2006) 605 – 615.) {{pointed out}} that, for 9 reversals {{over the last}} 3 Myr, reversal age has a non-random relationship to the phase of orbital obliquity. Our analysis, based on Rayleigh tests, indicates that reversals have no preferred phase distribution in the obliquity cycle at the 5 % significance level over the last 3 Myr. There is, however, a statistically significant relationship (at the 5 % level) between reversal age and the phase of orbital eccentricity for the last 3 Myr, although this relationship breaks down on adding just a few reversals beyond 3 Ma. Over the last 5 Myr, reversals preferentially occurred during decrease of the maximum obliquity envelope although, yet again, the relationship does not hold as additional reversals {{are added to the}} analysis, no matter which timescale is tested. The Rayleigh tests are all based on the assumption of no uncertainty in reversal/excursion age, or in orbital solutions. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that reversal/excursion ages would have to be known within 5 – 10 kyr to resolve a preferred phase in obliquity similar to that advocated by Fuller (Fuller, M., Geomagnetic field intensity, excursions, reversals and the 41, 000 -yr obliquity <b>signal,</b> <b>Earth</b> Planet. Sci. Lett. 245 (2006) 605 – 615.) over the last 3 Myr. Reversal/excursion ages would have to be known within ~ 15 kyr to resolve a preferred phase in orbital eccentricity for reversals over the last 3 Myr, and within ~ 40 kyr for the last 25 Myr. Comparison of astrochronological reversal timescales indicates that reversal age uncertainties exceed these limits, making it unlikely that a relationship of reversal/excursion age to the phase of obliquity or eccentricity would be resolvable. In the case of the obliquity envelope, the critical levels of reversal age uncertainty (~ 50 kyr for 0 – 3 Ma, ~ 200 kyr for 0 – 5 Ma, and ~ 400 kyr for 0 – 25 Ma) are less stringent. The presence of a significant relationship between reversal age and phase of the obliquity envelope for the last 5 Myr, but not further back in time, implies either larger than expected reversal age uncertainties in pre-Pliocene polarity timescales and a link between reversal age and the obliquity envelope, or, more probably, the fortuitous occurrence of a low probability relationship over the last 5 Ma that has no mechanistic implication...|$|R
