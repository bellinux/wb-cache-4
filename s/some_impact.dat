5|$|Airspace: in many European countries, {{the growth}} of civil {{aviation}} is {{reducing the amount of}} uncontrolled airspace. In the U.S. new security requirements, and {{the growth of}} controlled airspace around cities, has also had <b>some</b> <b>impact</b> on where to fly.|$|E
5|$|The site {{occupies}} a small pocket of forest amongst an extensive region of cleared agricultural land. The agricultural land {{closest to the}} ruins is largely dedicated to livestock grazing, particularly cattle and horses. La Blanca is located close to the Mopan River and its tributary, the Salsipuedes River.

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have <b>some</b> <b>impact</b> on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|Zürich has, {{depending}} on the definition used, an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), with four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Zürich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{parameterization}} {{of radiation}} in the CPTEC’s (Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies, Cachoeira Paulista, SP, Brazil) operational AGCM has {{its origins in}} the work of Harshvardhan et al. (1987) and uses the formulation of Ramaswamy and Freidenreich (1992) for the short-wave absorption by water vapor. The UK Met Office’s radiation code (Edwards and Slingo, 1996) was incorporated into CPTEC’s global model, initially for short-wave only, and <b>some</b> <b>impacts</b> of that were shown by Chagas and Barbosa (2006). Current paper presents <b>some</b> <b>impacts</b> of the complete incorporation (both short-wave and long-wave) of UK Met Office’s scheme. Selected results from off-line comparisons with line-by-line benchmark calculations are shown. Impacts on the AGCM’s climate are assessed by comparing output of climate runs of current and modified AGCM with products from GEWEX/SRB (Surface Radiation Budget) project...|$|R

25|$|The Central Valley {{spans the}} O'Higgins (VI) and Maule (VII) {{administrative}} regions {{as well as}} the Metropolitana Region. Within it are four subregions: the Maipo Valley, the Rapel Valley, the Curicó Valley and the Maule Valley. This is Chile's most productive and internationally known wine region, {{due in large part to}} its proximity to the country's capital, Santiago. It is located directly across the Andes from Argentina's most well known wine region, Mendoza Province The soil of Maipo Valley is noted for high salinity stemming from irrigation from the Maipo river and low potassium level which has <b>some</b> <b>impact</b> on the grapevines. Vineyards in the Maule also suffer from low potassium as well as deficient nitrogen levels. Advances in viticultural techniques have helped vineyards in these regions compensate for some of these effects.|$|E
25|$|Consumption in {{the twentieth}} and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by {{automobile}} growth; the 1985–2003 oil glut even fueled the sales of low economy vehicles in OECD countries. The 2008 economic crisis {{seems to have had}} <b>some</b> <b>impact</b> on the sales of such vehicles; still, the 2008 oil consumption shows a small increase. In 2016 however Goldman Sachs predicts lower demand due to emerging economies concerns, especially China. The BRICS (Brasil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries might also kick in, as China briefly was the first automobile market in December 2009. The immediate outlook still hints upwards. In the long term, uncertainties linger; the OPEC believes that the OECD countries will push low consumption policies {{at some point in the}} future; when that happens, it will definitely curb oil sales, and both OPEC and EIA kept lowering their 2020 consumption estimates during the past 5 years. Oil products are more and more in competition with alternative sources, mainly coal and natural gas, both cheaper sources.|$|E
25|$|After {{the events}} of the Civil War, anti-British {{sentiment}} was high in the United States. British-built Confederate warships had wreaked havoc on US commerce during the war. Irish-Americans were a large and politically important constituency, particularly in parts of the Northeastern States, and a large number of Irish American regiments had participated in the war. Thus, while deeply concerned about the Fenians, the US government, led by Secretary of State William H. Seward, generally ignored their efforts: the Fenians were allowed to openly organize and arm themselves, and were even able to recruit in Union Army camps. The Americans were not prepared to risk war with Britain and intervened when the Fenians threatened to endanger American neutrality. The Fenians were a serious threat to Canada, as being veterans of the Union Army they were well-armed. Despite failures, the raids had <b>some</b> <b>impact</b> on Canadian politicians who were then locked in negotiations leading up to the Confederation agreement of 1867.|$|E
