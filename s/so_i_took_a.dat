6000|$|... "I {{have not}} lain down. When we came home at four o'clock, Cecil was quite knocked up, excited and hysterical. Her maid advised {{me to leave}} her to her; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> bath, and came down to wait for you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{started off}} upon my errands, but before doing <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{look at the}} {{barometer}} upon the wall. The mercury had sunk to the phenomenal point of twenty-eight inches. Clearly the old sailor had not been wrong in his interpretation of Nature's signs.|$|E
5000|$|... "Some of {{my songs}} had been recorded, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> advance on my song {{royalties}} {{and went back}} to college, graduated, and got married. When my twin daughters were born, I put the guitar into the closet and went to work for Sears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called them}} hares and {{tortoises}}," [...] Clara said--a little timidly, for she dreaded being laughed at. [...] "And I thought there couldn't {{be so many}} hares as tortoises on the Line: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> extreme case--one hare and {{an infinite number of}} tortoises." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{not strong}} enough to lower Boggs's bulk, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> {{unlighted}} candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope, implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of him, and then swung out over the shaft.|$|R
60|$|Teague's man, a {{young fellow}} called Virgil, met us here. He did not {{resemble}} the ancient Virgil in the least, {{but he did}} {{look as if he}} had walked right out of one of my romances of wild riders. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> liking to him at once.|$|E
60|$|I {{went downstairs}} again {{to put out}} the lights in the dining-room. I noticed as I passed the {{sideboard}} that I was still shaking a little. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> small drink of whisky--though as a rule I never care to take more than one drink--unless when I am sitting talking as we are here.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} pacify Dora, but {{she turned away}} her face, and shook her curls from side to side, and said, 'You cruel, cruel boy!' so many times, that I really did not exactly know what to do: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> few turns {{up and down the}} room in my uncertainty, and came back again.|$|E
50|$|I {{started out}} before the Battle of Cr√©cy and the Battle of Agincourt, but then <b>I</b> <b>took</b> them out of that matrix. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> {{historical}} entity {{in the form of}} the English troops and threw it into a science fiction environment. By the time I brought them back to Earth, Earth had been developing long enough the Earth was a science-fiction environment, as well. So it's not like 1633 or 1632 would have been.|$|R
5000|$|On Blackacidevil, the band's sound {{shifted from}} doomy and gothic heavy metal to {{experimental}} industrial rock. Glenn Danzig explained: [...] "I {{wanted to do}} something that nobody else was really doing. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> element of industrial that I liked here, and an element of techno there, then mixed it with what I normally do. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the best elements of stuff. They're powerful when used properly. Then, I'd still experiment with different directions, which I wanted to do anyway, and then watch what happened when I mixed it together." [...] On several tracks Danzig applied distortion effects to his vocals.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bideawhile shouldn't {{have asked}} you to agree to {{anything}} in my absence,' said Squercum indignantly. 'It was a very unprofessional thing on his part, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>take</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of telling him.' ...|$|R
60|$|I did not {{altogether}} {{like to give}} in, though I did not relish the plunge. There might be snags about, or weeds, I thought. I meant to compromise matters by {{going down to the}} edge and just throwing the water over myself; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> towel and crept out on the bank and wormed my way along on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into the water.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{my chance}} came," [...] Jack went on. [...] "I'd found out almost everything; not, of course, exactly {{by way of}} legal proof, but to my own entire satisfaction: and I {{determined}} to lay the matter definitely at once before Mr. Callingham. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> holiday for a fortnight, to go bicycling in the Midlands I told my patients; and I fixed my head-quarters at Wrode, which, as you probably remember, is twenty miles off from Woodbury.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was hot and}} feverish, {{and could}} not sleep; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stroll in the forest, and got lost. Luckily, Susquesus had an eye on me, and kept himself at hand the whole time. I was obliged to catch a nap {{in the top of}} a fallen tree, and when I woke in the morning, the Onondago led me here in quest of {{something}} to eat, for I was hungry as a famished wolf." ...|$|E
60|$|MICH. I think not. I {{will wear}} {{the uniform of}} the Imperial Guard, and the Colonel on duty is one of us. It is on the first floor, you remember; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long shot.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} for Songwriting Magazine, Parsons recalled: [...] "I think a good producer can transform a song. If {{you make a}} small change compositionally that really makes a song gel then you can say production is part of songwriting. For example I remember on Steve Harley's [...] "Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)" [...] he was phrasing the chorus completely differently and I suggested that he made it more rhythmic and I think {{that is part of}} the hook of the whole record, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bit of credit for that - although I didn't get paid for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{understand}} {{very little}} German,' said she, coldly. 'I {{once had a}} German governess whom <b>I</b> disliked <b>so</b> much that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> disgust to the language.' ...|$|R
60|$|The three detectives {{had many}} matters of detail into which to inquire; so I {{returned}} alone to our modest quarters {{at the village}} inn. But before doing <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.|$|E
60|$|At {{this instant}} Rectus {{ran up the}} black flag with the yellow cog-wheel, and we white people gave a cheer. As soon as they got a cue, the darkeys knew what to do. They burst out into a wild yell, they waved their hats, they laid down {{on the grass and}} kicked, they jumped, and danced, and laughed, and screamed. I was afraid the queen would bolt, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> quiet hold of her shawl. But she stood still until the crowd cooled down a little, and then she made a {{courtesy}} and sat down.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} my only chance was to act at once. I threw on my clothes, {{opened the window}} softly, and, after making sure that there was nobody about, dropped out onto the ground and made off as hard as I could run. I {{traveled}} a matter {{of two or three}} miles, when my wind gave out; and as I saw a big building with people going in and out, I went in too, and found that it was a railway station. A train was just going off for Dover to meet the French boat, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> ticket and jumped into a third-class carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hoitie toitie," [...] {{answered}} the traveller, [...] "why, how came you here, {{if you go}} to that, squire?--Egad, Lady Penelope is trembling for her souchong, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>took</b> <b>a</b> step here to save her ladyship the trouble of looking after Mrs. Jones in person, which, I think, might have been a worse interruption than mine, Mr. Mowbray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{come over}} {{to see if you}} don't {{want to go to the}} city to-morrow? I've got Joe Pease to stay in the store, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> thought I'd <b>take</b> <b>an</b> outing." ...|$|R
40|$|Knot-work not networks, or anti-anti-antifetishism and the ANTipolitics machine Keir Martin, University of Oslo In this paper, I {{explore what}} might count as {{political}} intervention in contemporary anthropological descriptions. In doing <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> particular {{focus on the}} work of Bruno Latour, as the clearest exponent of a posthuman philosophy critiqued by some of the contributors to this special section. I argue that a posthuman philosophy guided by a rigid anti-anti-fetishism is in danger of failing to take seriously the experience of people for whom the adoption of a perspective that stresses the unique characteristics of human agency and relations is a matter of great political importance. The contemporary posthumanist claim that a disavowal of politics as it is currently configured is necessary to avoid an elitist disdain for our informants is examined from different perspectives, from which posthumanism itself might be viewed as an expression of precisely that elitist disdain that it professes to disavow...|$|R
60|$|But as yet I did not sleep, for though Kari hated both, {{this talk}} of love and women had stirred my blood and made me wakeful. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> rough comb that I had {{fashioned}} from the shell of a turtle, and dragged it through my long fair beard, which, growing fast, now hung down far upon my breast, and through the curling hair that lay upon my shoulders, for I had become as other wild men are, and sang to myself there by the little fire which we kept burning day and night {{and tried to think}} of happy things that never should I know again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Night {{before last}} I sat till eleven, studying. Against the rules, I know; but I forgot, and when I was through I opened my window to air the room. It was bright moonlight, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stroll {{along the top}} of the piazza, and coming back with my eyes on the sky I {{naturally}} saw the roof of the main house from my wing. I couldn't have been asleep, could I? yet, I solemnly declare I saw a white figure with a veil over its head roaming to and fro as quietly as a shadow. I looked and looked, then I called softly, but it never answered, and suddenly it was gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it isn't. Nothing is {{impossible}} when I {{make up my}} mind. You must go. I'll drag you there by main force {{if it comes to}} that. Oh, I have such a jolly plan, Auntie. You know my black and yellow dinner dress--no, you don't either, for I've never worn it here. The folks at home all said it was too severe for me--and so it is. Nothing suits me but the fluffy, chuffy things with a tilt to them. Gil--er--I mean--well, yes, Gilbert always declared that dress made me look like a cross between an unwilling nun and a ballet girl, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> dislike to it. But it's as lovely as a dream. Oh, when you see it your eyes will stick out. You must wear it tonight. It's just your style, and I'm sure it will fit you, for our figures are so much alike." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> had got <b>so</b> uneasy <b>I</b> couldn't set still. I {{had to do}} {{something}} with my hands; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> up <b>a</b> needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested --and I was, too--and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps it {{was that}} her talk put the subject in my mind. The woman needed no such aid; she was always there; but when I locked myself into my room that night, I half {{expected}} to find her in the room. I was not sleepy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> book of Aunt Janet's and began to read. The title was [...] "On the Powers and Qualities of Disembodied Spirits." [...] "Your grammar," [...] said I to the author, [...] "is hardly attractive, but I may learn something which might apply to her. I shall read your book." [...] Before settling down to it, however, I thought I would {{have a look at}} the garden. Since the night of the visit the garden seemed to have a new attractiveness for me: a night seldom passed without my having a last look at it before turning in. So I drew the great curtain and looked out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought it}} was queer, but I {{went on to the}} stable. About {{a quarter of an hour}} afterwards, and as I was a-cleaning up the bits, I heard Wolf howl. He kept on at it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> lantern and went out to see what was the matter. He was rolling about, and seemed very bad. I stood a-looking at him, {{wondering}} what were best to do, when sudden he gave a sort of yell, and rolled over, and he was dead. I {{thought it was}} no good telling you about it till this morning; and thinking it over, and seeing how sudden like it was, I come to the 'pinion as how he had been poisoned; and naturally thinking that, as he had bit Reuben, and as how Reuben said he ought to be killed, and seeing as I had met the boy a quarter an hour afore the dog was took bad, it came to me as how he had done it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I felt a tug at {{the rope}} by which I was raised and lowered. I didn't like this. If I should be pulled up I might be jerked {{away from my}} air-supply and suffocate before I got to the surface. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> turn of the rope around a stick of timber near by, and they might pull {{as much as they}} chose without {{disturbing}} me. There I stood, and thought, and wondered. But, above everything, I could not help feeling all the time how good that air was! It seemed to go through every part of me. It was better than wine; it was better than anything I had ever breathed or tasted. A little while ago I was on the point of perishing. Now before me there were tiers of hogsheads full of air! If it had not been that I would be obliged to eat, I might have stayed down there as long as I pleased.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Spin in September 1991, Dench commented on the dynamics within the band, stating that: [...] "I'm the Musical Director, but I couldn't do it without them. They provide so much attitude. Derry's the least active in a musical sense, but he's <b>so</b> involved. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> tune in and he says turn it up or make it more manic.
