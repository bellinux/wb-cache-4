50|$|Spindle oils are {{a type of}} low-viscosity {{mineral oils}} marketed for use in {{lubrication}} of high-speed machine spindles.Spindle oil is free from gumming properties.Since the viscosity is so low the oil runs off {{the surface of the}} spindle during shut-down periods, the <b>spindle</b> <b>oil</b> may be doped with additives that prevent rusting. Since the <b>spindle</b> <b>oil</b> often is used in textile factories it is also important that it doesn't stain the textiles.|$|E

50|$|Several Internet Typex {{articles}} {{say that}} only Vaseline {{was used to}} lubricate Typex machines and that no other lubricant was used. Vaseline was used to lubricate the rotor disc contacts. Without this there was a risk of arcing which would burn the insulation between the contacts. For {{the rest of the}} machine two grades of <b>oil</b> (<b>Spindle</b> <b>Oils</b> 1 and 2) were used. Regular cleaning and maintenance was essential. In particular, the letters/figures cam-cluster balata discs had to be kept lubricated.|$|R

40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{research}} of precision regularities in a spindle unit by the trajectory of the spindle installed on hydrostatic bearings. The mathematical model of trajectories spindle with lumped parameters that allows to define the position of the spindle with regard the simultaneous influence of design parameters, geometrical deviations ofform, temperature deformation bearing surfaces, the random nature of operational parameters and technical loads of hydrostatic bearings has been developed. Based on the results of numerical modeling the influence of shape errors of bearing surface of hydrostatic bearing on the statistical characteristics of the radius vector trajectories of the spindle by varying the values rotational speed of the <b>spindle</b> and <b>oil</b> pressure in front hydrostatic bearing has been developed. The obtained statistical regularities of precision spindle unit have been confirmed experimentally. It has been shown that an effective way to increase the precision of spindle units is to regulate the size of the gap in hydrostatic spindle bearings.

Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils {{used to be the}} recommended <b>spindle</b> and way <b>oils</b> (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).|$|R

30|$|This paper proposes an {{experimental}} approach for monitoring and {{inspection of the}} formation accuracy in ultra-precision grinding (UPG) {{with respect to the}} chatter vibration. Two factors related to the grinding progress, the grinding speed of grinding wheel and <b>spindle,</b> and the <b>oil</b> pressure of the hydrostatic bearing are taken into account to determining the accuracy. In the meantime, a mathematical model of the radius deviation caused by the micro vibration is also established and applied in the experiments. The results show that the accuracy is sensitive to the vibration and the forming accuracy is much improved with proper processing parameters. It is found that the accuracy of aspheric surface can be less than 4 μm when the grinding speed is 1400 r/min and the wheel speed is 100 r/min with the oil pressure being 1.1 MPa.|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} investigations on ball {{motion in}} deep-grooved and angular contact ball bearings {{are presented in}} several reports, adding a theoretical analysis. The ball motion of thrust ball bearing is complicated and influenced specially by centrifugal force {{much more than the}} other rolling bearings for its unique structure. Furtheremore, its motion is affected significantly in accordance with lubricating conditions so that spin friction and or micro slip may occur owing to unstable ball motion. Consequently, their use for high speed is considered generally to be difficult. The probability that either of moving ring and stationary ring becomes the control surface of the ball motion seems equal.

40|$|An {{unconventional}} machining {{technique has}} been developed for producing relatively large radii quasi-toroidal surfaces which could not normally be produced by conventional diamond turning technology. The maximum radial swing capacity of a diamond turning lathe is the limiting factor for the rotational radius of any toroid. A typical diamond turned toroidal surface is produced when a part is rotated about the spindle axis while the diamond tool contours the surface with any curved path. Toric surfaces sliced horizontally, {{have been used in}} laser resonator cavities. This paper will address the fabrication of a special case of toroids where a rotating tool path is a circle whose center is offset from the rotational axis of the toroid by a distance greater than the minor radius of the tool path. The quasi-toroidal surfaces produced by this technique approximate all asymmetrical combinations of concave/convex section of a torus. Other machine configurations have been reported which offer alternative approaches to the fabrication of concave asymmetric aspheric surfaces. Prototypes of unique lenses each having two quasi-toroidal surfaces were fabricated in the Ultraprecision Manufacturing Technology Center at form key components of a scanned laser focusing system. As an example of the problem faced, the specifications for one of the surfaces was equivalent to a section of a torus with a two meter diameter hole. The lenses were fabricated on a Nanoform 600 diamond turning lathe. This is a numerically controlled two axis T-base lathe with an air bearing <b>spindle</b> and <b>oil</b> hydrostatic slides. The maximum radial swing for this machine is approximately 0. 3 meters...|$|R

In a hot room the spinners in vest and overalls only perspire freely, and this must tend to wash off the natural grease on the skin and allow the oil to get onto it. In over 80% of the cases occur on the left side, this may be due to one or more of the following causes: firstly the left side hangs anatomically lower than the right, this will be more pronounced when the spinner is bending forward to piece with his left hand;perspiration from the lower part of the abdomen will then tend to run down the left side and the left side and less often the middle of the scrotum will come into contact with the left thigh and the oily trousers some hundreds of times a day.|$|R

Consequently, hyperplasia caused after short term exposure is of little value for distinguishing between carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic oils. An association between exposure to mineral oils and the development of occupational cutaneous cancer in man was reported by Leitch (1924). Subsequently, mineral oils used as coolants/lubricants in metal working operations were implicated as the cause of scrotal cancer among machine operators (Cruickshank & Squire, 1950). Evidence that occupational exposure to mineral oils increases the risk of cutaneous cancer induction is now substantial (Mastromatteo, 1955...|$|E

It is shown that reaction causes foreshortening of aluminum penetrators at rates that are more competitive at impact velocities towards the slow end of an effective penetrating jet, and that localized reaction and thermal expansion of ablative particulates prior to and after impact can cause substantial plate deformation. The results are consistent with hydrodynamic penetration theory when modified for reaction induced foreshortening.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the productivity, the gas bottom blowing technique has been widely applied to mix molten iron/slag inside the ironmaking smelter. The main function of the technique {{is to increase the}} interface area between slag and iron, then to enhance the rate of the smelting reduction. In this study, the simulated experiments of the ironmaking smelter using water model were conducted to investigate the mixing degree of molten iron/slag under different gas bottom blowing conditions. In the experiments, the major parameters of the gas bottom blowing were the inside diameter of tuyere (6. 0 to 15. 0 mm), the total gas flow rate (320 to 480 normal liter/min), the placement of the bottom blowing tuyeres, and the stirring energy. In the water model, water and <b>spindle</b> <b>oil</b> were selected to be the substitute of liquid iron and molten slag, respectively, inside the smelter. Additionally, thymol was used as the tracer of mass transfer between the water phase and the oil phase. Based on the mass transfer rate equation with the analyzed data of thymol concentration during experiments, the mixing degree could be distinguished for different blowing conditions. In this study, {{it was found that the}} mixing degree of water and oil in the case of 10. 0 mm inner diameter tuyere was higher than those of other size tuyeres under the same gas flow rate via 4 tuyeres. Also, the mixing degree increased with increasing the total gas flow rate. Additionally, the mixing degree in the case of 4 tuyeres in the square-corner placement was higher than that in the triangle-corner-center placement at the same tuyere size and total gas flow rate. If considering both mixing efficiency and the gas consumption, the best choice of blowing condition would be four tuyeres of 10. 0 mm diameter in the square-corner placement under the total gas flow rate of 320 normal liter...|$|E

Foundry characteristics in particular, fluidity, mode of solidification and feeding ability were examined. Metallographic analysis of structures {{was carried out}} using optical and scanning electron microscopy and their mechanical properties were determined using standard techniques. Dry wear characteristics were determined using a pin-on-disc test, and boundary-lubricated wear was studied using full bearing tests. Results from casting experiments were evaluated and compared with the behaviour of a standard ZA- 27 alloy and those from tribological tests with both ZA- 27 alloy and a leaded tin-bronze (SAE 660) under the same testing conditions. The presence of silicon was beneficial, reducing the temperature range of solidification, improving feeding efficiency and reducing gravity segregation of phases. Use of chills and melt degassing was found necessary to achieve soundness and enhanced mechanical properties. Dry wear tests were performed against a steel counterface for sliding speeds of 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2 m/s and {{for a range of}} loads up to 15 kgf. The high aluminium alloys showed wear rates as low as those of ZA- 27 at speeds of 0. 25 and 0. 5 m/s for the whole range of applied loads. ZA- 27 performed better at higher speeds. The build up of a surface film on the wearing surface of the test pins was found to be responsible for the mild type of wear of the zinc based alloys. The constitution of the surface film was determined as a complex mixture of aluminium, zinc and iron oxides and metallic elements derived from both sliding materials. For full bearing tests, bushes were machined from sand cast bars and were tested against a steel shaft {{in the presence of a}} light <b>spindle</b> <b>oil</b> as the lubricant.
