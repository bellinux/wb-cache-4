50|$|A third tornado struck extreme {{northwest}} Calvert County, {{causing the}} roof and a chimney of a predominantly wood-constructed farm house to collapse. The home was temporarily uninhabitable. At least one wall was near failure. A second chimney collapsed at a nearby home. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the path, and one home in an estates subdivision sustained damage to its gutters. Another tornado was spawned in Madison in Dorchester County, {{which is on the}} eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. The twister downed numerous trees and power lines blown down, resulting in <b>scattered</b> <b>property</b> damage and power outages. Strong winds felled trees and large limbs, damaging five homes in Calvert County. The combination of rain, gusty winds, and isolated severe weather left approximately 45,000 customers without electricity on the western shore. The Fenwick Island Buoy, which is just offshore along the Delaware-Maryland border, recorded a sustained wind speed of 47 mph, while the highest gust observed was 63 mph at Ocean City. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 3 to 5 in and caused some street flooding in southeastern Maryland.|$|E

40|$|How {{to assess}} Hungary's present {{situation}} in the broader context of overall economic and political developments in post-socialist Eastern Europe? The regional perspective suggests {{that in terms of}} parting with state socialism and building market democracy Hungary - and a few other countries including Poland - represents the maximum any former socialist state could achieve between 1989 - 98. While in this respect no country succeeded in getting farther, most other states have struggled with the peaceful or forceful formation of national identity or a new, independent state, which often dominated over and conflicted with, the issues of economic reforms and democratization on the transformation agenda. Another key to success is that Hungary - similar to Poland, but to a much larger extent - became a major target for foreign direct investment. This is due to a number of factors: from Hungary's strategy for debt, macroeconomic management and privatization, to the foreign investors' and creditors' own expectations. However, the resulting large capital inflow had a major impact on the features of Hungarian capitalism. While everywhere in East the new ownership structure displays various combinations of foreign owners, "national capitalists", and the <b>scattered</b> <b>property</b> rights of workers, the proportions dramatically differ. In much of the East the cohort of foreign investors is entirely missing, while national capitalists of often doubtful origin, skills and strategies acquired overwhelming share and influence. At the other extreme, in former GDR virtually the whole business elite is "foreign": West-German or of other Western origin. On this scale Hungary, with a one-third of its largely private economy in foreign hands [Hegymenet, 1998 : 163] in 1997 is closest to the former GDR - {{and at the same time}} farthest from the other extreme exhibited by Eastern "national capitalisms". This location makes the Hungarian case specific and hints both at the risks the country avoided and the ones it took. Hungary, Poland, economic reforms...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} science community has entered {{a period in}} which electromagnetic <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> at microwave frequencies of realistically constructed ice particles are necessary for making progress on a number of fronts. One front includes retrieval of ice-particle properties and signatures from ground-based, airborne, and satellite-based radar and radiometer observations. Another front is evaluation of model microphysics by application of forward operators to their outputs and comparison to observations during case study periods. Yet a third front is data assimilation, where again forward operators are applied to databases of ice-particle <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> and the results compared to observations, with their differences leading to corrections of the model state. Over the past decade investigators have developed databases of ice-particle <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> at microwave frequencies and made them openly available. Motivated by and complementing these earlier efforts, a database containing polarimetric single-scattering properties of various types of ice particles at millimeter to centimeter wavelengths is presented. While the database presented here contains only single-scattering properties of ice particles in a fixed orientation, ice-particle <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> are computed for many different directions of the radiation incident on them. These results are useful for understanding the dependence of ice-particle <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> on ice-particle orientation with respect to the incident radiation. For ice particles that are small compared to the wavelength, the number of incident directions of the radiation is sufficient to compute reasonable estimates of their (randomly) orientation-averaged <b>scattering</b> <b>properties.</b> This database is complementary to earlier ones in that it contains complete (polarimetric) <b>scattering</b> <b>property</b> information for each ice particle – 44  plates, 30  columns, 405  branched planar crystals, 660  aggregates, and 640  conical graupel – and direction of incident radiation but is limited to four frequencies (X-, Ku-, Ka-, and W-bands), does not include temperature dependencies of the single-scattering properties, and does not include <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> averaged over randomly oriented ice particles. Rules for constructing the morphologies of ice particles from one database to the next often differ; consequently, analyses that incorporate all of the different databases will contain the most variability, while illuminating important differences between them. Publication of this database is in support of future analyses of this nature and comes with the hope that doing so helps {{contribute to the development of}} a database standard for ice-particle <b>scattering</b> <b>properties,</b> like the NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) CF (Climate and Forecast) or NetCDF CF/Radial metadata conventions...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} of the acoustic <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> of aqueous suspensions of non-cohesive sands having different and mixed mineralogical compositions are presented. Four different types of sand are examined: quartz, crushed shell, magnetite, and muscovite mica. The experimental data obtained {{for each type of}} sand are compared with theoretical scattering predictions for spheres having the same physical properties. The results show that for each type of sand, scattering is enhanced in the geometric regime relative to the sphere predictions, and for mica, scattering in the Rayleigh regime is reduced. To provide a theoretical framework for the observations, the applicability of two different modified sphere scattering models previously reported in the literature is evaluated. Measurements of the ensemble <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> obtained from mixtures of the different sands are also presented and compared with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Atmospheric particles, i. e. ice crystals, dust particles, {{and black}} carbon, show {{significant}} complexities like irregular geometries, inhomogeneity, small-scale surface structures, {{and play a}} significant role in the atmosphere by scattering and absorbing the incident solar radiation and terrestrial thermal emission. Knowledge of aerosol <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> is a fundamental but challenging aspect of radiative transfer studies and remote sensing applications. This dissertation tries to improve our understanding on the <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> of atmospheric particles by investigating both the scattering algorithms and the representation of the realistic particles. One part of this dissertation discusses in details the pseudo-spectral time domain algorithm (PSTD) for calculating <b>scattering</b> <b>properties,</b> its advantages and the elimination of the Gibbs phenomenon. The applicability of the parallelized PSTD implementation is investigated for both spherical and nonspherical particles over a wide range of sizes and refractive indices, and the PSTD is applied for spherical particles with size parameters up to 200, and randomly oriented non-spherical ones with size parameters up to 100. The relative strengths of the PSTD are also shown by a systematic comparison with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The PSTD outperforms the DDA for particles with refractive indices larger than 1. 4, and ones with smaller refractive indices by large sizes (e. g. size parameters larger than 60 for a refractive index of 1. 2). The results suggest significant potential of the PSTD for the numerical investigation of the light scattering and corresponding atmospheric applications. The other part of this dissertation investigates the effects of particle complexities on the light <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> of the atmospheric particles, and three aspects corresponding to the irregular geometry, inhomogeneity and surface roughness are studied. To cover the entire particle size range from the Rayleigh to the geometric- optics regimes, the PSTD (for relatively small particles) is combined with the im- proved geometric-optics method (IGOM) that is only applicable for large particles. The Koch-fractal geometry is introduced to model the light <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> of aerosol, and performs an excellent job of reproducing the experimental measurements of various mineral dust particles. For the inhomogeneous particles, the applicability of the effective medium approximations (EMA) is tested, and the EMA can be used to approximate the <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> of inhomogeneous particles only when the particles are uniformly internal mixtures. Furthermore, an irregular rough model is developed to study the effects of the small-scale surface roughness on the light <b>scattering</b> <b>properties.</b> In conclusion, the dissertation finds that the complexities of atmospheric particles have to be fully considered to obtain their <b>scattering</b> <b>properties</b> accurately...|$|R
