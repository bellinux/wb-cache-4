50|$|Remote sensing is {{the small}} or {{large-scale}} acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, {{by the use of}} either recording or real-time sensing device(s) that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object (such as by way of aircraft, spacecraft, <b>satellite,</b> <b>buoy,</b> or ship). In practice, remote sensing is the stand-off collection {{through the use of a}} variety of devices for gathering information on a given object or area which gives more information than sensors at individual sites might convey. Thus, Earth observation or weather satellite collection platforms, ocean and atmospheric observing weather buoy platforms, monitoring of a pregnancy via ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and space probes are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term generally refers to the use of imaging sensor technologies including but not limited to the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft, and is distinct from other imaging-related fields such as medical imaging.|$|E
40|$|International audienceContinuous {{atmospheric}} {{records of}} O 2 /N 2, CO 2 and N 2 O obtained at Trinidad, California document {{the effects of}} air-sea exchange during coastal upwelling and plankton bloom events. The atmospheric records provide continuous observations of air-sea fluxes related to synoptic scale upwelling events over several upwelling seasons. Combined with <b>satellite,</b> <b>buoy</b> and local meteorology data, calculated anomalies in O 2 /N 2 and N 2 O were utilized in a simple atmospheric transport model to compute air-sea fluxes during coastal upwelling. CO 2 fluxes were linked to the oceanic component of the O 2 fluxes through local hydrographic data and estimated {{as a function of}} upwelling intensity (surface ocean temperature and wind speed). Regional air-sea fluxes of O 2 /N 2 O, and CO 2 during coastal upwelling were estimated with the aid of satellite wind and SST data. Upwelling CO 2 fluxes were found to represent ~ 10 % of export production along the northwest coast of North America. Synoptic scale upwelling events impact the net exchange of atmospheric CO 2 along the coastal margin, and will vary in response to the frequency and duration of alongshore winds that are subject to climate change...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{large number}} of fish species are {{associated}} with drifting seaweeds; however, the ecological significance of such seaweeds for fishes remains unclear. Here, we developed a raft equipped with a seaweed clump, interval still/video cameras, and a GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>buoy.</b> This novel monitoring system was used to monitor the schooling and associative behavior of Seriola spp. juveniles with seaweed for up to 1 wk in the East China Sea. We observed diel behavioral patterns of the fish, which swam around the seaweeds {{during the day and}} remained ‘attached’ to the seaweed or to conspecifics at night. This nighttime behavioral pattern suggests that the fish may use drifting seaweed to maintain schools at night when vision is less effective. Solitary individuals and those in smaller schools tended to remain close to the seaweed, whereas fish in larger schools were observed swimming actively around the seaweed. Additionally, some of the solitary fish and small schools escaped into the seaweed when potential predators appeared. As the school size of the fish increased over time, solitary individuals and small schools may have used drifting seaweeds as a shelter from predators until the fish could gather to form larger schools. We suggest that drifting seaweeds have multiple ecological functions for Seriola spp. and other seaweed-associated fishes, and the knowledge of these functions will be useful in designing conservation and management measures for the associated fishes...|$|E

This study concentrates on documenting their strengths and limitations using <b>satellite</b> measurements, <b>buoy</b> spectra, and a comparison between the different models. It is confirmed that all models perform well in terms of significant wave heights; however higher-order moments have larger errors. The partition wave quantities perform well in terms of direction and frequency but the magnitude and directional spread typically have larger discrepancies. The high-frequency tail is examined through the mean square slope using <b>satellites</b> and <b>buoys.</b> From this analysis it is clear that some models behave better than the others, suggesting their parameterizations match the physical processes reasonably well. However none of the models are entirely satisfactory, pointing to poorly constrained parameterizations or missing physical processes.
