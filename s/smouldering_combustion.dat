40|$|Modern {{buildings}} increasingly {{include the}} usage of innovative materials aimed at improving sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint of the built environment. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are one such group of novel materials which reduce building energy consumption. These materials are typically flammable and contained within wall linings yet {{there has been no}} detailed assessment of their fire performance. Current standard fire test methods provide means to compare similar materials but do not deliver knowledge on how they would behave {{in the event of a}} real fire. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to develop a novel testing framework to assess the behaviour of these materials in realistic fire scenarios. For PCMs, a flammability study is conducted in the bench-scale cone calorimeter to evaluate the fire risk associated with these materials. Then, micro-scale Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) is used to identify the fundamental chemical reactions to be able to confidently interpret the flammability results. Finally, intermediate-scale standard fire tests are conducted to evaluate the applicability of the bench-scale results to realistic fire scenarios. These take the form of modified Lateral Ignition and Flame spread Test (LIFT) and Single Burning Item (SBI) tests to understand flame spread and compartment fires respectively. Finally, a simplified method to combine this knowledge for use in building design is proposed. This method allows the balancing of potential energy benefits with quantified fire performance to achieve the specified goals of the designer. Hemp-lime insulation is a material which has also becoming increasingly popular in the drive towards sustainability. The porous nature of the material means that <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustions</b> are the dominant reaction mode but there is currently no standardised test method for this type of behaviour. Thus, hemp-lime materials also represent an unquantified risk. The work in this thesis defines a simple, accessible and economically viable bench-scale method for quantifying the fire risk associated with rigid porous materials. This is applicable for both downward opposed flow and upward forward flow smoulder propagation conditions. The behaviour is then interpreted using micro-scale thermogravimetric analysis to understand the underlying pyrolysis and oxidation reactions. Designers can utilise this framework to quantify the smouldering risk associated with hemp-lime materials to enable their usage in the built environment. The holistic fire risk assessment performed in this thesis has quantified the behaviour of PCMs and hemp-lime insulation applicable to realistic fire scenarios. The simplified design method empowers designers to be able to realise innovative buildings through fundamental understanding of the fire behaviour of these materials. The outcomes of this thesis allow designers to mitigate the fire risk associated with these materials and achieve optimised engineering solutions. Furthermore, the novel fire testing frameworks provide the economically viable means to assess the fire performance of future PCMs and hemp-lime products which ensures lasting relevance of this research in the future...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between <b>smouldering</b> and flaming <b>combustion</b> is that <b>smouldering</b> occurs {{on the surface of}} the solid rather than in the gas phase. Smouldering is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a porous fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic temperature and heat released during smouldering are low compared to those in the flaming combustion (i.e., ~600 C vs. ~1500 C). Smouldering propagates in a creeping fashion, around , which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak <b>combustion</b> characteristics, <b>smouldering</b> is a significant fire hazard. Smouldering emits toxic gases (e.g., carbon monoxide) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to flaming combustion.|$|R

50|$|Pyrolysis {{is usually}} the first {{chemical}} reaction that occurs in the burning of many solid organic fuels, like wood, cloth, and paper, and also of some kinds of plastic.

Thus, the pyrolysis of common materials like wood, plastic, and clothing is extremely important for fire safety and firefighting. In pyrolysis there is a gas phase present.

The aim of the ground-based sampling experiment was to determine the chemical composition of dust and carbonaceousaerosols in the surface layer, then to investigate the main source areas influencing the chemical composition of the particles. Major elements (Al, Ca and Fe), total (TC) and black carbon (BC), and water soluble ion (Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, NH 4 +, Cl−, NO 3 −, and) concentrations were measured. Total mass, number concentration and aethalometer measurements of PM- 10 were also obtained. Mineraldust in the surface layer is principally present in the coarse fraction representing 75 - 90 % of the collected mass (wt. %). Dust, suggested by backward trajectories of the air masses and supported by the variations of Ca/Al ratios, originates mainly from Northern Sahara. Particulate organic matter (POM) concentrations are more variable, but POM is mainly present in the fine fraction (up to 77 wt. %). Its presence is due to local sources such as domestic fire emissions rather than to remote sources as open-field vegetation fires in the Sahelian zone. Comparisons of Black Carbon (BC) concentrations measured with an aethalometer in the Ultra-violet and the Near-infrared wavelengths, show that POM originating from the adjacent Western African coast contains less aromatics than POM transported from the main biomass burning areas of the Sahelian zone.

However, during the combustion of polyurethane foams, the HCN yield is notably higher when the fire progresses from <b>smouldering</b> to flaming <b>combustion.</b> This was observed by Levin et al. (1985) when a flexible polyurethane foam was first heated at a temperature below its auto-ignition temperature, followed by flaming combustion of the remaining char and residue at a higher temperature. The authors intended to compare the HCN yields for the non-flaming and flaming combustion of the foam in a smoke chamber apparatus (as described in Levin et al. 1982) to that of a large scale test room. The test room was 2.4 [*]×[*] 3.0 [*]×[*] 3.0  m with a door (dimensions not specified) and a 1 to 2  kg slab of foam in the centre of the room. Smouldering was forced by an electrically heated resistance wire embedded in the sample and a load cell measured the mass of the sample throughout the experiment. In the smoke chamber, the highest reported yield during flaming combustion was 1.02  mg g− 1. In the large scale test room, the sample smouldered for 1.5 to 2  h, resulting in a HCN yield of 1.03  mg g− 1. Once the material ignited, the yield of HCN increased to 3.8  mg g− 1. While the smoke chamber experiment is known to give low HCN yields, and both scenarios are well-ventilated, the yield of HCN was almost 4 times as high during flaming combustion if the sample was allowed to smoulder first.|$|R

40|$|To build multi story {{buildings}} out {{of timber}} is {{of a common}} interest in the building sector. Timber as a building material has many profits, such as the low cost, the availability {{and the ability to}} recycle it, the low carbon footprint and the workability. Although, when it comes to fire protection of buildings with a timber based structure there are challenges regarding prevention of the spread of fire while timber surface is exposed to fire. There have been cases in which timber buildings have caught fire leading to severe fire spread and ruined buildings. One example concerns a student modulus accommodation in Luleå that caught fire in august 2013. The fire started on the fourth floor after which a vertical fire spread occurred in concealed spaces between the volume modules. According to the fire investigation lack of knowledge regarding performance of detailed building solutions has led to the poor fire performance of the building. This master thesis mainly consists of a model scale tests that is prepared and performed according to the standard EN 1363 - 1. The purpose of the test is to investigate the performance of various cavity barriers exposed to fire. The main objective is to examine which temperatures that can be expected at different positions at various cavity barriers when using model scale test as a test method. There are two main kinds of cavity barriers: barriers that are airtight and closed inside the voids of the construction; and ventilated barriers. The most common cavity barriers {{are the ones that are}} airtight and closed. The material can be solid wood, gypsum board or mineral wool. The installation areas for these cavity barriers are anywhere, besides where the concealed spaces shall be ventilated and in every joint that shall be sealed using sealant. The ventilated cavity barriers are mounted in concealed spaces where the ventilating function is provided. These concealed spaces are often situated in, for example, ventilated attics, facades and roofs. The purpose of the ventilated barriers is to maintain the air flow in the cavity during regular conditions but also to form a protecting barrier between fire compartments when exposed to fire. The model scale test includes test apparatuses such as thermocouples and a fire resistance furnace with plate thermometers and burners. In addition, a test rig consisting of test specimens and the products to be tested are essential.   In this report, two model scale tests have been performed and prepared according to EN  1363 ‑ 1. The test period endured for four hours and the thermocouples measured the temperatures during the whole time. During the first hour the test specimens were exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve by controlling the burners in the furnace. After one hour the burners were turned off and the specimens were no longer exposed to fire. The measurements of the temperatures continued during three more hours. After the first two of these three hours the furnace was opened to confer more oxygen in the purpose to record any changes in the temperatures. Results of the performed experiments have indicated parameters that affect the performance of the cavity barriers. The cavity surface itself has an influence to the fire spread. The number of barriers in the cavity and the material properties of the material that is used as the cavity barrier lead to the different protection by those cavity barriers. Some of the tested barriers were plastic covered, which had effect on the performance of the cavity barriers. The dimensions of the barriers, moreover the width and the thickness, are important parameters for the proper function of the barrier. The test results indicate that glowing combustion occurs in the cavity between various cavity barriers.   It can be seen that the temperature rises when the furnace is opened. This indicates the appearance of <b>smouldering</b> since the <b>combustion</b> increases when the amount of oxygen increases, which leads to a temperature rise. Furthermore, the appearance of <b>smouldering</b> (glowing <b>combustion)</b> can be indicated by the observation of the damages of the specimens after the test. The temperatures that may be expected at the unexposed side of the cavity barrier depend on the surface material of the cavity, dimensions, and the material of the cavity barriers. Smouldering is a consequence of the temperature rise in closed cavities between cavity barriers. The performed test endured for approximately four hours and this indicates that fires in cavities can stay for a long time. To ensure the performance of various cavity barriers and verification by a model scale test it is important to perform further experiment and analyses to investigate the effects of the various parameters. To ensure the effectiveness of the performance of the cavity barriers they should be tested in cavities with various widths and various heights. Further investigation of the risk for smouldering is needed with measuring the amount of oxygen and the pressure...|$|R
40|$|Coal mining was {{widespread}} in the central belt of Scotland from 1830 until the 1970 ’s and created a legacy of waste tips or ‘bings’ that still dot the landscape. High content of coal fines and carbonaceous shales, make bings very prone to self-heating and smoldering combustion. A 30 m high waste heap at Bogside, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, started to smoulder in 2009, approximately 80 years after {{the closure of the}} pit and waste dumping. Induced <b>smouldering,</b> a flameless <b>combustion</b> process, of soils contaminated with tar, PAHs, heavy oils and other organic compounds is a promising technology for the remediation of brown field sites, but has hitherto been conducted on an experimental scale of several hundred tonnes. But the large scale phenomena of burning bings provide a unique opportunity to study a ‘natural’ analogue for smouldering remediation. Chemical, geotechnical and physical parameters of the Bogside Bing have been studied. A combustion front is moving from west to east along the axis of the tip at an approximate rate of 1 m/month and three well-defined zones were identified and mapped using thermal imagery and temperature probes: the undisturbed zone, the preheating plus drying zone and the combustion zone. The subsurface fire is resulting in a detrimental effect to the vegetation and structural integrity of the heap. Spread of the combustion is accompanied by the development of vents ahead of the front and fissures that run parallel to the direction of heating and smaller landslips along the flanks. It is probable that changes to the soil mechanics’ of the tip induced by the smouldering front create a network of fissures, some running deep, that supply the front with enough air to sustain the process. Analysis of gas from the vents, show elevated CO 2, CO, CH 4 and SO 2, and partially depleted in oxygen. All these are indicative of smouldering activity deep into the tip. The primary environmental concern is likely to be from SO 2 release, although the stability of the structure may be compromised. Understanding the development of internal fissures and their role in sustaining the combustion process is crucial to utilizing smouldering as a remediation method for large areas of land contaminated by organic compounds.

An {{increase in the}} quality of the building envelope with more and better insulation is therefore an initiative to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Smouldering fire is a hazard in combustible insulation. A material can decompose and undergo a <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> at lower temperatures than needed to initiate a flaming fire, and cellulose insulation in combination with inadequate separation from electrical appliances and heat-producing equipment has led to smouldering combustions and building fires. The purpose of this thesis was to find the conditions necessary for combustible building insulation materials to undergo a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion.</b> The main goal was to find the temperature exposure needed to initiate a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion.</b> If smouldering was obtained, the differences and similarities in the combustion of the different test materials was studied and connected to the chemical and physical properties of the materials. The thesis is based on experimental tests. A literature study was used as a foundation for the discussion of test results. Four different types wood fibre insulation was tested. The samples were placed in an insulated steel chimney above a hotplate, and heated from underneath. Temperature development and mass loss was registered during the testing. The results show that one of the four test materials obtained a <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> at temperatures much lower than the rest. Two different types of smouldering behaviours were observed in the test samples. The distinction was made based on the registered mass losses and maximum temperatures. The one with highest maximum temperature and mass loss was found to be typical for materials undergoing a secondary oxidation of the char. The temperatures needed from external heating to obtain a self-sustained smouldering behaviour in the tested materials are: 275 °C for material T, 280 °C for material U, 225 °C for material V and 290 °C for material W. This indicated that an onset of a self-sustained <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> occurs at lower temperature in insulation material with smaller fibre size than in a material with larger fibre size, when the materials have the same added level of fire retardant. A higher level of added fire retardant gave an onset of a <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> at lower temperatures, when the fibre size of the material is the same.

Small-scale (~ 15 cm), proof-of-concept experiments {{were the first to}} demonstrate that organic liquids embedded within an inert soil matrix can be successfully smouldered. Intermediate-scale (~ 30 cm) column experiments examined in detail the behaviour of the combustion process including its relationship to mass and energy balance and the evolution of temperature profiles. In addition, detailed evaluations of environmental parameters (e. g., soil concentrations, gas emissions) were conducted. For the first time, it was demonstrated that NAPL <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> can be self-sustaining (i. e., propagation of the smouldering front after termination of the igniter) and self-terminating (i. e., natural extinction of the reaction after all of the NAPL is destroyed). More than 30 column sensitivity experiments quantified the broad range of process parameters - including contaminant type, contaminant mass, soil type, and oxidizer flow rates - within which the process was self-sustaining and essentially complete remediation was achieved (i. e. contaminant mass removal in excess of 99. 5 %). Maximum burning temperatures were observed in the range 600 - 1100 C. Average propagation velocities varied between 0. 7 e- 4 and 1. 2 e- 4 m/s. Intensity and velocity of the process were shown to be controlled by the rate at which oxidizer is delivered. Contaminant type and mass was observed to affect peak temperatures and propagation velocity by influencing the energy balance at the reaction front. Moreover, mass and energy balance models were demonstrated to provide reasonable predictions of the observed propagation velocities.

The results from a detailed study of {{the conditions under which}} a smouldering reaction propagates in sand embedded with coal tar are presented. The objective of the study is to provide further understanding of the governing mechanisms of <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> of liquids in porous media. A small-scale apparatus consisting of a 100 mm in diameter quartz cylinder arranged in an upward configuration was used for the experiments. Thermocouple measurements and visible digital imaging served to track and characterize the ignition and propagation of the smouldering reaction. These two diagnostics are combined here to provide valuable information {{on the development of the}} reaction front. Post-treatment analyses of the sand were used to assess the amount of coal tar remaining in the soil. Experiments explored a range of inlet airflows and fuel concentrations. The smouldering ignition of coal tar was achieved for all the conditions presented here and self-sustained propagation was established after the igniter was turned off. It was found that the combustion is oxygen limited and peak temperatures in the range 800 - 1080 °C were observed. The peak temperatur...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} bushfire spread is proposed, in which {{radiative}} heat transfer, species consumption and flammable gas production {{are taken into}} account. It is shown that fire propagation in this model does not occur as a one-dimensional travelling wave, except for <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> of wet bushland. Numerical solutions {{for the evolution of}} a line fire are obtained using a diagonally implicit finite difference scheme, and the effects of firebreaks and uncleared combustible debris are studied. An energy theorem is presented for the case of a spreading two-dimensional fire, and numerical results are illustrated...|$|E

Retention data, mass spectral data and quantitative proportions are given. Furan and 2 -methylfuran are major components. Contrary to other oxygen-containing compounds, the furans elute from the aluminium oxide column widely used for volatile C 2 -C 8 hydrocarbons. The furans are formed mainly from glowing and <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for the rapid destruction of human waste using <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> is presented. Recently, self-sustaining <b>smouldering</b> <b>combustion</b> {{was shown to}} destroy the organic component of simulated human solid waste and dog faeces resulting in the sanitization of all pathogens using a batch process (Yermán et al., 2015). Here, a continuous smouldering process is demonstrated for the first time, allowing for a much smaller reactor size and much less energy input per mass of waste treated. The self-sustained smouldering of simulated human faeces mixed with sand is evaluated over long periods (more than 16 h) based on a single ignition. The key process of intermittent self-sustained smouldering, in which the reaction is terminated and restarted by only turning the air off and on, is demonstrated. Experiments examine the influence of two key operator controls: airflow rate and set elevation of the quasi-steady-state smouldering front in a 37 cm high reactor. Quasi-steady-state fuel destruction rates from 93 g/h to 12 g/h were achieved by varying the superficial flow velocity from 7. 4 cm/s to 0. 11 cm/s, the latter with a velocity approximately {{an order of magnitude}} lower than possible for a self-sustaining reaction in an equivalent batch system. Excess energy of up to 140 J/g of sand was recovered from the clean sand produced in each cycle, which could be used to further increase the energy efficiency of this novel waste treatment system...|$|E
