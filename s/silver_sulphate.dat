40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{kinetics}} of the galvanostatic electrorecovery of copper and <b>silver</b> from <b>sulphate</b> solutions on a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode in flow-by mode. The influence of applied current and flow rate on the electrorecovery rate was systematically studied. Detailed analysis of the electrorecovery kinetics revealed two regimes. The first one {{was found to be}} electron-transfer limited, while the second one appeared to be mass transfer limited. From the relevant kinetic rate constants, a current efficiency of 1. 03 +/- 0. 03 for Ag and 0. 88 +/- 0. 01 for Cu electrorecovery was obtained in the first regime. For the second regime, the characteristic mass transport coefficients were determined as (7. 6 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (- 3) and (22. 6 +/- 0. 03) x 10 (- 3) cm/s for Ag and Cu, respectively. Analysis of the time and concentration at the kinetic transition was shown to allow for an additional, independent calculation of both the current efficiency and mass transport coefficient, and to confirm that the kinetic transitions occur when the limiting current has been reached.

40|$|In this work, {{the pulse}} {{electrodeposition}} technique was employed {{for the first}} time to deposit AgInSe 2 films. The films were deposited at room temperature from a bath containing Analar grade 10 mM <b>silver</b> <b>sulphate,</b> 50 mM indium sulphate and 5 mM SeO 2. The deposition potential was maintained at − 0. 98 V (SCE). Tin oxide coated glass substrates (5. 0 Ω/sq) were used for depositing the films. The duty cycle was varied in the range of 650 %. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the thin films deposited at different duty cycles indicated the peaks corresponding to AgInSe 2. The transmission spectra exhibited interference fringes. Resistivity of the films increased from 1. 5 Ω cm to 12. 4 Ω cm. Mobility increased with duty cycle. Carrier density decreased with duty cycle.

40|$|Three {{samples of}} Ag 2 SO 4 powder were heated up from 380 °C to 540 °C and then cooled down to 380 °C using an {{in-house}} made heat blower with a thermo-couple based temperature controller. During the heating process, synchrotron X-ray diffraction data including diffraction angles and intensitieswere obtained by diffractometer-setup {{found in the}} Swiss-Norwegian beamlines (SNBL- BM 01 A) at the ESRF. The diffractograms of each samples at different temperatures were studied byMathematica. Ag 2 SO 4 powder procured at “Sigma-Aldrich” did not showany diffraction peak in the diffractograms, but the Ag 2 SO 4 powder obtained from crushing a large single crystal by pestle and mortar showed silver peaks in all five lowest reflections, 111, 200, 220, 311 and 222. The sizes of the silver were estimated by Scherrer equation. The ways of defining peak Width and the choice of Scherrer constants {{were found to be}} vital for the accuracy of size estimations. Peak width was defined by two methods, namely FWHM and integral breadth. For FWHM method, the sizes of silver grew typically from around 50 (10) nm to 70 (10) nm when temperature increased from 380 °C to 432 °C. For integral breadth method, the sizes of silver grew typically fromaround 60 (10) nm to 80 (10) nm when temperature increased from 380 °C to 432 °C. For both methods, silver crystallites were grown almost linearly with increasing temperature in all reflections within the temperature range of 380 °C to 432 °C. Then, silver crystallites stopped growing when temperature was over 432 °C that is close to the phase transition temperature of <b>silver</b> <b>sulphate,</b> 427 °C. It is very likely that the phase transition of <b>silver</b> <b>sulphate</b> prohibits the growth of metallic silver. The main instrumental broadening was coming from the finite pixel size of the detector and the energy dispersion of the synchrotron radiation. The uncertainties in FWHM were 0. 04 ° (0. 01 °) to 0. 10 ° (0. 01 °). The magnitude of the instrumental broadening due to the energy dispersion of the synchrotron radiation was 10 e- 5 ° and was insignificant...|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{presence}} of sucrose in the vase solution, which is considered as an unfavorable condition and is associated with many problems, microbial growth occurs (Rodney and Hill 1993). The moisture enters the stem through the cut and exposed sides of the spikes and leads to blockage of the vascular bundles, thus creating an imbalance between water uptake and water loss. They also release secondary metabolites like enzymes or ethylene which are toxic and thus decrease the longevity of the cut spikes. So, addition of an antimicrobial element in sugar solution is essential to prevent the vascular blockage and enhance the vase life. Different chemicals, i.e. <b>silver</b> nitrate, aluminum <b>sulphate,</b> cobalt sulphate, 8 -hydroxyquinoline sulphate in different combinations and proportions (Reddy et al. 1997), 5 -Sulfo Salicylic Acid (5 -SSA) (Ezhilmathi et al. 2007), boric acid, citric acid, and α-lipoic acid (Singh 2005), are used in different formulations and combinations to enhance the vase life of cut flowers. Selection of appropriate vase solution or preservative is necessary to extend the vase life and floral quality by studying physiological and biochemical processes of floral senescence.|$|R

The interaction between PHEMA matrix and silica filler was investigated by IR spectroscopy. Adsorption of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate and BAC from aqueous solution on the silica surface was also examined. Phase composition and thermal stability of composites were studied by the differential thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis. Release of BAC into water medium from prepared composites were shown {{to depend on the}} synthetic method and differed significantly.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the fluoride content of powdered formula for infants 0 - 12 months in products available from Brisbane stores in 2006 / 07 and compare {{this with the}} fluoride content of infant formula products available in Australia 10 years earlier. Methods: A range of available infant formula powders were collected from major supermarkets and chemists in Brisbane, Queensland. The fluoride levels in infant formula powder samples were determined using a modification of the micro-diffusion method of Silva and Reynolds 1 utilising perchloric acid and <b>silver</b> <b>sulphate</b> and measured with an ion selective (fluoride) electrode/meter. Fluoride content both prior to and after reconstitution, as well as estimated daily intake according to age was calculated. Results: Formula samples contained an average of 0. 49 姠F/g of powder (range 0. 24 - 0. 92 姠F/g). After reconstitution with water containing 0 mg/L fluoride, the fluoride content averaged 7. 09 姠F/ 100 mL (range 3. 367 - 22. 72 姠F/ 100 mL). Estimated infant fluoride intakes ranged from 0. 0039 mg/kg/day for a 6 - 12 month old infant when reconstituting milk-based formula with non-fluoridated water (0 mg/L), to 0. 1735 mg/kg/day for a 0 - 3 month old infant when reconstituting soy-based formula with fluoridated water (1. 0 mg/L). Conclusions: Infant formula powders contain lower levels of fluoride than previously found in Australia in 1996. Implications: This confirms that infants consume {{only a small amount}} of fluoride from milk-based powdered infant formula. Although soy-based infant formulas contain more fluoride than milk-based products, the levels still comply with national food standards. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Arsenic {{contamination}} {{in drinking water}} from ground water {{poses a threat to}} the health of a large population in developing countries in Asia. This has sparked great interests in the potential of different microbes in arsenic resistance and removal from water. This study involves isolation of arsenic resistant Escherichia coli from sewage water from Kathmandu University and investigation of its attributes. Arsenic resistant E. coli was successfully isolated which could survive in high concentration of arsenic. The maximum tolerance of arsenite was 909. 79 mg/L (sodium arsenite) and 3120. 1 mg/L arsenate (sodium arsenate) which is well above most natural concentration of arsenic in ground water. This particular E. coli tolerated multiple heavy metal like <b>silver</b> nitrate, cobalt <b>sulphate,</b> cadmium chloride, nickel chloride, mercury chloride, copper sulphate, and zinc chloride at concentration 20 µM, 1 mM, 0. 5 mM, 1 mM, 0. 01 mM, 1 mM, and 1 mM respectively which are concentrations known to be toxic to E. coli. Biotransformation of arsenite to arsenate was also checked for by a qualitative silver nitrate technique. This E. coli was able to transform arsenate to arsenite. It showed some sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Nalidixic Acid. As E. coli and its genome are very widely studied, these particular properties have a lot of potential in microbial remediation or microbial recovery of metals and possible recombination approaches...|$|R
