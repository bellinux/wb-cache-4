The 1962 act gained notoriety for its use in internment of Chinese immigrants in India, most notably Calcutta. Other similar laws enacted i independent India includes the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during The Emergency, and [...] TADA (enacted during the Punjab insurgency) which carry very similar provisions.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the use of coercive medical {{measures}} (forced medication, isolation, and mechanical restraint) in mentally ill inmates within two secure psychiatric hospitals (SPH) and three regular prisons (RP) in Spain. Variables related to adopted coercive measures were analyzed, such as type of measure, causes of indication, opinion of patient inmate, opinion of medical staff, and more frequent morbidity. A total of 209 patients (108 from SPH and 101 from RP) were studied. Isolation (41. 35 %) was the most frequent coercive measure, followed by mechanical restraint (33. 17 %) and forced medication (25. 48 %). The type of center has some influence; specifically in RP there is less risk of isolation and restraint than in SPH. Not having had any previous imprisonment reduces isolation and restraint risk while {{increases the risk of}} forced medication, as well as previous admissions to psychiatric inpatient units does. Finally, the fact of having lived with a partner before imprisonment reduces the risk of forced medication and communication with the family decreases the risk of isolation. Patients subjected to a coercive measure exhibited a pronounced psychopathology and most of them had been <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>measures</b> on previous occasions. The mere fact of external assessment of compliance with human rights slows down the incidence of coercive measures. This study was financed through a Grant from the Spanish Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (Health Research Fund) PI 070862...|$|E

30|$|It is {{plausible}} to assume, then, that a public philosophy of integration also configures which policy fields {{are associated with}} integration and what styles and methods. On this note, we argue that the alleged absence of a Swedish civic turn derive both from a leaner multicultural philosophy of adult integration and its relative separation from questions of entry and stay. In Sweden, the public debate on society’s ability to integrate immigrants have not dictated the design of entry, residence and naturalization requirements {{to the same extent}} as in Denmark and many other European countries. But it has influenced the form and content of citizenship education in schools. On this view, a civic assimilationist philosophy such as the Danish is more likely to transcend many policy areas, than a civic multiculturalist philosophy such as the Swedish, which largely relies on voluntary and mutual adaptation. In the latter case, civic integration policies which impose selected values and norms on citizens-to-be are easier to justify in public schools, which are compulsory and universal by definition, than in adult integration programs that single out migrants (but not natives) for such preparation. In a multicultural society, civic integration may be perfectly legitimate if it targets everyone, which of course is what public schools do. As long as the (official) end is to forge future able citizens of all children, immigrants, and natives, there is no contradiction between mandatory civic integration and multiculturalism. However, in a society like Denmark where assimilation is the accepted norm, it is legitimate to impose mandatory measures in whichever policy field seems relevant for the integration of immigrants. The act of singling out and <b>subjecting</b> minorities <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>measures</b> does not constitute any obvious form of discrimination, since it is understood in the first place that {{they are the ones who}} have to adapt to mainstream society.|$|R
40|$|Thinking War in the 21 st Century” {{develops}} {{a theory of}} war applicable to conflicts with non-state actors such as the “Islamic State”. Just war theory traditionally focuses on states as actors in war. This book moves beyond this narrow lens, arguing that active individual members of organized collectives with a political aim and receiving some level of popular support should be considered analogous to state-combatants and be assigned similar rights, duties, and obligations under the principles of war. It addresses the main themes for establishing conditions {{for the application of}} the principles of war to conflicts with non-state actors, including sovereignty of states, the discrimination principle, and prisoner of war status. Additionally, it urges for assigning criminal law protections to non-combatants associated with non-state actors, primarily focusing on suspected terrorists <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> preventive <b>measures</b> <b>such</b> as travel bans and asset freezes. With the recognition that such constraints can infringe on one’s ability to lead a free and autonomous life, it argues that some of these constraints require similar protections as their counterparts that put persons under lock and key. By developing a theory for the regulation of state responses to non-state combatants and civilians associated with non-state violence, this book aims to bring philosophy of war in accord with the reality of current conflicts involving non-state actors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the privacy {{interests}} of those <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a criminal process. The thesis investigates {{the extent to which}} the privacy interests of those <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>such</b> a process are recognised and afforded adequate protection in England and Wales. Over the last thirty years policing has become increasingly proactive and preventive. Advances in technology have given rise to new policing strategies, which emphasise the need to manage ‘risky’ groups and individuals through the collection and retention of disparate pieces of personal information. Whilst there is a significant body of criminological literature documenting this trend, and raising the possibility that these developments could pose a threat to the privacy interests of those <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>such</b> preventive policing <b>measures,</b> criminological theorising alone cannot provide a defensible normative model for assessing the impact of such developments. Moreover, criminal procedure scholarship tends to focus on human rights insofar as they regulate adjudicatory policing measures geared towards the prosecution of suspected offenders. This procedural scholarship does not focus centrally on the wider functions of the police in maintaining order and protecting the public by gathering intelligence on ‘risky’ individuals and groups. This thesis aims to fill this gap in the literature through an assessment of how such policing activities set back privacy related rights. An interdisciplinary method is used, which draws on philosophical literature, European and domestic human rights and criminal procedure jurisprudence, and relevant policing and criminal justice scholarship. The first broad task for the thesis is to develop a normatively defensible model which can identify where privacy interests are set back as part of a criminal process, and articulate why it is important for those tasked with regulating <b>such</b> a process <b>to</b> recognise and appropriately protect these interests. This normative model is then used to assess English law’s response in different contexts to the police use of privacy interfering measures against those <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the criminal process. It is noted that the European Court of Human Right’s Article 8 jurisprudence has (generally speaking) had a positive impact on English law in this area, but concerns are raised that domestic lawmakers consistently fail to strike a fair balance between the privacy interests of those <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a criminal process and the legitimate crime prevention goals of the police...|$|R
40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> costly, additional veterinary measures. Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for}} <b>such</b> additional cross-border <b>measures</b> can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine veterinary measures (standard measures that apply to both domestic and cross-border transport) and additional cross-border measures (extra measures that only apply to cross-border transport) as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of additional cross-border measures. The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine veterinary measures and additional cross-border measures for the cross-border region was € 22. 1 million, 58 % (€ 12. 7 million) of which came from additional cross-border measures. Two-thirds of this € 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were veterinary checks on animals (twice {{in the case of}} slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four additional cross-border measures met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save € 8. 2 million (€ 5. 0 million for NL and € 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>measures,</b> <b>such</b> as veterinary checks {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of additional cross-border measures in both countries...|$|R
