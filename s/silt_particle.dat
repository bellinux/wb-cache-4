5000|$|Loam is soil {{composed}} {{mostly of}} sand (particle size > 63 µm), <b>silt</b> (<b>particle</b> size > 2 µm), {{and a smaller}} amount of clay (particle size < 2 µm). Its composition is about 40-40-20% concentration of sand-silt-clay, respectively. These proportions can vary to a degree, however, and result in different types of loam soils: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and loam. In the USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil that is not predominantly sand, silt, or clay is called [...] "loam". Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The mineral composition of a loam soil is typically about 40% sand, 40% silt and 20% clay by weight. The soil's texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water are crucial. Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties.|$|E

Our calculations further show that given the size of bubble the enhancement is mainly correlating with the mass (Its shape also {{plays an important role in}} gaining the drag force from the micro-jet flow, which will be discussed in detail later) of particle and the ratio between the distance from the collapsing bubble to a solid boundary and its radius upon collapse. Though there are more attributions of the enhancement need to be further investigated such as the influence of presence of the particle on the micro-jet flow, etc. (by using a real coupled calculation approach) these initial results do reveal the major features of this phenomenon quantitatively for the first time (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserve...|$|E

We use the digital camera to shoot the under water delta moving situation and discuss each topic like the under water pile up development and movement, sediment trapping efficiency, ration of sand imprisoning, and the concentration of slit. We found that the situation of sand imprisoning and moving under water is similar between porous media check dams and close check dams. They both develop from hydraulic jump to the downstream.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to suspended silt, kaolin and fuller's earth on growth and condition of Pacific oysters, 16 months of age, were studied. The exposure apparatus maintained a continuous flow of turbid water through chambers containing test oysters. Additional studies measured the filtration rates of oysters exposed to suspended sediments, and microscopic examinations of sediment transport on excised gill tissue were made. Growth was assessed as total wet weight increase over two-week exposures to sediments. Normal wet weight increase under field conditions averaged 2. 30 percent and {{was similar to that}} found under laboratory conditions. Laboratory growth, under conditions of flowing, unfiltered seawater, was comparable to growth when test animals were fed laboratory cultured algae in filtered seawater. <b>Silt</b> <b>particles,</b> 104 to 149 μ and 74 to 104 μ in size, did not inhibit growth. <b>Silt</b> <b>particles</b> 38 to 74 μ in diameter appeared to reduce growth at 0. 65 and 1. 06 g/liter, with the intensity of effect increasing with an increase in silt concentration. No statistically significant growth reduction occurred after exposure to <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> < 38 μ in size, although visual inspection suggested that some reduction may have occurred at 1. 61 g/liter. Kaolin particles 0. 2 μ, 1. 5 μ and 9. 5 μ in size significantly reduced growth of oysters in the range of 0. 36 to 1. 81 g/liter, with the level of growth inhibition increasing with kaolin concentration. Many animals appeared to lose weight as a result of exposure to kaolin sediments. Similarly, growth was reduced as the concentration of 5 μ fuller's earth increased from 0. 20 to 1. 37 g/liter. None of the sediments tested had a marked effect on condition index, except in tests employing <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> 74 to 104 μ in size. Although a significant reduction in condition was observed in this test, it was concluded that this may have been an anomalous result. Filtration rates of oysters exposed to all particle sizes of kaolin and fuller's earth appeared to decrease in response to increase in sediment concentration. Normal filtration rates averaged approximately 1. 60 1 /hour, and decreased to below 0. 40 1 /hour at sediment levels of about 0. 40 g/liter. A 50...|$|R

40|$|Structure of topsoil horizons on a {{mountain}} slope in the Kamagatani Experimental Basinwas investigated to estimate the predominant geomorphic processes on it. The soil profile onthe gentle slope near the ridge represents a standard weathering sequence. In an old land-slide scar, standard weathering sequence is overlain by colluvial material brought aboutthrough the secondary erosion of the landslide cliff. In newer landslide scar, exposed bed-rock has been rapidly weathered. Sometimes it has been covered by the colluvial deposit. If the bedrock is covered {{as soon as it}} is exposed, the weathering becomes retarded. Mea-surement of particle size distribution revealed that the matrix part of deposit or weatheredslate is composed of <b>silt</b> <b>particle</b> with a mode at 11 to 16 micron and very little fractions ofclay and fine sand throughout the depths of trench-cut cross sections. It suggests that all soilhorizons have been brought about by the weathering of the bed rock. Some of topsoil hori-zons contain dispersed rock pieces and the content of rock pieces becomes greater downslopeuntil the topsoil consists of pure pebble near the valley bottom. It suggests that the colluvialmaterial loses fine particles due to surface wash as it migrates downslope by the repeatedtopsoil failure. Horizons of minimum cone penetration resistance were found within the bedrock. Though it suggests the possibility of rockslide or rockglide, current denudation throughtopsoil failures and subsequent rain wash seems to prevail over the speed of the growth ofweak horizons within the bed rock...|$|E

The Loess Plateau, the southern hilly {{region and the}} Northeast China are subject to serious soil and water loss; however, the characteristics of rain splash erosion in those regions are still unclear. The objectives of the study are to analyze the characteristics of splash erosion on loess soil, red soil, purple soil and black soil, and to discuss the relationship between splash erosion and soil properties. Soil samples spatially distributed in the abovementioned regions were collected and underwent simulated rainfalls at a high intensity of 1. 2 mm/min, lasting for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively. Rain splash and soil crust development were analyzed. It shows that black soil sample from Heilongjiang Province corresponds to the minimum splash erosion amount because it has high aggregate content, aggregate stability and organic matter content. Loess soil sample from Inner Mongolia corresponds to the maximum splash erosion amount because it has high content of sand particles. Loess soil sample from Shanxi Province has relatively lower splash erosion amount because it has high <b>silt</b> <b>particle</b> content and low aggregate stability easily to be disrupted under rainfalls with high intensity. Although aggregate contents of red soil and purple soil samples from Hubei and Guangdong provinces are high, the stability is weak and prone to be disrupted, so the splash erosion amount is medium.

40|$|A global {{compilation}} of nearly sixty measurement studies {{is used to}} evaluate two methods of simulating the mineral composition of dust aerosols in an Earth system model. Both methods are based upon a Mean Mineralogical Table (MMT) that relates the soil mineral fractions to a global atlas of arid soil type. The Soil Mineral Fraction (SMF) method assumes that the aerosol mineral fractions match the fractions of the soil. The MMT is based upon soil measurements after wet sieving, a process that destroys aggregates of soil particles {{that would have been}} emitted from the original, undisturbed soil. The second method approximately reconstructs the emitted aggregates. This model {{is referred to as the}} Aerosol Mineral Fraction (AMF) method because the mineral fractions of the aerosols differ from those of the wet-sieved parent soil, partly due to reaggregation. The AMF method remedies some of the deficiencies of the SMF method in comparison to observations. Only the AMF method exhibits phyllosilicate mass at silt sizes, where they are abundant according to observations. In addition, the AMF quartz fraction of silt particles is in better agreement with measured values, in contrast to the overestimated SMF fraction. Measurements at distinct clay and <b>silt</b> <b>particle</b> sizes are shown to be more useful for evaluation of the models, in contrast to the sum over all particles sizes that is susceptible to compensating errors, as illustrated by the SMF experiment. Model errors suggest that allocation of the emitted silt fraction of each mineral into the corresponding transported size categories is an important remaining source of uncertainty. Evaluation of both models and the MMT is hindered by the limited number of size-resolved measurements of mineral content that sparsely sample aerosols from the major dust sources. The importance of climate processes dependent upon aerosol mineral composition shows the need for global and routine mineral measurements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{we carry}} out a {{detailed}} analysis concerning Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) and particle size distribution in water samples collected mainly during storm events in the Reno river basin, in northern Apennines (Italy). At the outlet of mountain basins {{of the three major}} tributaries, Lavino, Savena and Sillaro, a hydrological monitoring has been started up. A total of 766 samples with maximum SSC were selected for this study to determine the nutrient level on the solid fraction. The samples were taken during flood events occurred from the year 2000 to 2009. By considering the physicochemical properties and nutrient constituents as the most important characteristics of the river conditions, total Nitrogen (Ntot), total Phosphorus (Ptot), particle size and SSC were selected for testing. The monitored watersheds are different for lithology, land cover and anthropogenic contamination levels. These differences were recognizable in the particle size distribution and in the nutrient level of the SSC in the water samples. Suspended sediment of the Savena stream showed a higher component of coarser material, Sillaro and the Lavino samples have higher clay content, 46 % and 43 % respectively. Concentration of Ntot and Ptot in the stream suspended sediments increases from Sillaro to Lavino to Savena. There is a statistically significant relationship between Ptot and Ntot (P< 0. 05) and both nutrients showed significant linear relationships versus <b>silt</b> <b>particle</b> sizes. Silt appears to be the preferential vector of nutrients, confirming that finer particles and their aggregates have been proved to be the preferential vehicle for nutrients.

Comparable values occur in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, while those {{from the rest of the}} Pacific are distinctly higher, confirming that the Southern Ocean was the source for the unventilated/nutrient-enriched water seen here. Oxygen and carbon isotopic data are compatible with a glacial cold deep water mass of high salinity, but lower nutrient content (or better ventilated), below ~ 3500 m depth. This contrasts with the South Atlantic where unventilated/nutrient-enriched water extends all the way to the sea bed. Comparison with previous studies also suggests that the deeper reaches of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current below ~ 3500 m are not homogeneous all around the Southern Ocean, with the Kerguelen Plateau and/or the Macquarie-Balleny Ridges posing barriers to the eastward spread of the deepest low-d 13 C water out of the South Atlantic in glacials. These barriers, combined with inferred high density of bottom waters, restricted inter-basin exchange and allow three glacial domains dominated by bottom waters from Weddell Sea, Adelie Coast and Ross Sea to be defined. We suggest that the Ross Sea was the main source of the deep water entering the Pacific below ~ 3500 m...|$|E
30|$|The {{percentage}} of sand, silt, and clay in the inorganic fraction of sediments was measured {{according to the}} standard Bouyoucos procedure. First, the samples were treated with sodium hexametaphosphate to complex Ca 2 +, Al 3 +, Fe 3 +, and other cations that bind clay and <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> into aggregates. The density of the soil suspension was determined with a hydrometer calibrated to read in grams of solids per liter after the sand settles down and again after the silt settles (Bouyoucos [1962]). The organic matter content was determined by standard method (Walkey and Black [1934]).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{properties of}} dense suspensions and sediments of small spherical <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> {{by means of}} a combined Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) simulation. We include van der Waals and effective electrostatic interactions between the colloidal particles, as well as Brownian motion and hydrodynamic interactions which are calculated in the SRD-part. We present the simulation technique and first results. We have measured velocity distributions, diffusion coefficients, sedimentation velocity, spatial correlation functions and we have explored the phase diagram depending on the parameters of the potentials and on the volume fraction.

50|$|Point {{bars are}} simply an {{accumulation}} of deposited alluvium that collects on the inside bank of a meander curve. This accumulation occurs due to the stream's lower velocity in the interior portion of the curve. In accordance with the Hjulström curve, sediment will settle more readily at lower velocities. Point bars typically are composed of sediment {{ranging in size from}} pebbles to granular sands. Only in still water do <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> settle.The development of point bars is suggested to depend upon a sufficient suspended load so that finer-grained sediments may be deposited on the inner bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{feeding method}} of tadpole shrimps {{is similar to}} that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes {{at the base of the}} leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir and lift the sediments. Fine <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg.|$|R
50|$|Soil {{separates}} {{are specific}} ranges of particle sizes. The smallest particles are clay particles and {{are classified as}} having diameters of less than 0.002 mm. Clay particles are plate-shaped instead of spherical, allowing for an increased specific surface area. The next smallest <b>particles</b> are <b>silt</b> <b>particles</b> and have diameters between 0.002 mm and 0.05 mm (in USDA soil taxonomy). The largest particles are sand particles and are larger than 0.05 mm in diameter. Furthermore, large sand particles {{can be described as}} coarse, intermediate as medium, and the smaller as fine. Other countries have their own particle size classifications.|$|R
