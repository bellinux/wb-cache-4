5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by <b>soil</b> <b>treatment.</b> Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
25|$|In agriculture, {{clinoptilolite}} (a {{naturally occurring}} zeolite) {{is used as}} a <b>soil</b> <b>treatment.</b> It provides a source of slowly released potassium. If previously loaded with ammonium, the zeolite can serve a similar function in the slow release of nitrogen. Zeolites can also act as water moderators, in which they will absorb up to 55% of their weight in water and slowly release it under the plant's demand. This property can prevent root rot and moderate drought cycles.|$|E

Its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which lindane production, by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It {{has been used to}} treat food crops and forestry products, as a seed treatment, a <b>soil</b> <b>treatment,</b> and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a shampoo or lotion. Between 1950 and 2000, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of lindane were produced globally, {{and the vast majority of}} which was used in agriculture. It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries, but as of 2007, only India and possibly Russia are still producing it.|$|E

2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of <b>soil</b> <b>treatment</b> closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

40|$|Contaminated {{surface water}} {{has become a}} {{critical}} environmental problem. Soil erosion, nutrient runoff, loss of soil organic matter, and the impairment of environmental quality from sedimentation and pollution of natural waters by agrochemicals have stimulated interest in proper management of natural resources. Herbicides mobility from agricultural activities impact surface water quality. Studies at Kentucky State University (KSU) were conducted to investigate the effect of municipal sewage sludge on {{the persistence of the}} herbicide bensulide, also known as Prefare 4 E in soil and runoff water following field application. The study was conducted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> replicated six times. The three <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> used were: sewage sludge (SS) only, sewage sludge mixed with yard waste (SS+YW) compost, and no-mulch (NM) bare soil. Prefare 4 E was applied at 2 L of the formulated product (the recommended rate of application) which is equivalent to 2. 7 kg active ingredient per acre. Results revealed that the half-life (T 1 / 2) values of bensulide residues in soil varied among the three <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> and averaged 44. 3, 37. 6, and 27. 1 d in SS-YW mix, SS alone, and NM bare <b>soil</b> <b>treatments,</b> respectively.

Organic standards require that producers find alternatives to pesticides. <b>Soil</b> <b>treatments</b> to control the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi (L.) (Diptera: Tephrididae) {{appear to be an}} attractive option. However, <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> can only be effective if the migration of flies is low, because mature flies may migrate from near-by trees for oviposition. To examine the general potential of <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> and to understand the dispersal and flight behaviour of R. cerasi within orchards, experiments using netting to cover the soil were conducted in two orchards with different pest pressure during two years. The netting reduced flight activity by 77 % and fruit infestation by 91 %. The data showed that the flies have a dispersal of less than 5 m within orchards, which is very low. The low thresholds for tolerance for infested fruit in the fresh market creates a strong economic incentive for control, therefore, soil covering is a promising strategy for controlling R. cerasi in commercial orchards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} {{to find out the}} status of the availability of rhododendrons of Sikkim Himalaya. Rhododendrons, denizens of high altitude, have a characteristic slow growth rate. Seeds of rhododendron are clearly distinguished from their outer micro-and macro-morphological variability from species to species. Seed germination of 10 elite species of rhododendrons were investigated in various treatments using rhododendron rhizosphere soil (Ratey Chuu, East Sikkim,), non-forest soil and sterilized soil in various combinations. Results obtained from various <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> indicated the presence of certain factors probably of microbial origin influencing the seed germination. A total of seven <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> taken under consideration were: (T 1) sterilized soil, (T 2) forest soil, (T 3) degraded soil, (T 4) rhizosphere natural soil and (T 5, T 6, T 7) rhizosphere natural soil: degraded soil in three ratios (1 : 3, 1 : 1, 3 : 1), respectively. Best results on per cent seed germination were recorded in the treatment where rhododendron rhizosphere soil was mixed with degraded soil in 1 : 1 ratio followed by rhododendron rhizosphere soil mixed with degraded soil in 3 : 1 ratio. Soil respiration, total organic carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen varied significantly between soil types. Chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll content of rhododendron species were always higher in rhododendron rhizosphere <b>soil</b> based <b>treatments</b> compared to other <b>soil</b> <b>treatments.</b> Mean net photosynthetic rate of rhododendron seedlings was greater in rhododendron rhizosphere <b>soil</b> based <b>treatments.</b> Photosynthesis varied significantly between species grown in different soil types...|$|R

Pb and Cd contamination is a common problem at many abandoned and uncontrolled commercial and industrial sites. Phytoremediation is one technology that can be employed to remove metals such as Pb from the soil. This study investigated the effectiveness of several plant and <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> on the uptake and retention of Pb and Cd by vegetation from contaminated soil at a Superfund site. Field plots were established and plant treatments included a mixture of grasses including Festuca, Poa. and Phleum; red clover (Trifolium Pratense); and sunflower (Helianthus annuus). <b>Soil</b> <b>treatments</b> included a common NPK fertilizer, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), dilute sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4), and a mixture of EDTA and H 2 SO 4 (EDTA+H 2 SO 4). Trifolium tissue contained a greater quantity of Pb (182 mg Pb/kg tissue) than that of Poa (65 mg Pb/kg tissue). Cadmium concentration was similar in Poa and Trifolium tissue. ranging from 7. 2 to 10. 6 mg/kg tissue. Different <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> affected Pb levels found in plant tissue in order of effectiveness: H 2 SO 4 >EDTA>NPK>EDTA+H 2 SO 4 The effects of <b>soil</b> <b>treatments</b> on Cd levels were similar to those for Pb with a difference of 0. 1 mg Cd/kg tissue between EDTA and NPK <b>treatments.</b> <b>Soil</b> amendments differentially influenced Pb bioavailability and uptake, with H 2 SO 4 exhibiting the greatest positive influence on Pb and Cd concentration in tissue. There was no correlation between the quantity of Pb and Cd up taken by vegetation at the site. The current study demonstrated the capability of common native plant species to grow on toxic and infertile soils, and the ability to uptake Pb and Cd to a limited degree. Regardless of tissue concentrations of Pb or Cd, Poa coverage at the site was generally dense. demonstrating the ability of Poa to become established on toxic soils and prevent soil erosion.
