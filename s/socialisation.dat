This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the {{backyard}} alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the <b>socialisation</b> measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|When resting, lion <b>socialisation</b> occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's {{expressive}} movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E
25|$|Rottweilers are a {{powerful}} breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, {{or lack of}} <b>socialisation</b> and training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It {{is for this reason}} that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive <b>socialisation</b> are essential for all Rottweilers. According to the AKC, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training and socialization are required.|$|E
25|$|Irish Terriers {{are often}} {{dominant}} with other dogs. As with any dog, poorly socialised individuals can start fights and early <b>socialisation</b> is a necessity. Most have strong guarding instincts and when these instincts are controlled, make excellent alarming watchdogs.|$|E
25|$|Harris and Pinker {{have put}} forward {{the notion that}} the {{influence}} of parents has been much exaggerated and that <b>socialisation</b> takes place primarily in peer groups, although H.

25|$|Rajneesh's syncretic teachings emphasise the {{importance}} of meditation, awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity, and humor—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition, and <b>socialisation.</b> Rajneesh's teachings have had a notable impact on Western New Age thought, and their popularity has increased markedly since his death.|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal passage}} {{was large and}} placed close to the beak. The {{nostrils}} were in a high position. On {{each side of the}} top of the skull there was a low bump between the nasal opening and the eye socket; the significance of both protuberances is unknown, but they may have been used for <b>socialisation</b> or mating displays. A secondary palpebral bone was lacking.|$|E
25|$|Thus, actors (agents) {{employ the}} social rules {{appropriate}} to their culture, ones {{that they have}} learned through <b>socialisation</b> and experience. These rules together with the resources at their disposal are used in social interactions. Rules and resources employed in this manner are not deterministic, but are applied reflexively by knowledgeable actors, albeit that actors’ awareness may {{be limited to the}} specifics of their activities at any given time. Thus, the outcome of action is not totally predictable.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia, and new provisions for maternity were introduced. In February 1920, an industrial relations law was passed, giving workers in industry legally guaranteed representation, together {{with the right to}} co-determination in cases of hiring and firing, holiday arrangements, the fixing of working hours and regulations, and the introduction of new methods of payment. A <b>Socialisation</b> Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the workers' councils. In addition to workers' councils at national, regional, and factory level, the government made provision for economic councils in which employers and employees would work together on matters affecting {{the economy as a whole}} (such as nationalisation) and lend support to the Weimar parliament.|$|E
25|$|In this role, due {{to their}} working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in {{households}} that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that {{are not able to}} provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, {{as it was in the}} dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper <b>socialisation</b> training.|$|E

2500|$|Lapsit {{for preschoolers}} {{with their parents}} was an {{innovation}} launched by then Chief Librarian Rata Graham in 1992. These were half-hour sessions of mostly music and song, as well as stories and finger puppetry. Lapsit proved so popular it was extended to twice a week in 1999. It was the precursor to [...] "Rhymetime" [...] now standardised across the entire North Shore Libraries system, a programme specifically designed to encourage active <b>socialisation</b> {{and the development of}} reading skills, through the focus on rhythm and rhyme.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{avenues for}} men to gain honor were {{providing}} for their families and exercising leadership. Raewyn Connell has labeled traditional male roles and privileges hegemonic masculinity, encouraged in men and discouraged in women: [...] "Hegemonic masculinity {{can be defined as}} the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women". In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered <b>socialisation,</b> enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Labour's 1916 policy {{objectives}} called for [...] "the <b>socialisation</b> {{of the means}} of production, distribution and exchange", including state ownership of major parts of the economy. Up to the 1980s Labour remained a party that believed in a strong role for governments in economic and social matters. However, it had been transformed from a trade union-dominated, socialist-oriented movement to a moderate social-democratic party. The Labour Government of the 1980s deviated sharply from a social-democratic path. In a series of economic reforms dubbed [...] "Rogernomics" [...] (after Finance Minister Roger Douglas), the Government removed a swathe of regulations and subsidies, privatised state assets and introduced corporate practices to state services.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2000, white rhino, Mzithi, {{gave birth}} to the zoo's first white rhino calf, and the first female white rhino born in New Zealand.

[...] Following the {{unexpected}} death of Mzithi and Mbili, in September 2003, the orphaned Kito was sent to Hamilton Zoo in January 2004 to learn <b>socialisation</b> skills from their herd. In 2007, white rhino Mandala was put down due to neurological health issues and Auckland Zoo participated in a rhino swap. Auckland's male, Kruger, was sent to Hamilton Zoo for breeding, while they received Hamilton's breeding male, Zambezi, and his sons, Inkosi and Mtoto.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the Court {{found that}} [...] "respect for the minimum {{requirements}} {{of life in}} society" [...] could under certain circumstances be considered [...] "protection of the rights and freedoms of others". It wrote: [...] "The Court {{takes into account the}} respondent State’s point that the face {{plays an important role in}} social interaction. [...] The Court is therefore able to accept that the barrier raised against others by a veil concealing the face is perceived by the respondent State as breaching the right of others to live in a space of <b>socialisation</b> which makes living together easier. That being said, in view of the flexibility of the notion of “living together” and the resulting risk of abuse, the Court must engage in a careful examination of the necessity of the impugned limitation".|$|E
2500|$|Godwin {{had high}} hopes for Mary, giving her a higher {{intellectual}} experience than most women of her period, and describing her as [...] "very intelligent." [...] He wished to give his daughter a more [...] "masculine education" [...] and prepared {{her to be a}} writer. However, Godwin withdrew his support as Mary became a woman and pursued her relationship with Percy Shelley. Mary’s first two novels, Frankenstein and Mathilda, may be seen as a reaction to her childhood. Both explore the role of the father in the child's <b>socialisation</b> and the control the father has on the child's future.Shelley’s last two novels, Lodore and Falkner, re-evaluate the father-daughter relationship. [...] They were written at a time when Shelley was raising her only surviving child alone and supporting her ageing father. In both novels, the daughter eludes the father's control by giving him the traditional maternal figure he asks for. This relationship gives the daughter control of the father.|$|E
2500|$|While often caricatured as ultra-conservative, Spencer {{had been}} more radical earlier in his career – {{opposing}} private property in land and claiming that each person has a latent claim {{to participate in the}} use of the earth (views that influenced Georgism), calling himself [...] "a radical feminist" [...] and advocating the organisation of trade unions as a bulwark against [...] "exploitation by bosses", and favoured an economy organised primarily in free worker co-operatives as a replacement for wage-labor. Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s. He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to <b>socialisation</b> of the means of production, saying [...] "all socialism is slavery"; Spencer defined a slave as a person who [...] "labours under coercion to satisfy another's desires" [...] and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and [...] "it means not whether his master a single person or society" ...|$|E
2500|$|Nowadays, the {{schooling}} {{system in}} France is centralised, and {{is composed of}} three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015. Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are {{the responsibility of the}} state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their <b>socialisation</b> and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (...) [...] The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavours) or certificate of professional competence (certificat d'aptitude professionelle).|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Saeed Anwar's {{daughter}} he took to a more fundamental Islam and started growing a beard. He was then {{said to have been}} the turning point in the Islamisation of the Pakistani cricket team, which was also a reason for Yousuf Youhana's conversion to Islam. From the 2003 World Cup a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a [...] "good Muslim" [...] (with the notable exception of Shoaib Akhtar and Danish Kaneria (the latter being the only Hindu on the team). Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as Bismillah ur Rehman rahim. Most famously, after the loss to arch-rival India at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Shoaib Malik came under fire for apologising [...] "I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent" [...] for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering Irfan Pathan, a Muslim was named Man of the Match for his performance in India's win, and Shah Rukh Khan was in the stands cheering on India. Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field. In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational identity, greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and <b>socialisation</b> needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war.|$|E
60|$|Great financiers contributed generously to a School of Economics {{that had}} been founded with moneys left to the Fabian Society by earlier enthusiasts for socialist {{propaganda}} and education. It remained for Mr. Belloc to point {{the moral of the}} whole development with a phrase, to note that Fabianism no longer aimed at the <b>socialisation</b> of the whole community, but only at the <b>socialisation</b> of the poor. The first really complete project for a new social order to replace the Normal Social Life was before the world, and this project was the compulsory regimentation of the workers and the complete state control of labour under a new plutocracy. Our present chaos was to be organised into a Servile State.|$|E
60|$|This second {{method of}} attack brought the Fabian {{movement}} into co-operation {{with a large}} amount of benevolent and constructive influence outside the socialist ranks altogether. Few wealthy people really grudge the poor a share of the necessities of life, and most are quite willing to assist in projects for such a distribution. But while these schemes naturally involved a very great amount of regulation and regimentation of the affairs of the poor, the Fabian Society fell away more and more from its associated proposals for the <b>socialisation</b> of the rich. The Fabian project changed steadily in character until at last it ceased to be in any sense antagonistic to wealth as such. If the lion did not exactly lie down with the lamb, at any rate the man with the gun and the alleged social mad dog returned very peaceably together. The Fabian hunt was up.|$|E
60|$|Even more {{definitely}} a class {{party is the}} Labour Party, whose immediate interest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor, increase employment, and make better terms for the working-man tenant and working-man purchaser. Its leaders are no doubt constructive minded, but {{the mass of the}} following is naturally suspicious of education and discipline, hostile to the higher education, and--except for an obvious antagonism to employers and property owners--almost destitute of ideas. What else can it be? It stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole situation and difficulty arise from its individual lack of initiative and organising power. It favours the nationalisation of land and capital with no sense of the difficulties involved in the process; but, on the other hand, the equally reasonable <b>socialisation</b> of individuals which is implied by military service is steadily and quite naturally and quite illogically opposed by it. It is only in recent years that Labour has emerged as a separate party from the huge hospitable caravanserai of Liberalism, and there is still a very marked tendency to step back again into that multitudinous assemblage.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the whole}} of this process of the making and {{delivery}} of a shell, which is the main process of modern warfare, is {{one that can be}} far better conducted by a man accustomed to industrial organisation or transit work than by the old type of soldier. This is a thing that cannot be too plainly stated or too often repeated. Germany nearly won this way because of her tremendously modern industrial resources; but she blundered into it and she is losing it because she has too many men in military uniform and because their tradition and interests were to powerful with her. All the state and glories of soldiering, the bright uniforms, the feathers and spurs, the flags, the march-past, the disciplined massed advance, the charge; all these are as needless and obsolete now in war as the masks and shields of an old-time Chinese brave. Liberal-minded people talk of the coming dangers of militarism in the face of events that prove conclusively that professional militarism is already as dead as Julius Caesar. What is coming {{is not so much the}} conversion of men into soldiers as the <b>socialisation</b> of the economic organisation of the country with a view to both national and international necessities. We do not want to turn a chemist or a photographer into a little figure like a lead soldier, moving mechanically at the word of command, but we do want to make his chemistry or photography swiftly available if the national organisation is called upon to fight.|$|E
60|$|I {{perceived}} I had {{got something}} quite fundamental here. It {{had taken me}} some years to realise the true relation of the great constructive ideas that swayed me not only to political parties, but to myself. I had been disposed to identify the formulae of some one party with social construction, and to regard the other as necessarily anti-constructive, just as I had been inclined to follow the Baileys in the self-righteousness of supposing myself to be wholly constructive. But I saw now that every man of intellectual freedom and vigour is necessarily constructive-minded nowadays, and that no man is disinterestedly so. Each one of us repeats in himself the conflict of the race between the splendour of its possibilities and its immediate associations. We may be shaping immortal things, but we must sleep and answer the dinner gong, and have our salt of flattery and self-approval. In politics a man counts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but for his common workaday, selfish self; and political parties are held together not by a community of ultimate aims, but by the stabler bond of an accustomed life. Everybody almost is for progress in general, and nearly everybody is opposed to any change, except {{in so far as}} gross increments are change, in his particular method of living and behaviour. Every party stands essentially for the interests and mental usages of some definite class or group of classes in the exciting community, and every party has its scientific-minded and constructive leading section, with well-defined hinterlands formulating its social functions in a public-spirited form, and its superficial-minded following confessing its meannesses and vanities and prejudices. No class will abolish itself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically reconstruct itself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the unlimited <b>socialisation</b> of any other class. In that capacity for aggression upon other classes lies the essential driving force of modern affairs. The instincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway and struggle. The ideas and understandings march on and achieve themselves for all--in spite of every one....|$|E

5000|$|According to Chantal Kourilsky - Augeven, {{phenomena}} of individuals' <b>socialisation</b> {{have been developed}} in three disciplines: psychology, anthropology and sociology. Psychologists, who study {{at the level of}} the individual, emphasize the construction of the personality or identity of the subject. Anthropologists start with a specific culture, considered as an entity formed by a group of people who share [...] "ways of thinking, feeling and acting", values and behavioural norms. These common values and norms are then internalised by new generations and ensure the cohesion and continuance of the community. Like anthropologists, sociologists view the object of study from the perspective of society as a whole, but perceive <b>socialisation</b> more strongly in terms of the transmission of behavioural norms and models by persons and institutions. They tend to assign to them, for functional purposes, the role of <b>socialisation</b> agents. <b>Socialisation</b> of subjects is also considered in terms of learning of social roles or attainment of social skills.|$|E
