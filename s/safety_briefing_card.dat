50|$|In an emergency, {{flight attendants}} {{are trained to}} calmly {{instruct}} passengers how to respond, given the type of emergency.Research conducted at the University of New South Wales Australia questions {{the effectiveness of these}} briefings in conveying key safety messages for passengers to recall and act upon in an emergency. In one study, a range of pre-recorded safety briefings were tested. One <b>safety</b> <b>briefing</b> contained humour, another was void of humour (said to reflect a standard style briefing), and another used a celebrity to sell the importance of the <b>safety</b> <b>briefing</b> and the messages contained within. Not long after being exposed to the briefing, individuals recalled approximately 50% of the key safety messages from the briefing featuring the celebrity, 45% from the briefing containing humour, and 32% from the briefing void of both a celebrity and humour. Two hours post exposure to the pre-flight safety briefings, recall decreased on average by 4% from the original levels across all conditions.|$|R
