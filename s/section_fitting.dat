40|$|We {{consider}} the two-line fitting problem. True points lie on two straight lines and are observed with Gaussian perturbations. For each observed point, {{it is not}} known on which line the corresponding true point lies. The parameters of the lines are estimated. This model is a restriction of the conic <b>section</b> <b>fitting</b> model because a couple of two lines is a degenerate conic section. The following estimators are constructed: two projections of the adjusted least squares estimator in the conic <b>section</b> <b>fitting</b> model, orthogonal regression estimator, parametric maximum likelihood estimator in the Gaussian model, and regular best asymptotically normal moment estimator. The conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the projections of the adjusted least squares estimator are provided. All the estimators constructed in the paper are equivariant.

The sub-nanometre precision of fitting was reached with this new robust and fast algorithm. The algorithm also does not need precise estimation of parameters for the initial iteration. It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and alignment markers on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections. Moreover, the part of algorithm that finds the correct coordinate system and removes outliers can be used independently on the conic <b>section</b> <b>fitting</b> part. Thus the algorithm will be useful for the optical community for precise characterisation and testing of aspheric lens.|$|E

With the aid of the calc package also the calculation of square roots and henceforward lengths is supplied. Preamble If you want to draw complicated and/or lots of pictures, you should use Post-Script for generating your plots and dvips to include them in TEX documents. PostScript can plot lines with arbitrary slope and unlimited length and circles with arbitrary radius just by using one command. See also the LATEX Graphics Companion[4] for further possibilities. There is also a new package pict 2 e[8] available which is preferrable for PDF and PostScript. This package will support also lines with arbitrary slopes and unlimited length, but each line has to be generated as a sample of points. Each point reduces TEX’s memory and you will very likely have to overcome some TeX capacity excxeeded [...] . messages. Exact circles would involve trigonometric functions or square roots to be evaluated by TEX. Even with some tricks for reducing the effort of the calculation algorithm there would be hundreds of calculations for each point. ∗ But they may be quite well approximated by cubic bezier curves, also supplied in this package (The quality of interpolation is discussed in some detail in the <b>Section</b> <b>Fitting</b> Arcs.) In fact, the small circles in the LATEX-lcircle fonts are also generated by the same method. For draft papers use all kind of bezier curves with small number of points, just for the final run increase the numbers.

40|$|Die südliche mittelamerikanische Landbrücke ging aus der Subduktion der ozeanischen pazifischen Platte unter die ozeanische karibische Platte hervor. Ihre Entstehung läßt sich in eine präcampane ozeanische Vorgeschichte, eine Frühgeschichte mit inselbogenartigen Verhältnissen (Campan bis Eozän) und eine jüngere Geschichte (Oligozän - Rezent) unterteilen, in deren Verlauf der Isthmus seine heutige Form erst ziemlich spät (Pleistozän) erhielt. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich in der Hauptsache mit der bislang fast noch unbekannten Frühgeschichte. Im Obercampan existierte ein nichtvulkanischer Basaltinsel-Archipel, auf dessen Insularschelfen sich Rudisten-Biostrome ansiedelten. Der größte Teil dieses Basaltinsel-Archipels versank schon wieder am Ende des Campans und wurde im Verlaufe des Paleozäns und Eozäns unter dem Schutt des sich langsam herausbildenden vulkanisch aktiven andesitischen Inselbogens begraben. Erkenntnisse über die Beschaffenheit der insularen bzw. kontinentalen Environments dieser Epoche lassen sich nur aus zeitgleichen Abhangsedimenten gewinnen. Dies ist der zentrale methodische Ansatz in dieser Studie. The southem {{part of the}} Central American isthmus {{resulted}} from the subduction of the oceanic Pacific plate beneath the oceanic Caribbean plate. The rise of this landbrigde from the pre-Campanian ocean floor {{is characterized by a}} Campanian to Eocene island arc stage, an Oligocene to Miocene swell stage as well as a Pliocene to Recent mountain chain stage. The present study deals mainly with the island arc stage. The first island ares emerged towards the beginning of the Late Campanian: a non-volcanic archipelagos of basaltic islands bounded by strike-slip fault scarps. Where insular shelves did exist, they were colonized by Rudist biostromes; the talus originated mainly by rock-falling and avalanching. As early as {{at the end of the}} Late Campanian, the greater part of this basaltic archipelagos subsided. During the Paleocene and the Eocene, it became more or less deeply buried under hemipelagic sediments deriving from the active andesitic island arc which formed at the si te of the actual mainland. The borders of this andesitic island arc were oversupplied with elastics due to excessive erosion. Thus, carbonate shelves could hardly extend and were restricted to some patchy areas where communities of larger foraminifera and red algae developped during the Middle/Upper Eocene. Dueto local uplift, however, a relatively small isolated Bahama-type carbonate platform established in the western Bajo Tempisque area, producing the (probably Eocene) Barra Honda formation. This carbonate platform both supplied slide blocks to the adjacent basins and was surged up and bypassed by turbidites deriving from the andesitic island are. Paleovertebratological data evidence that from both island chains only the Campanian one permitted an exchange of terrestrial animals between North and South America. This early connection must have been disrupted, from the latest Campanian onward, by transform displacements and/or late rotations. In this context it may be annotated that the present-day geological configuration in the Costa Rican area provides only incomplete paleogeographical profiles. A hypothetical <b>section</b> <b>fitting</b> the Peninsula de Nicoya and Bajo Tempisque area with the Quepos - Fila Costeila - Talamanca area would join the missing links. This configuration, however, requires NW - SE lateral displacements which, at the moment, can neither be lo- calized nor be proved due to the lack of paleomagnetical data...|$|E

We characterize the neuroanatomical properties of the correlation and density profiles by ranking the regions of the left hemisphere delineated in the Allen Reference Atlas. We compare these rankings to prior biological knowledge of the brain region from which the cell-type-specific sample was extracted.

40|$|The rate of {{performance}} improvements of the LHC at CERN has had strong influence {{on the characteristics of}} the monitoring tools developed for the experiments. We present some of the latest additions to the suite of Web Based Monitoring services for the CMS experiment, and explore the aspects that address the roughly 20 -fold increase in peak instantaneous luminosity over the course of 2011. One of these user-friendly tools allows collaborators to easily view, and make correlations among, accelerator configuration information such as bunch patterns, measured quantities such as intensities, vacuum pressures, and background conditions, as well as derived quantities such as luminosity and the number of simultaneous interactions per beam crossing. An additional tool summarizes the daily, weekly, and yearly luminosity and efficiency. Finally, we discuss a trigger cross <b>section</b> and rate <b>fitting</b> service, that uses data from previous runs to validate current running conditions as well as to serve as a predictive extrapolation tool for developing triggers for higher luminosity running...|$|R
