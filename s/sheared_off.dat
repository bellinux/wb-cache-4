5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> the tops of large trees.|$|E
5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E

On 24 September 1977, Air Chief Marshal Mulgavkar visited the squadron. In June 1978, the first accident with a MiG 21 in the IAF took place. The nose of an aircraft <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> on landing during a night sortie.|$|E
25|$|The third {{incident}} of 2004 happened on July 14 and involved one of Intamin's launched stratacoasters. Four {{people were injured}} while riding on Cedar Point's Top Thrill Dragster. The riders were struck by metal debris that <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> the coaster's launch cable during launch. They were treated at the park's first aid station. Two were further treated at Firelands Regional Medical Center.|$|E

25|$|On August 21, 1995, one of {{the blades}} on Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529's number-one {{propeller}} <b>sheared</b> <b>off,</b> partly tearing the left engine from its mount and increasing drag on the left side. It crashed in a field near Carrollton, Georgia. Of the twenty-nine people on board, ten died (one casualty was {{from a heart attack}} nearly 8 weeks after the accident).|$|E
25|$|Culp's Hill {{became a}} prime tourist {{attraction}} after the battle. It {{was close to}} the town and, unlike most battles in open fields, it was heavily wooded and the extreme firepower took a very visible toll on the trees, some of which were completely <b>sheared</b> <b>off.</b> Geary's division alone on July 3 reported that they expended 227,000 rounds. It took over twenty years before the scars of battle faded and nature reclaimed the breastworks.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{from the}} Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the British Department for Transport {{concluded}} that {{the nose of the}} aircraft was effectively blown off, and was separated from the main section within three seconds of the explosion. The nose cone was briefly held on by a band of metal but facing aft, like the lid of a can. It then <b>sheared</b> <b>off,</b> up and backwards to starboard, striking off the No. 3 engine and landing some distance from Lockerbie, near Tundergarth church.|$|E
50|$|A small {{airstrip}} {{was built}} {{near the village}} by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) around 1993 by <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> hilltops, though its dirt surface would suffer damage from erosion during the rainy season. Between 2007 and 2009, the airstrip was paved by MAF, who brings supplies to the area.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy the isthmus {{of the uterus}} unfolds and forms the lower segment. In a typical pregnancy the placenta does not overlie. If the placenta does overlie the lower segment, {{as is the case}} with placenta previa, it may <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> and a small section may bleed.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{ditching}} {{or water}} landing, podded engines {{hanging from the}} wing increase the stress on the wing by {{increasing the amount of}} drag caused by the water. This can cause the wings to <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> or flip the aircraft and destroy the fuselage as happened to Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961.|$|R
25|$|On June 3, 1972, {{a second}} death {{occurred}} at the Transpo '72 Air Show, during a sport plane pylon race. At 2:40pm, during the second lap and near a turn about pylon 3, a trailing aircraft's (LOWERS R-1 N66AN) wing and propeller hit the right wing tip of a leading aircraft (CASSUTT BARTH N7017). The right wing immediately <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> the fuselage, and the damaged aircraft crashed almost instantly, killing the 29-year-old pilot, Hugh C. Alexander. He was a professional Air Racer with over 10,200 hours.|$|E
25|$|After the {{manoeuvres}} {{the crew}} which was assigned {{the task of}} returning the République to Chalais-Meudon decided to fly her back, rather than have her deflated and dismantled for the return journey by rail. On the morning of 25 September 1909 while near the Château of Avrilly, one of the metal propeller blades <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> its shaft and pierced the envelope, which deflated catastrophically, causing the République to crash into ground at high speed, killing all four crew members: Capt. Marchal, Lt. Chauré, and the 'Adjudants mecaniciens', Vincenot and Réau.|$|E
25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.|$|E
25|$|Pilots {{would often}} claim {{that one could}} fly a P-47 through a brick wall and live, in the post-war era one Air National Guard Thunderbolt plowed into the second story of a factory, <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> its wings, with the {{crumpled}} fuselage eventually coming to rest inside the building, the pilot walked away alive.|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of glass fibre reinforced vinyl-ester laminates with multiple holes {{has been investigated}} experimentally. Different hole pattern configurations have been tested, primarily for unidirectional laminates. Unidirectional laminates have shown very low notch sensitivity and the laminate failure was governed by two competing failure modes; <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> failure and net section tensile failure.

50|$|Lotosaurus was 1.5 to 2.5 m {{long and}} a heavily built quadruped. It was a herbivore, <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> leaves with its toothless, beaked jaws. Lotosaurus, like some {{other members of}} the Poposauroidea, had a sail on its back, {{granting}} it an appearance superficially similar to that of Permian pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, although not as high.|$|R
25|$|The statue {{was kept}} in hiding for five years. During that period, her guardians had her {{carefully}} restored by the Polich Tallix art foundry in New Windsor, New York. Over the years the statue's hand had been broken off, her foot was <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> at the ankle, and her head remained only precariously attached by brackets. The students contacted Bruce Becker, who had stolen Sabrina in 1984 and had since procured a mold of the statue. The foundry used that mold to reconstruct the statue's hand and foot, which were then reattached. The statue's cracked neck was reinforced with fiberglass and epoxy. The guardians also commissioned a wheeled base for Sabrina to aid in her transportation and display.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 1937, Smith was {{critically}} {{injured in}} a car crash while traveling along U.S. Route 61 between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{criminal}} charges {{focused on the}} car's steering column, which {{was found to have}} <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as {{there was no time to}} manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.|$|E
