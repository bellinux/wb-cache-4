40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of typical shoulder motion is desirable for both clinicians and shoulder researchers. With this knowledge, comparisons between normal and special populations (e. g. athletic, working, elderly, injured) are enabled and injury mechanisms for heightened or diminished performance may be identified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to generate a robust quantification of typical <b>shoulder</b> kinematic <b>profiles</b> during dynamic humeral elevation in six vertical movement planes, and to determine the influence of humeral movement plane, movement phase, gender, and humeral elevation angle on typical scapulothoracic (ST), glenohumeral (GH), acromioclavicular (AC), and sternoclavicular (SC) kinematics. Upper limb kinematic data were collected on 15 males and 14 females as they elevated and lowered their right humerus in six vertical movement planes with elbows fully extended. A total of 60 <b>shoulder</b> kinematic <b>profiles</b> were generated for both raising and lowering motion phases. Trial-to-trial repeatability of the measured rotations, as indicated by intra-class correlation coefficient was found to be moderate (0. 658) to high (0. 999). Overall, as the humerus was elevated, scapulothoracic (ST) upward rotation, ST posterior tilt, sternoclavicular (SC) elevation, SC retraction, acromioclavicular (AC) elevation and glenohumeral (GH) elevation all increased. However, ST protraction/retraction, GH internal/external rotation, GH anterior/posterior plane of elevation, and AC protraction/retraction responses were less consistent. There was a main effect of humeral movement plane and elevation angle (p < 0. 001) identified for all measured joint rotations. A significant phase main effect was not found for right glenohumeral +anterior/-posterior plane of elevation (GAP), glenohumeral +medial/-lateral elevation (GLE), and acromioclavicular protraction/retraction (APR). At least one significant interaction of the main effects, including that of gender, was present for all rotations. The typical <b>shoulder</b> kinematic <b>profiles</b> provided in this investigation is the largest to date of its kind obtained using skin-mounted shoulder tracking techniques. Clinical scientists will find the profiles useful because they provide motion trends that can be compared to profiles from other segments of the population, including patients with specific shoulder injuries.

In the Compton-thin regime, the EW of the Ni Kalpha line is a factor of ~ 22 {{less than that of}} the Fe Kalpha line but this factor can be as low as ~ 6 in the Compton-thick regime. We show that the optically-thin limit for this ratio depends only on the Fe to Ni abundance ratio, it being independent of the geometry and covering factor of the reprocessor, and also independent of the shape of the incident X-ray continuum. We give some useful analytic expressions for the absolute flux and the EW of the Ni Kalpha line in the optically-thin limit. When the reprocessor is Compton-thick and the incident continuum is a power-law with a photon index of 1. 9, the Ni Kalpha line EW has a maximum value of ~ 3 eV and ~ 250 eV for non-intercepting and intercepting lines-of-sight respectively. Larger EWs are obtained for flatter continua. We have also studied the Compton shoulder of the Ni Ka line and find that the ratio of scattered to unscattered flux in the line has a maximum value of 0. 26, less than the corresponding maximum for the Fe Kalpha line. However, we find that the shape of the Compton <b>shoulder</b> <b>profile</b> for a given column density and inclination angle of the torus is similar to the corresponding profile for the Fe Ka line. Our results will be useful for interpreting X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binary systems in which the system parameters are favorable for the Ni Kalpha line to be detected.

U iskopavanjima 2002. godine otkriven je paljevinski grob s drvenom arhitekturom u kojem su se nalazili prilozi dvojakoga podrijetla. Autohtono podrijetlo u latenskoj kulturi mlađega željeznoga doba pokazuju lonci zaobljenoga tijela izrađeni rukom i zdjela S-profilacije. Sjevernoitalskoga podrijetla su zdjelica tankih stijenki, keramička svjetiljka, staklena posuda te ostali prilozi koji zajedno s Klaudijevim novcem datiraju grob u sredinu 1. st. Na osnovi nalaza posuda izrađenih u latenskim tradicijama pretpostavlja se kako je u grobu bila pokopana osoba starosjedilačkoga podrijetla, dok importirani prilozi svjedoče o ranoj romanizaciji južne Panonije i dunavskoga limesa. O postojanju složenoga pogrebnoga rituala svjedoče izdvojeni ostaci kultiviranih biljaka domaćega i uvoznoga podrijetla koje su bile položene u lonce. The high Danube bank near Ilok, {{which is}} {{situated}} on the western slopes of Fruška gora, was continuously settled in all prehistoric periods, and after that - as the finds analyzed herein indicate - in the Roman time, but Ilok experienced its peak in the Late Middle Ages, {{in the period of}} Nikola and his son Lovro. The beginning of excavations in Ilok’s upper town is particularly significant for reveal of the topography of Roman Ilok, which remained almost completely unknown due to a small number of finds. Data about the Roman settlement of Ilok (Cuccium) are preserved in several Itineraries, with different forms for the settlement’s name. Thus Notitia Dignitatum mentions two cavalry units, Cuneus equitum Promotorum and Equites Sagittarii, in Cuccium of the 4 th century. The excavations of the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb began in 2001 in the extension of the eastern wing of Odescalchi Castle, to be continued in 2002 towards the west to encompass the lawn in front of the castle (Fig. 1). In preloess layer SJ 224 (10 YR 4 / 3) {{in the southern part of}} the excavated area, filling SJ 229 was isolated. This filling is the first in a number of preserved fillings of the larger prehistoric pit SJ 306 which by finds was dated to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. In prehistoric filling SJ 229 another younger rectangular filling SJ 230 (5 Y 4 / 3) was identified, whose western edge was damaged by recent burial in lime pit SJ 216, whereas the southern part lies outside the margin of the excavated area. Filling SJ 230 is part of the Early Roman grave SJ 273. Along the southern profile of the dig in filling SJ 230 a smaller burial SJ 270 and filling SJ 269, which caused no major damage to the grave (Fig. 5), were identified. The bottom of the grave with finds remained preserved, and the lack of incinerated human remains is possibly due to the fact that they are situated in the southern part of the grave, which has not yet been excavated, even though it is highly possible that they were destroyed in an earlier intervention in the grave filling. All grave goods were found in the eastern part of the grave (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In the middle of the grave, close to the top of SJ 230, a hollow shafted iron axe (Pl. 2, 7) was found, which on account of its position compared to other finds is supposed to have entered the grave by digging through the older prehistoric strata, thus not belonging to the grave goods. On the bottom of the grave, filling SJ 268 (2. 5 Y 5 / 6) was isolated which belongs to the thin layer of preserved wooden architecture (Fig. 2 - 3), on whose remains in the northeastern corner of the grave two hand-made pots with a rounded body and a flat rim and bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) were found, as well as fragments of a wheel-made bowl with an S profile (Pl. 2, 1). In the corner of the grave, fragments of a dark-gray bowl with thin walls (Pl. 2, 6) and a play-token of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1) were found. A part of the bowl was also in a pot laid slightly more to the south (Pl. 1, 2). Around both pots numerous seeds were identified, which is why the complete content of the filling around the vessels and their filling is flotated. In the eastern part of the grave there were fragments of a glass vessel, probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4). Fragments of a ceramic lamp (Pl. 2, 5), a bronze earring (Pl. 1, 3), a fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) and an iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) were found in the southeastern excavated part of the grave. Also in that part of the grave a bronze artifact, which probably represents a vessel’s handle fastening system (Pl. 1, 4), and Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6) were found. Beneath the remains of planks, filling SJ 272 (5 Y 5 / 4) was isolated, which contained no grave goods. The excavated part of grave SJ 273 is rectangular-shaped with rounded corners with dimensions of 2. 12 m (W-E) and 1. 88 m (N-S up to the dig profile). The results of research indicate that all the grave goods were lain on the bottom of a wooden case, the existence of which is proved not only by SJ 268, but also by four uncovered post holes, one in each corner (SJ 277 and SJ 295), and two more in the middle of the western and eastern side of the grave respectively (SJ 275 and SJ 293). Although the southern part of the grave was not excavated, it can be assumed that post holes were in the southeastern and southwestern corner of the grave. All the holes are quadrangular, and in the bottom part they become octagonal to make post driving easier. The results of floatation of part of the filling around the ceramic vessels laying in the northeastern part of the grave and the filling of pots indicated the existence of a complex funeral custom which is reflected in the presence of a relatively large number of isolated cultivated plants. Archaeobotanical analysis showed that among grave goods there were cereals (barley, millet, and different types of wheat), leguminous plants (lentil and vetch) as well as a large number of “fruit” objects (melon/cucumber, fig, apple/ pear cherry/sour cherry/sloe, plum, elder and vinegrape). The fig and probably the melon were imported to the Ilok since they are cultivated in warmer (sub) Mediterranean areas, whereas the other sorts were probably cultivated in the surroundings of Ilok. All of the cereals and vetch are carbonized, i. e. they were intentionally or unintentionally burned. Apparently they were laid onto a funeral pile. The remaining “fruit” finds were calcified, i. e. they were laid into the grave fresh or dried, probably when laying the human remains and other grave goods. With the exception of the fig, which had to be dried due to long transport from the Mediterranean region, the remaining fruits could have been laid fresh. Apples, pears, plums, sourberries and elder berries as well as vinegrapes and melons ripen at the same time of the year, i. e. in the early autumn, which suggests that the burial took place in that season. Still one has to keep in mind that “fruit” objects could have been kept in dried state for a relatively long time. The remains of a Roman grave were found in the excavations of 2002, indicating the existence of a cemetery, which had been unknown until now. The grave contained a cremation burial, with grave goods that were laid on the bottom in the northeastern corner and along the eastern side of the wooden case, rectangular in shape, which was probably made of oakwood (Fig. 4). The answers to questions on the chronological position, ethnic determination and the origin of the finds shall be given after an analysis of the grave goods, which can be divided in two groups, the first represented by three ceramic vessels made following the tradition of the La Tène culture, and the other group of finds which are northern Italic imports and which, along with the coin, make dating of the grave possible. These finds consist of a ceramic bowl with thin walls, a glass vessel, a ceramic lamp, a bronze earring and a glass paste play-token. The same origin can be assumed concerning the finds that were preserved only in fragments such as a bronze handle fastening system of a vessel and a needle. On the basis of their shape and technological characteristics, the two hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the wheel-made, S-profiled bowl are connected with the tradition of the La Tène culture. The dark gray to dark brown pots with an admixture of quartz and chuff in abundance, have a rounded body, a flat rim beneath which there is a horizontal groove and a flat bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2). These are situla form pots, for which there are numerous parallels in the Late La Tène Scordiscs settlements in eastern Slavonia and Syrmia, found also in Early Roman strata and graves. Of similar origin is also the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl with a rich admixture of quartz (Pl. 2, 1) that was also found in the northeastern corner of the grave. The hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the S-profiled bowl represent the Late La Tène heritage of the Scordiscs and testify to the presence of an autochthonous population in the Early Roman sites of the 1 st century, whose traditions are the strongest in the shapes, techniques and methods of decorating coarse pottery. As indicated by the finds from the settlement layers in Vinkovci, Osijek and Srijemska Mitrovica, the local craftsmen continued the production of recognizable shapes, thus satisfying the needs of the indigenous population. Those forms were decorated by familiar motifs by applying combed or broom-shaped ornaments and by polishing. Ceramic ware with autochthonous features was preserved until the period of the Flavians, suggesting the existence of indigenous peregrine communities which preserved the achievements of their own material culture up until the end of the 1 st century, but due to intensified romanization in the 2 nd century this autochthonous trait The second and larger group of finds from the grave testifying to the romanization of the indigenous population of Cuccium. This group consists of Early Roman import artifacts, which arrived at Limes by the well-known Sava valley trade route from the northern Italic region. The dark gray bowl with thin walls and two horizontal ribs (Pl. 2, 6), the ceramic lamp with a voluted nose and a rosette ornament (Pl. 2, 5), and a glass vessel, most probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4) represent imported grave goods which are not only chronologically sensitive but also point to the direction of the cultural and economic effects of the Roman conquest of the Drava, Sava and Danube interfluve. Ceramic ware with thin walls appeared in the eastern Alps and the middle Danube in the Tiberian period along with Padanian sigillata at the time of the first military conquests. Different shapes and ornamentation methods were identified, of which bowls decorated in barbotine technique are the largest in number. Typical of southern Pannonia is intensive import in the Claudius-Flavius period, when the peak of production was achieved. With the Flavian period, the production in the local workshops of Sirmium, Emona and on Gomolava began, in which shapes, ornaments and facture of the imported specimens were imitated. At the end of the 1 st century the quality and the number of vessels with thin walls declined, but their production continued until the middle of the 2 nd century. The ceramic lamp with reddish-brown coating and voluted nose, two grooves on its shoulder and a rosette ornament (Pl. 2, 5) is also of northern Italic origin; its fragments were found at the eastern margin of the grave. The lamp find, along with other imports, suggests the acceptance of Roman lifestyle traditions and funeral customs. The described lamp belongs to the Iványi I type, which encompasses specimens with voluted triangle-shaped nose, a relief figure in the middle concentric grooves on the rim. According to D. Iványi’s classification, the lamp from Ilok belongs to the third type, its basic feature being a broader voluted nose dated to about the middle and the last quarter of the 1 st century or to the 2 nd century. According to Loeschcke’s classification of ceramic lamps with an angular nose and volutes, the Ilok find corresponds to type I, variation b, characterized by a somewhat narrower top of the nose than with lamps having volutes, whereas the <b>shoulder</b> <b>profile</b> with two grooves is of type IIb. The angular ceramic lamps with volutes of the Iványi I, or Loeschcke I type, from Pannonian sites, represent a northern Italic import from the beginning of the 1 st century, when they arrived along with the Arentino and northern Italic sigillata of the Augustan and Tiberian periods. The finds of voluted lamps, as well as of ceramic ware with thin walls, in military camps on the Danube (Zemun, Novi Banovci, Surduk) prove that they were imported to satisfied the needs of the army, but also for the higher social class of the autochtonous population, as indicated by the richly cremation grave from Ilok. Production in local Pannonian workshops began in the second half of the 1 st century, as finds of moulds in Sirmium, Mursa and Poetovio suggest. Their occurrence in south Pannonian sites can be followed also in the 2 nd century, up to the beginning of the 3 rd. The smaller vessel, probably a funnel or a glass, made of greenish glass with a horizontally inverted rim (Pl. 2, 4), the fragments of which were found along the eastern margin of the grave, also suggests northern Italic origin. Just like the voluted lamp and the bowl with thin walls, the vessel came to the Danube limes through Aquileia, which in the 1 st- 2 nd centuries was an important production center, but at the same time it was a commercial port for goods coming from other production centers, from where it was imported into the eastern Alpine and Danube regions. In the northeastern corner of the grave there was also a play-token made of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1), which is supposed to have served for playing and which was dated to the 1 st century. In the grave, a greenish glass bead was found as well (Pl. 2, 3). Metal grave goods and coin were preserved (Fig. 4) in the southeastern excavated part of the grave, on the remains of poorly preserved wooden planks. The little bronze 74 ring with an irregular rectangular cross-section has its one terminal looped, whereas its other terminal is missing (Pl. 1, 3). Its description corresponds with the type of Roman bronze earrings in the shape of wired annulets with different crosssections, with looped or clipped terminals. Simple earrings in the form of a wired ring that used to close by inserting the small hook through the loop were documented in a longer period, and they differ according to the shape of the pendant hanging from the ring, whose shape remained almost unchanged. The fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) was probably part of a bronze fibula. In the immediate vicinity of the earring there was another object, the function of which is not sufficiently clear. It might have been a handle fastening system of a bronze vessel (Pl. 1, 4) consisting of a leaned ring with an oval outline and a round cross-section, beneath which there is trifoliate sheet metal with rectangular terminals and a rivet hole in the upper part. The ring is separated from the bottom part by a rib, on which there are two horizontal grooves. In the immediate vicinity, a smaller iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) was found with a short spike with a rectangular cross-section that might have served for fastening a handle. Apart from the described finds, another import in the grave are also the remains of the fig and the melon, found along with other archaeobotanical samples in the northeastern part of the grave and in the fillings of both pots. The figs could not be cultivated in the southern Pannonian area due to inclement climatic conditions. Since figs could not have been kept fresh for a long time, it was not possible to transport the fruits across larger distances, therefore probably the figs arrived to Cuccium dried. The figs, along with the remaining ceramic and glass finds, were imported for the needs of the settled Italic, but also indigenous population, who were not unfamiliar with Italic goods. The largest part of archaeobotanical artifacts accounts for wine grape seeds. The question of the origin and cultivation of wine among the Illyrians with the mentioned antique sources was thoroughly analyzed by M. Zaninović. The Pannonian production of small quantities of wine and the bad quality of its production is mentioned by Dion Cassius (49. 36. 2), which is also confirmed by Strabo’s quote (VII. 5. 10) that the regions above Dalmatia are mountainous and cold and that vineyards can seldom be found there. The finds of amphorae dated in the beginning of the 1 st century, which came along with the wine across Aquileia, testify to imports of wine to Sirmium, which was supported by settled Italics and by the indigenous population. Wine cultivation in Pannonia was intensified in the second half of the 3 rd century, in the period of Probus, when soldiers planted selected grapes on the slopes of Fruška gora (Almus Mons). The discovery of grape seeds in pots in the grave in Ilok prove the earlier existence of vineyards on the western slopes of Fruška gora already in the 1 st century, although it is possible that the tradition of wine cultivation in the Ilok region is considerably older. The laying of different kinds of cereals and fruits combined with ceramic and glass vessels of twofold origin into the grave suggests the existence of a complex funeral rite, which is still inadequately understood in the southern Pannonian territory in the Early Roman period. Numerous parallels to all described finds from the grave in Ilok were documented in the Danube region, which enable the dating of the grave in the middle of the 1 st century. This is also confirmed by the find of Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6). Although the grave has not been completely excavated, the grave goods and remains of grave architecture enriched the existing understanding of the process of romanization of the Croatian Danube region, testifying to the relation of the indigenous population towards the newly arrived achievements of the Roman culture. Of particular importance for the ethnic determination of the burial are three ceramic vessels from the northeastern corner of the grave, two hand-made pots with a rounded body (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) and the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl (Pl. 2, 1). The described vessels can be compared with the material heritage of the La Tène culture, which in the middle Danube is connected with the Scordiscs. In the described shapes, the continuation of pottery traditions of the indigenous mixed Celtic- Pannonian population is visible, which in the 1 st century formed an important ethnic component of the southern part of Roman Pannonia. The second group of finds that suggests northern Italic origin points to the direction of the new ethnic, cultural and economic influences on the eastern part of the the Sava-Drava-Danube interfluve in the process of early romanization. Numerous parallels with Early Roman cremation burials from Syrmia, in which ceramic finds produced following La Tène traditions were found, indicate a strong tradition of the autochthonous population up until the end of the 1 st century. This means that the mixed Celtic-Pannonian population living in the territory of the middle Danube played an important role in the process of early romanization and formed a constituent part of the ethnic corps of the newly conquered part of southern Pannonia. The indigenous population in larger centers that emerged from Late La Tène protourbane centers, was exposed to more intensive and rapid romanization by the settling Italic population and veterans and common imports, which was accompanied by the achievements of the Roman way of life. Rural Late La Tène communities long held the features of their own material culture, accepting only some of the achievements of the newly founded Roman provincial culture. In the grave in Ilok, imported objects suggesting northern Italic origin were found as well, and they came to the middle Danube by a trade route that was in function earlier - along the Sava River, where in the 1 st century BC certain goods were transported for the Scordiscs. This is shown by numerous finds of bronze vessels of northern Italic origin, which in the sites of La Tène culture in eastern Slavonia occur in graves and in the most important fortified settlements such as Dalj, Sotin, Vinkovci and Orolik. The import of bronze vessels took place from Aquileia through Nauportus and Emona, from where along the Sava over Segestica it came to the middle Danube. Strabo (4. 6. 10; 5. 1. 8; 7. 5. 2) described this important prehistoric communication, and the described trade route is also supported by finds of coins from Appolonia and Dyrrhachion, as well as of Roman Republican coins. The use of the well-known trade route, along the Sava towards the East, continued also in the Early Roman period, when Aquileia was the most significant center of the export of pottery with thin walls, terra sigillatae and glass vessels on the markets of Pannonia and Noricum. It can be claimed with certainty that Tiberius’ conquest of the eastern part of the Interfluve came running across the Sava valley. The understanding of events after the Roman conquest of eastern Slavonia and western Syrmia is weak due to a lack of site excavations, on which the process of romanization that had started could be followed. Although there were significant military bases of the Danube Limes in the described territory, as well as larger civic settlements in its hinterland, such as Mursa and Cibalae, the material heritage of the first decades of the 1 st century is little known.

40|$|We present new, high {{signal-to-noise}} ratio {{results from a}} Monte Carlo study of {{the properties of the}} Compton shoulder of the Fe Kalpha emission line in the toroidal X-ray reprocessor model of Murphy & Yaqoob (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1549). The model comprehensively covers the Compton-thin to Compton-thick regimes and we find that the variety of Compton <b>shoulder</b> <b>profiles</b> is greater than that for both (centrally-illuminated) spherical and disk geometries. Our Monte Carlo simulations were done with a statistical accuracy that is high enough to reveal, for the case of an edge-on, Compton-thick torus, a new type of Compton shoulder that is not present in the spherical or disk geometries. Such a Compton shoulder is dominated by a narrow back-scattering feature at ~ 6. 24 keV. Our results also reveal a dependence of the shape of the Compton shoulder (and its magnitude relative to the Fe Kalpha line core) on the spectral shape of the incident X-ray continuum. We also show the effects of velocity broadening on the Fe Kalpha line profile and find that if either the velocity width or instrument resolution is greater than a FWHM of ~ 2000 km/s, the Compton shoulder begins to become blended with the line core and the characteristic features of the Compton shoulder become harder to resolve. In particular, at a FWHM of ~ 7000 km/s the Compton shoulder is NOT resolved at all, its only signature being a weak asymmetry in the blended line profile. Thus, CCD X-ray detectors cannot unambiguously resolve the Compton shoulder. Our results are freely available in a format that is suitable for direct spectral-fitting of the continuum and line model to real data.

In the present paper Landau damping of electron plasma (Langmuir) waves and ion-acoustic waves in a hot, isotropic, unmagnetized plasma is studied with the generalized (r, q) distribution function.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} a novel modelling technique based around intermittent transport due to filament motion, to interpret experimental profile and fluctuation data in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of JET during the onset and evolution of a density <b>profile</b> <b>shoulder.</b> A baseline case is established, prior to shoulder formation, and the stochastic model is shown to be capable of simultaneously matching the time averaged profile measurement as well as the PDF shape and autocorrelation function from the ion-saturation current time series at the outer wall. Aspects of the stochastic model are then varied with the aim of producing a <b>profile</b> <b>shoulder</b> with statistical measurements consistent with experiment. This is achieved through a strong localised reduction in the density sink acting on the filaments within the model. The required reduction of the density sink occurs over a highly localised region with the timescale of the density sink increased by a factor of 25. This alone is found to be insufficient to model the expansion and flattening of the shoulder region as the density increases, which requires additional changes within the stochastic model. An example is found which includes both a reduction in the density sink and filament acceleration and provides a consistent match to the experimental data as the shoulder expands, though the uniqueness of this solution can not be guaranteed. Within the context of the stochastic model, this implies that the localised reduction in the density sink can trigger shoulder formation, but additional physics is required to explain the subsequent evolution of the profile...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} issues in space plasma physics is {{that in spite of}} the {{inhomogeneity}} of interplanetary plasma and the complicated magnetic field topology we do not find strong deviations from Maxwellian distributions as it would be expected for a quasi-collisionless plasma. However, the presence of high energy tail and <b>shoulders</b> in the <b>profile</b> of distribution function stimulate to look for a better analytic representation of the observed distributions. Therefore, here we adopt a non-Maxwellian distribution function such as the Ellipsian distribution function, which is the generalized form of the Kappa distribution function. In this paper we have analysed the solar wind data recorded by Cluster s/c during early 2001 and 2002 when the s/c were repeatedly immersed in the solar wind, ahead of the Earth’s bow shock. Data were modeled {{with the help of the}} Ellipsian distribution function and values of the best fit parameters were successively used to characterize the solar wind kinetics at different locations of one of the four Cluster s/c...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{elaborate}} a motor {{plan and}} perform online {{control in the}} gravity field, the brain relies on priors and multisensory integration of information. In particular, afferent and efferent inputs related to the initial state are thought to convey sensorimotor information to plan the upcoming action. Yet it is still unclear to what extent these cues impact motor planning. Here we examined the role of initial information on the planning and execution of arm movements. Participants performed upward arm movements around the shoulder at three speeds and in two arm conditions. In the first condition, the arm was outstretched horizontally and required a significant muscular command {{to compensate for the}} gravitational shoulder torque before movement onset. In contrast, in the second condition the arm was passively maintained in the same position with a cushioned support and did not require any muscle contraction before movement execution. We quantified differences in motor performance by comparing <b>shoulder</b> velocity <b>profiles.</b> Previous studies showed that asymmetric velocity profiles reflect an optimal integration of the effects of gravity on upward movements. Consistent with this, we found decreased acceleration durations in both arm conditions. However, early differences in kinematic asymmetries and EMG patterns between the two conditions signaled a change of the motor plan. This different behavior carried on through trials when the arm was at rest before movement onset and may reveal a distinct motor strategy chosen in the context of uncertainty. Altogether, we suggest that the information available online must be complemented by accurate initial information...|$|R

METHODS: A total of 56 patients with proximal humeral fractures were selected, and submitted to digitized simple radiography in antero-posterior <b>shoulder</b> and scapular <b>profile.</b> Radiographs were analyzed by three observers at time one, and then three and six weeks later. The kappa coefficient modified by Fleiss was used for the analysis.

40|$|Inspired by the {{manufacturing}} process of switch rails for railway turnouts, a method for the optimization of switch rail profile geometry is presented. The switch rail profile geometry is parameterized with four design variables to define a B-spline curve for the milling tool profile, and two design variables to prescribe the deviation from the nominal vertical path of the milling tool. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective minimization problem with objective functions based on the contact pressure and the energy dissipation in the wheel–rail contact. The front of Pareto optimal solutions is determined by applying a genetic type optimization algorithm. The switch rail profile designs are evaluated by simulations of dynamic train–turnout interaction using a commercial code for multi-body dynamics. The vehicle model is a freight wagon with Y 25 bogies and 25 metric tonnes axle load. Traffic is simulated in both travelling directions in the diverging route of a 60 E 1 - 760 - 1 : 15 turnout. It is concluded that the obtained set of Pareto optimal solutions corresponds to a rather small variation in design variables where increased profile height and increased <b>profile</b> <b>shoulder</b> protuberance are preferred for both objectives...|$|R
40|$|Direct laser {{patterning}} {{of various}} materials has {{found its way}} into several micro-system production lines like inkjet printing, solar cell technology, flat-panel display production, semiconductors and medical treatment. Typically, TEM 00 single-mode solid state lasers and their higher harmonics are used, especially for machining of holes and trenches. The most prominent lasers are short pulse solid-state lasers based on Nd-doped gain materials and their harmonics @ 266, 355 and 532 nm. Traditionally, the original Gaussian beam profile is used. With optimised top hat optics the quality of the generated micro-structures - especially straightness and steepness of the edges - can be improved. Additionally, the process time can be reduced since for a top hat profile less energy is lost in the <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>profile</b> compared to a Gaussian one. Based on LIMO’s unique production technology free-form refractive optics were developed which exhibit high efficiencies (> 98 %) and inhomogeneities below 10 %. With optimized depths of field above +/- 300 µm and integration into industrial scanning systems these optics can boost the performance and throughput in laser-based solar cell manufacturing lines.
