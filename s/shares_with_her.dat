Minogue felt [...] "All the Lovers" [...] summarised the [...] "euphoria" [...] of the album perfectly and chose it to be the lead single from Aphrodite. It was then globally released by Parlophone as a CD single and digital download on 11 June 2010. [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is a midtempo disco song with influences of electropop music.

She comes out to him and he <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> his longing to be [...] "normal" [...] for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook. She advises him to just ask for the things he wants, so they visit Freddie to tell him to make up with Cook. At Freddie's house, though, they walk in on Freddie having sex with Emily's twin sister, Katie (Megan Prescott), and JJ accidentally outs Emily as a lesbian, leaving Katie looking visibly shaken. JJ asks Freddie to make up with Cook, but Freddie refuses and tells JJ to choose between him and Cook.|$|E
500|$|... "Littlest Things" [...] has met mixed reviews; Heather Phares from AllMusic complimented the song, {{saying the}} ballad softens Allen's rough image and celebrates [...] "the mundane moments {{of a dying}} relationship", whereas Blender {{reporter}} Jon Dolan considers it a [...] "forlorn single", where the singer writes about the terror {{of being in a}} relationship [...] "with white-knuckled worry over a snip of florid piano from a ’70s soft-core porn flick". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticised Allen for being a [...] "poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad 'Littlest Things' seem like a farce". While analysing Alright, Still, The Guardian reviewer, Sophie Heawood, described the lyrics as the [...] "perfect description of missing someone: 'We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt'." [...] Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Littlest Things' is a supple piano-tickler that provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms. Dynamite in the dust on the R balladeering front". He believed that the song is made out of Allen's [...] "comfort zone" [...] of songs such as [...] "Smile", the result being of [...] "high order, if not a bit more erratic". IGN reviewer Todd Gilchrist named the song as the album's [...] "most affecting tune", while thought it [...] "compiles a sad and beautiful checklist of the intimate moments she no longer <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> dearly departed boyfriend".|$|E
500|$|Back in the present, {{the group}} {{make it to}} Founders Island where humans {{have been living in}} {{relative}} peace. While Kara seeks to make amends with Frieda, Finn and Jake discover that the island is full of Minerva look-alike robots called [...] "helpers". They are brought to the real Minervaa digitized consciousnesswhen Finn is identified as her son. Minerva reveals that she had Dr. Gross send Kara to retrieve Finn, but years had passed and Dr. Gross had accidentally released a deadly virus that was killing humans. Minerva had her essence uploaded into a computer, and then created the helpers to assist the human race. Now that she is with Finn, she expresses her desire that he stay permanently. Finn tries to convince Minerva that life off the island is not all bad, but Minerva thinks off-island life is dangerous. Finn then tries to convince the humans to leave, and they all rally alongside him. This causes Minerva to attempt to upload the consciousnesses of all the islands' inhabitants. To prevent this, Finn <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> his memories of helping people, causing her to back down; she realizes that Ooo is not nearly a threat as she before believed. The humans all change their minds about leaving, except for Frieda. With Minerva's help, they defeat the colossus. Later, Kara and Frieda announce to Finn, Jake, and BMO that they have made amends and are leaving to have their own adventures. Finn has one final talk with Minerva through the VR headset, where the two embrace in the digital realm. Finn then returns to Ooo with Jake and BMO.|$|E

They bond over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, {{and over time}} develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet's outspoken arrogance and beauty. Together they paint, write stories, make Plasticine figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is {{the setting of the}} adventure novels they write together, which they hope to have published and eventually made into films in Hollywood. Over time it begins to be as real to them as the real world. Pauline's relationship with her mother, Honora, becomes increasingly hostile and the two fight constantly.

2500|$|The {{short story}} [...] "Everyday Use" [...] by Alice Walker {{illustrates}} {{the voice of}} a black rural middle class woman through the relationship that a black woman <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> two daughters Dee and Maggie. Dee is spoiled and believes that her education and experiences make her better than her mother and her sister. On the other hand, Maggie envies her sister for her the beauty and arrogance that always gets her what she wants. Historically, it has been very common for people of color to have their stories told by Caucasians. However, Walker attempts to break this tradition by having a black rural middle class woman tell the story of her relationships with her two daughters. An important part of the story occurs when the mother in [...] "Everyday Use" [...] states, [...] "You've no doubt seen those TV shows where the child who has [...] "made it" [...] is confronted, as a surprise, by her own mother and father, tottering in weakly from backstage… Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort…". Here the mother reminisces about a family experience that she has witnessed on television that she wishes she could have for herself. A heart-warming scene similar to the one that the mother witnessed on television does not take place when her daughter Dee comes to visit. Instead when Dee comes to visit the mother a rough, awkward tension-filled encounter slowly unfolds. Walker employs this story and its context to illustrate that a majority of womanism is characterized by black women telling their stories.|$|E
