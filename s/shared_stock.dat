This essay turns toward {{a different set of}} questions—about the role of texts in the communication of knowledge. Developing an alternative intellectual genealogy of copyright law grounded in the eighteenth-century contest between innatism and empiricism, I argue that jurists like William Blackstone and poets like Edward Young drew on Locke’s theories of ideas to articulate a new understanding of writing as uncommunicative expression. Innatists understood texts as tools that could enable transparent communication through a <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> of innate ideas, but by denying the existence of innate ideas empiricists called the possibility of communication into question. And in their arguments for perpetual copyright protection, eighteenth-century jurists and pamphleteers pushed empiricism to its extreme, linking literary and economic value to the least communicative aspects of a text...|$|E

40|$|The fishery for Northeast Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} fisheries in the North Atlantic. After the introduction of Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction, cod is a <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> between Norway and Russia. Overfishing of quotas has been a concern for a number of years. The purpose of this article is to analyse cooperative and non-cooperative management of the Northeast Atlantic cod fishery. This will be done in a game theoretic context, based on different assumptions regarding important variables such as cost of effort and initial stock size. The game theoretic analysis will be based on an empirical bioeconomic model developed and estimated by Hannesson (2007, 2010). The case of cooperative management is analysed for different cost parameters and starting values of the stock. An interesting result is that the optimal policy gives rise to pulse fishing. As this involves effort (and harvests) varying from year to year, potentially imposing substantial social costs on the industry in years when the fishery is closed, a policy of constant effort is also considered. Finally, non-cooperative management is analysed...|$|E

Consider a number of groups of machines, for each of which a target aggregate fill rate or target average response time (waiting time) should be met. Between groups, commonality exists, i. e., some parts occur in the material breakdown structure of machines in multiple groups. Instead of using separate stocks per group of machines, we study {{the potential benefits of}} exploiting commonality by using a <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> for all groups together. For this purpose, we formulate a multi-item single-site spare parts inventory model, with the objective to minimize the spare parts provisioning costs, i. e., inventory holding and transportation costs, under the condition that all service level constraints are met. We develop a heuristic solution procedure using a decomposition approach as in Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, in order to obtain both a heuristic solution and a lower bound for the optimal costs. In a case study and a numerical experiment, we show that significant reductions in spare parts provisioning costs can be obtained by using shared stocks. Furthermore, we show how the size of the potential benefits behaves {{as a function of the}} number of groups, the percentage of commonality and the occurrence of commonality in cheap or expensive items...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. Collaborative {{management}} {{is essential in}} fisheries with multiple users, where different fishing groups compete to exploit a <b>shared</b> <b>stock,</b> often using unsustainable practices. This {{is the case in}} the Coral Triangle, an ecosystem increasingly coveted by conservation organizations for its high biodiversity, and heavily exploited by fishing groups from the six main countries with exclusive fishing access to the majority of its area: Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Solomon Islands. This paper proposes to address the possibility for collaborative management through the application of game theory to skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna fisheries in the Coral Triangle. The member countries of the Coral Triangle target skipjack tuna, however there are high incidences of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna bycatch. Adult yellowfin and bigeye are targeted by countries outside the Coral Triangle, and thus there is a very obvious conflict of interest between the two groups that needs to be explored. This paper will look at whether current exploitation of tuna stocks in the Coral Triangle is operating under a cooperative or a noncooperative equilibrium, and investigate what type of compensation (perhaps {{in the form of a}} side payment) could be offered to Coral Triangle countries to discourage bycatch of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna...|$|E

40|$|Summary of Proposed Work: The eastern Bering Sea fishery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) yields gross exvessel {{revenues}} about $ {{billion and}} a first wholesale value over $ 1 billion; {{it is the}} premier US fishery. While there is general agreement that this fishery is managed under principles that will ensure sustainability, the eastern Bering Sea pollock stock is not wholly contained within the US EEZ and there are concerns {{about the role of}} historic and potential future catches from regions such as the Bogoslof Basin, the Donut Hole, and the Navarin Basin. The management of straddling stocks can be highly contentious and challenging, particularly when the stock is migratory or when the spatial distribution of abundance is variable. The absolute abundance of pollock and the spatial distribution of pollock abundance have varied considerably over the past three decades, with warmer conditions being associated with a shift of the center of abundance to the north and west, where a portion of the stock is subject to harvest by vessels licensed to operate in the Russian Federation EEZ. In this project, we will use stochastic simulations to identify optimal cooperative and non-cooperative harvest management strategies from the perspective of US and Russian pollock fisheries under climate-induced changes in abundance and the distribution of abundance. Like it or not, this stock is a <b>shared</b> <b>stock.</b> Game theory suggests that cooperative solutions offer many advantages; identifying cooperative solutions provide important leverage in negotiations.

40|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} of the Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) was virtually non-existent in Brazilian waters until 2000 when foreign trawlers initiated their operations on slope grounds {{as part of a}} government-induced chartering program. Since then, the species has been included among the targets of a developing slope trawl fishing off southeastern and southern Brazil. Biological samples were collected from commercial catches of 25 national and seven foreign (chartered) trawlers between 23 °- 33 °S and 170 - 740 m depth. These samples represent two periods of the commercial {{exploitation of}} Illex argentinus in Brazil: 2001 - 2003, when both chartered and national trawlers operated simultaneously, and 2006 - 2007, when only national vessels continued to exploit I. argentinus along with other slope stocks. Catches contained immature and ma-turing squid throughout the year, as well as at least two distinct, fully mature, spawning groups: one composed of small-sized males and females present year-round on the shelf-break/ upper slope (< 400 m), and the other consisting of large squid present only in austral winter-spring in southern (26 °- 29 °S) and deep fishing grounds (400 - 700 m). The latter group has sustained the large winter catches reported since 2000 and the large sizes and concentrations of the specimens sparked the interest of the fishing industry as a potential target of the slope fishery. The reproductive attributes and temporal/ spatial distribution patterns of winter spawners support the hypothesis that relates this group to migrating concentrations of a north Patagonian shelf stock. If confirmed, the present data would underscore the need to consider multinational <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> management strategies in the SW Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} {{resulted}} in a significant grow of the corpus of Old Aramaic inscriptions. Several of the discovered texts contain a series of curses which show a significant degree of similarity. The present contribution aims at a comparative analysis of the curses found in the Tel Fekheriye inscription (KAI 309), the Bukan inscription (KAI 320) and the Sefire treaties (KAI 222 - 224) {{as well as at}} their interpretation in the larger context of the West Semitic literary tradition attested in the Hebrew Bible and in the Phoenician epigraphs. The <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> of expressions and images employed in the curses clearly points to the existence of a common tradition. This tradition goes back to the rural and pastoral lifestyle as it is revealed by the imagery of the curses (famine, infertility). Its distinct character is apparent when compared with the Phoenician curses that use a set of images such as a broken scepter and an overturned throne that betray a royal ideology. The level of literary sophistication of the curses indicates their transmission and subsequent elaboration in scribal circles. The occurrence of the same motifs in the Old Aramaic inscriptions and in a few passages of the Hebrew Bible hints at the common cognitive environment shared by the Aramaeans and Israelites and possibly the existence of a shared tradition. The scribal nature of this tradition is, however, evident only later, {{as in the case of}} Tobit and Ahiqar or Amherst papyrus 63 and Psalm 20, when it is possible to speak about knowledge of literary works by the scribes and not just stock phrases and formulas as is the case with the curses.

40|$|In western Africa, {{multiple}} {{species of}} marine fish are exploited {{by a large}} fishing community. The exploitation of this resource calls {{for the establishment of}} appropriate management and conservation strategies at national and regional levels, which must start with the correct species identification of catches at fish landing sites. To improve fisheries management in West Africa, research actions have recently been developed, but surveys for the correct identification of species and delimitation of stocks are still in need as e. g the famous sardinella <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> between Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau. Research {{of the past two decades}} established that molecular approaches are the best to fill the need especially in poor data area. To address these challenges, we propose a research programme for improving the identification of catches following two objectives. The first objective is to implement a biodiversity collaborative survey on landing sites, with small scale fishermen, using a barcoding approach which will provide a reference barcode library for future studies. This objective may also help discovering new species, establish data base, follow inventory of genetic resources and identify taxonomic ambiguities as well as traceability of fishing product for e. g. exportation. The second is the development of appropriate molecular tools for the delimitation of potential genetic stocks in West Africa for selected fish of high economic importance. The project involves a network of collaborators which will facilitate different aspects of the study including collection/sampling and laboratory procedures. The outcomes of the project include the development of a molecular resource for West African fish, improvement of fisheries management particularly for transboundary species and a better understanding of their biodiversity along the East Atlantic. The project will also contribute to building human capacity in fish identification as well as strengthening a collaboration network between Mauritania to Guinea and South Africa. Scientific outputs will include identification tools, reports for national and regional fisheries organizations, conference communications, and scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals. The new knowledge gathered by the project will be crucial for better management of commercial and threatened fish in West Africa as well as establish a precedent for future studies on other commercially important taxa...|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999, after {{escalating}} tensions in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, NATO went to war against Serbia. This Western intervention was the object of heated debate in various constituencies around the world: within Yugoslavia, Kosovo's majority Albanian population rejoiced in their possible liberation from Serbian oppression, while Serbs questioned the legality of international involvement within a sovereign state. In Europe and America, leftist critics warned of US imperialism, while in China mass protests were sparked when NATO bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Closer to the combat zone, citizens of other southeast European countries watched uneasily. The break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990 s had generated bloody conflict in Croatia and Bosnia, where successor states vied to control territory and resources. It had also prompted dispute in the symbolic realm, as Greece objected to {{the recognition of the}} Republic of Macedonia's sovereignty. The Kosovo war of 1999, though, represented a new set of issues: the ferocity of NATO's aerial assault, the mass displacement of refugees into fragile neighbouring states, and the fundamental character of the war, which pitted Western armed forces directly against a Balkan state, were all unprecedented, and fed fears among amateur and professional commentators that further escalation was likely. In this paper we set out to examine the presence of the Kosovo war in everyday commentary and conversation among the residents of two cities, one Greek and one Macedonian, in 1999. Our aim is first ethnographic: to document how people in the region interpreted a war that Western media, following the line preached by US President Clinton and UK Prime Minister Blair, presented at the time as humanitarian, just and therefore necessary. The narratives we collected were unanimous in viewing NATO's action negatively, and drew on an apparently <b>shared</b> <b>stock</b> of idioms. We consider this apparent ‘meeting of minds’ between Greeks and Macedonians as an interpretive challenge. It is remarkable not only because Greece is and Macedonia aspires {{to be a member of}} NATO and the European Union, but also in the light of the previously high-profile and allegedly deep-rooted dispute between the two countries. The explanation we offer in this paper is that the common anti-Western rhetoric and remarkable parallels in explanations of the war demonstrate how deeply cultural factors shape perceptions of political realities...|$|E
