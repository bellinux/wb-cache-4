5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest {{portion of the}} shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E

50|$|Whether or not <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> {{delivered}} fuzed {{depends on}} whether or not the <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> in sealed packaging. Historically smaller calibres, e.g. 105mm and less, usually were while larger calibre <b>shells</b> <b>were</b> without packaging and plugged. However, in many armies it is now normal for 155mm <b>shells</b> to <b>be</b> delivered in sealed packaging with fuzes fitted.|$|R

5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> due {{to the presence of}} a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E

5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are {{composed of}} aragonite. The outermost layer of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> the periostracum, a skin-like layer which is composed of a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E

5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration {{pattern on the}} <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water, in rivers and lakes on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
50|$|Often <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to be removable, either rolling away on wheels or flying into a flyspace. <b>Shells</b> <b>are</b> most commonly used for orchestras, bands and choirs, although {{they can also be}} used in any application that requires passive sound amplification. <b>Shells</b> <b>are</b> generally made of hard materials because they are {{designed to}} absorb as little sound as possible.|$|R

5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E

As a consequence of the experiment, vibration characteristics of symmetrically laminated Composite <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> obtained, and the validity of the proposed method for laminated composite <b>shells</b> <b>is</b> proven...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{made from}} lapstrake wood, <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> now almost always {{made from a}} {{composite}} material for strength and weight advantages. The first composite <b>shells</b> <b>were</b> made from a form of papier-mâché and became popular in the 1870s. These paper <b>shells</b> <b>were</b> sold world-wide by the Waters Paper Boat Factory of Troy, New York. Modern <b>shells</b> <b>are</b> usually made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic in a honeycomb structure. They are manufactured by either cold laying up of the carbon, which is then left to set, or by using heat curing, which ensures that the carbon fibre composite is properly set.

5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface.

5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The <b>shell</b> <b>is</b> very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities {{may be influenced by}} factors like ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E
