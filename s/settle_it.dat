5|$|Swedish King John III and Stefan Batory allied against Ivan IV in December 1577, despite {{problems}} caused {{by the death of}} Sigimund which meant that the issue of the substantial inheritance due to John's wife, Catherine had not been resolved. Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia, without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it. The 120,000 daler lent in 1562 had still not been repaid, despite Sigismund's best intentions to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerous Alliance was a {{dominant}} force in WCW. At {{one point during}} 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy Sting. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until {{it was decided to}} <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> in a double ring War Games Match at WrestleWar 1992. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod. This match would be given a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.|$|E

5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761– March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio. Hudson {{was born in}} Branford, Connecticut and lived there until the age four when {{his family moved to}} Goshen, Connecticut. He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E
5|$|Neither party showed any {{inclination}} to back down, {{and the nation}} seemed {{on the brink of}} another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Eagleton died on March 4, 2007, “relieving me of {{the need}} to conceal his identity,” Novak wrote. Some of Eagleton’s former aides were {{reportedly}} angry that Eagleton’s name was attached to a quote that made him appear duplicitous. Asked about the story, Novak acknowledged that disclosing Eagleton’s identity was “a judgment on my part.” If there is any disagreement, Eagleton could <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> with him in heaven “or wherever we end up,” Novak added.|$|E

25|$|The San Patricio {{men were}} deserters in action, and had traitorously joined the enemy army. There was no {{question}} about this, and the punishment for desertion and treason was death. Scott's army was still facing a dangerous enemy and possible insurgency, so he placed the prisoners before courts martial to have them <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> Eisenhower says the men were tried in two groups. The trials were conducted fairly by Brevet Colonel John Garland and by Colonel Bennet Riley. Because all the men captured were wearing Mexican uniforms, they were found guilty and sentenced to hang.|$|E
25|$|Ten years later, on August 25, 1765, {{the land}} that became Tatamagouche was given to British {{military}} mapmaker Colonel Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres by the British Crown. DesBarres was awarded 20,000 acres (81km2) of land in and around Tatamagouche {{on the condition that}} he <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> with 100 Protestants within 10 years. Low land prices in other colonies made attracting tenants difficult, but an offer of six years free rent to dissatisfied residents of Lunenburg was a moderate success (1772). Protestant repopulation also grew considerably {{before the end of the}} century with a flood of Scottish immigrants following the Highland Clearances.|$|E
25|$|Pieter Stuyvesant was {{selected}} to replace Kieft, as Director-General of New Netherland, and arrived on May 11, 1647. Further colonization of the area slowly proceeded. In 1646 a land patent at Konstapel's Hoeck (Constable Hook) was granted to New Amsterdam's chief constable, Jacob Jacobsen Roy, who declined to <b>settle</b> <b>it,</b> and 1647, Maryn Andriansen (who had led the attack at Corlear's Hook) received a land patent (of 169 acres) at Awiehaken (Weehawken). It was incidents farther afield {{that led to the}} area being more seriously settled. In 1654, the Netherlanders lost the colony in northern Brazil known as New Holland to the Portuguese.|$|E

25|$|Bermuda was {{discovered}} in 1503 by Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez. It is mentioned in Legatio Babylonica, published in 1511 by historian Pedro Mártir de Anglería, and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot to take on fresh meat and water. Legends arose of spirits and devils, now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the Bermuda petrel, or cahow) and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs. Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, the archipelago {{became known as the}} Isle of Devils. Neither Spain nor Portugal attempted to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{method used}} in Hereditary Genius has been {{described}} as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as birth order and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not <b>settle</b> <b>it,</b> and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginian {{leadership}} {{probably thought}} Rome had been defeated and invested little manpower in Sicily. With a small force {{and no money}} to hire new troops, Hamilcar’s strategic goal probably was to maintain a stalemate, as he had neither the resources {{to win the war}} nor the authority to peacefully <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> Hamilcar was in command of a mercenary army composed of multiple nationalities and his ability to successfully lead this force demonstrates his skill as field commander. He employed combined arms tactics, like Alexander and Pyrrhus, and his strategy was similar to the one employed by Quintus Fabius Maximus in the Second Punic War, ironically against Hannibal, the eldest son of Hamilcar Barca, in Italy during 217 BC. The difference was that Fabius commanded a numerically superior army to his opponent, had no supply problems, and had room to manoeuvre, while Hamilcar was mostly static, had a far smaller army than the Romans and was dependent on seaborne supplies from Carthage.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Wilder and Chandler had {{intended}} to retain as much of Cain’s original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella would not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not putting more of it into the script. To <b>settle</b> <b>it,</b> Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain’s original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right and, in the end, the movie’s cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain. Chandler also {{did a lot of}} fieldwork while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, he was able to bring a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he hung around Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene where Phyllis and Walter would discreetly meet to plan the murder.|$|E
500|$|On January 10, 1998, Bonds {{married his}} second wife, Liz Watson, at the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton Hotel {{in front of}} 240 guests. The couple lived in Los Altos Hills, California, with their {{daughter}} Aisha during their ten-and-a-half years of marriage before Watson filed for legal separation on June 9, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. On July 21, 2009, just six weeks later, Watson announced that she was withdrawing her Legal Separation action. The couple were reconciled for seven months before Watson formally filed for divorce in Los Angeles on February 26, 2010. On June 6, 2011, Bonds and Watson filed a legal agreement {{not to take the}} divorce to trial and instead <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> in an [...] "uncontested manner", effectively agreeing to take the proceedings {{out of the public eye}} and end the marriage privately at an unspecified later date without further court involvement.|$|E
500|$|During the 1840s, the United States saw a {{dramatic}} increase in pioneers, people who left their homes in the east to settle in Oregon and California. Some, such as Patrick Breen, saw California as a place where they would be free to live in a fully Catholic culture, but many were inspired by the idea of Manifest Destiny, a philosophy which asserted that the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans belonged to European Americans and they should <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> Most wagon trains followed the Oregon Trail route from Independence, Missouri to the Continental Divide, traveling at about [...] a day on a journey that usually took between four and six months.

500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class action suits he said: [...] "It's something I could have settled many times. I could <b>settle</b> <b>it</b> right now for very little money, but I don't {{want to do it}} out of principle." [...] Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|As a {{legislative}} body, the General Court could make proclamations of law as needed. These laws were not formally compiled {{anywhere in the}} early years of the colony; they were first organized and published in the 1636 Book of Laws. The book was reissued in 1658, 1672, and 1685. These laws included the levying of [...] "rates" [...] or taxes and the distribution of colony lands. The General Court established townships as a means of providing local government over settlements, but reserved for itself the right to control specific distribution of land to individuals within those towns. When new land was granted to a freeman, it was directed that only the person to whom the land was granted was allowed to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> It was forbidden for individual settlers to purchase land from Native Americans without formal permission from the General Court. The government recognized the precarious peace that existed with the Wampanoag, and wished to avoid antagonizing them by buying up all of their land.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war, Greeley {{played with}} ideas {{as to how}} to <b>settle</b> <b>it.</b> In 1862, Greeley had {{approached}} the French minister to Washington, Henri Mercier, to discuss a mediated settlement. [...] However, Seward rejected such talks and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at Antietam in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. [...] In fact, the men were in Niagara Falls, Canada to aid Peace Democrats and otherwise undermine the Union war effort. but they played along when Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln's request: the president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had no credentials and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. [...] Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley's credulous conduct, but privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore.|$|E
