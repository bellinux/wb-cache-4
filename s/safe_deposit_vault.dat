40|$|Today in the United States, {{virtually}} every commercial bank makes <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> services {{available for a}} small fee, either through a department of the bank or through a subsidiary or affiliated <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> company. Never before has the demand for <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> services been so great. More than ever before, Americans are turning to <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> companies and bank <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>vaults</b> for the storage of their assets. This increased demand has caused increased concern among legislators and bankers about whether to regulate further the day-to-day affairs of the <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> business. Increased use of <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>vaults</b> and boxes will predictably lead to more litigation concerning the rights and responsibilities of banks and their customers.

My grandfather lived and died a member of the Stock Exchange, honored and well thought of. My father followed in his footsteps. I, too, was there. Without becoming wealthy, the name I bear has become known and respected. Failure, whatever one may say, means a broken life and a broken honor. I sat in my office and I knew that the use of those notes for a few days might save me from disgrace, might keep the name, which my father and grandfather had guarded so jealously, free from shame. I would have paid any price for the use of them. I would have paid with my life, if that had been possible. Think of the risk I ran--the danger I am now in. I deposited those notes on the morrow as security at my bank, and I met all my engagements. The crisis is over! Those notes are in a <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>vault</b> in Chancery Lane!

6000|$|... "His {{name was}} Rudolph Von Behrling," [...] Bellamy announced, [...] "and he was {{actually}} the Chancellor's nephew, also his private secretary. I have told you the history, sir, of those papers. It was Von Behrling who, without a doubt, murdered the American journalist and secured them. It was he who insisted upon coming to London instead of returning with them to Vienna, {{which would have been}} the most obvious course for him to have adopted. He was a pauper, and desperately in love with a certain lady who has helped me throughout this matter. He agreed to part with the papers for twenty thousand pounds, and the lady incidentally promised to elope with him the same night. I met him by appointment at that little restaurant in the city, paid him the twenty thousand pounds, and received the false packet which you remember I brought to you, sir. As a matter of fact, Von Behrling, either by accident or design, and no man now will ever know which, left me with those papers which I was supposed to have bought in his possession, and also the money. Within five minutes he was murdered. Doubtless we shall know sometime by whom, but it was not by Stephen Laverick. Laverick's share in the whole thing was nothing but this--that he found the pocket-book, and that he made use of the notes in his business for twenty-four hours to save himself from ruin. That was unjustifiable, of course. He has made atonement. The notes at this minute are in a <b>safe</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>vault</b> and will be returned intact to the fund from which they came.

His accomplices were his brother, James Dinsio, his nephews Harry and Ronald Barber, his brother-in-law Charles Mulligan, alarm expert Phil Christopher and Charles Broeckel. The Dinsio crew was from Youngstown, Ohio and Christopher and Broeckel were from Cleveland.

He had no skills needed to assist in any other way with the score as he {{was nothing more than a}} petty thief. Charles Broeckel helped inside the vault to bust open safe deposit boxes.
