40|$|Background: Bread is {{the staple}} food of Iranian society. Attention to its health and hygiene is important. Nowadays, {{the use of}} baking soda in the {{production}} of bread has seen by most of bakers which is because of producing bread with more beautiful and appearance and is more public acceptance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study that 40 people were taken, consumer satisfaction of prepared Barbari bread using three types additives Fenugreek juice, baking soda, and tomato juice by means of questionnaires were evaluated. Results: The results of this study showed that consumer satisfaction of taste and smell (34 of 40), appearance, <b>glazing,</b> and <b>quality</b> (36 of 40) of prepared bread by tomato juice was more than Fenugreek juice and baking soda. Consumer satisfaction of taste, smell, appearance, <b>glazing,</b> <b>quality,</b> shopping satisfaction, and quality of bread over time of three types of additives (baking soda, tomato juice, and Fenugreek juice) was significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Tomato juice has the attributes necessary for public acceptance and satisfaction of consumers, nevertheless don’t have the complications of baking soda. So it can be a reasonable alternative for the processing of bread dough instead of baking soda...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of glazes on clay-based ceramic products {{has been identified}} {{as one of the best}} form of ceramic decorations. This can be attributed to its characteristic to lend aesthetic value to ceramic products and also to render them more durable, useful and hygienic. This paper reports an investigation on the development of new ceramic glaze recipes by means of <b>selected</b> <b>glaze</b> software packages using locally available raw materials in Nigeria. For the achievement of this study, survey methods, material oxide analysis, as well as kiln firings have been used. The results established the possibility of using existing glaze software in Nigeria so as to derive new recipes from old ones by using local material analyses database. The study indicates that with recent technological solutions, local raw materials can be properly identified and maximally utilized for a nation’s industrial development and sustainable economic growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend for}} modern {{buildings}} {{to be designed}} with large glazing areas in the exterior envelope is becoming more popular than ever before. At the same time, the power utilities in most of Kuwait demand code compliance through targeting of peak electric requirements for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The lack of detailed and accurate information on the thermal performance of glazing systems coupled with limits set by the code of practice can result in bad building design with respect to indoor comfort conditions. This paper presents a methodology for <b>selecting</b> <b>glazing</b> areas, while keeping the peak-load demand fixed.

40|$|The paper {{shows how}} to {{determine}} dimensions of stationary horizontal (canopies) and vertical (ribs) shading devices {{in order to}} prevent penetration of normal beam solar radiation into the buildings during warm season of the year. While analyzing formulae for insolation rate equations for determination of dimensions of canopies and ribs which are perpendicular and inclined to the plane of intensively irradiated fenestrations orientated to the South, South-East, South-West, East and West have been obtained in the paper. Sloping canopies have the smallest dimensions. What is more, an angle of slope with regard to opening plane must correspond to elevation of sun station at an hour when there is a maximum specific heat flow rate of normal beam solar radiation. The paper considers an influence of canopies and ribs on transmission of diffuse solar radiation which along with normal beam solar radiation serves for creation of natural illumination. As follows from the analysis of formulae it is possible to make a conclusion about an inefficiency of vertical shading elements due to large rib dimensions and decrease in transmission of diffuse solar radiation. Minimum distances from fenestration reveal to the canopy have been determined for various orientations proceeding from the position that the opening must be maximally illuminated by normal beam solar radiation during the cold season of a year in order to reduce heat inputs for building heating. On the basis of dependence analysis we have come to a conclusion that it is appropriate to design stationary shading devices for fenestrations orientated only to the South and they must be sloping canopies. It is necessary to <b>select</b> <b>glazing</b> with a small index of solar factor for openings orientated to other corners of the Earth and reduction of solar radiation heat inputs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The conference {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} a recent collaboration between artist printmaker Tracy Hill and ceramic researcher Dr Alasdair Bremner. The {{aim was to}} create large format 3 D relief prints that retained a print quality, yet were rendered in a durable material. The presentation will discuss the compromises and opportunities that developed from the cross-disciplinary activity. Tracy has been developing a way of translating the marks from etched metal plates and silkscreen images {{onto the surface of}} cast plaster. The direct interaction with this surface and the relationship which resulted between the oil based ink of the etched plate and the surface layer of the water based ink laid down by the silk screen, offered many potential combinations, creating a versatile and unique medium that was printed, yet retained a relief surface. The disadvantage of this process was the fragility of the resulting works. A potential solution was to translate the process into ceramic. Alasdair’s research using castable refractory concrete to create large format architectural ceramics presented a way to achieve pieces that would have the scale and durability that was required. This industrial technology offers the opportunity to achieve the creation of objects that do not conform to some of the traditional limitations of conventional clay yet can make use of a range of ceramic surface treatments. The challenge of the project was to translate the techniques that Tracy had developed for use in plaster to refractory concrete material, combining the print <b>quality</b> with ceramic <b>glaze</b> <b>qualities.</b> They will discuss the processes developed and highlight the advantages print making in refractory concrete can offer in terms of the interaction of glaze and oxide; the scales possible and finally the durability and permanency.

40|$|Architects and {{designers}} could readily use {{a quick and}} easy tool to determine the solar heat gains of their <b>selected</b> <b>glazing</b> systems for particular orientations, tilts and climate data. Speedy results under variable solar angles and degree of irradiance would be welcomed by most. Furthermore, a newly proposed program should utilise the outputs of existing glazing tools and their standard information, {{such as the use}} of U-values and Solar Heat Gain Coefficients (SHGC’s) as generated for numerous glazing configurations by the well-known program WINDOW 6. 0 (LBNL, 2001). The results of this tool provide interior glass surface temperature and transmitted solar radiation which link into comfort analysis inputs required by the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool –V 2 (ASHRAE, 2011). This tool is a simple-to-use calculator providing the total solar heat gain of a glazing system exposed to various angles of solar incidence. Given basic climate (solar) data, as well as the orientation of the glazing under consideration the solar heat gain can be calculated. The calculation incorporates the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient function produced for the glazing system under various angles of solar incidence WINDOW 6. 0 (LBNL, 2001). The significance of this work rests in providing an orientation-based heat transfer calculator through an easy-to-use tool (using Microsoft EXCEL) for user inputs of climate and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (WINDOW- 6) data. We address the factors to be considered such as solar position and the incident angles to the horizontal and the window surface, and the fact that the solar heat gain coefficient is a function of the angle of incidence. We also discuss the effect of the diffuse components of radiation from the sky and those from ground surface reflection, which require refinement of the calculation methods. The calculator is implemented in an Excel workbook allowing the user to input a dataset and immediately produce the resulting solar gain. We compare this calculated total solar heat gain with measurements from a test facility described elsewhere in this conference (Luther et. al., 2012) ...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{benefiting from}} a {{glasshouse}} {{to create a}} local microclimate between two buildings is not new, around 1985 such a multi-occupancy block was built in Hagsätra, {{in the south of}} Stockholm. Four buildings were constructed around a glazed courtyard which acts as a large solar collector. It is clear that in comparison with conventional buildings, glazing gives more temperate space “for the same price”. The idea is that a glass building offers an indoor quality that can be profited for having a comfortable space enjoyable by people throughout the year. The energy required for conditioning it depends on the activity that wants to be performed inside. In this thesis, a glass structure consisting of a roof and two frontal façades was simulated using the simulation programme DesignBuilder 3. 0. 0. 105. The model is based on a real proposal for covering the space between two existing buildings in KTH main campus. Different possibilities concerning the indoor climate related to the activity that wants to be set in it have been simulated. The selected option has no mechanical ventilation and no supply of cooling since it is provided of a natural ventilation system designed for evacuating the warm air when the microclimate reaches temperatures above the comfort level. A heating system has been installed to maintain the indoor temperature to a minimum of 5 oC. The results showed that when <b>selecting</b> the <b>glazing</b> of the microclimate special attention has to be put to the g-value.

The external shading devices included a permanent horizontal overhang and a light shelf. The <b>selected</b> types of <b>glazing</b> included clear, reflective, tinted, low-emissivity coating, and heat-mirror glass. One concern about using external window attachments is that while reducing the solar heat gains, they also {{reduce the amount of}} the daylight needed to supplement interior lighting. Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} explore which strategy would give a balance between solar heat gain reduction and daylight utilization and result in the most energy savings in the building. Computer simulations using an hourly energy calculation model were conducted to predict the building's total energy consumption using each strategy. The economics of each strategy were analyzed with lifecycle costing techniques using the present value technique. Results show that properly designed overhangs that shade clear glazing are slightly more cost-effective than specialized low-e glazing systems. These results are unique for hot humid climates where winter heating is not an issue. On the contrary, when used in cold climates, external shading devices tend to increase the building's energy consumption...|$|R

The facility only operates during warmer months due to its high heating costs {{as a result of}} its energetic inefficiency. In addition, the building is protected due to having cultural heritage and therefore, some limitations about renovation measures must be considered. Relevant legislation in the energy sector is presented, the restrictions that apply due to its cultural heritage protection, and the proposals based on pre-made studies of the building. The current state is also analysed, its energy balance, calculation of insolation and adequacy of building's envelope. It was assessed that the current situation exceeds the criteria given in Rules on efficient use of energy in buildings five times over. Based on the limitations of cultural heritage, protection proposals are given that would be feasible. The present proposals are: replacing windows, additional roof insulation, and replacement of energy source for heating with a wood chip furnace or heat pump water. These suggestions are taken into account in the assessment of the energy balance of the building and compared with each other. At the end of the thesis, it is suggested which of the pending proposals would be most effective, namely the simultaneous replacement of windows by <b>selecting</b> the appropriate <b>glazing,</b> additional roof insulation, and replacing energy source for heating with biomass.

It {{is often a}} dominant species and influences environmental and ecological systems. Cladophora is a biological material with great development potential due mainly to its significant biomass and {{the ease with which}} it can be harvested. Furthermore, because it can live on various carriers or vectors, the growth conditions of Cladophora can affect the group to which it belongs. To investigate the growth of the Cladophora group in the natural environment, this study endeavored to (1) observe the biomass accumulation of Cladophora glomerata on varying substrates, (2) determine whether substrate roughness has an impact on the attachment of C. glomerata, and (3) identify the relationship between the attachment of pioneer diatoms and C. glomerata. Five types of substrate were <b>selected</b> (glass slide, <b>glazed</b> tile, marble, unglazed tile, and wood) and placed in the natural habitat of C. glomerata, a sub-tropical river. After thirty days, unglazed tile produced the largest biomass of 2332. 2 dry weight mg/m 2, followed by wood (1744. 3 dry weight mg/m 2), marble (158. 1 dry weight mg/m 2), glass slide (90. 7 dry weight mg/m 2), and glazed tile(36. 3 dry weight mg/m 2). The results {{of this study indicate that}} the type and roughness of the substrate both influence the attachment of C. glomerata and the subsequent development of its population. The existence of biofilm formed by pioneer diatoms on the substrate is also beneficial to the epiphytic growth of C. glomerata.

As soluÃÃes de glazeamento contendo Ãleos vegetais foram: Ãleo de algodÃo/Ãgua, Ãleo de canola/Ãgua, Ãleo de girassol/Ãgua; Ãleo de milho/Ãgua e Ãleo de soja/Ãgua. As soluÃÃes de glazeamento contendo vegetais em pÃ foram: brÃcolis em pÃ/Ãgua; espinafre em pÃ/Ãgua; palmito em pÃ/Ãgua e tomate em pÃ/Ãgua. As soluÃÃes de glazeamento contendo subprodutos (cascas) de processamento de frutas foram: subproduto de abacaxi/polpa de abacaxi; subproduto de caju/polpa de caju; subproduto de goiaba/polpa de goiaba e subproduto de manga/polpa de manga. Cada uma destas soluÃÃes foi desenvolvida atravÃs de um Delineamento Composto Central Rotacional (DCCR) totalizando 11 ensaios, com trÃs repetiÃÃes no ponto central. A metodologia estatÃstica aplicada consistiu em anÃlise descritiva dos dados, testes de normalidade, anÃlise de variÃncia (ANOVA) e nÃo-paramÃtrica, teste de mÃdia Tukey, anÃlise de regressÃo mÃltipla, anÃlise de correlaÃÃo e superfÃcies de resposta. Os efeitos do perÃodo de estocagem congelada (0, 15, 30, 45 e 60 dias) foram avaliados sobre os parÃmetros fÃsicos de qualidade das massas. Para as soluÃÃes contendo Ãleos vegetais e Ãgua verificou-se que o maior volume obtido foi pela soluÃÃo de Ãleo de algodÃo e Ãgua com 4, 23 mL/g, seguido da soluÃÃo com Ãleo de milho/Ãgua (4, 03 mL/g). Atribuiu-se a menor viscosidade destes Ãleos a nÃo-formaÃÃo de pelÃcula externa Ã massa, nÃo prejudicando as transferÃncias de calor e massa durante a fermentaÃÃo e forneamento. O Ãndice de expansÃo foi {{superior}} a 2, 00 para todas as soluÃÃes com exceÃÃo das compostas por Ãleo de canola/Ãgua e Ãleo de girassol/Ãgua. Com relaÃÃo Ãs soluÃÃes contendo vegetais em pÃ e Ãgua, observou-se que os volumes especÃficos, de modo geral, foram superiores aos obtidos pelas soluÃÃes adicionadas de Ãleo. Os vegetais em pÃ podem fornecer micronutrientes para as leveduras e melhorar o processo fermentativo, resultado devido ao maior nÃmero de alvÃolos apresentado, tendo obtido valores acima de 1. 000 alvÃolos para todos os vegetais, exceto o palmito, portanto, apresentaram miolos com boa porosidade. Verificou-se que as soluÃÃes de glazeamento contendo subprodutos e polpa de frutas promoveram os menores volumes especÃficos para os pÃes, onde nenhum ensaio apresentou valores maiores que 4, 00 mL/g. Este resultado pode estar relacionado com o pH Ãcido das frutas e a presenÃa de enzimas proteolÃticas que podem danificar a estrutura do glÃten, reduzindo a capacidade de retenÃÃo gasosa ou prejudicar a atividade das leveduras. AtravÃs das superfÃcies de resposta e modelos matemÃticos gerados foi possÃvel selecionar duas soluÃÃes de glazeamento para cada tratamento, totalizando 26 soluÃÃes que foram utilizadas em massas congeladas por atÃ 60 dias, onde foi avaliado o seu potencial para a manutenÃÃo da qualidade. Verificou-se que a estocagem congelada das massas reduziu o volume especÃfico, Ãndice e fator de expansÃo, pH, umidade total e volume produzido. Entretanto, as soluÃÃes de glazeamento, de modo geral, promoveram a reduÃÃo no descrÃscimo da qualidade ao longo do tempo de estocagem, quando comparados Ãs massas controle, ausentes da aplicaÃÃo das soluÃÃes de glazeamento. A aplicaÃÃo de soluÃÃes de glazeamento em massas congeladas para a produÃÃo de pÃes tipo forma, portanto, consiste em uma tecnologia que pode ser utilizada em processos industriais pois demonstrou eficÃcia na manutenÃÃo da qualidade das massas apÃs 60 dias de estocagem congelada, alÃm poder contribuir para a melhoria da qualidade nutricional dos produtos. The glazing {{technique is}} used in bakery products and confectionery, {{in order to promote}} the improvement of the external characteristics of the product. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop composite glazing solutions of unconventional raw materials like vegetable oils, powdered vegetables and by-products of fruit processing through statistical tool Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) and study the process of getting the bread through the frozen dough technology evaluating the effect of storage for 60 days in the quality of breads parameters. The glaze solutions containing vegetable oils are: cottonseed oil/water, canola oil/water, sunflower oil/water; corn oil/water and soy oil/water. The glaze solutions containing powdered vegetables were broccoli powder/water; Spinach powder/water; palmito powder/water and tomato powder/water. The glazing solutions containing fruit processing by-products were byproduct of pineapple/pineapple pulp; byproduct of cashew/pulp cashew; Guava byproduct/guava pulp and byproduct mango/mango pulp. Each of these solutions was developed through a CCRD total of 11 samples with three replications at the center point. The applied statistical methodology consisted of descriptive data analysis, normality tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and nonparametric, average Tukey test, multiple regression analysis, correlation analysis and response surfaces, we used these tests to check the effect of different glazing solutions on the quality of physical parameters - specific volume, density, expansion factor of the dough, expansion index of breads, volume produced during fermentation, number and circularity of alveoli - to establish the conditions great to hold each of the study with frozen dough. The effects of frozen storage time (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days) were evaluated by the aforementioned parameters, and the total water content of the dough, acidity and pH. For solutions containing vegetable oils and water has been found that the greater volume was obtained by cotton seed oil and water solution with 4. 23 mL/ g, followed by the solution of corn oil/water (4. 03 mL/g) This result is related to the lower viscosity of these oils, attributing to non-formation of outer film to the dough and does not impair the heat and mass transfer during fermentation and baking. The expansion ratio was greater than 2. 00 for all solutions except those consisting of canola oil/water and sunflower oil/water. With respect to solutions containing vegetable powder and water, it was observed that the specific volumes generally were higher than those obtained by the added oil solutions. In this case, the vegetable powder can provide micronutrients for the yeast and improve the fermentation process, results related to the higher number of wells shown (above 1000 for all vegetables except palmito) therefore presents brains with good porosity. It was found that the glazing solutions containing by-products and fruit pulp promoted, generally smaller specific volumes for the loaves, where no test showed values above 4. 00 mL/g, this result may be related to the pH acid fruits and the presence of proteolytic enzymes that can damage the gluten structure and, consequently, reduce the gas retaining capacity, or impair the activity of the yeast. Therefore, before the results, we <b>selected</b> two <b>glazing</b> solutions for each treatment, totaling 26 glazing solutions to be used in frozen dough for up to 60 days and evaluate its potential as a quality preserving agent. Through the response surface and mathematical models generated it was possible to <b>select</b> two <b>glazing</b> solutions for each treatment, totaling 26 solutions that were used in frozen dough for up to 60 days, which was evaluated its potential as a quality preserving agent. It was found that frozen storage of the dough reduced the specific volume, expansion index, expansion factor pH, moisture and volume produced. However, the glazing solutions generally have promoted the reduction in the quality descrÃscimo over storage time, when compared to mass control, absent the application of glazing solutions. Application of glazing solutions frozen dough for producing bread-like form thus consists of a technology that can be used in industrial processes as it has demonstrated its effectiveness in maintaining the quality of the pasta after 60 days of frozen storage, in addition to contribute to improving the nutritional quality of products...|$|R

Some of the fragments belonged to more sophisticated forms. Two originated from a vessel (or vessels) with a highly rounded body, decorated with conical knobs which, however, were considerably larger and more loosely spaced than those described above. Another three fragments came from a pedestalled beaker, or perhaps a beaker with a separated foot. The vessel had thin wall covered on both sides with highly decorative glaze light-green in colour with a brownish tinge. The impression is emphasised by single dark knobs with granulated surfaces resembling blackberry fruits attached at or near the level of narrow bands of dark-brown glaze running around the vessel body. Most of the fragments described above find no direct analogies in the stoneware finds from Poland, which represent either the Rhine workshops or {{what is known as the}} Falke group. A connection with the latter can only be indicated in the case of the forms decorated with knobs. The fragment with leaf-like imprints most likely originates from a Celje type beaker - a vessel type manufactured in Carinthia during the 15 th century - while the largest group of sherds, whose ornamentation was executed with a roulette, are probably the work of Moravian workshops, although variants identical with the Muszyna finds have not been confirmed there. As regards the vessel decorated with “blackberry fruits” no analogy has yet been found. Several possible interpretations can be proposed: the vessel could either be a German import, the product of Moravian workshops, or a unique product of the workshops which operated in Buda during the time of Matthias Corvinus and which produced exquisite pottery (including maiolica) for the royal court. The pottery fragments in question were discovered in the deposits pre-dating the Hungarian siege of 1474 as well as in those chronologically corresponding to it, from where the most spectacular fragments were recovered. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that they found their way to Muszyna with Hungarian troops that, probably being commanded by King Matthias Corvinus himself, captured the castle in January 1474. In the light of this assumption, there is a distinct possibility that the discussed vessels may have been used by the king himself...|$|R
