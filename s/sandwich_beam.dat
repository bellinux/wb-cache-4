Based on the superposition principle, {{a new model}} is established for predicting the indentation response of <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams.</b> It {{should be pointed out}} that this model does not need to calculate the strain energy stored in the structure, which is usually difficult to be determined. For traditional foam <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> and foam <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> reinforced by fiber columns, the analytical predictions of indentation behaviors well agree with experimental measures. Furthermore, the analytical solution of indentation response of foam sandwich plate reinforced by fiber columns is derived by the principle of minimum energy and is compared well with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|This study {{involved}} experimental investigation onto the flexural behaviour of glue-laminated fibre composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> {{with a view}} of using this material for structural <b>beams.</b> Composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> with 1, 2, 3, and 4 composite sandwich panels glued together were subjected to 4 -point static bending test in the flatwise and edgewise positions to evaluate their stiffness and strength properties. The results showed that the composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> in the edgewise position failed with 25 % higher bending strength but have 7 % lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. The results however indicated that the bending stiffness of flatwise specimens converges to that of the edgewise specimens with increasing laminations. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to debonding between the skin and core. Wrapping the glue-laminated <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> with one layer of tri-axial glass fibres did not prove to be effective. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the glue-laminated <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> exhibited better performance than the individual composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

In the finite element method, a quarter and a half models of the specimens were analyzed.

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of the core material is a critical parameter and is an important consideration when designing a composite sandwich structure in construction application. In this paper, the shear behaviour {{of a new generation}} composite sandwich panel made up of glass fibre composite skins and phenolic core was investigated under three-point loading short beam (SB) and asymmetrical beam shear (ABS) tests.

50|$|<b>Sandwich</b> <b>beam,</b> plate, {{and shell}} {{theories}} usually {{assume that the}} reference stress state is one of zero stress. However, during curing, differences of temperature between the face-sheets persist because of the thermal separation by the core material.

If the bending is constrained during the manufacturing process, residual stresses can develop in the components of a sandwich composite. The superposition of a reference stress state on the solutions provided by sandwich theory is possible when the problem is linear. However, when large elastic deformations and rotations are expected, the initial stress state has to be incorporated directly into the sandwich theory.|$|E

The effect of the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the shear strength and failure behaviour of glued <b>sandwich</b> <b>beams</b> is examined using an asymmetrical beam shear test.
