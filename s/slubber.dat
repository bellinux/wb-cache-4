60|$|The days grow gray. The sun {{has lost}} its warmth, and each noon, at meridian, it is lower in the {{northern}} sky. All the old stars have long since gone, and it would seem the sun is following them. The world--the only world I know--has been left behind far there to the north, and the hill of the earth is between it and us. This sad and solitary ocean, gray and cold, {{is the end of}} all things, the falling-off place where all things cease. Only it grows colder, and grayer, and penguins cry in the night, and huge amphibians moan and <b>slubber,</b> and great albatrosses, gray with storm-battling of the Horn, wheel and veer.|$|E
60|$|The elderly steward was not {{satisfied}} with the mere spears. While the rescued Kwaque continued to moan and <b>slubber</b> thankfulness at his feet, he proceeded to strip them that were naked. Nothing they wore in the way of clothing, but from around each of their necks he removed a necklace of porpoise teeth that was worth a gold sovereign in mere exchange value. From the kinky locks of one of the naked young men he drew a hand-carved, fine-toothed comb, the lofty back of which was inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which he later sold in Sydney to a curio shop for eight shillings. Nose and ear ornaments of bone and turtle-shell he also rifled, as well as a chest-crescent of pearl shell, fourteen inches across, worth fifteen shillings anywhere. The two spears ultimately fetched him five shillings each from the tourists at Port Moresby. Not lightly may a ship steward undertake to maintain a six-quart reputation.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of the assistant manager, Bill Crank, the Winstanleys, authors of the book cited below, visited May Mill in September 1980. They said: Although we expected to see some old spinning machines, we were very surprised to find so many still in use; in fact, {{there was very little}} new machinery. Many of the machines were pre-1920, and some dated to about the turn of the century. <b>Slubber</b> and drawing frames were said {{to be part of the}} original May Mill equipment These were made in 1902 by Howard & Bullough of Accrington. Numerous carding frames by Platt Brothers of Oldham were dated 1905, 1907 and 1920, but some of these had been converted to suit Courtauld's needs. Fly frames, also made by Howard & Bullough, were dated 1915. The scutchers made by Platt Brothers, were built in 1921 and 1924. Cone winders by Geo. Hattersley were made about 1950. Perhaps the most modern machines were ring spinning frames, dated 1967.|$|E
60|$|Back {{on board}} his {{schooner}} and dozing in a deck chair under a three-months-old magazine, David Grief was aroused by a sobbing, <b>slubbering</b> noise from overside. He opened his eyes. From the Chilian cruiser, {{a quarter of}} a mile away, came the stroke of eight bells. It was midnight. From overside came a splash and another <b>slubbering</b> noise. To him it seemed half amphibian, half the sounds of a man crying to himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{a sudden}} we heard Jehan at the {{stairway}} wake, but a boy pushed past him, and stood before us, the hall rushes in his hair, all <b>slubbered</b> with sleep. [...] "My father! My father! I dreamed of treachery," [...] he cried, and babbled thickly.|$|R
60|$|A jump took David Grief {{to the low}} rail. Beneath, centred {{about the}} <b>slubbering</b> noise, was an area of {{agitated}} phosphorescence. Leaning over, he locked his hand under the armpit of a man, and, with pull and heave and quick-changing grips, he drew on deck the naked form of Aloysius Pankburn.|$|R
5000|$|Bullock {{served as}} a {{corporal}} in the Football Battalion during the First World War. He {{was wounded in the}} shoulder during the Battle of the Somme in 1916, in the region of Delville Wood and Guillemont and was injured in the knee after an accident in 1918. After his retirement from football in 1922, Bullock became landlord of the <b>Slubber's</b> Arms pub in Huddersfield. He died of ammonia poisoning in November 1922, having been suffering [...] "nerve troubles" [...] during the month preceding his death.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew more}} of the {{language}} of crocodiles than did any man. He had better means and opportunities of knowing. He knew their many noises that were as grunts and <b>slubbers.</b> He knew their anger noises, their fear noises, their food noises, their love noises. And these noises were as definitely words in his vocabulary as are words in a human's vocabulary. And these crocodile noises were tools of thought. By them he weighed and judged and determined his own consequent courses of action, just like any human; or, just like any human, lazily resolved upon no course of action, but merely noted and registered a clear comprehension of something that was going on about him that did not require a correspondence of action on his part.|$|R
5000|$|In 1834 Norris, Sykes and Fisher {{participated in}} {{the report of the}} Factories Commissioners into the Employment of Children in Factories, and as to the Propriety and Means of Curtailing their Labour. According to the answers given by the firm to the Commissioners, the firm had {{commenced}} manufacture of woollen cloth in 1824, using water power driven by the river Wessenden. They employed a number of children in the mill, some below ten years of age. Boys and girls under ten were paid 3 shillings a week, about half what an adult might receive, and were [...] "employed in piecing for <b>slubbers</b> and mules, and feeding scribbling and carding machines". A regular working week for all workers was sixty nine and a half hours, with days off on Sunday, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and [...] "about six other half days during the year".|$|R
60|$|As to {{the grand}} objection, which this writer <b>slubbers</b> over in so {{careless}} a manner, because indeed {{it was impossible to}} find a satisfactory answer, I mean the knavery of our woollen manufacturers in general, I shall relate some facts, which I had more opportunities to observe than usually fall in the way of men who are not of the trade. For some years, the masters and wardens, with many of their principal workmen and shopkeepers, came often to the Deanery to relate their grievances, and to desire my advice as well as my assistance. What reasons might move them to this proceeding, I leave to public conjecture. The truth is, that the woollen manufacture of this kingdom sate always nearest my heart. But the greatest difficulty lay in these perpetual differences between the shopkeepers and workmen they employed. Ten or a dozen of these latter often came to the Deanery with their complaints, which I often repeated to the shopkeepers. As, that they brought their prices too low for a poor weaver to get his bread by; and instead of ready money for their labour on Saturdays, they gave them only such a quantity of cloth or stuff, at the highest rate, which the poor men were often forced to sell one-third below the rate, to supply their urgent necessities. On the other side, the shopkeepers complained of idleness, and want of skill, or care, or honesty, in their workmen; and probably their accusations on both sides were just.|$|R
60|$|The {{hatch to}} the engine room was battened down, access being gained through a narrow passage from the cabin. The heat and gas fumes were stifling. Grief took one hasty, {{comprehensive}} examination of the engine and the fittings of the tiny room, then blew out the oil-lamp. After that he worked in darkness, save for the glow from endless cigars which {{he went into the}} cabin to light. Even-tempered as he was, he soon began to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a mechanical monster that toiled, and sobbed, and <b>slubbered</b> in the shouting dark. Naked to the waist, covered with grease and oil, bruised and skinned from being knocked about by the plunging, jumping vessel, his head swimming from the mixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe, he laboured on hour after hour, in turns petting, blessing, nursing, and cursing the engine and all its parts. The ignition began to go bad. The feed grew worse. And worst of all, the cylinders began to heat. In a consultation held in the cabin the half-caste engineer begged and pleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and to attend to the water circulation. Captain Warfield was against any stopping. The half-caste swore that the engine would ruin itself and stop anyway and for good. Grief, with glaring eyes, greasy and battered, yelled and cursed them both down and issued commands. Mulhall, the supercargo, and Hermann were set to work in the cabin at double-straining and triple-straining the gasoline. A hole was chopped through the engine room floor, and a Kanaka heaved bilge-water over the cylinders, while Grief continued to souse running parts in oil.|$|R
