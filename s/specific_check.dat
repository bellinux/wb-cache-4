The Super NES version requires a set amount of enemies to be destroyed before entry to the next area is granted. Both versions have a time limit that expires if the player takes too long, whereupon the character Elsie-Dee automatically finds Wolverine and kills him, wasting one of his five lives (Genesis version) or giving the player a game over (Super NES version). Both games feature a password function that enables the player to continue the game at any level. Both games give Wolverine a percentage of his available health, always starting at 100%. Upon taking damage, his energy will recover overtime thanks to his mutant healing factor.

40|$|Abstract—Today many {{developers}} use the Java components {{collected from}} the Internet as external LIBs to design and develop their own software. However, some unknown security bugs may exist in these components, such as SQL injection bug may comes from the components which have no <b>specific</b> <b>check</b> for the input string by users. To check these bugs out is very difficult without source code. So a novel method to check the bugs in Java bytecode based on points-to dataflow analysis is in need, which is different to the common analysis techniques base on the vulnerability pattern check. It {{can be used as}} an assistant tool for security analysis of Java bytecode from unknown softwares which will be used as extern LIBs.

40|$|In component-based systems, {{there are}} several {{obstacles}} to using Design by Contract (DbC), {{particularly with respect to}} third-party components. Contracts are particularly valuable when debugging or testing composite software structures that include third-party components. However, existing approaches have critical weaknesses. First, existing approaches typically require a component’s source code to be available if you wish to strip (or re-insert) checks. Second, documentation of the contract is either distributed separately from the component or embedded in the component’s source code. Third, enabling and disabling <b>specific</b> kinds of <b>checks</b> on separate components from independent vendors can be a significant challenge. This paper describes an approach to representing contracts for. NET components using attributes. This contract information can be retrieved from the compiled component’s metadata and used for many purposes. The paper also describes nContract, a tool that automatically generates run-time checks from embedded contracts. Such run-time checks can be generated and added to a system without requiring source code access or recompilation. Further, when checks for a given component are excluded, they impose no run-time overhead. Finally, a highly expressive, fine-grained mechanism for controlling user preferences about which <b>specific</b> <b>checks</b> are enabled or disabled is presented...|$|R

40|$|The Reproducing Kernel Element Method (RKEM) is {{a hybrid}} between finite {{elements}} and meshfree methods that provides shape functions of arbitrary order and continuity yet retains the Kronecker-delta property. To achieve these properties, the underlying mesh must meet certain regularity constraints, unique to RKEM. The {{aim of this}} dissertation {{is to develop a}} precise definition of these constraints, and a general algorithm for assessing a mesh is developed. This check is a critical step in the use of RKEM in any application. The general checking algorithm is made more specific to apply to two-dimensional triangular meshes with circular supports and to three-dimensional tetrahedral meshes with spherical supports. The checking algorithm features the output of the uncovered regions that are used to develop a mesh-mending technique for fixing offending meshes. The <b>specific</b> <b>check</b> is used in conjunction with standard quality meshing techniques to produce meshes suitable for use with RKEM. The RKEM quasi-uniformity definitions enable the use of RKEM in solving Galerkin weak forms as well as in general interpolation applications, such as the representation of geometries. A procedure for determining a RKEM representation of discrete point sets is presented with results for surfaces in three-dimensions. This capability is important to the analysis of geometries such as patient-specific organs or other biological objects...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} and availability of the Dutch storm surge barriers are calculated by probabilistic risk assessment and various underlying risk analysis methods. These calculations, however, focus on the numerical probability of the storm surge barrier functioning adequately, and {{the implementation of the}} many constraints from the risk analysis is merely an implicit factor. This includes constraints varying between whether the set repair times are feasible and whether the organization is capable of managing the asset adequately. Thus, the resulting {{reliability and}} availability figures should be validated, verifying the checks and balances on the behavior of the asset manager in terms of the performance of the maintenance and operational processes, but also the quality and knowledgeability of the maintenance and operational teams, among other checkpoints. In other words, the conformability of the organization should be verified during the performance assessment, in order to validate the risk analysis. Within Rijkswaterstaat, and for specific use at the storm surge barriers, a tool has been developed for an internal audit on the resilience of both the organization and the constraints following from the risk analysis – the compass. This paper focusses on the approach Rijkswaterstaat has chosen for the review of the validity of a risk analysis, including the adaptation of ISO and auditing standards, <b>specific</b> <b>check</b> points on risk analysis matters and the self-auditing regime that Rijkswaterstaat proposes for the storm surge barriers and their performance analysi...|$|E

The paper starts with a brief introduction of the Belgian federal state and concludes with some thoughts for future developments. ...|$|R
