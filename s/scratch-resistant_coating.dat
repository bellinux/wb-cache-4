50|$|While Blu-ray {{mandates}} {{the use of}} a <b>scratch-resistant</b> <b>coating,</b> it {{does not}} specify what coating is used, and both Sony and Panasonic have their own independent hard coating technologies that are primarily in use on Blu-ray pre-recorded discs.|$|E
5000|$|The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman is an Android {{smartphone}} from Sony Ericsson. It is a music-focused {{smart phone}} running Android 2.3 (Gingerbread customized with Sony Ericsson's four-corner UI), {{powered by a}} 1 GHz processor. The screen is 3.2" [...] TFT with HVGA resolution and <b>scratch-resistant</b> <b>coating.</b> The phone measures 56.5 x 106 x 14.2 mm and weighs 115g, making it slightly taller and heavier than the Xperia mini but its specs are similar.|$|E
50|$|An {{anti-scratch}} or <b>scratch-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> {{is a film}} or coating {{that can}} be applied to optical surfaces, such as the faces of a lens or photographic film. The coating does not interfere with how the lens functions and does not affect vision, but creates a permanent bond with the lens that reduces the appearance of hairline scratches which is common to eyeglass lenses. Though an anti-scratch coating is not 100% scratch-proof, it helps to prevent minor scratches that can easily happen to a regular lens. These minor scratches can damage the surface of the lens and impair vision. An anti-scratch coating acts as a protective layer thus making the lenses more durable and safe.|$|E
5000|$|NGC {{has used}} EdgeViewÂ® Holders since 2007 for the [...] Presidential Dollar series {{and for all}} other coins since 2008. Since 2009, a <b>scratch-resistant</b> holder <b>coating,</b> {{similar to that used}} on eyeglass lenses, has been employed. NGC offers Oversize holders for coins larger than 45 mm. NGC's label lists a coin's denomination, variety, grade, pedigree, serial number, and other info.|$|R
50|$|Since the Blu-ray Disc {{data layer}} {{is closer to}} the surface of the disc {{compared}} to the DVD standard, it was more vulnerable to scratches in early designs. The first discs were therefore housed in cartridges for protection, resembling Professional Discs introduced by Sony in 2003. Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium, so designers chose hard-coating of the pickup surface instead. TDK was the first company to develop a working scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs, naming it Durabis. In addition, both Sony's and Panasonic's replication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's rewritable media are spin-coated, using a <b>scratch-resistant</b> and antistatic <b>coating.</b> Verbatim's recordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary technology, called Hard Coat.|$|R
40|$|DE 19838826 A UPAB: 20000516 NOVELTY - An optical component, with a {{transparent}} <b>scratch-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> comprising an interference layer system of adhesion promoting and diamond-like carbon layers, is new.

The silicon organic compounds without further compounds or with further compounds {{are used as}} precursor for the plasma. The plastic substrate is arranged in the high-frequency plasma polymerization reactor, {{so that it is}} present between a zone in which the plasma is formed and a cathode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises optionally cleaning a plastic substrate surface to be coated using plasma, and coating the cleaned substrate surface in a high-frequency plasma polymerization reactor by plasma polymerization. The silicon organic compounds without further compounds or with further compounds are used as precursor for the plasma. The plastic substrate is arranged in the high-frequency plasma polymerization reactor, so that it is present between a zone in which the plasma is formed and a cathode. The coating produced by the process has a breaking elongation of greater than or equal to 2. 5 %, a yellow index of less than or equal to 2. 5 determined according to ASTM D, and a hardness of 3. 1 - 6 GPa to be measured by nanoindentation. The coating produced by the process contains carbon portion (7 - 28 atomic%) that is determined by measuring using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and is related to the total number of carbon-, silicon- and oxygen atoms contained in the coating, and has a pencil hardness of 4 H or high. The plastic substrate is partially transparent or transparent in the region of the visible light, and is a film and/or thermoplast, elastomer or thermoplastic elastomer. The oxygen is supplied to the plasma in the coating step. All materials supplied to the plasma are in gaseous form before entering into the plasma polymerization reactor, where a ratio of the gas flow of oxygen and further precursors supplied to the plasma is 3 : 1 - 5 : 1. The precursors are hexamethyldisiloxane and optionally oxygen. During coating, a regulation takes place, so that the self-bias is 100 - 300 V and is adjusted to the substrate with the aid of an external direct-current voltage source and so that the total variation width of the self-bias is maximum 3 % of the temporal mean value. In the coating step, the substrate is present in spatial contact with the cathode and the deposition rate is adjusted to a value of greater than or equal to 0. 3 mu m/minutes. The plasma polymerization is carried out at less than 200 degrees C and/or a pressure of 10 - 3 - 10 - 1. The coating step is carried out up to a thickness of the deposited layer of greater than or equal to 4 mu m. The non-fragmented silicon organic compounds are present in the plasma polymerization reactor and transfer with reactive points on the surface of the coating under the formation of a hydrophobic surface. The plasma is produced by high-frequency. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a method for producing a component with a scratch-resistant coating; (2) a coated plastic substrate; and (3) a component. USE - Method for coating a surface of a plastic substrate, which is useful for producing a component having a <b>scratch-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> by laminating, hot-stamping, injection molding, blow molding, pressing, back injection, back compression molding, injection-compression and strand deposition, as a lamination film, a film for thermal molding process and/or a film for back injection (all claimed), in glazing elements, sensors, control elements, visors in a helmet and for firefighters and displays for mobile phones and in the field of film-processing industry.
