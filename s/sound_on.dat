5|$|Following their hiatus, which {{commenced}} {{after the}} release of , the band reconvened in late 2006 to write songs for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.

5|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied {{through the}} {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road plan for Hordaland.|$|E

5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in <b>Sound</b> <b>on</b> Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo <b>Sound</b> <b>on</b> 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea.

After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
