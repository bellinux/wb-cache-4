2500|$|At 06:14 {{hours on}} November 24, 1943, the unescorted Melville E. Stone (Master Lawrence J.

The first torpedo struck {{on the port side}} in the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> and the second hit ten seconds later near #4 hold. The explosions opened large holes in the side and extensively damaged the main and auxiliary engines. As the ship settled rapidly on an even keel, the 42-man complement, 23 armed guards and 23 passengers (military personnel) abandoned ship immediately in rough seas. Two of the lifeboats capsized from the suction created by the ship, which sank within eight minutes and several men drowned, including the master. Three boats got away and were later picked up men from rafts and debris. The survivors were later spotted by an aircraft, which dropped flares so that the American submarine chasers USS SC-1023 and USS SC-662 could pick them up. Five officers, seven crewmen, two armed guards and one passenger were lost.|$|E

40|$|Circulation regions always {{exist in}} <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> These regions reduce the tank’s {{performance}} and decrease its&# 13; effective volume. The recirculation zones {{would result in}} short-circuiting and high flow mixing problems. The&# 13; inlet position would also affect the size and location of the recirculation region. Using a proper baffle&# 13; configuration could substantially increase {{the performance of the}} <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> A common procedure for the&# 13; comparison of the performances of different tanks has been using the Flow Through Curves (FTC) method. &# 13; FTC, however, neglects tendencies for particles sedimentation.

50|$|For example, Settling {{tanks are}} used for {{separating}} solids and/or oil from another liquid. In food processing, the vegetable is crushed and placed inside of a <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with water. The oil floats {{the top of the}} water then is collected. In water and waste water treatment a flocculant is often added prior to settling to form larger particles that settle out quickly in a <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> or an inclined plate settler, leaving the water with a lower turbidity.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, a water {{scheme was}} devised {{for the town}} of Llangefni in central Anglesey.

These arrangements became redundant with the building of the Cefni Reservoir, which was completed in 1951, but the <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> and pumping station survive in Llangefni to this day.

50|$|Engineered {{facilities}} that use water suspension to transport solids (private septic systems and municipal facilities) typically form a floating layer in their primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank,</b> consisting of low-density liquids such as oils, buoyant solids, and soap foam. This {{is referred to}} as scum and is slowly decomposed by microorganisms, eventually falling {{to the bottom of the}} <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> as part of the sludge. When private septic tanks are emptied of solids, the tank is typically vacuumed empty and the incompletely digested scum is added to the incompletely digested sludge, further adding to its aroma and bioactivity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} use of a process simulator to optimize gypsum recovery at Afmine, a small plant near Yzerfontein on the South African West Coast The simulator consisted of models of the major plant equipment, viz. hydrocy-clones, surge bins, <b>settling</b> <b>tanks,</b> a primary sieve and a dewatering screen. Experimental data suggested that the equipment could be modelled satisfactorily from data published in the open literature. Simulation studies have indicated that gypsum losses on the plant could be reduced substantially by means of some relatively minor modifications to the plant layout Moreover, sensitivity analyses of the plant have indicated that optimization of the <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> should receive priority over the other process units. © The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2005.

40|$|The double {{exponential}} settling {{model is}} the widely accepted model for wastewater secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> However, this model does not estimate accurately solids concentrations in the settler underflow stream, mainly because sludge compression and consolidation processes are not considered. In activated sludge systems, accurate estimation of the solids in the underflow stream will facilitate the calibration process {{and can lead to}} correct estimates of particularly kinetic parameters related to biomass growth. Using principles of compaction and consolidation, as in soil mechanics, a dynamic model of the sludge consolidation processes taking place in the secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> is developed and incorporated to the commonly used double exponential settling model. The modified double exponential model is calibrated and validated using data obtained from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} and the flowrate of municipal wastewater {{from the city}} of Doha, located in the Arabian Gulf have been studied to examine their effect on the performance of the primary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> at the local sewage treatment plant. The wastweater is predominantly domestic and characterized by low suspended solids concentration but high total dissolved solids. The high temperature of the wastewater and long flowtime in the sewerage system turn it septic. The performance efficiency of the circular primary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> in terms of total suspended solids and BOD removal was determined. Simple empirical models relating the suspended solids removal efficiency with various loading parameters like detention time, overflow rate and solids loading rate have been developed. The solids loading rate seems to be more significant than the overflow rate or the detention time in predicting settling performance. The results of the investigation are compared with published data...|$|R

50|$|Clarifiers are <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> {{built with}} {{mechanical}} means for continuous removal of solids being deposited by sedimentation. A clarifier is generally used to remove solid particulates or suspended solids from liquid for clarification and (or) thickening.

50|$|The adsorption/bio-oxidation {{process is}} a {{two-stage}} modification of the activated sludge process used for wastewater treatment.

Both stages have separate <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.|$|R
40|$|A new {{perspective}} on the modelling of settling behaviour in water resource recovery facilities is introduced. The {{ultimate goal is to}} describe in a unified way the processes taking place both in primary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> (PSTs) and secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> (SSTs) for a more detailed operation and control. First, experimental evidence is provided, pointing out distributed particle properties (such as size, shape, density, porosity, and flocculation state) as an important common source of distributed settling behaviour in different settling unit processes and throughout different settling regimes (discrete, hindered and compression settling). Subsequently, a unified model framework that considers several particle classes is proposed in order to describe distributions in settling behaviour as well as the effect of variations in particle properties on the settling process. The result is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are valid from dilute concentrations, where they correspond to discrete settling, to concentrated suspensions, where they correspond to compression settling. Consequently, these PDEs model both PSTs and SSTs...|$|R
