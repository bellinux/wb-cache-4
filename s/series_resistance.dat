40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> in vertical MOSFETs incorporating the fillet local oxidation (FILOX) structure that serves {{to reduce the}} gate to drain/source overlap capacitances. The <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> are modeled analytically and the important influencing factors, namely gate bias dependence and the asymmetric nature of the device, are identified. We extract by simulation, Rd and Rs from devices with different FILOX thicknesses, employing an impedance method often used in RF characterisation. We identify the trade-off whereby thickening the FILOX first causes an increase of the cut-off frequency fT, until the on-current Ion becomes limited by increasing <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> and fT therefore reduces. The results indicate a thickness of 40 nm FILOX for maximum fT. We also investigate the influence of process conditions on low <b>series</b> <b>resistances,</b> namely time of rapid thermal annealing RTA and angle of implantation...|$|R
40|$|In modern submicrometer transistors, the {{influence}} of the internal base and emitter <b>series</b> <b>resistances,</b> on both the I-V characteristics and the LF noise at higher bias currents, becomes important. In this paper expressions are presented for the LF noise in transistors, where {{the influence}} of the <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> has been taken into account. The expressions have been compared with recent experimental results from the literature obtained from modern submicrometer (heterojunction) bipolar transistors. At low forward currents the LF noise in such transistors is determined by spontaneous fluctuations in the base and collector currents. In most transistors at higher forward currents, the parasitic <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> and their noise become importan...|$|R
40|$|A process-related design {{formula for}} the MOSFET <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> is discussed, {{assuming}} a linear doping profile for graded junctions. The main process variable is the lateral doping gradient, whereas the LDD-dose has little effect.

25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{modeling}} of MOS transistors for RF applications requires the accurate extraction of the extrinsic <b>series</b> <b>resistances.</b> In this paper, we fairly compare several RF extraction methods based on simulation results provided by an accurate foundry compact model of advanced RF MOSFETs. We demonstrate that all published RF characterization methods properly work {{to extract the}} extrinsic <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> when the RF measurement noise is not considered. However, when Vectorial Network Analyzer (VNA) measurement noise on S-parameters {{is included in the}} simulations, we clearly conclude that the extracted <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> are dependent on the extraction procedure. These results demonstrate the high sensitivity of the extracted RF MOSFETs small-signal equivalent circuit with S-parameters measurement noise and therefore the need of specific filtering methods to reduce the VNA noise floor.

Gyrators can be used to create inductors from the microhenry range up to the megahenry range. Physical inductors are typically limited to tens of henries, and have parasitic <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> from hundreds of microhms through the low kilohm range. The parasitic resistance of a gyrator depends on the topology, but with the topology shown, <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> will typically range from tens of ohms through hundreds of kilohms.|$|R

A two point linear calibration curve defining acceptable multiplexer voltage limits may be defined by the computer by determining the voltage output of the multiplexer to very accurately known input signals developed from predetermined current levels across the <b>series</b> <b>resistances.</b> Drift in the multiplexer may be detected by the computer when the output voltage limits, expected during normal operation, are exceeded, or the relationship defined by the calibration curve is invalidated...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a novel {{analytical}} method based on radio-frequency (RF) analysis for the accurate and reliable extraction of source and drain (S/D) <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> in silicon nanowire (SNW) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). The proposed method provides decomposed RF model equations for the gate-bias-independent off-state and gate-bias-dependent on-state components from both Y-and Z-parameters. The validity of our extraction method for S/D <b>series</b> <b>resistances</b> in SNW MOSFETs has been carefully tested in comparison {{with that of a}} previously reported method {{as well as with the}} physical three-dimensional (3 D) device simulation.

25|$|This {{internal}} DC resistance Ri {{should not}} be confused with the internal AC resistance called equivalent <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> (ESR) normally specified for capacitors.

25|$|The {{equivalent}} <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> (ESR) summarizes all {{resistive losses}} of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact {{resistance of the}} electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the dielectric losses in the dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|The {{fill factor}} is {{directly}} affected by {{the values of the}} cell's series, shunt resistances and diodes losses.

25|$|All {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age over time, due to evaporation of the electrolyte. The capacitance usually decreases and the equivalent <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> (ESR) usually increases. The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000h/85°C and operating at 40°C, is roughly 6 years. It {{can be more}} than 10 years for a 1000h/105°C capacitor operating at 40°C. Electrolytic capacitors that operate at a lower temperature can have a considerably longer lifespan.|$|E

25|$|The {{fill factor}} is {{the ratio of the}} actual maximum {{obtainable}} power to the product of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells with a high fill factor have a low equivalent <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> and a high equivalent shunt resistance, so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{electrochemical}} capacitors (supercapacitors) {{consists of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and electrically connected via an electrolyte. Energy storage occurs within the double-layers of both electrodes as a mixture of a double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. When both electrodes have approximately the same resistance (internal resistance), {{the potential of the}} capacitor decreases symmetrically over both double-layers, whereby a voltage drop across the equivalent <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> (ESR) of the electrolyte is achieved. For asymmetrical supercapacitors like hybrid capacitors the voltage drop between the electrodes could be asymmetrically. The maximum potential across the capacitor (the maximal voltage) is limited by the electrolyte decomposition voltage.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the <b>series</b> <b>resistance</b> and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E
