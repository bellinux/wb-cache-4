40|$|The {{quantum theory}} of de Broglie and Bohm solves the {{measurement}} problem, but the hypothetical corpuscles play {{no role in}} the argument. The solution finds a more natural home in the Everett interpretation. “If the quantum theory {{is to be able to}} provide a complete description of everything that can happen in the world [...] . it should also be able to describe the process of observation itself in terms of the wave functions of the <b>observing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and those of the system under observation. Furthermore, in principle, it ought to be able to describe the human investigator as he looks at the <b>observing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and learns what the results of the experiment are, this time in terms of the wave functions of the various atoms that make up the investigator, as well as those of the <b>observing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the system under observation. In other words, the quantum theory could not be regarded as a complete logical system unless it contained within it a prescription in principle for how all these problems were to be dealt with. ” D.
