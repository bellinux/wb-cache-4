5|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Warriors of Rock challenges one to four local or online players to use <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> controllers based on guitar, bass, drums, and vocals to simulate the playing of rock music, matching notes as they scroll on-screen with specific actions of the controller to score points and successfully complete songs that are available on-disc, through imports of other Guitar Hero games, or purchasable as downloadable content. Players are awarded star ratings based on their performance; in Warriors of Rock, the typical limit of five stars can easily be surpassed through gameplay-changing powers possessed by the eight in-game characters when they are used. Players can opt to play songs on one of six difficulty levels, from Beginner to Expert (Expert+ on drums), that alter the number of notes and scrolling speed.|$|E

But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|One of his {{earliest}} contributions {{while at the}} Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, {{by means of the}} development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour.|$|E
25|$|The similar Eagle Vision, {{featured}} a smaller split-grill {{with a large}} Eagle badge in the center. The Vision's taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde's were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde's lightbar, instead using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to rear bumper-mounted licence plate on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated very different headlight and taillight assemblies, and had no grille at all. The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid's interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never {{had the option of}} autostick transmission and its <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> cluster. It was only available with an automatic transmission.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica, {{like other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, allows players to {{simulate}} the playing of rock music using <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> controllers. [...] The game {{is based on the}} band approach presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, and features parts of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. To successfully complete songs and score, players must use the instruments to play notes that scroll on-screen in time with the music. For lead and bass guitar players, this is done by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar neck while striking a strum bar; for the drum players, this requires the player to strike the appropriate drum pad or kick with the bass drum pedal; for vocals, the player must attempt to match the pitch of the notes through a microphone. Players earn scoring multipliers for playing several consecutive notes or phrases correctly, and by correctly completing marked phrases, players can earn Star Power which can be released for a higher scoring multiplier. If players miss too many notes, they will eventually fail the song and will have to retry it.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero 5 is {{the fifth}} main title in the Guitar Hero series of rhythm games, {{released}} worldwide in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3 and Wii consoles. In the game, players use <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> controllers to simulate the playing of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals for rock and other songs. Players are awarded points by performing specific actions on the controllers to match notes that scroll on screen that correspond with the appropriate instrument. Successfully hitting notes increases the player's scoring and performance meter, while missing too many notes will lower the performance meter and may cause the song to end prematurely. Songs can be played either by oneself, competitively with other players in several game modes, or cooperative with up to three other players in their own virtual band. Although traditionally a four-player band can have one player on each instrument, Guitar Hero 5 allows any four-player combination of these instruments to be used, such as a band composed of four drummers. Guitar Hero 5 is considered by its developers to be {{an expansion of the}} series into more [...] "social play", featuring modes such as Party Play, which allows players to drop in and out and change difficulty {{in the middle of a}} song without worrying about failing or losing points.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is a rhythm game, allowing up to four people play in a band on vocals, lead and bass/rhythm guitar, and drums, to use <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> controllers to simulate the playing of rock music. In general, the goal for each player is to match scrolling note gems that correspond to that instrument's part in the given song to score points; the guitar and bass player must hold down the appropriate colored buttons on the controller and then use the strum bar as the notes pass over a marked zone; the drummer must strike the matching drum pads on the controller when the notes pass, and the vocalist must match the relative pitch of the song's lyrics as guided by phrase markers. Successfully striking notes earns points and boosts the player's performance meter; missing notes will cause this meter to drop. When playing by one's self, if the performance meter should empty, the song will end and require the player to restart it; when playing in a band, the remaining band members must play well enough for a limited time to [...] "revive" [...] a player that has fallen out due to an empty performance meter, or else the whole band will fail the song. Prior {{to the start of}} a song, each player can select one of five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert, with a sixth difficulty of Expert+ available to some songs on the drums which introduces a double bass pedal. Harder difficulties have characters with high note densities and more difficult playing techniques; each player can select their own difficulty to play.|$|E

2500|$|Rock Band 3 is a 2010 {{music video}} game {{developed}} by Harmonix. The game was initially published and distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts, respectively, in late October 2010. Mad Catz took over both roles and re-released the title on November 23, 2011. It {{is the third}} main game in the Rock Band series. As with the previous titles, Rock Band 3 allows players to simulate the playing of rock music and many other subgenres using <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> controllers mimicking lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. Rock Band 3 expands upon previous games by including three-part vocal harmonies — previously used in [...] and [...] (up to 3 singers on a song) — plus support for MIDI-compatible keyboards, electronic drumkits, and even use of a real guitar in [...] "Pro" [...] mode.|$|E
2500|$|For Legend, Troels Brun Folmann {{composed}} {{the music and}} managed the sound effects. Alongside composing {{a large amount of}} music for the game, he created micro-scores for small segments within gameplay. Folmann returned to score Anniversary, doing re-orchestrations of the original score, along with expanding them. For Underworld, Folmann handled the main theme while Colin O'Malley handled the rest of the soundtrack, which featured far less looping music than Legend. The 2013 reboot was scored by Jason Graves, who had become known through his work on the Dead Space franchise. Along with his orchestral style, he created a <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> to create discordant sounds within the music, and musical elements from around the globe to represent the inhabitants of the game's island location. For Rise of the Tomb Raider, the composer was Bobby Tahouri, who had previously worked as assistant composer on video games and theatrical films. Guardian of Light used no original music, instead using extracts from the music of Legend, Anniversary and Underworld. The music for Temple of Osiris was written by Will Roget II, who had originally worked on licensed video games including [...] Temple of Osiris was the first title in the Lara Croft subseries to have an original score, using Egyptian and Middle Eastern musical elements while creating a new main theme {{that could be used in}} future Lara Croft games.|$|E
2500|$|The Nintendo DS {{version of}} Rock Band 3 follows the {{gameplay}} format of Rock Band Unplugged for the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS version of Lego Rock Band. [...] There are no <b>special</b> <b>instrument</b> attachments; instead, gameplay is designed around matching notes using the face {{buttons on the}} DS. Each of the 26 songs, {{a subset of the}} songs available on the Rock Band 3 disc for other consoles, are presented as a set of four tracks, one for each instrument, with the player able to move between them. To perform well, the player must move between tracks using the shoulder buttons and succeed to match a phrase of notes using the face buttons of the controller in order to boost the band's performance meter; in normal game modes, this will cause the track to play automatically by itself for a brief period allowing the player to focus on the other tracks. The player can fail a song if they cannot match notes correctly, or by ignoring a single track for too long. The DS version includes a single-player career mode and both cooperative and competitive play modes. Additional features that were present in Unplugged also are included in Rock Band 3 for the DS, but have been renamed to match changes in the game's console modes. For example, the [...] "Band Survival" [...] mode from Unplugged, requiring the player to keep all the instruments going without any respite after successfully completing a track section, is called [...] "Pro Mode" [...] in Rock Band 3 for the DS.|$|E
