The <b>statutory</b> <b>granting</b> of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.|$|R

500|$|The {{second of}} forty-one {{criminal}} cases {{heard by the}} Marshall Court, More ensured that the Court's criminal jurisprudence {{would be limited to}} writs of error from the state (and later, territorial) courts, original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in the circuit courts, and certificates of division and mandamus from the circuit courts. Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from the circuit courts in criminal cases until 1889, for capital crimes, and 1891, for other [...] "infamous" [...] crimes. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts, transferred the trial of crimes to the district courts, and extended the Court's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes. But, these <b>statutory</b> <b>grants</b> were construed not to permit writs of error filed by the prosecution, as in More.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} is different {{with respect to}} jurisdictional principles in the international context. The first difference concerns long-arm jurisdiction, which is the <b>statutory</b> <b>grant</b> of jurisdiction to local courts over out-of-state defendants. A long-arm statute authorizes a court in a state to exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. Without a long-arm statute, the courts in a state might not have personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. A state's authorization to exercise jurisdiction {{is limited by the}} federal Constitution. The use of a long-arm statute is usually considered constitutional where the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum state and there has been reasonable notice of the action against that defendant.|$|E

Accepting the majority's interpretation, then, there are two possibilities, neither of which is sustainable.

On the other hand, the majority's logic might be that inadmissible and removable aliens can be treated differently. Yet it is not a plausible construction of § 1231(a)(6) to imply a time limit as to one class but not to another. The text does not admit of this possibility.

50|$|After Donaldson v Beckett, {{disagreement}} continued {{over whether}} the House of Lords affirmed the existence of common law copyright before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers' monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of common law copyright, promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright.
