40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Wireless <b>Sensor</b> <b>Devices</b> are {{becoming}} a more attractive choice as a sensor platform compared to hardwired <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> because of the ease of installation and freedom in sensor placement. Wireless <b>Sensor</b> <b>Devices</b> are usually installed in mass quantity to form a Wireless Sensor Network to sense environmental changes, to track movement in battlefield or military zones, and to monitor any desired function in the industrial or commercial setting. This project {{is an effort to}} learn about the security requirements of a Wireless Sensor Network by analyzing the security mechanisms that have been developed through the TinyOS project. However, certain basic knowledge must be obtained first in order to fully understand the security requirements of a Wireless Sensor Network. Thus, the project starts with an overview of the Wireless <b>Sensor</b> <b>Devices</b> hardware architecture. Then, the project describes the Wireless <b>Sensor</b> <b>Devices</b> network stack and its security mechanisms. The Wireless Sensor Network security requirements are introduced along with some common Wireless Sensor Network attacks and their counter measures.

The results of the project are a procedure for setting up the TinyOS development environment to program Wireless <b>Sensor</b> <b>Devices</b> to form a Wireless Sensor Network, and an analysis of Wireless Sensor Network security software suites such as IEEE 802. 15. 4, ZigBee, SPINS (SNEP and uTesla), TinySec, SomeSec, TinyPK, and TinyECC.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have been widely}} used in many applications such as environment monitoring, surveillance systems and unmanned space explorations. However, poor deployment of <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> leads (1) bad network connectivity which makes data communication or data collection very hard; or (2) redundancy of coverage which wastes energy of sensors and causes redundant data in the network. Thus, in this paper, we propose using a mobile robot to assist the sensor deployment and data collection for unmanned explorations or monitoring. We assume that the robot can carry and deploy the <b>sensor</b> <b>devices,</b> and also have certain communication capacity to collect the data from the <b>sensor</b> <b>devices.</b> Given a set of interest points in an area, we study the following interesting problems: (1) how to decide minimum number of <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> to cover all the interest points; (2) how to schedule the robot to place these <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> in certain position so that the path of the robot is minimum; and (3) after the deployment of sensors, how to schedule the robot to visit and communicate with these <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> to collect data so that the path of the robot is minimum. We propose a complete set of heuristics for all these problems and verify the performances via simulation. I...|$|R

Here the <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> refer to the battery-operated, low-power wireless platforms[11, 12]. Sensor chips are originally meant to form sensor networks for home automation or various monitoring purposes. They usually consist of integrated sensors, a microcontroller, and an IEEE 802.15. 4 (Zigbee)-compliant radio module. The radio module provides built-in clear channel assessment (CCA), {{which can be used}} to evaluate the energy of the selected channel. With appropriate firmware, cheap <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> can also be programed into a swept spectrum analyzer.|$|R

25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the sampling process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the <b>sensor</b> <b>device</b> is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is always an integrated part of a system. The physical and logical structure of the system, where the sensor network is integrated, are together with other environmental requirements the constraints {{for the design of}} the network and the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>devices.</b> These requirements are very different for different applications and even for one specific system the requirements may be very different on the <b>sensor</b> <b>devices.</b> When developing efficient wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>devices</b> these constraints must be taken into consideration. The diverse constraints we are facing when developing wireless <b>sensor</b> networks and <b>devices</b> for various applications makes it necessary to have a platform-based development approach where as much of the components can be re-used. For the communication, the standard IEEE 802. 15. 4 provides an excellent platform for developing short range power aware sensor networks. In this paper a hardware platform is presented with its modular structure it provides a highly flexible solution suitable for rapid prototyping of wireless sensors.
