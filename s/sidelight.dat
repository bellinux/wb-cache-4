The rest of the lights appear to have been left untouched by Wooler-Hodec during the conversion process.|$|E
25|$|One <b>sidelight</b> of Alger's {{career in}} the McKinley Administration was his {{personal}} vendetta against former Confederate partisan Col. John Singleton Mosby. Mosby, a famous (or notorious) figure, had been United States Consul at Hong Kong, China, under Hayes but had been replaced {{with the election of}} Democrat Grover Cleveland. Upon his return to the United States, Mosby had taken a position obtained for him by his close friend former President Ulysses S. Grant with the Southern Pacific Railroad which he held for fifteen years. When the railroad changed ownership, Mosby lost his position so when McKinley became President, he returned east to seek out a position with the new administration. Mosby had known McKinley for many years through his involvement in Republican politics both in Virginia and California.|$|E

25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one <b>sidelight</b> flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
500|$|A <b>sidelight</b> of the Rose Bowl was the Rose Bowl Queen {{nomination}} of Ann Gestie, the future wife of Bob Chappuis, which {{was against the}} tradition of having a queen from Pasadena, California. Buck Dawson, {{the manager of the}} Michigan Yearbook who would go on to marry the daughter of Matthew Mann, was the proponent of the nomination.

2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the <b>sidelight</b> lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate <b>sidelight</b> to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E
2500|$|The digressions {{individually}} frustrate {{readers who}} expect a clear purpose. Each digression {{has its own}} topic, and each is an essay on its particular <b>sidelight.</b> In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author. This is the [...] "persona theory," [...] which holds that the Tale is not one parody, but rather a series of parodies, arising out of chamber performance in the Temple household. Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the Tale is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C. Elias about the acrimony of Swift's departure from the Temple household, evidence from Swift's Journal to Stella about how uninvolved in the Temple household Swift had been, {{and the number of}} repeated observations about himself by the Tale's author, it seems reasonable to propose that the digressions reflect a single type of man, if not a particular character.|$|E
2500|$|The south {{elevation}} {{is dominated}} by a side porch covered by an open lattice beam pergola which runs {{the entire length of}} the building. [...] The front of the side porch is bordered by a lava stone wall that matches the front porch. [...] The lattice beams are supported by seven lava stone columns. [...] Starting near the southwestern corner, there are double casement windows bordered by wood-molding frames. [...] The windows are separated by wide mullions with a header sill above. [...] Next to the window group, there is a single wooden door that has been sealed closed. [...] Then there is group of six bay windows. [...] The main side entrance is a wooden door with a large glass panel insert. [...] The door is flanked on both sides by five-pane <b>sidelight</b> windows in wooden frames. [...] East of the entrance are three casement windows with diamond-obelisk art glass in wooden frames. [...] A second floor dormer is centered in the middle of the south fa√ßade.|$|E

60|$|I {{propose to}} chronicle the {{military}} {{operations of the}} Malakand Field Force, to trace their political results, and to give, if possible, some picture of the scenery and people of the Indian Highlands.

They may describe an episode in that ceaseless struggle for Empire {{which seems to be}} the perpetual inheritance of our race. They may amuse an idle hour. But the ambition I shall associate with them is, that in some measure, however small, they may stimulate that growing interest which the Imperial Democracy of England is beginning to take, in their great estates that lie beyond the seas.|$|E

I've got Black, who is quite ready to go into court at any time, where you can't get at him.

No doubt, to save himself, the other man will turn against you. In addition, if it's necessary, which I hardly think possible, I have even more damaging testimony. I have sworn a statement before the said magistrate for the Crown-lands authorities, and purpose sending a copy to each of your directors individually. That ought to be sufficient, and I have no more time to waste with you." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} well that my little tour was to {{terminate}} at Dijon, for I found, rather to my chagrin, {{that there was not}} a great deal, from the pictorial point of view, to be done with Dijon. It was no great matter, for I held my proposition to have been by this time abundantly demonstrated--the proposition with which I started: that if Paris is France, France is by no means Paris. If Dijon was a good deal of a disappointment, I felt therefore that I could afford it. It {{was time for me to}} reflect, also, that for my disappointments, as a general thing, I had only myself to thank. They had too often been the consequence of arbitrary preconceptions produced by influences of which I had lost the trace. At any rate, I will say plumply that the ancient capital of Burgundy is wanting in character; it is not up to the mark. It is old and narrow and crooked, and it has been left pretty well to itself: but it is not high and overhanging; it is not, to the eye, what the Burgundian capital should be. It has some tortuous vistas, some mossy roofs, some bulging fronts, some grey-faced hotels, which look as if in former centuries--in the last, for instance, during the time of that delightful Pr√©sident de Brosses whose Letters from Italy throw an interesting <b>sidelight</b> on Dijon--they had witnessed a considerable amount of good living. But there is nothing else. I speak as a man who, for some reason which he doesn't remember now, did not pay a visit to the celebrated Puits de Mo√Øse, an ancient cistern embellished with a sculptured figure of the Hebrew lawgiver.|$|E
