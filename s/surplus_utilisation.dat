40|$|Computers are {{becoming}} an increasing {{part of the}} range of tools available to farmers in carrying out their farm management activities. However, there is a range of utilisation of computers within the farming sector. This Research Report provides an application which farmers would find of value in assisting with decision regarding feed conservation and feed <b>surplus</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Earlier publications in this Series present systems applicable to drenching decisions and weaning and a farmer evaluation of the use of the type of computer assistance. This final publication in the series incorporates many of the developments described in earlier reports. This successful research subject has collected information from producers and developed computer based support systems which can provide valuable assistance in decision making...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Storage Exchange (SX) {{is a new}} {{platform}} allowing storage to {{be treated}} as a tradeable resource. Organisations with varying storage requirements can use the SX platform to trade and exchange storage services. Organisations have the ability to federate their storage, be-it dedicated or scavenged and advertise it to a global storage market. In this paper we discuss the high level architecture employed by our platform and investigate a sealed Double Auction market model. We implement and experiment the following clearing algorithms: maximise <b>surplus,</b> optimise <b>utilisation</b> and an efficient combination of both. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{increased}} pressure to redistribute animal manure {{in order to}} lower the environmental pressure from agriculture, it seems obvious to consider processing slurry into nutrient rich fractions which can easily be transported. In this paper, an overall analysis of four different separation technologies is presented. The four technologies are Decanter, Funki Manura 2000, Green Farm Energy and Staring. These technologies are all implemented on a full scale in Denmark. In this paper both the economic and environmental aspects are considered, looking at the entire chain from stable to the field. The total investments range from 50, 000 to 4 million Euros and the total net costs are from 1 to 7 Euros per tonne for the four different technologies. One of the clear environmental benefits is a better utilisation of phosphorus, but using phytase in feeding is a cheaper first step when reducing phosphorus <b>surplus.</b> Improved nitrogen <b>utilisation</b> is only apparent with the Staring and Green Farm Energy concepts. The conclusion is that the Funki Manura 2000 system is too expensive and the Decanter system a fairly cheap way to reduce phosphorus levels, but other benefits are limited. Staring and Green Farm Energy show the greatest potential, but these systems have not been running long enough to validate the expected results included in this paper.
