50|$|Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 Manual (HEC-18) was {{published}} by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This manual includes several techniques of estimating <b>scour</b> <b>depth.</b> The empirical scour equations for live bed scour, clear water scour, and local scour at piers and abutment are shown in Chapter 5-General Scour section. The total <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> is determined by adding three scour components which includes the long-term aggradation and degradation of the river bed, general scour at the bridge and local scour at the piers or abutment. However, research had shown that the standard equations in HEC-18 over-predict <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> {{for a number of}} hydraulic and geologic conditions. Most of the HEC-18 relationships are based on laboratory flume studies conducted with sand-sized sediments increased with factors of safety that are not easily recognizable or adjustable. Sand and fine gravel are the most easily eroded bed materials, but streams frequently contain much more scour resistant materials such as compact till, stiff clay, and shale. The consequences of using design methods based on a single soil type are especially significant for many major physiographic provinces with distinctly different geologic conditions and foundation materials. This can lead to overly conservative design values for scour in low risk or non-critical hydrologic conditions. Thus, equation improvements are continued to be made in an effort to minimize the underestimation and overestimation of scour.|$|E
50|$|If the {{upstream}} {{shear stress}} {{is less than}} the threshold value, the bed material upstream of the bridge is at rest. This {{is referred to as the}} clear-water condition because the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow. The maximum local <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed material from the scoured area.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that both clear water and live-bed scour can occur. During a flood event, bed shear stress may change as the flood flows change. It {{is possible}} to have clear-water conditions at the commencement of a flood event, transitioning to a live bed before reverting to clear water conditions. Note that the maximum <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> may occur under initial clear-water conditions, not necessarily when the flood levels peak and live-bed scour is underway. Similarly, relatively high velocities can be experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge.|$|E

All tests were held under clear-water condition, using a horizontal bed consisted of non-uniform sandy soil (D 50 = 0. 6 mm).

Velocity traverses were made over the groins and in the constricted region to establish {{the relationship between the}} ratio of discharge through the constriction to the total discharge and the relative groin submergence and geometry.

50|$|Live-bed scour occurs {{where the}} {{upstream}} shear stress {{is greater than}} the threshold value and the bed material upstream of the crossing is moving. This means that the approach flow continuously transports sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a uniform channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some additional increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by a contraction (natural or artificial, such as a bridge) or a local obstruction (e.g. a bridge pier). The equilibrium <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> is achieved when material is transported into the scour hole at the same rate at which it is transported out.|$|E

40|$|A {{decrease}} in exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta) abundance with increasing elevation {{may be caused}} by unfavorable abiotic conditions, including scour and displacement of brown trout fry during spring floods. In 2009 and 2010, we investigated relationships between the geomorphic template and selection and scour of brown trout spawning gravels within study reaches along an elevational gradient of the Logan River, Utah. Across reaches, densities of spawning adults demonstrated a strong positive relationship with gravel availability. A comparison of egg burial versus <b>scour</b> <b>depths</b> suggested that <b>scour</b> of not-yet-emerged fry in spring 2009 was near 35 %, compared to 3 % in 2010, due to a longer 2009 flood duration. However, <b>scour</b> <b>depths</b> did not increase with increasing elevation and/or reach shear stress. Although a preference for microsites with low shear stress helps protect fry from <b>scour,</b> high <b>scour</b> <b>depths</b> may cause mortality of a significant percentage of incubating fry at all elevations during high flood years. Mortality could be greater at high elevations, where emergence is more closely timed with the spring flood event, potentially limiting brown trout abundance...|$|R

The total <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> of the pier is usually the sum of the depths of the local scouring, contraction scouring and general scouring (i.e., scouring without structures). The local scouring often dominates the overall scouring depth, and thus, other scouring is not considered at present (Alipour et al. 2013; HEC- 18 2012; NRCS of USDA 2010).

After discussing the critical velocities for sand particles and the sizes of the sand ripples under standing waves, two criteria which may distinguish between two basic scouring patters are presented. The geometrical shape of the scouring profile, the ultimate <b>scouring</b> <b>depth</b> and the development of the <b>scouring</b> <b>depth</b> as a function of time for relatively fine material is presented.

Through integrative application of the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and method of support vector machine (SVM), this method was used to identify the scour depths of bridge under conditions of ambient excitation.
