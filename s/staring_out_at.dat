5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
60|$|There was a {{movement}} and an exclamation from my right, and {{peering through the}} gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lady Cicely sits in her parlour. I saw {{her sweet}} {{face at the}} window but now <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the snow as though she thought to see a ghost in it." ...|$|E
60|$|He sat <b>staring</b> blankly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the window, {{and taking}} his wife's hand between his own, pressed {{it as he}} had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me a story," [...] {{said the}} Baroness, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> despairingly <b>at</b> the rain; {{it was that}} light, apologetic sort of rain that {{looks as if it}} was going to leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon.|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} {{walk up and down}} the room, then he went into the dining-room, and stood <b>staring</b> blankly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the cornfield. The table was already laid for lunch. Presently he turned, still dreaming, and almost {{mechanically}} helped himself to a glass of sherry.|$|R
60|$|She {{went and}} stood at the further window, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the rain. For a long time we were {{absolutely}} still. The wind and rain came in little gusts upon the pane. She turned to me abruptly.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the child}} stood unanswering, his little pale lips pinched together, his eyes <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> nothing. Emily went {{on her knees}} before him, and put her face close to his, saying, with a voice that made one shrink from its {{unbridled}} emotion of caress: ...|$|E
60|$|She was gone--oh, thank God, she was gone! Rilla {{was alone}} again, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the unchanged, dream-like beauty of moonlit Four Winds. Feeling {{was coming back}} to her--a pang of agony so acute as to be almost {{physical}} seemed to rend her apart.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{brought back}} the memory of sitting in a small apartment, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> the window <b>at</b> one o'clock in the morning, {{watching}} the rain come down," [...] wrote Bronson in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits. [...] "He sang into his tape recorder, 'I love a rainy night, I love a rainy night.'" ...|$|R
50|$|The architect, {{holding the}} plans, is <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> the window <b>at</b> the {{unfinished}} house, waiting patiently for sufficient funds to allow work to restart. Some commentators have {{identified him as}} a lawyer along with Silvertongue here for the bargaining, stating that his facial features and posture indicate his amazed disgust at what even he can tell is hideous.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, {{after seeing}} Robin on Channel 4, British band Radiohead {{approached}} Magnus Carlsson {{to make a}} video for their song [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] with Robin in it. Carlsson accepted {{and came up with}} the original idea for the video after locking himself in his office, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> the window <b>at</b> a bridge and listening to nothing but Paranoid Android repeatedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} it," [...] added Mr. Truefitt, {{crossing}} {{to the window}} and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the road {{with his back to the}} captain. [...] "And she said something about a silver-plated butter-dish; but in the circumstances I said ’No.’ Miss Willett thought so too." ...|$|E
60|$|Alone in {{the stable}} Lawrence stood <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the dull red ball of the winter sun with unseeing eyes. He had {{implicit}} faith in his mother, and the stab had gone straight to his heart. Bessy Houghton listened in vain that night for his well-known footfall on the verandah.|$|E
60|$|She hummed softly, {{then three}} times she sang the horn-call. Siegmund, {{with his face}} expressionless as a mask, sat <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the mist. The boom of the siren broke in upon them. To him, the sound was full of fatality. Helena waited till the noise died down, then she {{repeated}} her horn-call.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, rain! rain! rain!" [...] muttered Mr. Goodworth, <b>staring</b> desperately <b>out</b> <b>at</b> {{the miserable}} prospect, while Zack amused himself by rubbing his nose vacantly {{backwards}} and forwards against a pane of glass. [...] "Rain! rain! Nothing but rain and fog in November. Hold up, Zack! Ding-dong, ding-dong; there go the bells for afternoon church! I wonder {{whether it will}} be fine to-morrow? Think of the pudding, my boy!" [...] whispered the old gentleman with a benevolent remembrance of the consolation which that thought had often afforded to him, {{when he was a child}} himself.|$|R
5000|$|When Helen and Michael return, they {{discover}} the dead bodies. Michael runs for help. Helen, distraught, finds Carol hiding {{under the bed}} in a catatonic state. Neighbors arrive [...] - [...] curious, concerned and shocked. Michael returns and carries Carol <b>out,</b> <b>staring</b> creepily <b>at</b> her wide-open eye, face and body. A family photograph on the floor shows Carol as a girl, turned towards an adult male figure in the photograph {{with a look of}} loathing.|$|R
5000|$|Cory Barker of TV Guide {{summarized}} that, [...] "... it {{managed to}} produce such a fun, propulsive second episode without the normal post-pilot drop-off {{is both an}} achievement in of itself, and a great sign {{for the rest of}} Season 1 and beyond." [...] Barker also commented that: [...] "the church sequence ran the gamut from intensely violent to surprisingly comedic, striking a tonal balance that simply shouldn't work... But does." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised the Rogen and Goldberg's presentation of their [...] "gorgeous bit of imagery", such as, [...] "Jesse baptizing his flock, the camera remaining lock still as the house Odin Quincannon has just bought is bulldozed; Cassidy <b>staring</b> wistfully <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the open plains when he realizes it's now too light for him to safely go outside, and every beat of bonkers, intricately-choreographed action when Cassidy takes on the two mystery men at the church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they're not so bad," [...] {{was all he}} answered. He {{pretended that}} his hand was the cat and hers the mouse. For {{the first time she}} tolerated him rather than {{encouraged}} him. She was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Schoenstrom, a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, at which the train was stopping.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Augusta," [...] I answered, still <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the sea. [...] "In {{the prison}} yonder {{is an old}} bishop named Barnabas of Egypt, who was set upon by other bishops at the Council while you were away and wellnigh beaten to death. I ask {{that he may be}} freed and {{restored}} to his diocese with honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She couldn't keep still. She was {{different}} from the woman one had last seen. She used to be so calm--as if she were always sitting for her portrait. Wasn't she in fact always being painted in a pink frock and one row of pearls, always <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> you in exhibitions, as if she were saying 'Here they are again'? Last night she was on the rush." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Isaac {{walked slowly}} to the window, and stood for a time <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> into the garden.|$|R
60|$|Hurrying {{into the}} parlor, they found only Annon and the major, both looking startled, and both <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the windows.|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the window, {{and for a}} while I did {{not care}} to intrude upon his evidently painful memories.|$|R
6000|$|The glorious {{moment of}} {{standing}} lordly in the inn doorway, and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the world, the swinging sign, the geese upon the green, the duck-pond, a waiting waggon, the church tower, a sleepy cat, the blue heavens, with the sizzle of the frying audible behind one! The keen {{smell of the}} bacon! The trotting of feet bearing the repast; the click and clatter as the tableware is finally arranged! A clean white cloth! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My poor boy! Did you see him--his forehead?" [...] Her lips quivered. [...] "I {{will take}} him back home." [...] And tears rolled, one after the other, slowly down her flushed face under her veil. Poor woman! Poor woman! She had turned to the window, passing her {{handkerchief}} up under the veil, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the little strip of darkening lawn, and Winton, too, stared out into that mournful daylight. At last, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Brangwen {{went up to}} {{his room}} and lay <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the stars of the summer night, his whole being in a whirl. What was it all? There was a life so {{different}} from what he knew it. What was there outside his knowledge, how much? What was this that he had touched? What was he in this new influence? What did everything mean? Where was life, in that which he knew or all outside him? ...|$|E
60|$|He ended abruptly, and {{sat for a}} while <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of {{the window}} at the figures {{crossing}} and recrossing the muddy parade-ground.|$|R
60|$|McMurdo {{turned and}} saw {{that one of the}} policemen had shifted in his seat and was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> into the fiery waste.|$|R
5000|$|IndieLondon {{rated the}} song {{four out of}} five, stating it is [...] "as {{beautiful}} and haunting as we've come to expect from this Swedish performer... and perfectly ethereal to accompany <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> the window <b>at</b> a snowy landscape. If it wasn't essential beforehand, it damn sure is now!" [...] Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media commented that the [...] "feedback-streaked piano ballad 'Possibility' is a relative bright spot, but {{like the rest of}} the tracks the soundtrack, it pales in comparison to the work on her own records." [...] Krista Richmond of KillerFilm called the song [...] "lovely in its haunted, enchanting way" [...] and added that it is [...] "soft and melodic enough to pull at even the toughest of heartstrings". MusicRadar's Joe Bosso opined that [...] "this stark, piano-based hymn is spiritual stuff, and Li's arresting vocal powers will have you on your knees in worship." [...] Adam Pfleider of AbsolutePunk expressed that [...] "Lykke Li is where the problem of the soundtrack lies. I can't listen to this music without thinking of where it will end up in the melodrama of some teenager metamorphosing into a CGI werewolf. 'Possibility' is a beautiful song, but I can't help feeling its placement in the film would kill its blossoming melody in the end." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl, biting the finger-tip of {{her white}} cotton glove, was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the traffic. Like a pale ray of light {{entering}} the now dim cavern of the old man's mind, the thought came to Creed {{that he did not}} quite understand her. He had in his time had occasion to class many young persons, and the feeling that he did not quite know her class of person was like the sensation a bat might have, surprised by daylight.|$|E
6000|$|A pause--then Flo cried out, [...] "Bless me, there's a gallows {{and a man}} going up." [...] "Where, where?" [...] shrieks Amy, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> two tall posts with a {{crossbeam}} {{and some}} dangling chains. [...] "A colliery," [...] remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. [...] "Here's a lovely flock of lambs all lying down," [...] says Amy. [...] "See, Papa, aren't they pretty?" [...] added Flo sentimentally. [...] "Geese, young ladies," [...] returns Uncle, {{in a tone that}} keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the Flirtations of Captain Cavendish, and I have the scenery all to myself.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Wickam, {{with her}} eyebrows elevated, {{and her head}} on one side, lighted the way upstairs to a clean, neat chamber, opening on another chamber dimly lighted, {{where there was a}} bed. In the first room, an old woman sat {{mechanically}} <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the open window, on the darkness. In the second, stretched upon the bed, lay the shadow of a figure that had spurned the wind and rain, one wintry night; hardly to be recognised now, but by the long black hair that showed so very black against the colourless face, and all the white things about it.|$|E
60|$|He {{arrived at}} the Club at three o'clock, and the first person he saw was Bosinney himself, seated in a corner, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the window.|$|R
