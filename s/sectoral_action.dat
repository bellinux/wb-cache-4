40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} collective action by business is an "enfant industry" in the scholarly enterprise. Compared {{to the thousands}} of volumes devoted to describing, explaining, and (often) extolling the action of trade unions, those devoted explicitly to trade and employer associations could barely fill a single library shelf. Compared to the heroics of worker demonstrations, strikes, and uprisings, the efforts of capitalists to defend their interests collectively are bound to appear prosaic. If fashion and emotion were not enough, theory has also conspired to discourage the study of cooperation and collusion among consenting capitalists. Liberals try to convince us that only the competitive interaction of individuals as producers/ consumers and citizens/voters leads to social choices and determines societal outcomes; Marxists assure us that capitalists do not need to act collectively, their dominance being assured "at the point of production" or "through the state". Nevertheless and without any specific protection or subsidization, an enfant industry of studying collective action by business has emerged and even begun to prosper during the past two decades. It has had to cut across the usual compartments of academic specialization and to develop its own concepts and assumptions. It has relied heavily on international comparative analysis among advanced industrial societies, which imposes a weighty burden on individual scholars or extracts high transaction costs from collaborative efforts. It is still a hazardous and difficult market to enter, especially for a graduate student attempting his first major piece of research.

40|$|This work is {{underlain}} by broad-based {{expectations that}} policy interventions such as EU 2020 goals {{for renewable energy}} will continue to drive increased international trade in biomass for energy. This work focuses on where and how large volumes of biomass for bioenergy may {{be brought to the}} market in the short to medium term and sought insights in the following areas: • the manner in which demand for biofuels can be driven by political goals; • the realism of expectations that biofuels can achieve political goals; • the nature of production/consumption structures and potential in different regions; • competence and resource needs for international bioenergy trade; • the nature of synergies and competition with incumbent industries. The work first examines immaturity and diversity in the bioenergy industry, and then presents and dissects policy cases to examine policy-making strengths and weaknesses. Management literature for emerging industrial sectors and policy literature are then used to support analysis of challenges posed by diversity in geographical, socio-economic conditions, and by energy carrier and supply chains differences. Arguments are then developed that a significant contribution to progress can be made by enhancing collective action; ‘standardisation’ of ‘bioenergy offerings’; building the profession and professionalism; by improved interplay with other industries and stakeholders, and by improved input to policy-making processes. The report then presents quantifications for biomass resources potentially available in the near to medium term. These include residue flows from agriculture and forestry, and new dedicated agriculture-derived feedstock supply systems. Importantly, modelling supporting this analysis indicates that there is substantial scope for land-minimizing growth of world food supply. This is feasible through efficiency improvements in the food chains from existing land-in-use. Scenarios presented here indicate that it is feasible to reduce global agricultural requirements some 230 Mha from current levels while still meeting dietary requirements (mainstream FAO estimates indicate expansion by 280 Mha). This provides significant scope for expansion of dedicated energy crops. If higher productivity is combined with dietary changes toward less land-demanding food, then agricultural area available for biomass-for-energy could increase to some 1000 Mha. The discussions in this report – institutional, supply chain, and biomass-bioenergy potential – all find common themes that point towards needs for enhanced <b>sectoral</b> <b>action.</b> These include: increased bioenergy-industry professionalism, aligned and consistent forms of collective action, strategic efforts to markedly increase public and political acceptance, more synergistic alliances with incumbent industries, careful application of third-party assessment schemes, the building of resilient technology strategies, and the consistent sourcing of biomass via pathways that remain accepted (legitimate) in the eyes of critical stakeholders. This analysis concludes that many of the constraints or ‘barriers’ being experienced by the sector can be anticipated by examination of ongoing events through management and policy assessment lenses. This in turn indicates that guidance is available for action, both in theory, and by building upon the documented experiences of other emerging sectors. However, it is also concluded that more evidence from the field is vital to enrich this work and the value it may offer the sector. The report closes with brief delineation of research work required to better document where, how and when the industry might act to more effectively – and legitimately – unlock the potential of bioenergy on a global scale. It also calls for dissemination of this report in global bioenergy networks as a seed for future work for the international bioenergy community...|$|E
40|$|Both the European Union (EU) and China are culturally, economically, climatologically and {{environmentally}} diverse polities. The EU is a multi-state grouping of economically developed democratic countries, while China is a unitary sovereign {{state and a}} developing economy with a strong government bureaucracy. Our hypothesis is that given their diverse political systems, the EU and China would develop di®erent kinds of systems for the governance of adaptation to climate change. We test this hypothesis through a comparative analysis of policy documents from the two study areas, in which we examine framework policies, programmatic actions and speci¯c actions that have been adopted to date {{in order to address}} climate change, with a speci¯c focus on the water sector. We ¯nd that climate change adaptation began to be addressed through formal policy on a similar timeline in the two regions. The EU and China are also similar in that they use framework laws and existing sectoral policy, such as for the water sector. We ¯nd that the EU has primarily relied on integration of climate change adaptation concerns through legal instruments which set a framework for implementation of adaptation policy.

40|$|Esta tese trata das políticas habitacionais implementadas pelo Estado brasileiro, por intermédio do governo federal, entre 1964 e 2002. O marco referencial do início do estudo é o lançamento do Plano Nacional da Habitação (Lei nº 4. 380), pelo governo de Castello Branco, o primeiro da ditadura militar; o marco final é o encerramento do governo de Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Abrange-se, assim, as fases tipicamente intervencionista e liberal (ou neoliberal) da ação governamental na área habitacional, desenvolvida sob a dominação do capital monopolista no país. Pretende-se, com a pesquisa, identificar tanto as características internas dessas políticas no que oficialmente se propõem — a produção e financiamento de habitações —, quanto suas consequências sobre as condições materiais de vida dos trabalhadores e das camadas sociais populares. Parte-se do princípio de que são essas condições, determinadas em última instância pela estrutura da sociedade, que definem o acesso à habitação e sua qualidade; não as ações simplesmente setoriais, como aquelas historicamente praticadas no Brasil, baseadas no crédito para aquisição da casa própria. Verifica-se, pela relação com as políticas salariais e trabalhistas, que a ação governamental representou um fator importante de apoio à compressão salarial e à exclusão de direitos dos trabalhadores, concorrendo assim para a degradação das suas condições de vida, a realimentação do favelamento, do déficit quantitativo e qualitativo de moradias e de outros indicadores da reprodução ampliada da carência e da escassez de habitação. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis thesis {{deals with}} the housing {{policies}} implemented by the Brazilian State via the Federal Government between 1964 and 2002. The referential mark of this study begins {{with the publication of}} the National Housing Plan (Law no. 4. 380) by president Castello Branco, the first president of the military dictatorship and it finishes {{with the end of the}} Cardoso’s Administration. The study includes therefore the typically interventionist and liberal (or neoliberal) periods of the governmental action with respect to housing, developed by the domination of the monopolist capital in Brazil. In this study, we intend to identify the internal characteristics of such policies considering what they officially propose –the production and financing of housing – as well as their consequences for the living conditions of workers and popular social classes. We assume that it is these conditions - actually determined by the structure of the society – what defines the access to and the quality of housing; and not only <b>sectoral</b> <b>actions,</b> such as those historically adopted in Brazil, like the financing of house ownership. It is shown via the analysis of the relationship between wages and labor policies at large that the governmental action was an important supporting factor for the wage compression and the exclusion of workers rights, thus leading to the degradation of their life conditions, the booming of slums, the quantitative and qualitative housing deficit and other indicators of the increasing lack/shortage of housing...|$|R

40|$|Learning from {{success is}} the most {{effective}} and efficient way of learning. This report brings together the main findings of a series of assessments of successful community nutrition programming carried out in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda between 1999 and 2000. The overall aim of the assessments was to identify key lessons, or the main driving forces behind the successful processes and outcomes in these programs. Such elements of success fundamentally have to do with both what was done and how it was done. Experience with community-based nutrition programming, as documented in various syntheses and reviews during the 1990 s, does show that malnutrition can be effectively addressed on a large scale, at reasonable cost, through appropriate programs and strategies, and backed up by sustained political support. In most cases, successful attempts to overcome malnutrition originate with participatory, community-based nutrition programs undertaken in parallel with supportive <b>sectoral</b> <b>actions</b> directed toward nutritionally at-risk groups. Such actions are often enabled and supported by policies aimed at improving access by the poor to adequate social services, improving women’s status and education, and fostering equitable economic growth. Successful community-based programs are not islands of excellence existing in an imperfect world. Rather, part of their success has to do with contextual factors that provide an enabling or supportive environment. Some of these contextual factors are particularly influenced by policy, some less so. Contextual factors may include, for example, high literacy rates, women’s empowerment, community organizational capacity and structures, appropriate legislation. Nutrition program managers cannot normally influence contextual factors, {{at least in the short}} term. In addition to favorable contextual factors, certain program factors contribute to successful programs, such as the design, implementation, and/or management of the program or project, which can, of course, be influenced by program managers. Both contextual and program factors, and the way they interact, need to be identified in order to understand the dynamics behind success. In 1998, under the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative (GHAI) supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), nutrition coalitions were formed in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. These nutrition coalitions, comprising individuals representing government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), donors, academic institutions, and the private sector, seek to advance the nutrition agenda both in policy and programming through coordination and advocacy efforts. One of the first tasks of the nutrition coalitions, under the leadership of the Program for Applied Technologies in Health (PATH) in Kenya, the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC) in Tanzania, and the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) in Uganda, was to prepare an inventory of community nutrition programs in their respective countries and identify of better practices in community nutrition programming. Country teams, supported by USAID/REDSO/ESA and LINKAGES/AED, then selected three successful programs in their respective countries based on preestablished "process" and "outcome" criteria. UNICEF has a long history of promoting and supporting community-based programs in Eastern and Southern Africa and has supported many reviews and evaluations. As part of its continued effort to strengthen community-based programs by learning from new success stories, UNICEF also identified for review a relatively large scale successful program in Tanzania...|$|R

METHODS: Retrospective study based on the available indicators of the health status {{of the population in}} Europe, social determinants of health and health-related behavior, health systems and public health services, and analysis of the WHO policy documents, reports and commitments leading to the new coherent approach and strategic vision "Health 2020 ". RESULTS: The 21 st-century health landscape is shaped by growing global, regional and local interdependence and an increasingly complex array of interlinking factors that influence health and well-being. Most of today’s major public health challenges, including non communicable diseases, antimicrobial resistance, health inequalities and the health effects of austerity measures in some countries, cannot be addressed effectively without inter <b>sectoral</b> and coordinated <b>action</b> at supranational, national and local levels. The 53 countries of the WHO European Region developed and adopted a European policy framework and strategy for the 21 st century (Health 2020) as a common, evidence-informed policy framework to support and encourage coordinated action by policy-makers at all levels and in all sectors to improve population health and well-being.
