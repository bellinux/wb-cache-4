The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E

5|$|Following the Italian {{declaration}} of war against the Central Powers on 23 May 1915, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets.

Thereafter, the Austro-Hungarians returned to their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down Allied naval forces.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a {{province}} of the Ottoman Empire, ordered a series of ironclad warships from foreign shipyards. Iclaliye was the last vessel to be ordered by the Egyptian government. The contract was awarded to the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1868. By this time, Egyptian efforts to assert their independence had angered Sultan Abdülaziz, who on 5 June 1867 demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, Egypt surrendered Iclaliye and the other Egyptian ironclads {{in exchange for the}} central government recognizing greater autonomy, transforming the Eyalet into the Khedivate of Egypt. Iclaliye was a slightly enlarged version of the earlier <b>s</b> <b>that</b> had been built in France, carrying a slightly more powerful armament.|$|E
