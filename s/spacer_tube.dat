50|$|One {{example of}} {{desiccant}} usage {{is in the}} manufacture of insulated windows where zeolite spheroids fill a rectangular <b>spacer</b> <b>tube</b> at the perimeter of the panes of glass. The desiccant helps to prevent the condensation of moisture between the panes. Another use of zeolites is in the dryer component of air conditioning systems to help maintain the efficacy of the refrigerant. Desiccants are also commonly used to protect goods in shipping containers against moisture damage. Hygroscopic cargo, such as cocoa, coffee, and various nuts and grains, are particularly susceptible to mold and rot when exposed to condensation and humidity. Because of this, shippers often take precautionary measures to protect against cargo loss.|$|E

40|$|Flexible, vacuum-insulated {{transfer}} lines for low-temperature applications have higher thermal losses than comparable rigid lines. Typical flexible piping construction uses corrugated tubes, inner and outer, with a multilayer insulation (MLI) {{system in the}} annular space. Experiments on vacuum insulation systems in a flexible geometry were conducted at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory of NASA Kennedy Space Center. The effects of bending were simulated by causing the inner tube to be eccentric with the outer tube. The effects of spacers were simulated in a controlled way by inserting <b>spacer</b> <b>tubes</b> {{for the length of}} the cylindrical test articles. Two material systems, standard MLI and a layered composite insulation (LCI), were tested under the full range of vacuum levels using a liquid nitrogen boiloff calorimeter to determine the apparent thermal conductivity (k-value). The results indicate that the flexible piping under simulated bending conditions significantly degrades the thermal performance of the insulation system. These data are compared to standard MLI for both straight and flexible piping configurations. The definition of an overall k-value for actual field installations (k(sub oafi)) is described for use in design and analysis of cryogenic piping systems...|$|R

50|$|Metered-dose inhalers are {{sometimes}} used with add-on devices {{referred to as}} holding chambers or <b>spacers,</b> which are <b>tubes</b> attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce {{the speed at which}} the aerosol enters the mouth. They serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler. This makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air. With proper use, a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Evans balance {{was described}} by Dennis F. Evans in 1973 based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Evans used Ticonal bars with cadmium plated mild steel yokes as the magnets, a Johnson-Matthey gold alloy (hence the other name of the balance)for the suspension strip, all glued together with epoxy resin onto a phosphor brown <b>spacer.</b> The <b>tubes</b> were made from NMR tubes and the current came from CdS photocells. This original was modified {{with help from the}} Johnson-Matthey company Two pairs of magnets were glued between the arms of an H-frame. The sample was placed into the gap between one pair of magnets and a small coil in the gap between the second pair of magnets. This entire construction pivoted horizontally around a torsion strip. When a sample tube was placed between the first pair of magnets, the torsional force was restored by the current passed through the coil between the second pair of magnets, giving a reading on a display instead of a Helipot (as was used in the original).|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} context of rapidly {{depleting}} petroleum resources and growing environmental concerns, {{it is important}} to develop materials to harvest and store energy from renewable and sustainable sources. Hydrogen {{has the potential to be}} an alternative energy source, since it has higher energy content than petroleum. However, since hydrogen has very low volumetric energy density, hence {{it is important to}} design nano porous materials which can efficiently store large volumes of hydrogen gas by adsorption. In this regard carbon nanotube and Metal Organic Framework (MOFs) based materials are worth studying. Ionic liquids (IL) are potential electrolytes that can improve energy storage capacity and safety in Li ion batteries. Therefore it is important to understand IL's thermodynamic and transport properties, especially when it is in contact with electrode surface and mixed with Li salt, as happens in the battery application. This dissertation presents computation and simulation based studies on: 1. Hydrogen storage in carbon nanotube scaffold. 2. Mechanical property and stability of various nanoporous Metal Organic Frameworks. 3. Thermodynamic and transport properties of [BMIM][BF 4] ionic liquid in bulk, in Li Salt mixture, on graphite surface and under nanoconfinement. In the first study, we report the effects of carbon nanotube diameter, <b>tube</b> chirality, <b>tube</b> <b>spacer</b> distance, <b>tube</b> functionalization and presence of Li on hydrogen sorption capacity and thermodynamics at different temperature and pressure. In the second one, we observe high pressure induced structural transformation of 6 isoreticular MOFs: IRMOF- 1. IRMOF- 3, IRMOF- 6, IRMOF- 8, IRMOF- 10 and IRMOF- 14, explore the deformation mechanism and effect of Hydrogen inside crystal lattice. In the third study, we observe the equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties of [BMIM][BF 4] ionic liquid. The temperature dependence of ion diffusion, conductivity, dielectric constant, dipole relaxation time and viscosity have been observed and found similar behavior to those of supercooled liquid. The ion diffusion on graphite surfaces and under nanoconfinement was found to be higher compared to those in bulk...|$|R
40|$|The {{scale-up}} {{design of}} a spacer-filled disk-type membrane module has been conducted by using computational flu-id dynamic (CFD) technique. A three-dimensional CFD technique was used to analyze fluid flow in the membrane module, permeate flux, permeate volumetric flow rate {{and the distribution of}} permeation rates on the membrane surfaces. The numerical results showed that there were variations in the volumetric flow rate and permeation rates with different membrane module sizes. As radius ratio of the collection tube to radius of the spacer-filled disk-type membrane module was smaller than 0. 162, a series of membrane module could be considered instead of large membrane module sizes based on the same total membrane areas. Microscopic understanding derived from the CFD analysis can improve the design of collection <b>tubes,</b> <b>spacer</b> thicknesses and membrane module sizes to en-hance module performance and assist the construction of new designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this novel {{research}} {{was to understand the}} flow behaviour and improve the efficiency of the Volumatic™ spacer, using a combination of engineering tools such as CFD, Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Row visualization techniques. The lack of information on the Volumatic /A/ spacer meant that, initial understanding had to be gained into the flow behaviour within the spacer. This was initially performed by injecting air carrying a tracer concentration to represent t li<^drug portion of the medicine. The efficiency (volume of drug collected at the mouth piece) was found to be about 6. 5 % which was in the same order as the figure quoted in the literature Chuffart A series of parametric studies were carried out to discover the effects of various parameters on The overall efficiency of the spacer. In the initial part a series of jet profiles were studied at the inlet, these were in the shape of straight, cone shape and spray jet profiles. It was concluded that the jet with a cone angle of 5 ° increased the efficiency of the spacer from G. 5 % to 9. 4 %. The next stage of parametric study involved reducing the length of the spacer from 0. 24 m to 0. 12 m and varying the inlet velocity from 40 m/s down to 10 m/s. The findings concluded that t in 1 efficiency of the spacer could be increased to 23 %, using a velocity of 40 m/s at inlet. The length was reduced from 0. 12 m to 0. 06 m and a similar study as described above was carried out. This time it was concluded that reducing the velocity to 30 m/s increased the efficiency to 30 %. The other interesting feature {{to come out of this}} study was that the whole of tIk 1 spacer volume was used, hence the drug was mixing better than in the original Volumatic /A/ spacer, where about one third of the spacer volume remained completely empty of the drug. The studies carried out so far had shown that the additional increase in drug delivery efficiency in the case of the Volumatic 7 A/ spacer, was not substantial enough to justify the considerable manufacturing costs which have to be met, if the Volumatic 7 A/ spacer was to be remanufactured in its improved design. The way forward seemed to be in the development of a new design. The new design had to be small enough, so that it could be carried around easily by patients, who do not use 1 the current spacer due to its size. The new design had to be economical in terms of manufacture, simple to use and easy to clean. The reasons mentioned above and the current trend towards the <b>tube</b> type <b>spacer</b> designs, implied the logical approach would be to base the design on a similar geometry. A <b>tube</b> type <b>spacer</b> was modelled with two holes drilled directly opposite each other, a distance of 10 mm away from the pMDI's nozzle. The holes introduced a pressure difference, hence directing the drug towards the patient's airway system. The new spacer had a length of 0. 1 m. The computational results showed that the efficiency had increased to 71 % for this particular design. The CFD results obtained from the initial study on the Volumatic 7 M spacer were validated using LDA measurements. The velocities along four different locations were measured. At each location the velocities were measured at increments of 5 mm for a distance of 50 mm inside the spacer. The LDA results showed very good agreements with those obtained from CFD. The volume of data sampled experimentally at each point was 25, 000 data points. This large volume of data eliminated any random sources of error, and as the CF D simulations were carried out some six months prior to LDA results, it was safe to assume that the drug had been modelled accurately. The same experimental set up was used to measure velocity values for the <b>tube</b> <b>spacer,</b> but in this instance, velocity measurements were made only along two planes, due to limited time and availability of the drug source. Finally laser light sheeting was used to illuminate the Volumatic T spacer and a high speed KODAK camera capable of capturing 4500 frames per second was used. The visualization study proved that there was a portion of the Volumatie /A/ spacer which at times was free of any drug. The originality of the work has been described in the following paragraph: Prior to this research there was no comprehensive study available combining engineering tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Laser Doppler Anemoinetry (LDA) and High Speed Photography to study the (low pattern within the current Volumatic /A/ spacer design and hence analysing its efficiency. The studies carried out were of the impaction type. The results of this study have confirmed that there are several parameters contributing to the efficiency of the Volumatic' A/ spacer. This knowledge was not available in the open literature previously. The initial part of this study has provided a scientific approach to analysing the flow patterns, hence obtaining an accurate value for the efficiency of the current device. This part of the study alone is a valuable tool for industry, because it has given industry data which has not been previously available. The results from this study have indicated that, the Aero Chamber Spacer type design has an efficiency of 71 % compared to the current 10 % efficiency of the Volumatic 7 A/ spacer. The efficiencies discussed are measured in terms of the percentage of the drug delivered to the mouth piece. The benefit to industry would be saving at a conservative estimate in terms of millions of Pounds annually. This can be calculated from industry's own figures that, 1 out of every 5 new born baby suffers from asthma in various degrees. The drug is the most expensive component of the device, hence a more efficient device would use a lesser quantity of the drug. Finally the combination of techniques used, and the number of data samples taken for example in the case of LDA measurements some 25000 data samples were taken and averaged at each point, has ensured a high degree of accuracy and confidence in the results presented.
