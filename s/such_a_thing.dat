5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure she would not say <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> would be {{tantamount to a}} magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E

5|$|Like the Storm II, the Mark III was {{initially}} {{available only to}} the military with versions set to be delivered to the Israel Police in 2009. A civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified {{to allow it to}} compete with foreign imports of the same class. AIL states that if <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> would happen, a petrol engine version could be offered. Regarding Export markets, the Storm 3 has already seen use in several countries, especially in its armored version.|$|E
5|$|Two nonprofit {{organizations}} manage the park, which NYC Parks owns and operates. Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization founded in 2009, manages educational and cultural programs, and maintains the recreational areas. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, an independent nonprofit established in 1992, provides educational programs and assists in the upkeep of the park's natural areas. However, {{the two organizations}} {{have not had the}} same amount of funding as similar private organizations who manage parks in wealthier areas of the city. In 2013, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park only raised $416,612—as opposed to the Central Park Conservancy, which in 2016 had an $81 million endowment to maintain Central Park, or the Four Freedoms Parks Conservancy, which raised $8 million in 2011 alone for the construction of the Four Freedoms Park. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E

25|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} had {{different}} attitudes toward prostitution. George W. Hunter (missionary) noted that Turki Muslims (Uyghurs) would prostitute their daughters, while <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{would never happen}} among Tungan Muslims (Chinese Muslims), which was why Turki prostitutes were common around the country.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{some have}} also claimed this {{argument}} fails {{to account for}} Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.|$|E

25|$|Alexander, {{who also}} valued Craterus highly as a most {{competent}} officer, {{was forced to}} intervene and had stern words for both. It {{is a measure of}} how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own.|$|E
25|$|The House with a Clock in Its Walls (1973), Bellairs's next novel, was {{originally}} composed as a contemporary adult fantasy, {{but at the}} time there was little market for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> The second publisher to which it was submitted suggested rewriting it as a young readers' book; Bellairs did so, and thus determined the future course of his career. Bellairs wound up writing 15 young-adult novels.|$|E
25|$|In 2011. the {{constitutional}} court declared current Statute as unconstitutional, because {{the numbers of}} deputies from city districts don't match the number of voters in each district. The City {{is waiting for the}} new Statute to be created, and many believe that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> will need to be carried by OHR. In November 2011 Roderick W. Moore, the Principal Deputy High Representative, emphasized the importance of the urgent acts towards adoption of the new, constitutional Statute.|$|E

25|$|A nonprofit {{organization}} called Friends of Pelham Bay Park (founded in 1992) manages the park, while NYC Parks {{owns and operates}} the land and facilities. Compared to the Central Park Conservancy, Friends of Pelham Bay Park does not receive as much funding. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.|$|E
25|$|Nanorobotics {{centers on}} {{self-sufficient}} machines of some functionality operating at the nanoscale. There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine, {{but it may}} not be easy to do <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> because of several drawbacks of such devices. Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts.|$|E
25|$|In West Germany, Münch {{took part}} in {{discussion}} meetings and commemoration ceremonies. He was appreciated for having saved many Auschwitz prisoners {{at the risk of}} his own life. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, he made a journey back to the concentration camp. Münch was invited by Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of Josef Mengele's experiments on twins. Münch and Kor signed public declarations regarding what had happened there and declaring that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> should never be allowed to happen again.|$|E

25|$|Around 1997 the JASONS {{advisory}} group took testimony about the triggering of nuclear isomers. The JASON Defense Advisory Group published a relevant public report {{saying that they}} concluded that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> would be impossible {{and should not be}} attempted. Despite intervening publications in peer-reviewed journals of articles written by an international team reporting IGE from 178m2Hf, around 2003 IDA took testimony, again from relevant scientists on matters of the credibility of reported results. Professor Carl Collins, the lead U.S. member of the team publishing the successes, did not testify.|$|E
25|$|When Maddie {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{near the end}} of the fourth season, the writers tried to recreate the tension between Maddie and David by having Maddie spontaneously marry a man named Walter Bishop (Dennis Dugan) within a few hours of meeting him on the train back to LA. When Shepherd read the script she strongly voiced her objection that her character would not do <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> but was overruled. The move failed to rekindle the sparks between the main characters or capture the interest of the audience, which led to an even further ratings decline.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{concept of}} righteousness {{was rooted in}} the covenant-making God who had ordered {{creation}} for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern {{for the poor and}} needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. Satan {{raises the question of whether}} there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.|$|E
