25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|The R22 is a light, two-place, single reciprocating-engined {{helicopter}} with a <b>semi-rigid</b> two-bladed main <b>rotor</b> and a two-bladed tail rotor. The {{main rotor}} has a teetering hinge and two coning hinges. The tail rotor {{has only a}} teetering hinge.|$|R
2500|$|Bell {{participated in}} a joint Bell-Government {{integrated}} test team during the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the H-1 program. The AH-1Z program progressed slowly from 1996 to 2003 largely as a research and development operation. [...] The existing two-blade <b>semi-rigid,</b> teetering <b>rotor</b> system is being replaced with a four-blade, hingeless, bearingless rotor system. The four-blade configuration provides improvements in flight characteristics including increased flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate of climb, payload and reduced rotor vibration level.|$|R

2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed <b>semi-rigid,</b> teetering <b>rotor</b> {{system is}} being {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite rotor system. The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade tail rotor and drive system.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a mixed quantum-classical <b>semi-rigid</b> {{vibrating}} <b>rotor</b> target (QC-SVRT) {{model has}} been applied to study the reaction O(3 P) + CH 4 ! CH 3 + OH based on H + CH 4 potential surface of Jordan and Gilbert. In this approach, the relative translational motion between atom and polyatom molecules is treated classically while the others are treated quantum mechanically. The reaction probabilities and rate constants were carried out using the QC-SVRT approach. It was found that the QC-SVRT results are in good agreement with the quantum results and the reaction threshold is correctly produced in the present calculation. The application of this QC-SVRT approach makes it more practical to extend quantum reaction dynamics calculation to larger molecules and more complex systems without incurring signi cant loss of important quantum eects...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution, pulsed jet, Fourier {{transform}} {{microwave spectroscopy}} {{is used in}} separate studies of two means of intramolecular stabilization, namely, CH/π interaction and dispersive attraction. The smallest branched terminal alkyne capable of two simultaneous CH/π interactions, 4 -methyl- 1 -pentyne, is measured in the first investigation, and three disubstituted acetylenes {{are the focus of}} the second phase: 3 -hexyne, 3 -heptyne, and 2 -methyl- 3 -hexyne. ^ The conformer of 4 -methyl- 1 -pentyne with C 1 symmetry is shown to have closer approach of the hydrogen atom nearest to the triple bond than expected from nominal bond angles, adding support to the previously proposed CH/π interaction. A second conformer with two simultaneous CH/π interactions is definitively identified for the first time. Isotopomers with 13 C in natural abundance are seen with this structure, demonstrating significant population at the 2 K rotational measurement temperature. Computations at the MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(2 d, 2 p) level of theory show modest stabilization by two CH/π interactions with one triple bond vs. a single interaction, though less than the roughly additive effect shown by others when two triple bonds are involved. ^ The molecules 3 -hexyne and 3 -heptyne may freely orient their end-groups around the triple bonds by internal rotation. Both have stable structures with the centers of charge density aligned, consistent with an attraction through dispersive force. Extensive computations through MP 2 /AUG-cc-pVQZ//MP 2 /AUG-cc-pVTZ show an extremely flat potential energy surface. Vibrational levels calculated for this potential suggest that only the observed structure of 3 -hexyne (C 2 v symmetry) is significantly populated at 2 K. The potential function also implies a stabilizing role when the bonds on carbon atoms C 2 and C 5 are eclipsed. The observed form of 3 -heptyne, with a torsional angle of - 15 ° relative to eclipsing of the bonds, demonstrates a dominant role of dispersive attraction in determining such structures. ^ Based on this result, possible orientations are anticipated for 2 -methyl- 3 -hexyne. A comprehensive attempt has been made to observe one or more conformers, yielding sufficient lines to assign any structure obeying a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> Hamiltonian. Such an assignment is not possible, apparently from tunneling perturbations. This is consistent with the even flatter potential energy surface predicted if the effects calculated for 3 -hexyne are considered transferable. ...|$|E
50|$|Phase lag (rotorcraft) {{will cause}} the extra lift to be seen {{approximately}} 90 degrees later in <b>rotor</b> rotation in <b>semi-rigid</b> two bladed <b>rotor</b> systems. Phase lag is a separate phenomenon from gyroscopic precession. Phase lag is a property of all rotating systems acted upon by a periodic force. For systems hinged at the axis of rotation (in our case, a semi rigid flapping type rotor head) the phase lag is 90 degrees. For systems that are hinged at {{some distance from the}} axis of rotation (such as a fully articulated rotor head) the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. The pilot will experience either a right or left roll (see flight dynamics), depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were to investigate crack initiation characteristics and short crack growth behavior for Al-Li 2090 and for 4340 steel and {{to evaluate the}} ability of a closure-based crack-growth model to predict fatigue crack growth rates and total fatigue lives for the steel. Single-edge-notched tension specimens of each alloy were used to obtain the short crack growth rate information via an acetate replica technique. In addition to constant amplitude loading, tests on the steel were conducted using the Felix/ 28 variable amplitude spectrum (a shortened form of a standard loading sequence for fixed or <b>semi-rigid</b> helicopter <b>rotors).</b> The short crack growth rates were compared to those for long cracks grown under similar loading conditions. Metallurgical features associated with crack initiation are discussed. For Al-Li 2090 under R = - 1 loading, the short cracks grew well below the long crack threshold and grew at acute angles to the loading axis. For 4340 steel under constant amplitude loading at R = 0. 5 and 0 and for the Felix/ 28 spectrum loading, short-crack growth rates agreed well with long-crack growth rates, even near the long-crack threshold. A slight short-crack effect, growth below the long-crack threshold, was observed at R = - 1. Fatigue lives were found to depend on the size and type of initiation site, especially for the Felix/ 28 loading sequence. A semi-empirical crack-growth model incorporating crack-closure effects was used to predict crack growth rates and total fatigue lives of notched 4340 steel specimens. An initial defect size and shape typical of those identified in this steel was assumed for the life predictions. For all loading conditions, reasonable agreement was found between measured and predicted values for both crack growth rates and fatigue lives...|$|R
