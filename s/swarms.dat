5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike <b>swarms</b> at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike <b>swarms</b> mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In <b>swarm</b> robotic systems {{emergent}} <b>swarm</b> {{properties are}} particularly difficult to analyse and model. This paper describes {{a simple but}} effective algorithm for emergent <b>swarm</b> taxis (<b>swarm</b> motion toward a beacon) in a 2 D or 3 D wireless connected <b>swarm</b> of minimalist mobile robots. The paper then undertakes a deep analysis of the <b>swarm</b> taxis by identifying both first and second order micro-level robot interactions and quantifying the contribution of each such interaction to the macro-level <b>swarm</b> behaviour. From the analysis we develop a simple quantitative model that is able to predict <b>swarm</b> velocity with reasonable accuracy. Although the analysis is specific to the <b>swarm</b> algorithm in question, {{we believe that the}} methodology presented has generic value to <b>swarm</b> modellers. I. BACKGROUND.

5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, {{their numbers are}} low, {{and they do not}} pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become <b>swarms</b> of winged adults. Both the bands and the <b>swarms</b> move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E

40|$|The Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation {{algorithm}} {{is widely used}} to solve multiobjective optimisation problems. This algorithm optimises one objective using a <b>swarm</b> of particles where their movements are guided by the best solution found by another <b>swarm.</b> However, the best solution of a <b>swarm</b> is only updated when a newly generated solution has better fitness than the best solution at the objective function optimised by that <b>swarm,</b> yielding poor solutions for the multiobjective optimisation problems. Thus, an improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation {{algorithm is}} introduced by incorporating the nondominated solutions as the guidance for a <b>swarm</b> rather than using the best solution from another <b>swarm.</b> In this paper, the performance of improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm is investigated using performance measures such {{as the number of}} nondominated solutions found, the generational distance, the spread, and the hypervolume. The results suggest that the improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm has impressive performance compared with the conventional Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm...|$|R

5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of {{a mature}} colony includes a fertile female and male, {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge <b>swarms</b> emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These <b>swarms</b> attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what {{has been referred to}} as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These <b>swarms</b> of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such <b>swarms</b> between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the particular variants of particle <b>swarm</b> optimization, based on the velocity-type class. The original particle <b>swarm</b> optimization algorithm was developed as an unconstrained optimization technique, which lacks a model that is able to handle constrained optimization problems. The particle <b>swarm</b> optimization and its inapplicability in constrained optimization problems are solved using the dynamic-objective constraint-handling method. The dynamic-objective constraint-handling method is originally developed for two variants of the basic particle <b>swarm</b> optimization, namely restricted velocity particle <b>swarm</b> optimization and self-adaptive velocity particle <b>swarm</b> optimization. Also on the subject velocity-type class, a review of three other variants is given, specifically: (1) vertical particle <b>swarm</b> optimization; (2) velocity limited particle <b>swarm</b> optimization; and (3) particle <b>swarm</b> optimization with scape velocity.

5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in <b>swarms</b> a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these <b>swarms,</b> and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.|$|E

5|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed <b>swarms</b> to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. <b>Swarms</b> crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains <b>swarms</b> to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at <b>swarms.</b> Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
