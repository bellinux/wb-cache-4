40|$|We {{present an}} {{uncommon}} description of an energy transfer process in core-collapse supernovae: namely, a gravitational machine that increases Coulomb energy within nuclei via silicon burning. Later, excess of that Coulomb energy is returned by weak nuclear decays (EC and beta+). Those decays energize several observable quantities: (1) gamma-ray lines, (2) X-ray luminosity, (3) free chemical energy, (4) optical light curves. The delay {{of the return}} energy transfer is essential for visibility of these activations. These <b>secondary</b> <b>displays</b> have rich literatures; but expressing them as observables of a supernova machine, whose action can be summarized as gravitational compression→Coulomb nuclear energy increase→release of excess of that Coulomb nuclear en-ergy by electroweak decays→supernova displays, is novel.

50|$|It {{is clear}} that a fast {{response}} time and high refresh rate is desired in order to display smooth motion. A framerate of 60 frames per second (FPS) is generally the minimum acceptable framerate in a video game for enthusiasts, with some enthusiasts preferring 144 FPS or even 165 FPS, to match the refresh rate of their monitor (144 Hz or 165 Hz, respectively). Some gaming monitors can be overclocked to achieve even higher refresh rates. Apart from the primary display, some enthusiasts choose to use a <b>secondary</b> <b>display</b> or more to their PC.

The HTC U Ultra runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and comes with a 3000 mAh battery which supports Quick Charge 3.0. The 3.5 mm audio jack is missing from this device, and hence, users have to rely on the USB Type-C port for charging the phone as well as listening to music through earphones.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To examine eye {{tracking}} data and compare visual behavior in individuals with normal hearing (NH) and with {{moderate hearing loss}} (HL) during two types of driving conditions: normal driving and driving while performing a secondary task. Methods 24 participants with HL and 24 with NH were exposed to normal driving and to driving with a secondary task (observation and recall of 4 visually displayed letters). Eye movement behavior was assessed during normal driving by the following performance indicators: number of glances away from the road; mean duration of glances away from the road; maximum duration of glances away from the road; and percentage of time looking at the road. During driving with the secondary task, eye movement data were assessed in terms of number of glances to the <b>secondary</b> task <b>display,</b> mean duration of glances to the <b>secondary</b> task <b>display,</b> and maximum duration of glances to the <b>secondary</b> task <b>display.</b> The <b>secondary</b> task performance was assessed as well, {{counting the number of}} correct letters, the number of skipped letters, and the number of correct letters ignoring order. Results While driving with the secondary task, drivers with HL looked twice as often in the rear-view mirror than during normal driving and twice as often as drivers with NH regardless of condition. During secondary task, the HL group looked away from the road more frequently but for shorter durations than the NH group. Drivers with HL had fewer correct letters and more skipped letters than drivers with NH. Conclusions Differences in visual behavior between drivers with NH and with HL are bound to the driving condition. Driving with a secondary task, drivers with HL spend as much time looking away from the road as drivers with NH, however with more frequent and shorter glances away. Secondary task performance is lower for the HL group, suggesting this group is less willing to perform this task. The results also indicate that drivers with HL use fewer but more focused glances away than drivers with NH, they also perform a visual scan of the surrounding traffic environment before looking away towards the <b>secondary</b> task <b>display...</b>|$|R
