30|$|The {{influence}} of coal composition on {{the release of}} Na-, K-, Cl- and S-species during the combustion of German brown coals has been studied by Oleschko et al. [20]. In CFB combustion of Indian lignite, there are no hard deposits of ash on the heat transfer areas. But sintering-related choking/blocking and formation of agglomerates with weak strength are experienced in cyclones and <b>seal</b> <b>pot.</b>|$|E
30|$|If {{sintering}} {{is allowed}} in the upper section of the boiler or in cyclone section, it could eventually lead to operational difficulties. In CFBC boilers, ash sintering might contribute to deposit formation in the cyclone, return leg, and post-cyclone flue gas channel (back pass). In operating units, rapid sintering lead to heavy agglomerate formation and finally inhibited circulation in dense phase areas (such as <b>seal</b> <b>pot)</b> {{and in the back}} pass. Understanding the sintering behavior before the fuel is used is a must for avoiding such problems.|$|E

30|$|Heating {{microscope}} can {{be shown}} to be an excellent experimental technique for performing studies of sintering kinetics, because the shrinkage process can be monitored continuously. The height of the peak is proportional to the intensity of sintering. The sintering profiles with narrow peaks with comparatively higher intensity indicate that the fuel ash is very much temperature sensitive for sintering. If the ash particle reaches the critical temperature range corresponding to peak, then it sinters fast. And if it {{happened to be in the}} dense region of the fuel/ash path of CFBC-like cyclone bottom, <b>seal</b> <b>pot,</b> then heavy sintering leading to shrinkage is a distinct possibility.|$|E
40|$|This work {{concentrates}} on two issues regarding combustion in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers. Firstly, {{the impact of}} co-combustion of coal with sewage sludge on ash flows, bed material and gas concentrations in a CFB boiler is studied. Secondly, a methodology to determine the solids recirculation rate in a CFB boiler is developed and evaluated. Tests have been performed in a 12 MWth CFB boiler. Co-combustion of bituminous coal with municipal sewage sludge is conveniently carried out in a CFB boiler. Nevertheless, introducing sewage sludge into the fuel mix leads to altered conditions in the boiler. The major differences compared to coal combustion observed {{in this study are}} increased fly ash flows, wider bed material size distributions and higher temperatures {{in the top of the}} furnace caused by increased volatiles combustion above the bottom bed. The solids recirculation rate is an important operating parameter in a CFB boiler, but difficult to determine, as no standard procedure is available to measure it directly. A method is developed to measure the instantaneous or time-averaged solids recirculation rate, based on heat and mass balances over the return loop. The conditions for its use are that the solids in the circulation loop pass through a well-fluidized device such as a fluidized <b>seal</b> <b>pot</b> with a heat exchanger or an external heat exchanger. Continuous measurement of temperatures and flow rates of gas and water, and of temperatures in gas-solids mixtures at different locations in the return system is required. The method has been experimentally evaluated and proven suitable for external solids flux measurement...|$|E
40|$|DWPF Engineering {{personnel}} {{requested that}} a new minimum backup film cooler air flow rate, which will meet the off-gas safety basis limits for both normal and seismic sludge-only operations, be calculated when the air purge to the borescope cameras is isolated from the melter. Specifically, it was requested that the latest calculations which were used to set the off-gas flammability safety bases for the sludge batch 2 and 3 feeds be revised, while maintaining all other process variables affecting off-gas flammability such as total organic carbon (TOC), feed rate, melter air purges, and vapor space temperature at their current respective maximum or minimum limits. Before attempting to calculate the new minimum backup film cooler air flow, {{some of the key}} elements of the combustion model were reviewed, and it was determined that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow of 233 lb/hr is adequate to satisfy the off-gas flammability safety bases for both normal and seismic operations i n the absence of any borescope camera air purge. It is, therefore, concluded that {{there is no need to}} revise the reference E- 7 calculations. This conclusion is in essence based on the fact that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow was set to satisfy the minimum combustion air requirement under the worst-case operating scenario involving a design basis earthquake during which all the air purges not only to the borescope cameras but to the <b>seal</b> <b>pot</b> are presumed to be lost due to pipe ruptures. The minimum combustion air purge is currently set at 150 per cent of the stoichiometric air flow required to combust 3 times the normal flow of flammable gases. The DWPF control strategy has been that 100 per cent of the required minimum combustion air is to be provided by the controlled air purge through the backup film cooler alone...|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy Savannah River Site vitrifies {{nuclear waste}} {{incident}} to defense programs through its Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The piping in the DWPF <b>seal</b> <b>pot</b> jumper configuration must withstand the stresses during an unlikely but potential deflagration event, and maintain its safety function for a 20 -year service life. Carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites (CFR) were proposed for protection and reinforcement of piping during such an event. The proposed CFR materials have been ASME-approved (Section XI, Code Case N- 589 - 1) for post-construction maintenance and is DOT-compliant per 49 CFR 192 and 195. The proposed carbon fiber/epoxy composite reinforcement system was originally developed for pipeline rehabilitation and post-construction maintenance in petrochemical, refineries, DOT applications and other industries. The effects of ionizing radiation on polymers and organic materials {{have been studied}} for many years. The majority of available data are based on traditional exposures to gamma irradiation at high dose rates ({approx} 10, 000 Gy/hr) allowing high total dose within reasonable test periods and general comparison of different materials exposed at such conditions. However, studies {{in recent years have}} shown that degradation of many polymers are sensitive to dose rate, with more severe degradation often observed at similar or even lower total doses when exposed to lower dose rates. This behavior has been primarily attributed to diffusion-limited oxidation which is minimized during very high dose rate exposures. Most test standards for accelerated aging and nuclear qualification of components acknowledge these limitations. The results of testing to determine the radiation resistance and microstructural effects of gamma irradiation exposure on a bisphenol-A based epoxy matrix composite reinforced with carbon fibers are presented. This work provides a foundation for a more extensive evaluation of dose rate effects on advanced epoxy reinforced composites...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} reactor development unit (TRDU) {{was modified}} to accommodate oxygen-blown operation {{in support of}} a Vision 21 -type energy plex that could produce power, chemicals, and fuel. These modifications consisted of changing the loop seal design from a J-leg to an L-valve configuration, thereby increasing the mixing zone length and residence time. In addition, the standpipe, dipleg, and L-valve diameters were increased to reduce slugging caused by bubble formation in the lightly fluidized sections of the solid return legs. A <b>seal</b> <b>pot</b> was added {{to the bottom of the}} dipleg so that the level of solids in the standpipe could be operated independently of the dipleg return leg. A separate coal feed nozzle was added that could inject the coal upward into the outlet of the mixing zone, thereby precluding any chance of the fresh coal feed back-mixing into the oxidizing zone of the mixing zone; however, difficulties with this coal feed configuration led to a switch back to the original downward configuration. Instrumentation to measure and control the flow of oxygen and steam to the burner and mix zone ports was added to allow the TRDU to be operated under full oxygen-blown conditions. In total, ten test campaigns have been conducted under enriched-air or full oxygen-blown conditions. During these tests, 1515 hours of coal feed with 660 hours of air-blown gasification and 720 hours of enriched-air or oxygen-blown coal gasification were completed under this particular contract. During these tests, approximately 366 hours of operation with Wyodak, 123 hours with Navajo sub-bituminous coal, 143 hours with Illinois No. 6, 106 hours with SUFCo, 110 hours with Prater Creek, 48 hours with Calumet, and 134 hours with a Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal were completed. In addition, 331 hours of operation on low-rank coals such as North Dakota lignite, Australian brown coal, and a 90 : 10 wt% mixture of lignite and wood waste were completed. Also included in these test campaigns was 50 hours of gasification on a petroleum coke from the Hunt Oil Refinery and an additional 73 hours of operation on a high-ash coal from India. Data from these tests indicate that while acceptable fuel gas heating value was achieved with these fuels, the transport gasifier performs better on the lower-rank feedstocks because of their higher char reactivity. Comparable carbon conversions have been achieved at similar oxygen/coal ratios for both air-blown and oxygen-blown operation for each fuel; however, carbon conversion was lower for the less reactive feedstocks. While separation of fines from the feed coals is not needed with this technology, some testing has suggested that feedstocks with higher levels of fines have resulted in reduced carbon conversion, presumably due to the inability of the finer carbon particles to be captured by the cyclones. These data show that these low-rank feedstocks provided similar fuel gas heating values; however, even among the high-reactivity low-rank coals, the carbon conversion did appear to be lower for the fuels (brown coal in particular) that contained a significant amount of fines. The fuel gas under oxygen-blown operation has been higher in hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentration since the higher steam injection rate promotes the water-gas shift reaction to produce more CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 } at the expense of the CO and water vapor. However, the high water and CO{sub 2 } partial pressures have also significantly reduced the reaction of (Abstract truncated...|$|E

40|$|Aims Accurate {{quantification}} of P {{accumulated in}} plant root systems is difficult since fine roots {{are often not}} recovered from soil. ³³P-labelling of plant root systems in soil may facilitate estimation of total below-ground P accumulation. Methods Canola (Brassica napus) and lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), grown in sand in <b>sealed</b> <b>pots,</b> were fed 33 P-labelled phosphoric acid via the stemusing a wickfeeding technique. Results More ³³P was partitioned to canola roots (51 %) than lupin roots (26 %), although specific activity of roots for the two species was similar (30 – 31 kBq ³³Pmg ³¹P⁻¹) since canola roots had higher ³¹P content than lupin roots (4. 1 cf 2. 3 mg P plant⁻¹). Mean recovery of fed ³³P (250 kBq plant⁻¹) in the whole plant including recovered roots was 84 % 10 days after feeding, and 6 %was sorbed to the wick. Assuming the unrecovered 10 % of ³³P (below the detection limit for soil digestion method used in this study) was within fine roots, then estimated P in unrecovered fine roots represented 15 % of total root system P for canola and 32 % for lupin.

40|$|Background and aims: Measures of {{phosphorus}} (P) in roots {{recovered from}} soil underestimate total P accumulation below-ground by crop species {{since they do}} not account for P in unrecovered (e. g., fine) root materials. ³³P-labelling of plant root systems may allow more accurate estimation of below-ground P input by plants. Methods: Using a stem wick-feeding technique ³³P-labelled phosphoric acid was fed in situ to canola (Brassica napus) and lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) grown in sand or loam soils in <b>sealed</b> <b>pots.</b> Results: Recovery of ³³P was 93 % in the plant-soil system and 7 % was sorbed to the wick. Significantly more ³³P was allocated below-ground than to shoots for both species with 59 - 90 % of ³³P measured in recovered roots plus bulk and rhizosphere soil. ³³P in recovered roots was higher in canola than lupin regardless of soil type. The proportion of ³³P detected in soil was greater for lupin than canola grown in sand and loam (37 and 73 % lupin, 20 and 23 % canola, respectively). Estimated total below-ground P accumulation by both species was at least twice that of recovered root P and was {{a greater proportion of}} total plant P for lupin than canola. Conclusion: Labelling roots using ³³P via stem feeding can empower quantitative estimates of total below-ground plant P and root dry matter accumulation which can improve our understanding of P distribution in soil-plant systems.

Study 1 focused on a pilot project conducted in an irrigation district in Marana, AZ, USA, looking at using Reverse Osmosis (RO) concentrate on Atriplex lentiformis (quailbush) and then harvesting the plant to be tested for its possible use as a supplement in feed for livestock. Three irrigation treatments were tested based on the potential evapotranspiration rate (ET(o)) : (1) plots irrigated at ET(o) adjusted daily via an on-site micrometeorology station; (2) plots irrigated at 1. 5 ET(o) adjusted daily; (3) plots irrigated at a constant rate throughout the year based on the mean of annual ET(o). The plants produced 15 - 24 tons ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ of biomass and could be irrigated at the rate of ET(o), ca. 2 m yr⁻¹ at this location. It was concluded that irrigation of halophyte forage crops provide a viable strategy for extending water supplies and disposing of saline water in arid-zone irrigation districts. Study 2 focused on a field data from Study 1 and two greenhouse experiments. The greenhouse experiments were conducted in 2007 and 2010. The 2010 greenhouse trials, under well-watered conditions, showed that the apparent zero-point-salinity for yield was 47. 3 g L⁻¹ TDS. An additional greenhouse experiment was conducted in which plants in <b>sealed</b> <b>pots</b> were grown to the wilting point on a single application of water. The experiment was conducted at different salinities to see if salinity and water stress were additive factors in reducing yield and Water Use Efficiency (WUE). To the contrary, yield and WUE actually increased as a function of salinity, perhaps due to conversion from C 3 to C 4 photosynthesis over the salinity range (noted in other studies with A. lentiformis). We conclude that xerohalophytes such as A. lentiformis could greatly extend the useful range of salinities under which forage crops can be grown in arid-zone irrigation districts...|$|R
