The research was focused on the analysis of the labour market in Romania in terms of the skills required by the <b>current</b> <b>job.</b> The questions were aimed at studying three main aspects related to the <b>current</b> <b>jobs</b> of Romanian employees: general characteristics (length of service, source of information about <b>current</b> <b>job,</b> the degree of satisfaction related to different aspects of it), mismatches between the level or type of education and job requirements (time to become effective, how they acquired knowledge and skills held, the contribution of education and training to improve performance in <b>current</b> <b>job,</b> over-qualification versus under-qualification, over-education versus under-education), situation in terms of skills held and those required by the workplace (skill obsolescence, skill shortages, skill gap). The results show that even in a crisis period when unemployment is at high values, employers have difficulties in finding appropriate qualifications for some jobs, or the right candidate for the vacancies.

50|$|OS/360 MVT (Multitasking with a Variable {{number of}} Tasks) was an {{enhancement}} that further refined memory use. Instead of using fixed-size memory partitions, MVT allocated memory to regions for job steps as needed, provided enough contiguous physical memory was available. This {{was a significant}} advance over MFT's memory management, but had some weaknesses: if a job allocated memory dynamically (as most sort programs and database management systems do), the programmers had to estimate the job's maximum memory requirement and pre-define it for MVT. A job step that contained a mix of small and large programs wasted memory while the small programs ran. Most seriously, memory could become fragmented, i.e., the memory not used by <b>current</b> <b>jobs</b> could be divided into uselessly small chunks between the areas used by <b>current</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the only remedy was to wait some <b>current</b> <b>jobs</b> finished before starting any new ones.|$|R

One of the findings of this research is ambivalent evaluation on the result of study abroad. They are psychologically satisfied with study abroad as they developed various competencies. However, they are not happy with their <b>current</b> <b>jobs</b> because those jobs don't provide financial stability and fair evaluation on their competencies simultaneously. While the previous research assumed that international students pursued their study with clear and linear career visions, the participants of this research appear to have been developing their career plan as they experience study abroad, <b>job</b> hunting and <b>current</b> <b>job.</b> It is suggested that the knowledge of adult learning should be introduced on the planning of academic programs for international students...|$|R

Both modes of wage determination have generated large bodies of research. We surveyed {{a representative sample}} of U.

A third of the respondents reported bargaining over pay before ac-cepting their <b>current</b> <b>jobs.</b> Almost a third of workers had precise information about pay when they first met with their employers, a sign of wage posting. About 40 percent of workers were on-the-job searchers—they could have remained on their earlier jobs at the time they accepted their <b>current</b> <b>jobs,</b> indicating a more favorable bargaining position than is held by unemployed job-seekers.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} performance measures in promotion decisions. In particular, we examine {{the extent to which}} managers incorporate different performance measures for different types of job assignment. Based on a simple theoretical framework, we predict that, in making promotion decisions, the weight on <b>current</b> <b>job</b> performance decreases with increases in the change in tasks upon promotion, while the weight on subjective assessments of ability increases. This result basically follows from the premise that, with increased changes in tasks between hierarchical levels, the ability to master the <b>current</b> <b>job</b> says little about the ability needed in the next <b>job,</b> which makes <b>current</b> <b>job</b> performance less informative and increases the emphasis on subjective assessments. Using panel data of a retail bank, we find that individual managers behave according to our predictions. By examining the choice of performance measures in promotion decisions, we are able to provide unique insights into the incentive versus sorting roles of promotions, which has important implications for performance measurement and incentive system desig...|$|R

The results suggest that the effects of part time work and nonparticipation on earnings are similar.
