50|$|Molecular {{techniques}} for quantifying telomeric sequences include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), <b>slot</b> <b>blot,</b> horizontal gel electrophoresis, and Contour-clamped homogeneous electric field pulse field gel electrophoresis (CHEF-PFGE). In these techniques, purified genomic DNA is isolated and digested with restriction enzymes, such as HaeIII, HinfI, AluI, Sau3AI, EcoRI, EcoRV, PstI, SstI, BamHI, HindIII or BglII, and quantified by fluorometry.|$|E
50|$|The {{digestion}} of DNA {{into smaller}} fragments by restriction enzymes, separation of variable-sized DNA fragments via electrophoresis, and labeling of fragments containing telomeric DNA using a specific radio- or fluorescently-labeled probe are the essential steps completed within many molecular techniques. In many cases, the DNA fragments are transferred to distinctive membranes before labeling via blotting techniques (i.e. Southern blot). Specialized protocols {{have demonstrated the}} ability to isolate high molecular weight Class III telomeric DNA from Class I and II fragments as well as characterize the size ranges found within each class. The pattern of the telomeric fragments on the stained or labeled membrane is typically unique to the DNA sample (i.e. telomere arrays are rarely identical). Molecular weight markers are usually separated via electrophoresis through agarose gel along with genomic DNA fragments to aid in sizing telomeric arrays and identifying array inter- and intra- individual variability. <b>Slot</b> <b>blot,</b> however, is conducted without DNA fragmentation or separation, rather whole genomic DNA is used to quantify the total concentration of telomeric DNA. The flaw of this technique is {{that the size of}} the labelled DNA molecules cannot be identified. In <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> (or dot blot), total genomic DNA is attached to a membrane and labeled with a telomere-probe that produces a sample-specific chemiluminescence signal, which is captured and quantified by fluorometer equipment and software. A known concentration standard must be labeled and quantified simultaneously in order to accurately determine the telomeric sequence concentration in the DNA samples.|$|E
50|$|A {{dot blot}} (or <b>slot</b> <b>blot)</b> is a {{technique}} in molecular biology used to detect biomolecules, and for detecting, analyzing, and identifying proteins. It represents a simplification of the northern blot, Southern blot, or western blot methods. In a dot blot the biomolecules to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or paper substrate. This differs from the western blot because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically. This is then followed by detection by either nucleotide probes (for a northern blot and southern blot) or antibodies (for a western blot).|$|E
40|$|A type IV {{secretion}} system {{similar to}} the VirB system of the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{is essential for the}} intracellular survival and multiplication of the mammalian pathogen Brucella. Reverse transcriptase–PCR showed that the 12 genes encoding the Brucella suis VirB system form an operon. Semiquantitative measurements of virB mRNA levels by <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> showed that transcription of the virB operon, but not the flanking genes, is regulated by environmental factors in vitro. Flow cytometry used to measure green fluorescent protein expression from the virB promoter confirmed the data from <b>slot</b> <b>blots.</b> Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and fluorescence microscopy showed that the virB promoter is induced in macrophages within 3 h after infection. Induction only occurred once the bacteria were inside the cells, and phagosome acidification was shown to be the major signal inducing intracellular expression. Because phagosome acidification is essential for the intracellular multiplication of Brucella, we suggest that it is the signal that triggers the secretion of unknown effector molecules. These effector molecules {{play a role in the}} remodeling of the phagosome to create the unique intracellular compartment in which Brucella replicates...|$|R

Bacteria were first isolated and concentrated from phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or milk by IMS. After extraction from diluted bacteria culture with the extraction buffer, bacterial DNA was subjected to PCR. <b>Slot</b> <b>blot</b> assay was optimized and used to measure PCR products. The lowest level of detection by this method was 40 cfu/ml in PBS or milk for both pathogens. The whole detection procedure could be completed within 7 h.

The membrane was then immunologically processed before chemiluminescent detection. However, the antisera lacked specificity and cross-reacted with closely related clostridia strains. The specificity of the antisera was increased by adsorbing cross-reactive antibodies from whole antisera with affinity columns made with total proteins from culture supernatants of closely related clostridia.

40|$|Oestrogen {{receptor}} (ER) {{status in}} human breast cancer {{provides the best}} parameter available at present to determine the likely response to endocrine therapy. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for ER expression {{have yet to be}} fully elucidated. In order to examine this we have quantitatively analysed the mRNA and protein levels of ER in 61 patients with primary breast cancer using the techniques of ribonucleic acid (RNA) <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> and immunocytochemistry. Using the H 222 monoclonal antibody, ER staining was observed in 40 cases (65. 5 %) following immunocytochemical assay. RNA <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> using a complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid probe (HEO) revealed ERmRNA to be present in 46 cases (75. 4 %). The mRNA and protein levels of ER were found to be significantly correlated (rs = 0. 753, P < 0. 0001). Exclusion of 15 cases where neither mRNA nor protein was detected still revealed a significant correlation in the remaining 46 cases (rs = 0. 529, P = 0. 0002). In 39 cases sufficient RNA was obtained to allow further filters to be prepared containing larger amounts of RNA. The results obtained in these filters showed high concordance with those obtained originally for these patients (rs = 0. 915, P < 0. 0001), validating the results. Our results suggest that ER expression in primary breast cancer is determined either by transcriptional modulation or by increased transcript stability...|$|R

40|$|Dietary zinc {{deficiency}} increases uroguanylin accumulation in rat kidney. BackgroundZinc deficiency in humans produces a secretory diarrhea that is corrected by zinc supplementation. In rats, differential mRNA display analysis {{has shown that}} intestinal uroguanylin gene expression is increased in {{zinc deficiency}}. An endocrine axis involving intestinal uroguanylin and the kidney may exist. Therefore, we conducted this study to examine whether zinc deficiency would affect uroguanylin expression in the kidney of rats. MethodsA purified diet, deficient or adequate in zinc content, was fed to rats. Preprouroguanylin mRNA was localized in kidney by in situ hybridization, and prouroguanylin/uroguanylin peptides were localized in the kidney by immunohistochemistry. Abundance was measured by Western <b>blotting</b> and <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> analyses. ResultsIn situ hybridization demonstrated that preprouroguanylin mRNA-expressing cells were localized in the proximal tubules, being primarily limited to the cortical-medullary junction. Zinc deficiency did not alter the abundance or distribution of the mRNA. Immunohistochemistry, using a uroguanylin peptide-specific, affinity-purified antibody, demonstrated that immunoreactive uroguanylin peptide was localized to the same cells but that the staining was stronger in zinc-deficient rats. Western blotting analysis of kidney extracts showed {{that there was no}} difference in abundance of prouroguanylin between zinc adequate and deficient rats. However, <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> analysis demonstrated that the abundance of a low molecular weight immunoreactive peptide, presumably uroguanylin, was higher in extracts of zinc-deficient rats. ConclusionThe results suggest that production of prouroguanylin by the kidney, in contrast to the intestine, is not influenced by dietary zinc intake, but that higher amounts of uroguanylin in kidney extracts may reflect renal processing of the hormone obtained from the systemic circulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{originally}} developed a functional assay {{for the detection}} of yessotoxins (YTX) based on its capacity to induce dose-dependent changes in cellular levels of two marker proteins, consisting of E-cadherin and an E-cadherin fragment (ECRA(100)) in epithelial cells. The procedure is time-consuming and we have shortened it by a <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> format, using antibodies recognizing two different epitopes of E-cadherin (HECD- 1 and C 20820), thereby discriminating those markers. The best performing membrane under our conditions, in terms of binding capacity and even absorption of proteins, was a positively charged nylon membrane. Treatment of the membrane with 0. 5 mu g of Ab/ml was appropriate for maximal detection of antigens by our <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> procedure with both HECD- 1 and C 20820 antibodies. The treatment of cells with YTX, resulting in a relative increase in the cellular levels of ECRA 100, led to a dose-dependent increase of the signal detected by Ab HECD- 1 without a concomitant increase in the signal detected by Ab C 20820 in our <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> format, and the concentrations of YTX were correlated to both the increase of the signal detected through Ab HECD- 1 and to the decrease in the ratio of the signals obtained with the two Abs (C 20820 over HECD- 1). Upon analyses of extracts from cells treated with shellfish samples, we could detect and quantify YTX in naturally contaminated materials. The <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> format of our functional assay allows a substantial shortening of its analytical step (about seven hr, as compared to the two working days of the original method), providing YTX measurements that are accurate but show large standard deviations.

40|$|Regulation of gene {{expression}} {{can be analyzed}} {{by a number of}} different techniques. Some techniques monitor the level of specific mRNA directly, and others monitor indirectly by determining the level of enzymes encoded by the mRNA. Each method has its own inherent way of normalization. When results obtained by these techniques are compared between experiments in which differences in growth rates, strains, or stress treatments occur, the normalization procedure may {{have a significant impact on}} the results. In this report we present a solution to the normalization problem in RNA <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> experiments, in which mRNA levels routinely are normalized to a fixed amount of extracted total RNA. The cellular levels of specific mRNA species were estimated using a renormalization with the total RNA content per cell. By a combination of fluorescence in situ rRNA hybridization, which estimates the relative level of rRNA per cell, and <b>slot</b> <b>blotting</b> to rRNA probes, which estimates the level of rRNA per extracted total RNA, the amount of RNA per cell was calculated in a series of heat shock experiments with the gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis. It was found that the level of rRNA per cell decreased to 30 % in the course of the heat shock. This lowered ribosome level led to a decrease in the total RNA content, resulting in a gradually increasing overestimation of the mRNA levels throughout the experiment. Using renormalized cellular mRNA levels, the HrcA-mediated regulation of the genes in the hrcA-grpE-dnaK operon was analyzed. The hybridization data suggested a complex heat shock regulation indicating that the mRNA levels continued to rise after 30 min, but after renormalization the calculated average cellular levels exhibited a much simpler induction pattern, eventually attaining a moderately increased value...|$|R

40|$|Background: Control and {{elimination}} of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) {{can be accelerated}} {{through the use of}} diagnostic tests that are more accurate and easier to deploy. The goal of this work was to evaluate the immuno-reactivity of antigens and identify candidates to be considered for development of a simple serological test for the detection of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense infections, ideally both. Methodology/Principal Findings: The reactivity of 35 antigens was independently evaluated by <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> and ELISA against sera from both T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infected patients and controls. The antigens that were most reactive by both tests to T. b. gambiense sera were the membrane proteins VSG LiTat 1. 3, VSG LiTat 1. 5 and ISG 64. Reactivity to T. b. rhodesiense sera was highest with VSG LiTat 1. 3, VSG LiTat 1. 5 and SRA, although much lower than with T. b. gambiense samples. The reactivity of all possible combinations of antigens was also calculated. When the <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> results of 2 antigens were paired, a VSG LiTat 1. 3 - ISG 75 combination performed best on T. b. gambiense sera, while a VSG LiTat 1. 3 -VSG LiTat 1. 5 combination was the most reactive using ELISA. A combination of SRA and either VSG LiTat 1. 3 or VSG LiTat 1. 5 had the highest reactivity on T. b. rhodesiense sera according to <b>slot</b> <b>blot,</b> while in ELISA, pairing SRA with either GM 6 or VSG LiTat 1. 3 yielded the best results. Conclusions: This study identified antigens that were highly reactive to T. b. gambiense sera, which could be considered for developing a serological test for gambiense HAT, either individually or in combination. Antigens with potential for inclusion in a test for T. b. rhodesiense HAT were also identified, but because their reactivity was comparatively lower, a search for additional antigens would be required before developing a test for this form of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the biochemical and cell biologic characteristics of flies expressing two novel dominant alleles of the major rhodopsin encoding gene neither inactivation nor afterpotential E (ninaE) in a heterozygous background. Methods: Presence of the deep pseudopupil in flies was assayed 5 days post eclosion. For structural analysis, 1 -μm-retinal cross sections were obtained from fixed and resin-embedded Drosophila heads. Confocal microscopy was performed on dissected retinas stained with antibodies specific for rhodopsin, NinaA, and F-actin. Rhodopsin levels were determined by western and <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. Results: Dominant rhodopsin mutants showed progressive age-dependent and light-independent loss of the deep pseudopupil, without any apparent retinal degeneration at the morphological level. Expression of mutant rhodopsin caused rhodopsin to mislocalize to the cell body and the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Mutant rhodopsin also caused loss of solubility of wild-type rhodopsin and its accumulation presumably as a high molecular mass complex in the photoreceptor cell body. Conclusions: In heterozygous mutant flies, there is loss of wild-type rhodopsin immunoreactivity on a western assay but less reduction using <b>slot</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. This suggests that mutant rhodopsin is likely inducing the misfolding and insolubility of wild-type rhodopsin.
