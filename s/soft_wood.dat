Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavian {{countries}} we {{find some}} very early work of excellent design. In the Christiania Museum {{there are some}} fine chairs Scandina, of the 9th or 10th centuries carved with that particular vian work flat and broad treatment of scroll and strapwork so eminently suited to <b>soft</b> <b>wood.</b> In the Copenhagen Museum there are panels from Iceland in the same style. The celebrated wooden doorways of Aal (AD. 1200), Sauland, Flaa, Solder and other Norwegian churches (Christiania Museum) are only an elaboration of the same treatment of dragons and intricate scroll work, a style which we still see carried on in the door-posts of the 15th century in the Nordiska museum, Stockholm, and in the Icelandic work of quite modern times. In these early days the leaf was not much developed in design. The carver depended almost entirely on the stalk, a style of work which has its counterpart in Burmese work of the 17th century.|$|E

2500|$|Oaxacan {{artisans}} {{are noted}} {{for the quality}} of their work and business success; however, the industry still faces challenges. There is little to no local demand for products because commercially made equivalents are cheaper and often easier to use. This means that artisans are almost completely dependent on tourism to keep traditions alive. [...] The success of Oaxacan crafts has put strains on the availability of raw materials. One example of this is the over-exploitation of copal trees, whose <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> is preferred by alebrije carvers. Another challenge is the introduction of cheaper imitations of products, generally from China. To date, few handcraft products in all of Mexico have been eligible for certification to guarantee authenticity.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{included}} on the Second Supply were the first non-English settlers. [...] The company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and ‘deal’ — planks, especially <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> planks) and naval stores (pitch, turpentine, and tar). Among these additional settlers were eight [...] "Dutch-men" [...] (consisting of unnamed craftsmen and three who were probably the wood-mill-men — Adam, Franz and Samuel) [...] "Dutch-men" [...] (probably meaning German or German-speakers), Polish and Slovak craftsmen, who had been hired by the Virginia Company of London's leaders to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. There has been debate about the nationality of the specific craftsmen, and both the Germans and Poles claim the glassmaker for one of their own, but the evidence is insufficient. Ethnicity is further {{complicated by the fact}} that the German minority in Royal Prussia lived under Polish control during this period.

[...] This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440mm long, which is often made with walnut. [...] Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound. [...] Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum. [...] Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand {{on the side of the}} drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called , , or [...] (daouli switch).

[...] These thin sticks are often made from <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> such as willow or cornel.|$|E
2500|$|Early freight {{operations}} {{consisted of}} trains {{of fewer than}} twenty cars, for the cars were weak and the locomotives small. The hilly terrain over which the BR routes ran posed problems, especially {{in the days before}} steel rolling stock. To negotiate these grades, the railroad needed to use helpers and pushers. If the second (or third) engine were put {{at the head of the}} train, then too much weight aft might result in a broken coupler and the lethal problem of a runaway. If the additional power were at the back end, then the <b>soft</b> <b>wood</b> cars tended to buckle under the compression. Occasionally, a compromise would put the helper locomotive at or near the center of the train. Using helpers brought an additional problem. Since these engines were needed only on steeper grades and since the railroad would never countenance the expense of a second engine and crew on the entire run, the helpers had to return to the bottom of the grade for the next heavy train needing a push. At first, this meant running backward after uncoupling from the rear of the train. The BR discouraged backward running as bad practice, a problem that eventually was solved with the construction of wyes for turning around. Additionally, care had to be exercised to avoid placing a caboose between a pusher and a train, as this crushed the soft cabooses.|$|E

2500|$|Firing a [...] bullet at [...] from a [...] barrel, the 6mm U.S.N. was the highest-velocity {{cartridge}} used by {{any military}} {{force at the}} time of its adoption.

[...] The new loading had an effective range (individual rifle fire) of around 600-700 yards, at which point the blunt-tip bullet rapidly lost velocity and energy. [...] The [...] bullet, like its predecessor, demonstrated an inclination to instability unless rapidly rotated. The M1895 Lee rifle therefore received a rapid barrel rifling twist of one turn in 7.5 inches (19cm) (with right-hand twist) to keep the bullet from wobbling or tumbling at extended ranges. At some point, this rifling was changed in later production rifles to one turn in 10 inches RH (25cm). [...] Contemporary medical reports of the day noted the [...] bullet produced noticeably greater damage to tissue and bone than other military cartridges of the day when fired at full velocity (2,560 fps), and the bullet's copper jacket frequently fragmented or detached entirely from its lead core after penetrating a hard substance such as bone or metal. On the other hand, when the 6mm bullet struck muscle or air-filled cavities such as the lungs, the bullet tended to make a perforating wound of small diameter that caused little damage.|$|E
