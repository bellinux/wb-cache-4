5|$|The Russian {{unmanned}} resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} female employment in QIZs {{are yet to}} be quantified, and there is <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that over time, Jordanian women may have difficulty in achieving higher wages {{in a global economy}} where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{began as a}} subtropical cyclone over the central Atlantic and became a hurricane while moving westward toward the United States. Lili did not gain any additional strength before curving away from land and weakening into a tropical storm. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane's effects on land were minimal, despite multiple tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Initial uncertainty in its track prompted <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> of a landfall in North Carolina, but it remained predominately over the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Internet {{searches}} {{for information on}} suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, either with pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards. The Internet, however, may also help prevent suicide by providing a social group {{for those who are}} isolated.|$|E
5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E

5|$|The murders {{received}} {{a large amount}} of media attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that the level of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. The murders also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that {{areas of}} the Moss have been damaged or partly {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} agricultural activity, including the digging of drainage ditches. Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing ones should not be deepened, and that the area should not be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as {{to the ability of}} the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E

5|$|Crane and Kauffman pitched their {{original}} idea to network NBC in December 1993. NBC liked it and commissioned a complete script, which was submitted in March 1994. Before the script was finished, casting {{for the six}} main roles began; 75 actors were seen for each part. The pilot was taped on May 4, 1994 at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. After making final edits to the episode, executive producer Kevin Bright submitted it on May 11, two days before NBC was due to announce the schedule. Satisfied with the completed pilot, NBC ordered 12 more episodes for the first season. The episode was watched by approximately 22million viewers, making it the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week. Critics compared the show unfavorably to Seinfeld and Ellen, noting the similarities all three series had in depicting friends conversing about their lives. The cast, particularly Schwimmer, were complimented, though there was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that the character roles were undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that under him {{there might be a}} drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, {{other than the fact that}} it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team <b>some</b> <b>concern,</b> and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E

5|$|The {{total number}} of blue {{wildebeest}} {{is estimated to be}} around 1,550,000. The population trend overall is stable and the numbers in the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) have increased to about 1,300,000. The population density ranges from 0.15/km2 in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park where they are most plentiful. Blue wildebeest have also been introduced into a number of private game farms, reserves and conservancy areas. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. However, the numbers of the eastern white-bearded wildebeest (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline in numbers to a current level of probably 6,000 to 8,000 animals and this is causing <b>some</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
5|$|There was {{an element}} naming {{controversy}} {{as to what}} the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (symbol Uns) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not nielsbohrium, since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, bohrate and borate. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium should be called bohriates to avoid confusion.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. <b>Some</b> <b>concern</b> existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as the military}} secretary to Sir John Byng, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, and in July 1831 became the State Secretary to the Marquess of Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed over for the position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> among Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to {{be a candidate for}} the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to have}} materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely expected to become his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|In about 1143 Foliot {{wrote an}} account of the {{proceedings}} of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo. According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, Edith-Matilda, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused <b>some</b> <b>concern,</b> although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because Anselm of Canterbury had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the Angevin cause, as Matilda's claim was known.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to traverse {{the asteroid belt}} was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015. On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, {{the odds of a}} probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.|$|E
