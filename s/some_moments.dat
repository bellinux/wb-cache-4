He also set three days of national mourning, from March 31 to April 2. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires Province (birthplace of Alfonsín), also announced a provincial mourning. Almost a thousand people attended, and at <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> they sang the Argentine National Anthem.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide <b>some</b> <b>moments.</b> On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E

25|$|Nehru {{sought to}} {{initiate}} a more direct dialogue between the peoples of China and India in culture and literature. Around that time, the famous Indian artist (painter) Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, who had earlier decorated {{the pages of the}} original Constitution of India, was sent to China in 1957 on a Government of India fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. Noted Indian scholar Rahul Sankrityayan and diplomat Natwar Singh were also there, and Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan paid a visit to PRC. Between 1957 and 1959, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha not only disseminated Indian art in PRC but also became skilled in Chinese painting and lacquer-work. He also spent time with great masters Qi Baishi, Li Keran, Li Kuchan as well as <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Consequently, up until 1959, despite border skirmishes, Chinese leaders amicably had assured India that there was no territorial controversy.|$|E
500|$|Scott Weinberg from FEARnet {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review by claiming it is, [...] "Arguably the most accomplished feature from the late Charles B. Pierce," [...] and [...] "while the movie offers a slightly stodgy 'voice-over' narration and <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> that seem plucked straight out of '1970s police procedural 101', including a few painful moments of cop-related comic relief, it also delivers some legitimately effective atmosphere, several cool character actors doing fine work, {{and a handful of}} sincerely creepy moments." ...|$|E

500|$|In a DVD {{review of}} the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2.5/5 and added: [...] "Lisa {{develops}} much of her future personality in this episode. The family dynamic is starting to fall into place, as {{is the relationship between}} Homer and Lisa." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "overall, this was a pretty drab episode" [...] and added that [...] "it had <b>some</b> <b>moments,</b> such as the videogame boxing matches between Homer and Bart, but Lisa lacked the strength at this point to carry an entire show." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the fifth}} season and Castiel's more {{frequent}} interactions with humans, Collins commented, [...] "Obviously the big joke is that he doesn't understand human beings and how they behave. And there is something inherently funny in that, especially if he's the straight man." [...] The actor noted {{he was a little}} hesitant at making the character into [...] "the funny guy", and was apprehensive about <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> in the early episodes of the season. However, he believes the writers have found [...] "the line", allowing for the jokes to be [...] "more subtle" [...] and [...] "a little more believable".|$|E

However, Aoki admitted the art is [...] "quite nice, and there are <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> of genuine tenderness and humor."

He {{called it a}} [...] "crude concoction sewn together from the severed parts of prior horror/serial killer pics." [...] He called the screenplay [...] "convoluted," [...] criticizing the use of [...] "flashbacks within flashbacks" [...] and red herrings. He described the film as being [...] "too hyperbolic to be genuinely disturbing." [...] Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review saying the film [...] "combined B-movie acting with a twisted mind-set and visual tricks designed to camouflage cheap effects" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "terrifying at <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> and insinuatingly creepy at many others." [...] She called the killing scenes [...] "amazingly evocative for such a low-budget movie." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1954, Waters {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio with his band to record the song. Considered the classic Chicago blues band, music critic Bill Janovitz described Waters' group as [...] "a who's who of bluesmen". [...] Waters sings and plays electric guitar along with Rogers, blues harmonica virtuoso Little Walter, and drummer Elgin Evans, {{all of whom had}} been performing with Waters since 1951. [...] (Fred Below, who replaced Evans during 1954, is sometimes listed as the drummer.) [...] Pianist Otis Spann, who joined in 1953, and Dixon, in his debut on double bass for Waters' recording session, round out the group. [...] Two takes of the song were recorded. [...] Although there are <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> in the alternate take when a player's timing rushes or drags perceptibly, because the band is so tight, the difference with the master is only six seconds (for a nearly three-minute song).|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad thought the finale's theme of Will and Grace's connection {{to each other}} was well-presented by director James Burrows. Keller added, [...] "While not as satisfying as, say, the Friends finale or as crushing as the Seinfeld finale, the series finale to Will & Grace did have its moments {{and came back to}} the original concept of friendship among a close group of people. There were <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> where I did laugh out loud, but they were few." [...] CHUD.com's David Oliver praised the finale for not having characters [...] "go on wild tangents that betray who they were during the entirety of the show's run." [...] He also commented that Messing and McCormack are [...] "affecting in their performances" [...] and the episode [...] "nicely summarizes [...] friendship {{over the course of the}} entire show." ...|$|E

500|$|Kenshin's {{development}} in the Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection OVA series has received negative reviews by many publications. Anime News Network also adds that in Reflection he [...] "continues to be his old mopey self" [...] and criticizes {{the fact that he}} never says [...] "oro", while IGN felt that <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> of the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru were depressing. While criticizing the characters' sad decisions, Serdar Yegulalp from About.com wondered whether the OVAs had to make viewers accept Kenshin's death wish after so much time of wandering and feeling a mortal disease. However, some reviewers noted Kenshin's personality in the OVAs {{was one of the most}} complex ever to be animated remarking on the fact that he can not forget his bloody past, despite having a peaceful life. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kenshin's family became. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe shared similar feelings, but noted Kenshin had no new enemies to fight after Enishi, leaving him with his disease story arc.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months prior}} to its broadcast, an {{incomplete}} version of the pilot was released through BitTorrent clients, fueling speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. Executive producer Burk denied the claims, saying that [...] "we hate putting anything out there until it's done, and that's really the reason why you guys didn't get any advance copies". Abrams {{said that while the}} production crew [...] "freaked out" [...] about the leak, he was pleased that the [...] "response has been much more positive than not, especially for something that wasn't completed yet". The broadcast version of the pilot had new scenes added while other scenes were removed; Abrams also said that there was [...] "tightening and moving <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> here and there", and the ending was entirely different. Burk also stated that the composer, Michael Giacchino, had not finished his score {{at the time of the}} leak, and the most of the featured music was temp music. A variation of a piece of Giacchino's music called [...] "Hollywood and Vines" [...] used in the pilot was originally featured on Lost, as it was created for that show, also created by Abrams.|$|E
500|$|... "The F Word" [...] was {{considered}} particularly controversial, even by South Park standards {{due to the}} excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "fag". The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "The F Word" [...] marks a return of South Parks tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said [...] "The F Word" [...] served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not. Ramsey Isler of IGN compared [...] "The F Word" [...] to [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson", an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur [...] "nigger". However, Isler said [...] "The F Word" [...] was not as skillfully crafted as the [...] "Jesse Jackson" [...] episode and, although <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> were entertaining, the episode [...] "had a habit of running some gags into the ground". James Hibberd, of The Live Feed, said he found the episode [...] "well-intended and funny", and that it forced viewers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, [...] "This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said the word [...] "fag" [...] has not lost its associations with homosexuals, so she did not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode [...] "preachy", and said, [...] "It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs." ...|$|E

500|$|Former Living Single star T. C. Carson {{was hired}} as Eugene Dix. Carson {{identified}} his role as [...] "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has {{a change of heart}} as the corpses begin to pile up." [...] The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his [...] "originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." [...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E

He quotes from Longinus: [...] "For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears." ...|$|E

He noted {{the difficulty of the}} video game and again compared it to Minecraft and DayZ, saying the player will get used to the Game Over screen. Mitch Dyer (IGN) criticised Rust, saying it's a semi-broken game that's difficult to recommend due to the challenging and frustrating gameplay, but later in the review, Dyer said there were <b>some</b> <b>moments</b> that made the game unforgettable and more interesting than its inspiration.|$|E
