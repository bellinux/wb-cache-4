5000|$|The organ is {{the only}} one in the world to have <b>stops</b> {{standing}} <b>on</b> 100 inches wind pressure.

There are two more organs in the world with <b>stops</b> <b>on</b> 50 inches, but these are 8-foot; solo trumpet or tuba stops. 100 inches wind pressure (equivalent to 3.56 psi or 0.25 bars) is about 30 times more than a normal organ stop (even high-pressure stops usually only stand on 10 to 12 inches).

40|$|This report {{establishes}} {{an industry}} knowledge base for existing anchoring and mooring techniques {{as applied to}} wave energy conversion (WEC) devices in and around Oregon. This report <b>on</b> <b>anchoring</b> and mooring techniques {{is derived from the}} cumulative experiences of engineers and scientists with many years of experience analyzing, designing and installing structures in the ocean subjected to significant environmental forces. It is not intended to be a complete design procedure but to provide the user with practical guidance <b>on</b> <b>anchors</b> and mooring techniques and sources of reliable design information necessary to the design of WEC devices suited to the coast of Oregon...|$|R
40|$|The uplift test <b>on</b> <b>anchor</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in geo-anchorage, and is the essential component of the specification. A comparison of the existing specifications <b>on</b> the <b>anchor</b> detection in domestic has been made in this paper, from which the appropriate ones are selected to determine the conditions about loading and test termination. The uplift resistance and relevant parameters of anchor are obtained from the basic and acceptance experiment of some project <b>on</b> anti-floating <b>anchor,</b> which provides reference for the design of anti-floating engineering; then the analysis on the deflection of anchor is made to validate the design...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} often {{described}} by multivariate functions, {{which are usually}} approximated by a sum of lower dimensional functions. A major problem is the approximation error introduced and the factors that affect it. This paper investigates the error of approximating a multivariate function by a sum of lower dimensional functions {{in the setting of}} high dimensional model representations. Two kinds of approximations are studied, namely, the approximation based on the ANOVA (analysis of variance) decomposition and the approximation based <b>on</b> the <b>anchored</b> decomposition. We prove new theorems for the expected errors of approximations based <b>on</b> <b>anchored</b> decomposition when the anchor is chosen randomly and establish the relationship of the expected approximation errors with the global sensitivity indices of Sobol’. The expected approximation error give indications on how good or how bad could be the approximation based <b>on</b> <b>anchored</b> decomposition and when the approximation is good or bad. The influence of the <b>anchor</b> <b>on</b> the goodness of approximation is studied. Methods for choosing good anchors are presented. ...|$|R

If the tie involved concurrently with the bonus spin, they'll get another spin-off, but no more money to be won.|$|R
