5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the <b>subgraph</b> isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a <b>subgraph</b> of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced <b>subgraph</b> of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E

40|$|The {{output of}} {{frequent}} pattern mining {{is a huge}} number of frequent patterns, which are very redundant, causing a serious problem in understandability. We focus on mining frequent <b>subgraphs</b> for which well-considered approaches to reduce the redundancy are limited because of the complex nature of graphs. Two known, standard solutions are closed and maximal frequent <b>subgraphs,</b> but closed frequent <b>subgraphs</b> are still redundant and maximal frequent <b>subgraphs</b> are too specific. A more promising solution is δ-tolerance closed frequent <b>subgraphs,</b> which decrease monotonically in δ, being equal to maximal frequent <b>subgraphs</b> and closed frequent <b>subgraphs</b> for δ= 0 and 1, respectively. However, the current algorithm for mining δ-tolerance closed frequent <b>subgraphs</b> is a naive, two-step approach in which frequent <b>subgraphs</b> are all enumerated and then sifted according to δ-tolerance closedness. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the idea of “reverse-search” by which the completeness of enumeration is guaranteed and for which new pruning conditions are incorporated. We empirically demonstrate that our approach significantly reduced the amount of real computation time of two compared algorithms for mining δ-tolerance closed frequent <b>subgraphs,</b> being pronounced more for practical settings...|$|R

5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a <b>subgraph)</b> is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every <b>subgraph</b> of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a general approach {{of determining the}} distribution of spanning <b>subgraphs</b> in the random graph (n,p). In particular, we determine the distribution of spanning <b>subgraphs</b> of certain given degree sequences, which is a generalisation of the d-factors, of spanning triangle-free <b>subgraphs,</b> of (directed) Hamilton cycles and of spanning <b>subgraphs</b> that are isomorphic to a collection of vertex disjoint (directed) triangles.

We use triadic <b>subgraphs</b> in the structural network along with their corresponding functional reconstructions to study how the surrounding local circuitry may influence FP and FN location. From this, we can determine which <b>subgraphs</b> may promote local information flow and which may be prone to information loss.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{there exist}} -clique-free graphs of {{arbitrarily}} large chromatic number, the Henson graphs have infinite chromatic number.

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every <b>subgraph</b> of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every <b>subgraph</b> of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{injective}} homomorphism from G to H (i.e., {{one that}} never maps distinct vertices to one vertex) if {{and only if}} G is a <b>subgraph</b> of H.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a <b>subgraph</b> a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
40|$|An {{undirected graph}} G {{is called a}} VPT graph {{if it is the}} vertex {{intersection}} graph of a family of paths in a tree. The class of graphs which admit a VPT representation in a host tree with maximum degree at most h is denoted by [h, 2, 1]. The classes [h, 2, 1] are closed by taking induced <b>subgraphs,</b> therefore each one can be characterized by a family of minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs.</b> In this paper we associate the minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1] which are VPT with (color) h-critical graphs. We describe how to obtain minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> from critical graphs, even more, we show that the family of graphs obtained using our procedure is exactly the family of VPT minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1]. The members of this family together with the minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> for VPT, are the minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1], with h≥ 3. Notice that by taking h= 3 we obtain a characterization by minimal forbidden induced <b>subgraphs</b> of the class VPT ∩ EPT=EPT ∩ Chordal=[3, 2, 2]=[3, 2, 1]...|$|R

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected <b>subgraph</b> in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced <b>subgraph</b> of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E
