50|$|Bromus hordeaceus, soft brome, is {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} species of {{grass in the}} true grass family (Poaceae). It is also known in North America as bull grass, soft cheat, and <b>soft</b> <b>chess.</b>|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows on}} the Makua-Keaau and Kaluaa-Lualualei Summit Ridges {{of the central}} Waianae Mountains. The habitat is lower-elevation moist grassland. The plants grow in deep soil and in cracks in steep rock cliffs. The {{surrounding}} ground has a layer of mosses and lichens. The area has been invaded by non-native species of grasses including <b>soft</b> <b>chess</b> (Bromus mollis) and annual fescue (Vulpia spp.). Another source of habitat degradation is the mountains' population of feral goats, which scale the slopes, breaking up the soil and causing erosion.|$|E
50|$|Two plant {{communities}} each comprise {{about half}} of the Alhambra Creek watershed, coastal oak woodlands on north and east facing slopes and California annual grassland on drier high ridges and west and south facing slopes. The most common trees found in the oak woodlands are coast live oak, blue oak, valley oak, California bay laurel, toyon, and buckeye. In these woodlands, a wide variety of other plants grow beneath the trees, forming an understory. These plants include a variety of native and introduced grasses, herbaceous forbs, and small shrubs. Among the more common native understory plants are purple needle grass, <b>soft</b> <b>chess</b> grass, California yarrow, and poison oak. Native grasses that evolved over millions of years once dominated the grasslands of California. But changes in the fire frequency and intensity, the introduction of competitive grasses from the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and changes in the way the grasslands were grazed by animals led to a complete conversion in the species make-up of our grasslands. Now annual grasses introduced from Europe dominate California’s grasslands, while the native grasses cover only a minor fraction of the grassland area. The grasslands of the Alhambra Creek watershed support a wide array of wildflowers as well. Many of these wildflowers grow best when grazed moderately by wildlife and livestock.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 52 plant species were {{identified}} {{at the line}} transects of which 49 belonged to the ground strata. Species frequently observed included ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), creeping wild rye (Leymus triticoides), bur chervil (Anthriscus caucalis), Mexican spangletop (Leptochloa uninervia), Santa Barbara sedge (Carex barbarae), <b>soft</b> <b>chess</b> brome (Bromus hordeaceus), mugwort (Artemesia douglasiana), California blackberry (Rubus ursinus), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor), sandbar willow (Salix exigua), red willow (Salix laevigata), and box elder (Acer negundo). Non-native species represented {{more than half of}} the richness (27 species).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Presentation date: 1994 - 03 - 21 This {{research}} {{examined the}} biology of barb goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis L.) a weedy annual grass that is invading the rangelands of California. Germination and root growth characteristics of barb goatgrass were compared to <b>soft</b> <b>chess</b> (Bromis mollis L.), medusahead rye (Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski), slender wild oats (Avena barbata L.), and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterrraneum L.) to determine what advantages barb goatgrass might have when establishing in a plant community. Barb goatgrass germinated under {{a wide range of}} temperatures, between 5 and 25 C. This was a wider temperature range than associated species. Root growth rates under greenhouse conditions that simulate spring conditions on California annual grasslands were greatest for barb goatgrass and slender wild oats. Rooting area observed in glass sided boxes was greatest for goatgrass. Barb goatgrass populations increased with sheep grazing. Increasing grazing pressure resulted in increasing goatgrass density. Barb goatgrass invades both grazed and ungrazed pastures however higher density of this noxious weed was found in grazed pastures. Barb goatgrass can be controlled with 1. 12 kg ai/ha glyphosate (Roundup) but desirable plant species will likely need to be reseeded to occupy the site...|$|E
40|$|At two field {{sites that}} {{differed}} in fertility, we investigated how species richness, functional group diversity, and species composition of constructed plant communities influenced invasion. Grassland communities were constructed {{to be either}} functionally diverse or functionally simple based on belowground resource use patterns of constituent species. Communities were also constructed with different numbers of species (two or five) to examine interactions between species richness, functional diversity and invasion resistance. We hypothesized that communities with more complementary belowground resource use (i. e., more species rich and more functionally diverse communities) would be less easily invaded than communities with greater degrees of belowground resource use overlap. Two contrasting invasive species were introduced: an early-season, shallow rooting annual grass, Bromus hordeaceus (<b>soft</b> <b>chess),</b> and a late-season, deep rooting annual forb, Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle). Invader responses to species richness and functional diversity treatments differed between sites. In general, the more similar the patterns of belowground resource use between residents of the plant community and the invader, the poorer the invader’s performance. Complementarity or overlap of resource use among species in the constructed communities appeared to affect invader success less than complementarity or overlap of resource use between the invader and the species present in the community...|$|E
40|$|Natural product {{herbicides}} for vegetation {{control are}} being considered as alternatives to synthetic herbicides by many public agencies. Studies were conducted along roadsides at the Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) in 2001 and 2002 and on California State Route 29 (SR 29) in 2002 to evaluate acetic acid, pine oil, and plant essentials compared with glyphosate {{for control of}} herbaceous vegetation. In 2001, annual grass control after a single application of pine oil at HREC was 40 % or less effective, whereas acetic acid was at least 79 % effective. A second application of pine oil or acetic acid did not control regrowth or new plants. In 2002, plant essentials was the most effective (. 80 %) natural product at HREC for control of annual grasses, except slender oat. Pine oil often provided similar control of slender oat as plant essentials (71 and 69 %, respectively). At SR 29, five applications of acetic acid provided 83 % or better control of slender oat, hare barley, medusahead, and broadleaf filaree. Plant essentials and pine oil controlled hairy vetch, broadleaf filaree, and hare barley at least 83 %, but yellow starthistle, <b>soft</b> <b>chess,</b> buckhorn plantain, and medusahead control never exceeded 85 %. Glyphosate controlled all vegetation in these experiments {{with one or two}} applications. The cost of one or more applications of the natural products was greater than 10 times the cost of using one or two applications of glyphosate. Natural products were neither efficaciously nor economically comparable with glyphosate for control of annual roadside vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L. cv Woogenellup) and <b>soft</b> <b>chess</b> grass (Bromus mollis L. cv Blando) {{were grown}} in monocultures with 15 NH 4 Cl {{added to the}} soil to study {{nitrogen}} movement during regrowth following shoot removal. Four clipping treatments were imposed. Essentially all available 15 N was assimilated from the soil prior to the first shoot harvest. Measurements of total reduced nitrogen and 15 N contained within that nitrogen fraction in roots, crowns, and shoots at each harvest showed large, significant (P ≤ 0. 001) declines in excess 15 N of crowns and roots in both species {{between the first and}} fourth harvests. There was no significant decline in total reduced nitrogen in the same organs over that period. Similar responses were evident in plants defoliated three times. The simplest interpretation of these data is that reduced nitrogen compounds turn over in plant roots and crowns during shoot regrowth. Calculations for grass and clover plants clipped four times during the growing season indicated that 100 to 143 % of the nitrogen present in crowns and roots turned over between the first and fourth shoot harvest in both species, assuming nitrogen in those organs was replaced with nitrogen containing the lowest available concentration of 15 N. If other potential sources of nitrogen were used for the calculations, it was necessary to postulate that larger amounts of total nitrogen flowed through the crown and root to produce the measured dilution of 15 N compounds. These data provide the first quantitative estimates of the amount of internal nitrogen used by plants, in addition to soil nitrogen or N 2, to regenerate shoots after defoliation...|$|E
