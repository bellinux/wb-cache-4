40|$|<b>Slow</b> speed <b>slew</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are widely}} used in many {{applications}} such us radar, aviation and aerospace units, bogie bearings for vehicles, harbor and shipyard cranes. <b>Slew</b> <b>bearings</b> are design to carry out high axial and radial loads, they have high titling rigidity and they lubricated with grease. <b>Slew</b> <b>bearings</b> consist of the rollers, the inner and the outer ring and the gear in general.

40|$|Diagnostics and prognostics in {{rotating}} machinery {{is a subject}} of much on-going research. There are three approaches to diagnostics and prognostics. These include experience-based approaches, data-driven techniques and model-based techniques. Bayesian data-driven techniques are gaining widespread application in diagnostics and prognostics of mechanical and allied systems including <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings,</b> {{as a result of}} their ability to handle the stochastic nature of the measured data well. The aim of the study is to detect incipient damage of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings</b> and develop diagnostics which will be robust under changing operating conditions. Further it is required to explore and develop an optimal prognostic model for the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings.</b> This research develops a novel integrated nonlinear method for the effective feature extraction from acoustic emission (AE) signals and the construction of a degradation assessment index (DAI), which is subsequently used for the fault diagnostics of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings.</b> A <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearing</b> test rig was developed to measure AE data under variable operational conditions. The proposed novel DAI obtained by the integration of the PKPCA (polynomial kernel principal component analysis), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is shown to be effective and suitable for monitoring the degradation of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings</b> and is robust under variable operating conditions. Furthermore, this study integrates the novel DAI into alternative Bayesian methods for the prediction of RUL. The DAI is used as input in several Bayesian regression models such as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), Bayesian linear regression (BLR), Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and the Gaussian process regression (GPR) for RUL prediction. The combination of the DAI with the GPR model, otherwise, known as the DAI-GPR gives the best prediction. The findings show that the GPR model is suitable and effective in the prediction of RUL of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings</b> and robust to varying operating conditions. Further, the models are also robust when the training and tests sets are obtained from dependent and independent samples. Finally, an optimal GPR for the prediction of RUL of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings</b> based on a DAI is developed. The model performance is evaluated for cases where the training and test samples from cross validation approach are dependent as well as when they are independent. The optimal GPR is obtained from the integration or combination of existing simple mean and covariance functions in order to capture the observed trend of the bearing degradation as well as the irregularities in the data. The resulting integrated GPR model provides an excellent fit to the data and improvements over the simple GPR models that are based on simple mean and covariance functions. In addition, it achieves a near zero percentage error prediction of the RUL of <b>slow</b> rotating <b>bearings</b> when the training and test sets are from dependent samples but slightly different values when the estimation is based on independent samples. These findings are robust under varying operating conditions such as loading and speed. The proposed methodology can be applied to nonlinear and non-stationary machine response signals and is useful for preventive machine maintenance purposes.

This paper also investigates another potential MM operator, namely gradient operator. Two common time domain features in bearing condition monitoring, namely root mean square (RMS) and kurtosis, were extracted from the processed signal. The study shows that the changes in bearing condition can be clearly detected from the extracted features (RMS and kurtosis) of the MM operators compared to RMS and kurtosis features extracted from the original vibration signal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic emission-based method for the condition monitoring of low speed reversible slew bearings. Several acoustic emission (AE) hit parameters as the monitoring parameters {{for the detection}} of impending failure of slew bearings are reviewed first. The review focuses on: (1) the application of AE in typical rolling element bearings running at different speed classifications, i. e. high speed (3 ̆e 600 rpm), low speed (10 - 600 rpm) and very low speed (3 ̆c 10 3 ̆erpm); (2) the commonly used AE hit parameters in rolling element bearings and (3) AE signal processing, feature extraction and pattern recognition methods. In the experiment, impending failure of the <b>slew</b> <b>bearing</b> was detected by the AE hit parameters after the new bearing had run continuously for approximately 15 months. The <b>slew</b> <b>bearing</b> was then dismantled and the evidence of the early defect was analysed. Based on the result, we propose a feature extraction method of the AE waveform signal using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) algorithm and demonstrate that the LLE feature can detect the sign of failure earlier than the AE hit parameters with improved prediction of the progressive trend of the defect...|$|E

40|$|As wind {{turbines}} get larger, nacelle structure that is carried by yaw bearings becomes heavier. In order to bear these increasing loads, yaw bearing {{needs to have}} more than one row of rolling elements which cause increase in weight and consequently the cost of the yaw bearing in classical design [1]. As the industry trends demand larger and larger {{wind turbines}}, the <b>slew</b> <b>bearing</b> costs keep increasing. In addition to cost, slew bearings suffer other reliability problems in very large turbines. As the turbine size keeps increasing both overall nacelle weight and wind loads acting on the yaw system (radial, axial and moment loads) get very large. During operation these heavy loads act on a single/local point on the bearing for extended periods during which heavy loads oscillate with varying wind speeds/loads. Large cyclic loads acting on a specific point on bearing race cause indentation marks which is also called Brinelling failure. As turbine capacities keep growing well beyond 10 MW with offshore units, the need for a robust low cost alternative grows. Hydrostatic bearings are well known systems that are used in large and heavy load machinery. This thesis aims to investigate applicability and feasibility of alternative hydrostatic yaw bearing design for a sample horizontal axis wind turbine. Motivation of the thesis is to develop a hydrostatic bearing design for yaw system for a 500 KW wind turbine, and demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of the hydrostatic bearing yaw system in comparison to classical rolling element bearings by evaluating load capacity, rigidity, stiffness, cost and life...|$|E

A test-rig {{was designed and}} constructed to enable detailed measurement of horizontal rotating bearing acceleration forces in both the axial and radial plane in the speed range of 0. 5 to 10 revolutions per minute. These accelerations were carried out at both sonic and ultrasonic sampling rates to establish which technique is the most appropriate. Overall bearing displacement and surface temperatures were measured. Strains generated in the stress frame by the loading of the bearing were monitored along with the power used to drive the test-rig. Measurements were obtained from two full-size slew bearings operating in Bluescope Steel Limited. One bearing operated at 4. 3 rpm continuously in the vertical plane. The other <b>slew</b> <b>bearing</b> operated intermittently and with partial rotation at approximately 1 rpm in the horizontal plane. During this project, the concepts of Symmetry and Stability have been developed as a fundamental approach to information analysis. A considerable number of novel signal processing methods including; Kurtosis/Correlation dimension plots, Symmetry State Space (SSS), Symmetric Wave Decomposition (SWD), Compressed Eigenvector Deconvolution Spectral Analysis (CEDSA), Ring Matrix Fault Values (RMFV) have been developed.

It will be shown, among other things, that ultrasonic measurements using sensors designed for Acoustic Emission (AE) permit an implementation of an early warning system for slow speed bearings.

The effects of altitude and airspeed on such operating characteristics as operating range, stability of combustion, acceleration, starting, operation of fuel-control systems, and bearing cooling were investigated. With the low-flow compressor, the engine could be operated at full speed without serious burner unbalance at altitudes up to 50, 000 feet. Increasing the altitude and airspeed greatly reduced the operable speed range of the engine by raising the minimum operating speed of the engine. In several runs with the high-flow compressor the maximum engine speed was limited to less than 7600 rpm by combustion blow-out, high tail-pipe temperatures, and compressor stall. Acceleration of the engine was relatively slow and the time required for acceleration increased with altitude. At maximum engine speed a sudden reduction in jet-nozzle area resulted in an immediate increase in thrust. The engine started normally and easily below 20, 000 feet with each configuration. The use of a high-voltage ignition system made possible starts at a pressure altitude of 40, 000 feet; but on these starts the tail-pipe temperatures were very high, a great deal of fuel burned in and behind the tail-pipe, and acceleration was very slow. Operation of the engine was similar with both fuel regulators except that the modified fuel regulator restricted the fuel flow in such a manner that the acceleration above 6000 rpm was very <b>slow.</b> The <b>bearings</b> did not cool properly at high altitudes and high engine speeds with a low-flow compressor, and bearing cooling was even poorer with a high-flow compressor...|$|R

The stress-induced export of Npl 3 p is independent of both the activity of Xpo 1 p and the continued selective export of heat-shock mRNAs that occurs following stress. UV-cross-linking experiments show that Npl 3 p is bound to mRNA under normal conditions, but is no longer RNA associated in stressed cells.

This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in <b>slow</b> sliding journal <b>bearings</b> with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The synthetic esters were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of self lubricated bearings with water lubrication to an EAL lubricated tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water lubricated materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL lubricated tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find self lubricated journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL lubricated bronze bearings in water turbine application.

Methods To identify genes important in determining muscle growth and feed efficiency in broilers, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was conducted with breast muscle in modern pedigree male (PeM) broilers (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0096 per group), and with an unselected foundation broiler line (Barred Plymouth Rock; BPR). The RNAseq analysis was carried out using Ilumina Hiseq (2 x 100 bp paired end read) and raw reads were assembled with the galgal 4 reference chicken genome. With normalized RPM values, genes showing > 10 average read counts were chosen and genes showing 1. 3 fold change were considered as differentially expressed (DE) between PeM and BPR. DE genes were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for bioinformatic functional interpretation. Results The results indicate that 2, 464 DE genes were identified in the comparison between PeM and BPR. Interestingly, the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in chicken are significantly biased towards the BPR group, suggesting a lowered mitochondrial content in PeM chicken muscles compared to BPR chicken. This result is inconsistent with more <b>slow</b> muscle fibers <b>bearing</b> a lower mitochondrial content in the PeM. The molecular, cellular and physiological functions of DE genes in the comparison between PeM and BPR include organismal injury, carbohydrate metabolism, cell growth/proliferation, and skeletal muscle system development, indicating that cellular mechanisms in modern broiler lines are tightly associated with rapid growth and differential muscle fiber contents compared to the unselected BPR line. Particularly, PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) signaling and NFE 2 L 2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 -like 2; also known as NRF 2) mediated oxidative stress response pathways appear to be activated in modern broiler compared to the foundational BPR line. Upstream and network analyses revealed that the MSTN (myostatin) 2 ̆ 013 FST (follistatin) interactions and inhibition of AR (androgen receptor) were predicted to be effective regulatory factors for DE genes in modern broiler line.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{is one of}} many {{technologies for}} health monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machines such as gearboxes. Although significant research has been undertaken in understanding the potential of AE in monitoring gearboxes this has been solely applied to spur gears and <b>slow</b> speed roller <b>bearings.</b> This research presents an experimental investigation that assesses the effectiveness of both AE and vibration technologies in identifying various types of defects on in a helical gearbox; the first known attempt. Furthermore, the application of advanced signals processing techniques such as Spectral kurtosis (SK) and wavelet analysis were studied on AE and vibration signatures. It is shown that the application of advanced signal processing methods is particularly necessary for monitoring helical gears. The application of SK and wavelet analysis was found to be effective in denoising the acquired signals. The first chapter of this thesis is an introduction to this research and briefly explains motivation and theoretical background supporting this research. The second chapter summaries the relevant literature to establish the current level of the knowledge in this field. The third chapter describes methodologies and experimental arrangement utilized for this investigation. Chapter 4 discusses helical gear diagnosis for both natural and seeded surface defect. Chapter 5 reports on an experimental investigation in which several technologies such as AE, vibration and motor current signature analysis, were applied to identify the presence of a naturally fatigued pinion shaft in an operating gearbox. Chapter 6 details an investigation which compared the applicability of AE and vibration technologies in monitoring a naturally degraded roller bearing. It has been concluded that AE is a strong diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of bearings faults. However, the application of condition monitoring for helical gear diagnosis was fraught with some degree of complexity as compared to spur gears. This implies that condition monitoring of the gears using AET can be challenging. On the contrary, the applicability of AET for bearing diagnosis was promising and it offered an absolute advantage over the conventional vibrationdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application advanced signals processing methods such as Spectral Kurtosis and wavelet was found to be promising in denoise the recorded AE signals. It was also concluded that the use of different signal processing methods is often necessary to achieve meaningful diagnostic information from the signals.
