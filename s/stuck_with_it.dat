25|$|General {{interest}} magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, {{short stories}} and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One {{of them was the}} historically significant Collier's (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor William Chenery in 1925. Martin drew many of its covers during the Roaring Twenties, including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923–27). Some artists created a niche and then <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following: catching a baseball, loading up on desserts (pictured below), playing the flute, wearing a straw hat, shooting marbles, shoveling snow, carrying schoolbooks on head, riding a sled, winding up a toy, eating turkey at Christmas, bobbing for apples, playing football (pictured), happily swimming, getting a shaved haircut, saying grace, working as a messenger, daydreaming at school about fishing and going down a water slide. He seldom veered from this subject matter.|$|E

500|$|In {{his early}} years, Russell {{struggled}} {{to develop his}} skills as a basketball player. Although Russell was a good runner and jumper and had large hands, he simply {{did not understand the}} game and was cut from the team in junior high school. As a freshman at McClymonds High School in Oakland, California, Russell was almost cut again. However, coach George Powles saw Russell's raw athletic potential and encouraged him to work on his fundamentals. Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, he was delighted to receive warm words from his white coach. He worked hard and used the benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player, {{but it was not until}} his junior and senior years that he began to excel, winning back to back high school state championships. Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled, [...] "To play good defense... it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots, I was initially corrected, but I <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and it paid off." [...] Russell, in an autobiographical account, notes while on a California High School All-Stars tour, he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players’ moves (e.g., footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play) as preparation for defending against them, which including practicing in front of a mirror at night. Russell further described himself as an avid reader of Dell Magazines' 1950s sports publications, which he used to scout opponents' moves for the purpose defending against them.|$|E

40|$|Organisations and {{organisms are}} self-maintaining systems which spontaneously seek to {{preserve}} an evolved order. Both are enabled by replicators: memes or genes respectively. Whereas genes are the units of transmission of our biological inheritance memes are the units of transmission of our cultural inheritance. They cause organisations {{to settle into}} patterns, routines and habits of behaviour: manifestations of a particular memetic inheritance. These patterns enable the organisation but simultaneously limit its performance. Both systems share the evolutionary dynamic of adaptive radiation followed by stabilisation. Memetic examples include new markets, new technologies and new business ideas. Business theories and their derivative, managerial fads, are a class of memes. This paper illustrates the increasing returns dynamic {{in the evolution of}} management recipes by contrasting Business Process Re-engineering and the Learning Organisation. <b>It</b> ends <b>with</b> a plea for the Learning Organisations to retain memetic diversity rather than be trapped in sterile competitions to define an LO. The power of the Learning Organisation movement may, paradoxically, be that we are not <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> what <b>it</b> is...|$|R
