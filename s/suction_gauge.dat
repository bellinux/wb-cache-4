40|$|Characteristics of {{the flow}} inside an engine {{cylinder}} model have been evaluated by a particle image velocimetry (PIV) and a laser Doppler anemometer (LDA). Verifications of the results by Partial Cells in Cartesian coordinate method numerical simulation have been also made by the experiment results. The model engine head that has two intake valves and transparent cylinder {{are used in the}} steady state flow condition. The tests are conducted by single- and dual- valve open condition with 8 mm valve lift in- 1470 Pa <b>suction</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure. The comparisons between the PIV and the LDA experiments show almost the same tendencies for mean velocities and turbulence intensities in the whole experimental regien qualitatively and also quantitatively. The differences in the valve open condition are clearly observed in the integral length and time scales that are estimated from the PIV and LDA data respectively. It is shown that the PIV results are useful for verification of numerical results, which agree reasonably with those of experiments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The slotted {{correlation}} {{method for}} the post-processing of laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) data {{is applied to}} obtain the autocorrelation and turbulent scales at the in-cylinder flow of an IC engine. The slotted correlation method can provide correlation of turbulence from random time sampling data like as LDA measurement. The experiment is performed in the steady cylinder flow through the cylinder head. The cylinder head is designed for an SI engine with two intake valves and two exhaust valves. The transparent cylinder was made by acrylic with bore of 75 mm and length of 100 mm. The experiments are made by means of sucking the air {{from the bottom of}} the cylinder by the blower. The experiments are conducted by single- or dual- valve open conditions with 8 mm valve lift under- 1470 Pa <b>suction</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure in order to simulate the air flow motion through the intake ports in the actual operating condition. In these conditions, mean velocities at the cross section are about 7. 0 m/s for dual-valve open condition, and about 4. 0 m/s for single-valve open condition. The LDA consists on a fiber sending optics, a photomultiplier and a burst spectrum analyzer (BSA). From the results, comparison between conventional FFT and slotted correlation method shows a little difference in the turbulent scales. The FFT results show the tendency of overestimation compared with the slotted correlation results. This tendency becomes remarkable when the LDA data rate is low. The time scale of turbulence by FFT is gradually decreased with data rate. The slotted correlatio...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{bleeding and}} the estimated blood loss {{in patients who}} underwent total knee replacement (TKR) with different closed suction drains (3. 2 -mm and 4. 8 -mm gauge). MethodsThis was a randomized controlled trial with 22 patients who underwent TKR and {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I, with 11 patients in whom the 3. 2 -mm suction drain was used, and Group II, with 11 patients in whom the 4. 8 -mm suction drain was used. The hematocrit was measured after 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery in order to calculate the estimated blood loss. The drained volume was measured 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after TKR, and thereafter both groups were compared. ResultsRegarding the hematocrit, there were no differences between groups in measured periods (24, 48, and 72 h after surgery). The total bleeding measured at the suction drains within 48 h was higher in Group II, with a statistically significant difference (p= 0. 005); in the first 24 h, there was major bleeding in Group II (mean 893 mL), with a significant difference (p= 0. 004). Between 24 and 48 h, there was no statistically significant difference in both groups (p= 0. 710). The total estimated bleeding was higher in Group I, with mean of 463 mL, versus 409 mL in Group II, with no statistical significance (p= 0. 394).

MétodosEnsaio clínico randomizado com 22 pacientes submetidos à ATJ, divididos em dois grupos; no grupo I, os pacientes recebiam o DS 3, 2 mm e no Grupo II, o DS 4, 8 mm. O hematócrito foi aferido 24, 48 e 72 horas após a cirurgia, a fim de {{calcular}} a perda sanguínea estimada. O débito do dreno foi medido 3, 6, 12, 24 e 48 horas após a ATJ e os dois grupos foram comparados. ResultadosEm relação ao hematócrito, não se observaram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre os grupos nos períodos aferidos (24, 48 e 72 horas pós‐operatória). O sangramento total medido no DS nas 48 horas foi maior no grupo II, com diferença estatisticamente significativa (p= 0, 005); nas primeiras 24 horas, houve maior sangramento no grupo II (média 893 mL), com diferença significativa (p= 0, 004). Entre 24 e 48 horas, não foram observadas diferenças estatisticamente significativas em ambos os grupos (p= 0, 710). O sangramento total estimado foi maior no Grupo I, com média de 463 mL, enquanto no Grupo II esse valor foi de 409 mL, sem significância estatística (p= 0, 394). ConclusõesO sangramento foi maior no grupo que usou DS 4, 8 mm, sem diferenças no hematócrito e na perda sanguínea estimada.
