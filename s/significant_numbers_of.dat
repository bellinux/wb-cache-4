5|$|Although Belgium {{was officially}} neutral {{throughout}} his reign, <b>significant</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Belgians volunteered {{to fight for}} right-wing causes abroad. From 1860, large numbers of Belgian Catholic volunteers went to Italy in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend {{the independence of the}} Papal States against Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolutionaries.

5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and <b>significant</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E

The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
