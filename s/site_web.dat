This paper develops a theoretical model {{for understanding the}} effect of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> design elements on customer loyalty to a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We show {{the relevance of the}} business domain of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> to gain a contextual understanding of relative importance of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> design elements. We use a hierarchical linear modeling approach to model multilevel and cross-level interactions that have not been explicitly considered in previous research. By analyzing data on more than 12, 000 online customer surveys for 43 <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> in several business domains, we find that the relative importance of different <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> features (e. g., content, functionality) in affecting customer loyalty to a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> varies depending on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> 2 ̆ 7 s domain. For example, we find that the relationship between <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> content and customer loyalty is stronger for information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> than for transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> However, the relationship between functionality and customer loyalty is stronger for transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> than for information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> We also find that government <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> enjoy greater word-of-mouth effect than commercial <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally, transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> tend to score higher on mean customer loyalty than do information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The term World Wide Web (WWW) {{emphasizes}} that the Web is global and many companies realize that this creates new opportunities. A considerable amount of literature on <b>web</b> <b>site</b> development stresses that, {{in order to attract}} and retain more customers, it is vital to create different versions of a <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and adapt those versions to the local communities they target. This process is usually called globalization and the different <b>web</b> <b>site</b> versions are called localized <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> Although content management systems (CMS) for <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> provide support for multinational <b>web</b> <b>sites,</b> current <b>web</b> <b>site</b> design methodologies do not consider the issue of globalization. In general, the globalization effort is done after the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> is designed and implemented. This makes globalization much harder. In this paper, we show how to extend an existing <b>web</b> <b>site</b> design method, WSDM, to support the design of localized <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain how Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library {{improved}} the accessibility of their <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> aiming for <b>Web</b> Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2. 0 Level AA. It describes the results obtained. Design/methodology/approach – Initial testing by consultants was conducted in October 2012. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> was defined as all webpages which appear part of the library <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> including supplier webpages, plus pages from the university <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and library <b>web</b> <b>site.</b> Library staff applied the recommendations to pages which they could edit, and discussed the recommendations with suppliers to improve their product’s accessibility. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> was re-tested in June 2013. Social implications – A <b>web</b> <b>site</b> not complying with WCAG version 2. 0 would be very difficult for people with disabilities to access. Upgrading ECU Library’s <b>web</b> <b>site</b> will provide all users with more equal access to the resources. Findings – ECU Library <b>web</b> <b>site</b> failed WCAG 2. 0 Level A standard in the initial testing and re-testing. Many individual pages which failed initially passed the re-test. The smallest improvement was seen in suppliers’ <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> Practical implications – This paper could help libraries to improve <b>web</b> <b>site</b> accessibility, as it covers negotiating with suppliers to upgrade their <b>web</b> <b>sites,</b> plus upgrading editable webpages. It shows initial and re-test results, allowing libraries to compare their results to those of ECU. Legislation and guidelines state <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> should be accessible to all users and organisations providing non-accessible <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> risk being sued. Originality/value – This study describes problems in upgrading academic library webpages and related supplier <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> and organisation <b>web</b> <b>site</b> to improve accessibility for people with disabilities...|$|R

The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> configuration is a consistent version of the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and serves for navigation purposes.

On the other hand, specific characteristics related to the web environment and <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> in particular are considered. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> is modelled by an AND/OR type graph. The model serves as a useful abstraction simplifying the process of configuration building. Being essentially a graph search, it is inevitable to have a method for selecting a proper version.

They are raced under the historic register HSRCA in Australia as 1959 and 1960 Nota FJ. The third car was rear engined Nota FJ Renault, History unknown. This car was owned by Ian Cook 1970 till 1972 and raced at Oran Park and Amaroo as a Formula 3 and was not that reliable motor wise. Cook then sold it on to Peter Taylor who with Brian Morrow lengthend the chassis by 70 mm to suit Peter's 1850 mm height and fitted it with a Toyota 1198cc engine built by McGrath in Victoria the car went well at Oran Park and Amaroo until Peter sold it on.

It examines consumer perceptions of trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and addresses the following key research questions: What factors influence consumer trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and what specific <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> trust cues are associated with these factors? How does trust affect consumer behavioral intent on a <b>Web</b> <b>site?</b> To address these questions, we develop a conceptual model that links consumer perceptions of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> characteristics, consumer characteristics and demographics to perceptions of trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> and trust to behavioral intent related to a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We also examine whether trust mediates the relationship between <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent related to the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We test our hypotheses in a large-scale empirical study that estimates this model from 6831 consumers across 25 <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> and eight industry categories. We validate the model using a holdout sample. The results show that <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> consumer, category and demographic variables can explain 76 % {{of the variance in}} trust. <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> characteristics such as privacy and security, navigation, presentation, brand, and advice account for as much as 98 % of this explained variance in <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> trust.
