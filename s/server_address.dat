5000|$|Teredo {{is another}} IPv6 {{transition}} technology that encodes the originating IPv4 {{address in the}} IPv6 address. However, the encoding format encodes the Teredo <b>server</b> <b>address</b> and tunnel information before the IPv4 client address. Thus there is no definable set of prefixes more specific than 2001:0::/32 for Teredo packets with martian end-site addresses. It is, however, possible to spoof Teredo packets with the Teredo server IPv4 address set to a martian. The list of martian Teredo <b>server</b> <b>address</b> prefixes is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|A typical {{configuration}} on a {{home network}} would be DHCP with automatic assignment of the network parameters. Manual DHCP configuration requires the primary and secondary DNS <b>server</b> <b>address</b> to be entered. A PPPoE connection requires {{in addition to this}} the internet service user ID and password, and whether or not to save the password. A static IP address connection requires the IP address, subnet mask, default router, primary and secondary DNS <b>server</b> <b>address</b> to be entered. The network connection can be tested from a menu option before going online; error code 21003 indicates a successful connection.|$|E
50|$|To post {{items to}} a blog from Lifeblog, {{you need to}} know the Atom <b>server</b> <b>address.</b> Here are some examples. These can also be used in Nokia Photos (for PC) and in Share Online (for S60 phones).|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} online games, such as Doom, required {{players to}} exchange their personal IP addresses. With Quake these evolved into more permanent dedicated <b>server</b> <b>addresses</b> and an address book {{was added to}} the game's menu to store them, but finding the IPs in the first place remained a very involved process.|$|R

5000|$|Absolute URLs are URLs {{that start}} with a scheme (e.g., [...] ) and conform to scheme-specific syntax and {{semantics}}.

Its origin and method of propagation are currently unknown. The altered registry setting only affects users of Internet Explorer (including the most recent version, Internet Explorer 9); other browsers such as Firefox do not depend upon this specific Windows Registry item for proxy address and port settings.|$|E

Finding this useless, he asks the shopkeeper, and when her {{explanation}} isn't any help, he asks a man talking to his sister, and finally he reveals information: A man was rousing him for Virtua Souls, and he vanished in the Wild Corridor, yet another lost Server.

Sei is a cheerful fellow who's been tapped by his friend, Hayami, into trying out {{the life of a}} hunter, one who {{collects}} data chips from the far-flung reaches of the Nexus and then sells them for cash. Sei, curious about the occupation, yet slightly intimidated by the dangers involved, reluctantly accepts after a bit of influence from Hayami, and the thought about the bike that they are trying to finish in time for the race in the real world.After completing the Hunters' test and a brief explanation from Hayami about the Hunter's License rankings (LoA, HighA, and ExA), Sei finds the <b>server</b> <b>address</b> for Curio City, and marks his way to the location.|$|E

50|$|In a DHCP {{starvation}} attack, {{once the}} adversary receives the IP address and the lease period from the DHCP server, the adversary {{does not respond}} with the confirmation. Instead, the adversary floods the DHCP <b>server</b> with IP <b>address</b> requests until all <b>addresses</b> within the <b>server’s</b> <b>address</b> space have been reserved (exhausted). At this point, any hosts wishing to join the network will be denied access, resulting in a denial of service. The adversary can then set up a rogue DHCP server so that clients receive incorrect network settings {{and as a result}} transmit data to an attacker’s machine.|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{denial of}} service attacks have {{become more and more}} {{frequent}} nowadays. In 2013, a massive distributed {{denial of service}} (DDoS) attack was launched against Spamhaus causing the service to shut down. In this paper, we present a three-way handshaking server for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection redirection utilizing TCP header options. When a legitimate client attempted to connect to a server undergoing an SYN-flood DDoS attack, it will try to initiate a three-way handshake. After it has successfully established a connection, the server will reply with a reset (RST) packet, in which a new <b>server</b> <b>address</b> and a secret is embedded. The client can, thus, connect to the new server that only accepts SYN packets with the corrected secret using the supplied secret...|$|E
