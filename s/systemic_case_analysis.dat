40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>analysis</b> {{together}} with recursion are common techniques used in program specifications. In order to verify programs, we use mathematical induction. In this paper, we will outline {{the importance of}} non-inductive proof obligations such as <b>case</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{if we want to}} prove recursive and non-recursive properties of programs. The heuristic we propose exploits conditions provided by conditional defining equations and selects potential case split variables based on the pattern of the theorem. We will show that proofs obtained with a heuristic for <b>case</b> <b>analysis</b> are often shorter and more sophisticated. Hence it represents a more efficient approach to deal with non-inductive proof obligations. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Motivation Automatic reasoning techniques {{play an important role in}} enabling the application of formal methods to the design and verification of hard- and software.

LUTE-EJ parser has two interesting mechanical characteristics.

The other is extended HOLD mechanism(in ATN), in whose use an embedded clause, especially a "bedeleted " clause, is recursively analyzed by <b>case</b> <b>analysis.</b> This parser's features are (1) extracting a case filler, basically as a noun phrase, by ATNGbased <b>analysis,</b> including recursire <b>case</b> <b>analysis,</b> and (2) mixing syntactic and semantic <b>analysis</b> by using <b>case</b> frames in <b>case</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The OTS/CafeOBJ method {{can be used}} to {{formally}} model, specify and verify distributed systems such as security protocols and railroad systems. A distributed system is modeled as an OTS, a kind of transition system, and the OTS is specified and verified with CafeOBJ, an algebraic specification language. <b>Case</b> <b>analysis</b> (or <b>case</b> splitting) {{is one of the most}} intellectual pieces of work in verification. <b>Case</b> <b>analysis</b> should be done entirely by hand in the OTS/CafeOBJ method, which is errorprone. It is indispensable to cover all cases and find necessary lemmas for some sub-cases where desired results are not obtained in <b>case</b> <b>analysis.</b> We propose two methods of mechanically supporting <b>case</b> <b>analysis,</b> which concern these two issues.

40|$|Abstract. Smoothed {{analysis}} combines elements over worst-case {{and average}} <b>case</b> <b>analysis.</b> For an instance x, the smoothed complexity {{is the average}} complexity of an instance obtained from x by a perturbation. The smoothed complexity of a problem is the worst smoothed complexity of any instance. Spielman and Teng introduced this notion for continuous problems. We apply the concept to combinatorial problems and study the smoothed complexity of three classical discrete problems: quicksort, left-to-right maxima counting, and shortest paths. 1 Introduction Recently, Spielman and Teng [13] introduced smoothed analysis, which is inter-mediate between average <b>case</b> <b>analysis</b> and worst <b>case</b> <b>analysis.</b> The smoothed complexity of an algorithm is maxx Ey 2 Uffl(x) C(y) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{article is}} the twenty-ninth {{of a series}} of {{articles}} discussing various open research prob-lems in automated reasoning. The problem proposed for research asks one to find criteria that an automated reasoning program can apply to decide when to conduct a <b>case</b> <b>analysis</b> argument and to decide which cases are appropriate. When the choice of employing a <b>case</b> <b>analysis</b> argument is wise and the cases are well chosen, the likelihood that the reasoning program—or, for that matter, a person—will find an answer to the given question is sharply increased.
