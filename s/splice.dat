5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the <b>splice</b> lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of <b>splice</b> regulatory proteins such as <b>splice</b> silencers and <b>splice</b> enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some <b>splice</b> targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic <b>splice</b> sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. <b>Splice</b> modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional isoforms are {{not just}} random {{combinations}} of exons. What has caused exons to be differentially <b>spliced</b> and whether exons with different <b>splicing</b> frequencies are subjected to divergent regulation by potential elements or <b>splicing</b> signals? Beyond the conventional classification for alternatively <b>spliced</b> exons (ASEs) and constitutively <b>spliced</b> exons (CSEs), we have classified exons from alternatively <b>spliced</b> human genes and their mouse orthologs (12, 314 and 5, 464, respectively) into four types based on their <b>splicing</b> frequencies. Analysis has indicated that different groups of exons presented divergent compositional and regulatory properties. Interestingly, with the decrease of <b>splicing</b> frequency, exons tend to have greater lengths, higher GC content, and contain more <b>splicing</b> elements and repetitive elements, which seem {{to imply that the}} <b>splicing</b> frequency is influenced by such factors. Comparison of non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> (NAS) mouse genes with alternatively <b>spliced</b> human orthologs also suggested that exons with lower <b>splicing</b> frequencies may be newly evolved ones which gained functions with <b>splicing</b> frequencies altered through the evolution. Our findings have revealed {{for the first time that}} certain factors may have critical influence on the <b>splicing</b> frequency, suggesting that exons with lower <b>splicing</b> frequencies may originate from old repetitive sequences, with <b>splicing</b> sites altered by mutation, gaining novel functions and become more frequently <b>spliced...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of <b>splicing</b> systems (H systems) was initiated by Head in 1987. By restricting the <b>splicing</b> rules of <b>splicing</b> systems, some variants of <b>splicing</b> {{systems such as}} simple and semi-simple <b>splicing</b> systems have been developed.

40|$|Regulation of {{alternative}} <b>splicing</b> {{is controlled by}} pre-mRNA sequences (cis-elements) and trans-acting protein factors that bind them. The combinatorial interactions of multiple protein factors with the cis-elements surrounding a given alternative <b>splicing</b> event lead to an integrated <b>splicing</b> decision. The mechanism of multifactorial <b>splicing</b> regulation is poorly understood. Using a splicing-sensitive DNA microarray, we assayed 352 Caenorhabditis elegans alternative cassette exons for changes in embryonic <b>splicing</b> patterns between wild-type and 12 different strains carrying mutations in a <b>splicing</b> factor. We identified many alternative <b>splicing</b> events that are regulated by multiple <b>splicing</b> factors.

Unexpectedly, we found that the ability of a given alternative <b>splicing</b> factor to behave as an enhancer or repressor of a specific <b>splicing</b> event can change during development.

40|$|Alternative <b>splicing</b> in {{mammalian}} cells {{has been}} suggested to be largely controlled by combinatorial binding of basal <b>splicing</b> factors to pre-mRNA templates. This model predicts that distinct sets of pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> factors are associated with alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts. However, no experimental evidence for differential recruitment of <b>splicing</b> factors to transcripts with distinct <b>splicing</b> fates is available. Here we have used quantitative single-cell imaging to test this key prediction in vivo. We show that distinct combinations of <b>splicing</b> factors are recruited to sites of alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts in intact cells. While a subset of serine/arginine protein <b>splicing</b> factors, including SF 2 /ASF, SC 35, and SRp 20, is efficiently recruited to the tau gene when exon 10 is included, these factors are less frequently associated with tau transcription sites when exon 10 is excluded. In contrast, the frequency of recruitment of several other <b>splicing</b> factors is independent of <b>splicing</b> outcome. Mutation analysis of SF 2 /ASF shows that both protein–protein as well as protein–RNA interactions are required for differential recruitment. The differential behavior of the various <b>splicing</b> factors provides the basis for combinatorial occupancy at pre-mRNAs. These observations represent the first in vivo evidence for differential association of pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> factors with alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts.

40|$|Abstract: Alternative <b>splicing</b> {{is a key}} {{molecular}} {{mechanism for}} increasing the functional diversity of the eukaryotic proteomes. A large body of experimental data implicates aberrant <b>splicing</b> in various human diseases, including cancer.

In addition, the <b>splicing</b> profile of several cancerassociated genes is altered in particular types of cancer arguing for a direct role of specific <b>splicing</b> isoforms in tumor progression.

5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or <b>splice</b> products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution <b>splice</b> allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

Identification of intron <b>splice</b> junctions prevents reads being misaligned across <b>splice</b> junctions or erroneously discarded, allowing more reads to be aligned to the reference genome and improving the accuracy of gene expression estimates.
