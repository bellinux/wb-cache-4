40|$|Chiayi County {{is located}} in the largest {{alluvial}} plain of Taiwan with extensive aquaculture and rice farming sustained by water extracted from groundwater wells. Chiayi is a typical aquaculture area affected by land subsidence, yet such lands worldwide combine to provide nearly 90 % of global aquaculture products, greatly reducing oceanic overfishing problems. This study uses precision leveling, multi-layer compaction monitoring well (MLCW) and spaceborne SAR interferometry (InSAR) to examine the cause and effect of land subsidence in Chiayi associated with groundwater extractions and changes. Heights at benchmarks in a leveling network are measured annually and <b>soil</b> <b>compactions</b> at 24 – 26 layers up to 300 -m depths at 7 MLCWs are collected at one-month intervals. Over 2007 – 2011, 15 ALOS/PALSAR images are processed by the method of TCPInSAR to produce subsidence rates. All sensors show that land subsidence occur in most parts of Chiayi, with rates reaching 4. 5 cm/year around its coast, a result of groundwater pumping from shallow to deep aquifers. MLCWs detect mm-accuracy seasonal <b>soil</b> <b>compactions</b> coinciding with groundwater level fluctuations and causing dynamic compactions. Compactions near Taiwan High Speed Rail may reduce the strength of the rail’s supporting columns to degrade its safety. The SAR images yield subsidence rates consistent with those from leveling and compaction wells after corrections for systematic errors by the leveling result. Subsidence in Chiayi’s coastal area leads to relative sea level rises at rates up to 15 times larger than the global eustatic sea level rising rate, a risk typical for world’s aquaculture-rich regions.

The results indicate that soil moisture was generally lost after compaction by agricultural machinery and its loss was related to pressure load, <b>soil</b> depth and <b>compaction</b> times. Generally, moisture loss increased with the increase of pressure load and mostly occurred at the soil surface (0 to 5 cm) for light loads ( 110 kg). Moreover, the moisture loss decreased gradually with the increases in soil depth for light loads (37 and 98 kg), although it was first increased and then quickly decreased for heavy loads (>= 118 kg).

25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced <b>soil</b> <b>compaction.</b> Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

Moreover, <b>compaction</b> decreases <b>soil</b> settlement, improves bearing capacity and the stability of sloped embankments. An optimum water content is required to provide the best path to enter energy into soil and compact it.

As a result, a diminutive increase of lambda(dry) with T is driven by increasing lambda of air.
