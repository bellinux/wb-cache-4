40|$|AbstractIn adult {{patients}} with {{sickle cell disease}} two distinct subphenotypes have previously been defined: {{patients with}} the viscosity-vaso-occlusion <b>subphenotype</b> (VVO) suffer mainly from vaso-occlusive pain crises and have a relatively high hemoglobin concentration. Patients classified as the hemolysis-endothelial dysfunction <b>subphenotype</b> (HED) suffer from stroke and pulmonary hypertension and have an elevated concentration of lactate dehydrogenase. However, this classification is not possible in children due to low rates of complications. We used laboratory markers to classify children into the two subphenotypes, and measured vWF and vWF propeptide as markers of endothelial dysfunction. We included 106 children with sickle cell disease (mean age 8. 7 years), 74 (70 %) with HbSS/HbSβ° genotype and 32 (30 %) with HbSC/HbSβ+ genotype. vWF and vWF propeptide were significantly elevated in patients with sickle cell disease; this was more pronounced in patients with the HbSS/HbSβ° genotype. Patients with the HED <b>subphenotype</b> had higher levels of vWF propeptide, and a trend towards higher levels of vWF compared to those with the VVO <b>subphenotype.</b> We demonstrated that even young children in a stable clinical condition show signs of persistent endothelial dysfunction.

40|$|Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is {{characterized}} by chronic hemolysis, severe vasoocclusive crises (VOCs), and recurrent often severe infections. A cohort of 95 SCA pediatric patients was the background for genotype-to-phenotype association of the patient's infectious disease phenotype and three non-coding polymorphic regions of the TLR 2 gene, the - 196 to - 174 indel, SNP rs 4696480, and a (GT) n short tandem repeat. The infectious subphenotypes included (A) recurrent respiratory infections and (B) severe bacterial infection at least once during the patient's follow-up. The absence of the haplotype [Del]-T-[n ≥ 17] (Hap 7) in homozygocity protected against <b>subphenotype</b> (B), in a statistically significant association, resisting correction for multiple testing. For the individual loci, the same association tendencies were observed as in the haplotype, including a deleterious association between the SNP rs 4696480 T allele and <b>subphenotype</b> (A), whereas the A/A genotype was protective, and a deleterious effect of the A/T genotype with <b>subphenotype</b> (B), as well as including the protective effect of - 196 to - 174 insert (Ins) and deleterious effect of the deletion (Del) in homozygocity, against <b>subphenotype</b> (B). Moreover, {{a reduction in the}} incidence rate of severe bacterial infection was associated to a rise in the hemolytic score, fetal hemoglobin levels (prior to hydroxyurea treatment), and 3. 7 -kb alpha-thalassemia. Interestingly, differences between the effects of the two latter covariables favoring a reduction in the incidence rate of <b>subphenotype</b> (B) contrast with a resulting increase in relation to <b>subphenotype</b> (A).

40|$|Bipolar-related <b>subphenotypes</b> that cluster within {{families}} may help identify subsets of patients {{that are more}} genetically homogeneous. Environmental or assessment factors that segregate by family may influence estimates of familiality. We aimed to determine familiality of <b>subphenotypes</b> of bipolar disorder (BP), accounting for effects of age, sex, diagnosis, and site/wave of ascertainment. We studied 589 sibships with 1416 siblings affected with bipolar I (BPI), schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (SAB), bipolar II (BPII), or recurrent unipolar depression (RUDD). Sibships were from families with ≥ 2 BPI cases collected by the NIMH Bipolar Genetics Initiative (NIMHBGI). Rapid cycling showed the strongest evidence for familiality [odds ratio (OR) (95 %CI) [*]=[*] 2. 02 (1. 43, 2. 85), P [*]=[*] 6. 0 [*]×[*] 10 − 5] in a model including age, sex, diagnosis, and site/wave of ascertainment.

40|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBD) are classically {{divided in}} Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, these two entities are still heterogeneous and a further classification in <b>subphenotypes</b> is necessary. Clinical <b>subphenotypes</b> {{are easy to}} use, do not necessitate complicated tests and can already give very important information {{for the management of}} the patients. In CD, clinical <b>subphenotypes</b> are based on age at diagnosis, disease location and disease behaviour. Age at diagnosis allows to differentiating paediatric CD, classical young adult onset and more seldom CD of the elderly. These categories are associated with a different risk of development of complications and disabling disease and may have partly different pathophysiology. The classification on disease behaviour, including stricturin, penetrating or uncomplicated disease may have an impact on reponse to medical treatment and need for surgery. Finally the classification based on location is particularly relevant since it has been associated with different types of complications. Particularly ileal disease has been associated with the risk of surgery and colonic (particularly rectal) disease, with the risk of perianal disease. In UC, the classification in <b>subphenotypes</b> is essentially based on disease location, distinguishing proctitis, left-sided colitis and extensive colitis. This subclassification also has a very significant clinical relevance since extensive colitis has been associated with and increased risk of colon cancer, colectomy and even in some studies, mortality.

40|$|Rationale: U-BIOPRED, a European {{public-private}} collaboration, aims to <b>subphenotype</b> severe asthma using {{a systems}} medicine approach to describe its handprint. Methods: An interim {{analysis of the}} characteristics and inflammatory markers of severe asthma defined according to Thorax 2011; 66 : 910 is presented. (TABLE SEE LINKED PDF-FILE) NA: not available Results: The adult severe asthma cohort had chronic airflow obstruction, with higher sputum eosinophils (SpE) compared to moderate asthma. The school-age severe asthma cohort had no evidence of obstruction but higher FeNO levels than moderate asthma. Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (% pred) in adults inversely correlated with SpE and neutrophils, while SpE positively correlated with FeNO. In children, preBD FEV 1 inversely correlated with FeNO. Analysis of the adult cohort according to use of maintenance prednisolone showed that this <b>subphenotype</b> was associated with lower IgE and blood eosinophil level, but similar SpE and FeNO.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{search for}} {{susceptibility}} genes in autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been hindered by the possible small effects of individual genes and by genetic (locus) heterogeneity. To overcome these obstacles, one {{method is to}} use autism-related <b>subphenotypes</b> instead of the categorical diagnosis of autism since {{they may be more}} directly related to the underlying susceptibility loci. Another strategy is to analyze subsets of families that meet certain clinical criteria to reduce genetic heterogeneity. METHODS: In this study, using 976 multiplex families from the Autism Genome Project consortium, we performed genome-wide linkage analyses on two quantitative <b>subphenotypes,</b> the total scores of the reciprocal social interaction domain and the restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior domain from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. We also selected subsets of ASD families based on four binary <b>subphenotypes,</b> delayed onset of first words, delayed onset of first phrases, verbal status, and IQ > or = 70.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A German {{genome-wide}} nonsynonymous {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism (nsSNP) association study identified ATG 16 L 1 as a Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility gene. The association appeared to be confined to the nsSNP rs 2, 241, 880 and was confirmed in 2 German independent case-control collections (combined P = 4. 0 x 10 (- 8), odds ratio [OR] 1. 45; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 21 - 1. 74), a CD transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) collection, and an independent UK cohort. A weak statistical interaction with CARD 15 was demonstrated. No association with ulcerative colitis (UC) was demonstrated. The aims {{of the study were}} to replicate the association with CD, examine <b>subphenotype</b> associations and statistical interactions with CARD 15, IL 23 R, and the IBD 5 risk haplotype, as well as explore the association with UC. METHODS: The study included 645 CD and 676 UC rigorously phenotyped patients recruited from a single UK center. Unaffected controls comprised either spouses of patients (141) or individuals recruited from well-person clinics (1, 049). The nsSNP rs 2, 241, 880 was genotyped using MassArray (Sequenom). RESULTS: A strong association with CD was demonstrated (P = 2. 33 x 10 (- 7), OR 1. 45 [1. 25 - 1. 67]), but no significant association was demonstrated with any <b>subphenotype.</b> We failed to replicate the reported interaction between rs 2, 241, 880 and the CARD 15 low-risk haplotypes dd and Dd. No significant statistical interaction with the 3 known CD susceptibility genes was seen.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} is {{prevalent in}} adult patients with {{sickle cell disease}} and is strongly associated with early mortality and markers of hemolysis, in particular, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Intravascular hemolysis leads to impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), mediated by NO scavenging by plasma oxyhemoglobin and by arginine degradation by plasma arginase. We hypothesized that serum LDH may represent a convenient biomarker of intravascular hemolysis and NO bioavailability, characterizing a clinical <b>subphenotype</b> of hemolysis-associated vasculopathy. In a cohort of 213 patients with sickle cell disease, we found statistically significant associations of steady-state LDH {{with low levels of}} hemoglobin and haptoglobin and high levels of reticulocytes, bilirubin, plasma hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, arginase, and soluble adhesion molecules. LDH isoenzyme fractionation confirmed predominance of LD 1 and LD 2, the principal isoforms within erythrocytes. In a subgroup, LDH levels closely correlated with plasma cell-free hemoglobin, accelerated NO consumption by plasma, and impaired vasodilatory responses to an NO donor. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical <b>subphenotype</b> of pulmonary hypertension, leg ulceration, priapism, and risk of death in patients with sickle cell disease. We propose that LDH elevation identifies patients with a syndrome of hemolysis-associated NO resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and end-organ vasculopathy...|$|E

Recent studies have greatly expanded {{the number of}} established SLE risk alleles, but the distribution of multiple risk alleles in cases versus controls {{and their relationship to}} <b>subphenotypes</b> have not been studied. We studied 22 SLE susceptibility polymorphisms with previous genome-wide evidence of association (p < 5 × 10 - 8) in 1919 SLE cases from 9 independent Caucasian SLE case series and 4813 independent controls. The mean number of risk alleles in cases was 15. 1 (SD 3. 1) while the mean in controls was 13. 1 (SD 2. 8), with trend p = 4 × 10 - 128. We defined a genetic risk score (GRS) for SLE as the number of risk alleles with each weighted by the SLE risk odds ratio (OR). The OR for high-low GRS tertiles, adjusted for intra-European ancestry, sex, and parent study, was 4. 4 (95 % CI 3. 8 - 5. 1). We studied associations of individual SNPs and the GRS with clinical manifestations for the cases: age at diagnosis, the 11 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, and double-stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) production. Six <b>subphenotypes</b> were significantly associated with the GRS, most notably anti-dsDNA (OR high-low = 2. 36, p = 9 e- 9), the immunologic criterion (OR high-low = 2. 23, p = 3 e- 7), and age at diagnosis (OR high-low = 1. 45, p = 0. 0060). Finally, we developed a subphenotype-specific GRS (sub-GRS) for each phenotype with more power to detect cumulative genetic associations. The sub-GRS was more strongly associated than any single SNP effect for 5 <b>subphenotypes</b> (the above plus hematologic disorder and oral ulcers), while single loci are more significantly associated with renal disease (HLA-DRB 1, OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 64) and arthritis (ITGAM, OR = 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 88).

We aimed to calculate a reference range for total and regional adipose tissue (AT) as well as ectopic fat in liver and muscle in healthy subjects. We studied the relationship between age, body-mass, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and the distribution of AT, using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in 477 white volunteers (243 male, 234 female). Furthermore, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine intrahepatocellular (IHCL) and intramyocellular (IMCL) lipid content.

40|$|The {{identification}} of specific patterns of dental anomalies would allow testing {{the hypothesis that}} certain genetic and environmental factors contribute to distinct dental anomaly <b>subphenotypes.</b> A sexual dimorphism in tooth agenesis and its association with other dental anomalies has been suggested. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate a large group of children to define dental anomaly <b>subphenotypes</b> that may aid future genetic studies. Orthopantamograms of 1198 subjects were examined and 1167 were used in this study. The frequency of tooth agenesis in the studied population was 4. 8 %. Male:female ratios varied from 2 : 1 in the agenesis of upper lateral incisors to 0. 5 : 1 in premolar agenesis. The risk of infra-occlusion of primary molars and double formation of primary incisors was increased in individuals with tooth agenesis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a genetically complex disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. A polymorphism in the STAT 4 gene {{has recently been}} established as {{a risk factor for}} SLE, but the relationship with specific SLE <b>subphenotypes</b> has not been studied. We studied 137 SNPs in the STAT 4 region genotyped in 4 independent SLE case series (total n = 1398) and 2560 healthy controls, along with clinical data for the cases. Using conditional testing, we confirmed the most significant STAT 4 haplotype for SLE risk. We then studied a SNP marking this haplotype for association with specific SLE <b>subphenotypes,</b> including autoantibody production, nephritis, arthritis, mucocutaneous manifestations, and age at diagnosis. To prevent possible type-I errors from population stratification, we reanalyzed the data using a subset of subjects determined to be most homogeneous based on principal components analysis of genome-wide data. We confirmed tha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{supports}} {{the existence of}} different <b>subphenotypes</b> in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the pivotal role of cytokines and autoantibodies, which interact in a highly complex network. Thus, understanding how these complex nonlinear processes are connected and observed in real-life settings is a major challenge. Cluster approaches may assist {{in the identification of}} these <b>subphenotypes,</b> which represent such a phenomenon, and may {{contribute to the development of}} personalized medicine. Therefore, the relationship between autoantibody and cytokine clusters in SLE was analyzed. Methods This was an exploratory study in which 67 consecutive women with established SLE were assessed. Clinical characteristics including disease activity, a 14 -autoantibody profile, and a panel of 15 serum cytokines were measured simultaneously. Mixed-cluster methodology and bivariate analyses were used to define autoantibody and cytokine clusters and to identify associations between them and related variables. Results First, three clusters of autoantibodies were defined: (1) neutral, (2) antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) -dominant, and (3) anti-dsDNA/ENA-dominant. Second, eight cytokines showed levels above the threshold thus making possible to find 4 clusters: (1) neutral, (2) chemotactic, (3) G-CSF dominant, and (4) IFNα/Pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, the disease activity was associated with cytokine clusters, which, in turn, were associated with autoantibody clusters. Finally, when all biomarkers were included, three clusters were found: (1) neutral, (2) chemotactic/APLA, and (3) IFN/dsDNA, which were also associated with disease activity. Conclusion These results support the existence of three SLE cytokine-autoantibody driven <b>subphenotypes.</b> They encourage the practice of personalized medicine, and support proof-of-concept studies...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with clefts present {{considerably}} more dental anomalies than do individuals without clefts. We used dental development to <b>subphenotype</b> clefts {{with the goal}} of identifying cleft subgroups that could have specific genetic contributions. We examined 1000 individuals, 500 with clefts and 500 without. We used several clinical features, such as cleft completeness or incompleteness, laterality, and the presence of dental anomalies to assess each individual's cleft status. We performed chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to compare the frequencies of observed anomalies between individuals with and individuals without clefts, and among individuals with different cleft subphenotypes. Agenesis of the lateral incisor on the non-cleft side was the most remarkable observation, and may suggest that such cases could be considered incomplete forms of bilateral clefts of the lip...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{variation}} in myosin IXB (MYO 9 B) {{was found to}} be associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) in a recent collaborative study. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 1545620 at the 3 ' end of the gene {{was found to be}} significantly associated with UC and weakly associated with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of our current study was to replicate these findings in an independent UC cohort and to investigate association with CD. We also investigated <b>subphenotype</b> association and interactions with CARD 15, IL 23 R, ATG 16 L 1, and the IBD 5 risk haplotype. METHODS: In all, 652 CD patients, 650 UC patients, and 1190 controls were genotyped for 8 MYO 9 B SNPs. Haplotype testing, epistasis testing with known polymorphisms, and <b>subphenotype</b> analysis were performed. RESULTS: An intronic SNP rs 2305767 in the MYO 9 B gene was associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) overall (corrected P-value 0. 002, odds ratio [OR] 0. 76, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 67 - 0. 86). On individual disease analysis an association was found with CD (corrected P-value 0. 001, OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 73) but not with UC. Analysis of the common MYO 9 B haplotypes showed significant association for CD and UC alone and IBD overall. No subphenotypic association was found. These data support an association between CD and SNPs in MYO 9 B independent of the established effects of SNPs in CARD 15, IL 23 R, ATG 16 L 1, and the IBD 5 haplotype. There was no evidence of epistasis between SNPs in MYO 9 B and these established genes. CONCLUSIONS: MYO 9 B variants may be involved in IBD pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A North American {{genome-wide}} {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) association study identified IL 23 R as a novel inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility gene. Association was reported with multiple risk variants in the centromeric portion of IL 23 R in 3 large independent cohorts. The aims {{of this study were}} to replicate the association of IL 23 R with Crohn's disease (CD), examine <b>subphenotype</b> relationships, and look for evidence of epistasis with the known CD susceptibility gene CARD 15 and susceptibility haplotype IBD 5 in a large collection of CD patients. We further investigated the relationship between IL 23 R and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In all, 604 CD and 647 UC patients who had been rigorously phenotyped and who had been recruited from a single UK center were used in this study. Controls were either spouses of patients (141) or were recruited from well-person clinics (993). Eight SNPs were genotyped using MassArray (Sequenom). All 8 SNPs genotyped were significantly associated with CD. RESULTS: The association with the nonsynonymous SNP rs 11209026 was confirmed (P= 6. 65 x 10 (- 6), odds ratio [OR], 0. 43, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 29 - 0. 64). The most significant SNP in our study was rs 7517847 (P= 4. 9 x 10 (- 9), OR 0. 65, 0. 56 - 0. 75), which is statistically independent of rs 11209026. Preliminary evidence suggests an epistatic interaction with the IBD 5 risk haplotype. The effects of mutations in this IL 23 R appear weaker in UC (P= 0. 008, OR 0. 63, 0. 45 - 0. 89 and 0. 005 OR, 0. 81, 0. 71 - 0. 94, respectively). No <b>subphenotype</b> associations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the findings that IL 23 R is a susceptibility gene for IBD with suggestive epistasis with the IBD 5 locus in the CD population...|$|E
40|$|Adult-onset asthma {{differs from}} childhood-onset asthma in many respects. It is more heterogeneous, often severe and {{frequently}} associated with loss of lung function. To identify underlying mechanisms of adult-onset asthma and to capture predictors of disease progression, detailed characterization and phenotyping is necessary. To characterize adult-onset asthma and identify <b>subphenotypes</b> of adult-onset asthma. A cohort of 200 patients with adult-onset (> 18 year) asthma (age 54 (26 - 75) year) was recruited from one academic and three nonacademic pulmonary outpatient clinics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. These patients were fully characterized {{with respect to}} clinical, functional and inflammatory markers. After data reduction, K-means nonhierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of adult-onset asthma. Patients with adult-onset asthma were predominately female (61 %) and nonatopic (55 %). Within this group of patients were identified three clusters of adult-onset asthma. Cluster 1 (n = 69) consisted of patients with severe eosinophilic inflammation-predominant asthma and persistent airflow limitation despite high-intensity anti-inflammatory treatment, with relatively low symptom scores. The second cluster was characterized by obese women with frequent symptoms, high healthcare utilization and low sputum eosinophils. The third cluster consisted of patients with mild-to-moderate, well-controlled asthma with normal lung function and low inflammatory markers. Repeatability accuracy was 98. 2 %. Amongst patients with adult-onset asthma, three <b>subphenotypes</b> can be identified with distinct clinical and inflammatory characteristics. These <b>subphenotypes</b> help to understand the underlying pathobiology and provide clinicians with directions for personalized managemen...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} recent {{success in the}} detection of gene-disease associations. We consider here the development of tools that facilitate the more detailed characterization {{of the effect of}} a genetic variant on disease. We replace the simplistic classification of individuals according to a single binary disease indicator with classification according to a number of <b>subphenotypes.</b> This more accurately reflects the underlying biological complexity of the disease process, but it poses additional analytical difficulties. Notably, the <b>subphenotypes</b> that make up a particular disease are typically highly associated, and it becomes difficult to distinguish which genes might be causing which <b>subphenotypes.</b> Such problems arise in many complex diseases. Here, we concentrate on an application to Crohn disease (CD). We consider this problem as one of model selection based upon log-linear models, fitted in a Bayesian framework via reversible-jump Metropolis-Hastings approach. We evaluate the performance of our suggested approach with a simple simulation study and then apply the method to a real data example in CD, revealing a sparse disease structure. Most notably, the associated NOD 2. 908 G→R mutation appears to be directly related to more severe disease behaviors, whereas the other two associated NOD 2 variants, 1007 L→FS and 702 R→W, are more generally related to disease in the small bowel (ileum and jejenum). The ATG 16 L 1. 300 T→A variant appears to be directly associated with only disease of the small bowel...|$|R

Little {{is known about}} the genetic contribution to the severity and progression of PSC. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify genetic variants associated with PSC disease progression and development of complications. We collected standardised PSC <b>subphenotypes</b> in a large cohort of 3402 patients with PSC. After quality control, we combined 130 [*] 422 single nucleotide polymorphisms of all patients-obtained using the Illumina immunochip-with their disease <b>subphenotypes.</b> Using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, we identified genetic variants associated with binary and time-to-event PSC <b>subphenotypes.</b> We identified genetic variant rs 853974 to be associated with liver transplant-free survival (p= 6. 07 × 10 (- 9)). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a 50. 9 % (95 % CI 41. 5 % to 59. 5 %) transplant-free survival for homozygous AA allele carriers of rs 853974 compared with 72. 8 % (95 % CI 69. 6 % to 75. 7 %) for GG carriers at 10 years after PSC diagnosis. For the candidate gene in the region, RSPO 3, we demonstrated expression in key liver-resident effector cells, such as human and murine cholangiocytes and human hepatic stellate cells. We present a large international PSC cohort, and report genetic loci associated with PSC disease progression. For liver transplant-free survival, we identified a genome-wide significant signal and demonstrated expression of the candidate gene RSPO 3 in key liver-resident effector cells. This warrants further assessments of the role of this potential key PSC modifier gen...|$|R
