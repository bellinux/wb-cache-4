40|$|We {{present a}} {{distributed}} execution model for asynchronous systems with crash failures {{that we call}} <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System. As {{if they were in}} a synchronous system, in <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System, the processes try to run in <b>synchronized</b> rounds. More precisely, a <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System is a sequence of phases, and each phase is a sequence of <b>synchronized</b> rounds. The number of successive <b>synchronized</b> rounds characterizes the liveness properties of <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems. A <b>Synchronized</b> Phase System is a good paradigm to design fault tolerant algorithms and we show how to use it to implement efficiently Consensus and Atomic Broadcast. <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems can be implemented in asynchronous systems, but the liveness properties depend on the knowledge of processes concerning the failure of other processes. <b>Synchronized</b> Phase Systems are also a good abstraction for "real world" distributed systems like synchronous systems containing some sorts of timing and crash [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R. The series was {{produced}} primarily by using the machinima technique of <b>synchronizing</b> video footage from video games to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio. The series was produced {{at the request of}} Monolith Productions {{as a part of a}} tie-in with the Director's Edition of the F.E.A.R., which the Rooster Teeth team used to produce the series. The mini-series consists of five episodes. Four of these have been released on the Rooster Teeth website, and one — episode 0, a prequel — originally shipped exclusively with the F.E.A.R. Director's Edition DVD. It is also included with the game's digital release on GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in <b>synchronizing</b> the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E

40|$|Anecdotal {{accounts}} {{suggest that}} individuals spontaneously <b>synchronize</b> their movements to the 2 ̆ 7 beat 2 ̆ 7 of background music, often without intending to, {{and perhaps even}} without attending to the music at all. However, {{the question of whether}} intention and attention are necessary to <b>synchronize</b> to the beat remains unclear. Here, we compared whether footsteps during overground walking were <b>synchronized</b> to the beat when young healthy adults were explicitly instructed to <b>synchronize</b> (intention to <b>synchronize),</b> and were not instructed to <b>synchronize</b> (no intention) (Experiment 1 : intention). We also examined whether reducing participants 2 ̆ 7 attention to the music affected synchronization, again when participants were explicitly instructed to <b>synchronize,</b> and when they were not (Experiment 2 : attention/intention).

5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or <b>synchronizing</b> the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of <b>synchronizing</b> manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
