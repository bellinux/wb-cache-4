5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

50|$|In sediments, sterane {{biomarkers}} {{are found}} as {{a mixture of}} steroisomers. It {{can be difficult to}} separate out a specific stereoisomer, as is necessary for the detection of <b>solely</b> 24-n-propylcholestane. <b>Because</b> of this, 24-n-propylcholestane can be fairly difficult to detect using gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS). It has a m/z of 414 and a secondary peak at 217, and can be easily confused for a different group of C30 molecules, 4ɑ-methylsteranes.|$|R

25|$|In most {{societies}} {{the great}} majority of people eat meat when they can get it, but increasing controversy and debate has arisen over the ethics of eating animals. The most commonly given ethical objection to meat-eating is that, for most people living in the developed world, it is not necessary for survival or health; slaughtering animals <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> people enjoy the taste of meat is argued by some to be wrong and morally unjustifiable.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, {{there is}} good in having {{absolute}} power, and good in leading by persuasion. For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule <b>solely</b> by predestination, <b>because</b> then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion.

Incorporation of these observations into the panoply of data obtained from the history and physical examination will enhance both the accuracy and adventure of differential diagnosis.

5000|$|Many {{consumers}} read left-to-right, and therefore, compare {{prices in}} the same manner. [...] For example, {{if the price of}} a product is $93 and the sales price is $79, people will initially compare the left digits first (9 and 7) and notice the two digit difference. [...] However, because of this habitual behavior, “consumers may perceive the ($14) difference between $93 and $79 as greater than the ($14) difference between $89 and $75”. [...] As a result, consumers often mistakenly believe they are receiving a better deal with the first set of prices based on the left digits <b>solely.</b> [...] <b>Because</b> of that common misconception, companies capitalize on this sales pricing strategy more often than not to increase sales.|$|R
25|$|Planning {{permission}} for the competing Tesco {{development on the}} opposite side of the A2 road had been granted on 28 November 1998. Following the quashing of planning {{permission for}} D5 its developers sought judicial review of the permission granted to Tesco, arguing that the same could apply to that development, however this was refused on 17 September 1999. This judgement was slightly controversial, given that the judge refused to rescind planning permission <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> the £13million Tesco store was almost complete.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Regents of the University of California, {{urged by}} then-California Governor Ronald Reagan, fired {{her from her}} $10,000 a year post in 1969 because of her {{membership}} in the Communist Party.

60|$|I {{have but}} an indistinct {{idea of what}} {{happened}} for some time after this baleful object presented itself to my view. I was very merry, I know; but it was hollow merriment. I attached myself to a young creature in pink, with little eyes, and flirted with her desperately. She received my attentions with favour; but whether on my account <b>solely,</b> or <b>because</b> she had any designs on Red Whisker, I can't say. Dora's health was drunk. When I drank it, I affected to interrupt my conversation for that purpose, and to resume it immediately afterwards. I caught Dora's eye as I bowed to her, and I thought it looked appealing. But it looked at me {{over the head of}} Red Whisker, and I was adamant.|$|R
30|$|An LSA {{model can}} be viewed as an {{improvement}} over a model based <b>solely</b> on n-grams <b>because</b> it has a more precise measure of similarity.

This model reached an accuracy level of 78.74 %, while the LSA model reached 84.94 %. With these numbers, we can assert that this technology is efficient enough for practical application.|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of the federal government}} has shaped every facet of the city of Ottawa, and its architecture has been dramatically affected for both good and ill. Ottawa exists as a major city almost <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> it was selected to be the capital of the new nation of Canada, and the federal government remains the dominant employer in the city. Many of Ottawa's most acclaimed structures are the result of federal government projects, but the affinity for cheapness and blandness of recent government building has also {{played a central role in}} Ottawa's perceived architectural dullness.|$|E

Shamrock then engaged in a feud with White {{in the media and}} ultimately sued the UFC for breach of contract, citing that he had one fight left on his deal that the UFC had to honor.

40|$|When cassava is intercropped with legumes the {{cassava root}} yield {{generally}} decreases compared with when cassava is planted alone. This {{is due to}} the competition of the component crops for light, water and nutrients. However, cassava-legume intercropping systems usually increase the land use efficiency and economic return over <b>solely</b> cassava. <b>Because</b> of the current low market price for cassava roots, dual-purpose production of cassava for both root and fodder should be developed. Cassava hay is a good fodder for dairy cows, and legume crops, such as cowpea and peanut whose residues also provide good fodder for livestock, can be intercropped with cassava. When cowpea was row and strip intercropped with cassava, it produced fodder yields of 1. 7 to 2. 4 tons/ha, depending on the cowpea cultivar. Cowpea seeds and young green pods are eaten by humans. A food-feed system based on cassava-cowpea strip intercropping has been successfully developed by dairy farmers in Mahasarakham province in Northeast Thailand. Peanuts and mungbean are also high-potential legume crops for food-feed systems for dairy farmers...|$|R
