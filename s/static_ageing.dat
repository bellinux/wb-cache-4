40|$|International audienceThe {{work-hardening}} behaviour {{of virgin}} martensitic steel {{has been investigated}} in a strictly un-aged state and after various ageing conditions. At room temperature (RT), the un-aged alloy shows astonishing tensile performances (ultimate tensile stress[*]=[*] 1600 [*]MPa/uniform elongation[*]=[*] 15 %) but unexpected serrations. These serrations can be suppressed by <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> (at RT or higher) while maintaining the initial work-hardening rate (ageing at RT). Parallel investigations using atom probe tomography reveal that the distribution of carbon at the atomic scale evolves from purely homogeneous for virgin martensite to partly segregated at a very fine scale (5 - 10 [*]nm) after <b>static</b> <b>ageing.</b> This particular mechanical behaviour can therefore {{be associated with a}} very local decrease in available carbon in solid solution due to redistribution and segregations on defects (nanotwins) that occurs rapidly, even after few days at RT...|$|E

However, {{within a few years}} this demographic trend will be reversed, leading to a decline in population as a whole and especially in the number of those gainfully employed. In this paper, we use a population projection to apply a <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> approach to German micro data. Then, we simulate income tax revenue with a microsimulation model for the future population. In 20 years’ time the annual price-adjusted income tax loss is estimated to be equal to € 18 billion or almost 7 per cent.

40|$|To assess {{possible}} distribution {{effects of}} alternative scenarios, including hypothetical future states, {{one can use}} either <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> techniques, which age the population by reweighing and uprating, or dynamic ageing, which alter the relevant population by applying deterministic probabilities that a certain event {{may or may not}} occur. This paper makes the argument that, even though the two methods are technically completely different, they are not unlike in terms of their simulation properties. Starting from the thesis that under theoretical circumstances, both approaches are equivalent in terms of their simulation properties, the choice between the two archetypes of models comes down to assessing how far the actual and theoretical circumstances differ from each other. By highlighting the differences and resemblances between static and dynamic microsimulations in terms of their simulation properties, this short note will contribute to the debate in choosing between these two types of models, and can thus serve as an advice piece for someone contemplating the development of a microsimulation model. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{converter}} technologies {{situated in}} the exhaust streams of vehicles are under continuing pressure to meet more stringent emissions standards that requires increasing longevity along with higher efficiencies. This investigation studied the fundamental factors known to contribute to catalyst deactivation, by developing the specific designs and by construction of ageing facilities that isolated the ageing factors under inspection. Various <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> schedules were completed along with rapid ageing cycles {{with the aid of}} a custom built synthetic gas ageing machine named AutoCAS, (Automotive Catalyst Ageing System). Explicit characterisation techniques to help define the extent of catalyst degradation were also developed. These focused on use of scanning electron, microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to produce images of the catalyst which could then be analysed using image analysis software. The software program enabled statistical data to be collated, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the surface structure before and after ageing. Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the changes in catalyst substrate after the ageing process. Results uncovered that Platinum/Rhodium, (PtIRh), catalysts behave differently to Palladium, Pd, catalysts with respect to particle agglomeration. Pd loaded samples exhibited relationships with respect to ageing time and temperature whilst PtlRh catalysts were only susceptible to ageing temperature. Also, concluded was that PtlRh catalysts undergo agglomeration in an inert nitrogen environment which is in direct contradiction to mathematical expressions already published. Precious metal particle agglomeration was found to have a relatively insignificant role to play in overall catalyst deactivation. RATA ageing showed that the thermal stressing incurred by thermal cycling affected the catalyst activity more so than ageing at uniform temperature. Application ofthe current QUB catalyst model showed that there may be other factors contributing to deactivation rather than just washcoat sintering and precious metal agglomeration as measured in this research.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to identify single chemical agents that exhibit a desirable rheological property whereby if such a chemical is dissolved in salt water it increases the solution viscosity significantly with time. We term that behavior as 'self-thickening' and have nicknamed this as 'T 85 technology'. As detailed in the original project proposal, such single chemical products {{can be applied to}} advantage as agents for selectively slowing or blocking high flow water channels in subsurface oil reservoirs. The net effect is a decrease in water and an increase in oil flow and production. The initial testing has focused on five different synthetic co-polymers that have two or more chemical groups. These chemicals were dissolved at a concentration of 2500 ppm into different salt solutions (sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride) that encompass a range of dissolved salt concentrations. For the sodium chloride and potassium chloride solutions the salt concentration ranged from 1 - 5 wt%. The calcium chloride dihydrate sample concentrations ranged from 0. 1 - 1 wt%. One set of samples being aged at 25 C and a second set at 50 C. Viscosity measurements versus aging time show two of these agents may exhibit apparent self-thickening behavior under certain salinity and temperature conditions. Generally the effect is greater in lower salinity NaCl brines and at 25 C. Preliminary flow experiments confirm that the aged fluids exhibit increased effective viscosity while flowing through a porous medium (sand pack). These flow tests include the case of the chemical fluid being aged on the bench before injection into a sand pack, and also a second series of sand packs where fresh chemical fluid is injected and allowed to age in-situ. Thus, the results of the <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> tests together with the flow tests are a technical validation of the T 85 concept...|$|E
40|$|During {{cleaning}} {{steps in}} water drinking production, ultrafiltration membranes are mechanically and chemically stressed. This {{can result in}} membrane degradations and failures: separation properties of the membrane can change causing {{an increase in the}} permeation of large molecules through the membrane and/ or cracking of the membrane layer takes place leading to leakage of feed stream into the permeate stream. Failure of the filtration system requires a shut down for membrane replacement, which directly affects the production rate of the process. So, this raises the problem of the necessary optimization of the cleaning procedures which {{have to take into account}} the best cleaning efficiency as well as the less detrimental procedures for the membranes. That is why ageing is becoming the new bone of contention between end users, membrane manufacturers and chemical product suppliers. Nevertheless, in spite of numerous scientific researches realized on the subject, several gaps can be underlined: - First, the commonly used parameter “concentration × time of exposure” (c × t) is used to make ageing experiments easier and to shorten the experimental times involved by the ageing mechanisms. This way of thinking would suppose that strong concentrations for short times of exposure could be considered equivalent to low concentrations for long times of exposure. This approach remains questionable and the major issue of the current membrane ageing researches would be to define consistent and representative ageing protocols. - Secondly, the studies performed until now are mainly focused on hypochlorite, while the latter is not universally applied and the use of chlorine-based reagents is expected to be restricted in the next years. Some new membranes are not chlorine tolerant and the use of chlorine was shown to generate chlorinated organics with detrimental effects on health and environmental impacts. So, alternative detergents could significantly be used in the future. However very few work have been focused on the membrane ageing resulting from the use of formulated detergents. In this paper, some <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> results have been detailed. Polysulfone hollow fibers membranes were used to simulate industrial ageing in static conditions by NaOCl and by four commercial detergents: P 3 -Ultrasil 75 (acidic), P 3 -Ultrasil 110 (alkaline), P 3 -Ultrasil 67 /P 3 -Ultrasil 69 New (Enzymatic/buffer) and P 3 -Oxysan ZS (free chlorine oxidant). The macroscopic changes were monitored by permeability measurement and mechanical strength tests coupled with a microscopic characterization by ATR-FTIR (to identify the functional groups affected by ageing) and SEM (to visualize qualitatively the surface modifications). The aim is to achieve a better understanding of changes in membrane properties, or at least an identification of the combination of cleaning parameters (concentration, time and temperature) which should be avoid in cleaning procedures. -First, preliminary experiments were carried out (only with NaOCl) for a same value of the c × t parameter, but with a simultaneous variation of concentration and time of exposure. For a same value of the c × t parameter, it was shown that the macroscopic as well as the microscopic ageing were not equivalent for a high concentration/short time of exposure and low concentration/long time of exposure. For the ultrafiltration membranes and for the experimental conditions tested, the permeability deterioration in function of c × t parameter has been shown to be not homogeneous according to the temperature. -Secondly, further experiments were realized using an approach based on experimental designs in order to achieve a relevant and predictive ageing pattern without using an accelerated ageing protocol. For that, a wide concentrations range around the industrial concentrations commonly used (200 ppm for NaOCl, 0. 3 % w/v for P 3 -Ultrasil 75, 0. 7 %w/v for P 3 -Ultrasil 110, 0. 3 %/ 0. 8 % w/v for P 3 -Ultrasil 67 / 69 New, 0. 1 % w/v for P 3 -Oxysan ZS), several temperatures (from 5 °C to 40 °C, except for P 3 -Oxysan ZS, only tested at 20 °C) and several soaking times (from 7 days to 180 days) were tested. For all the tested detergents, permeability and elongation at break values obtained with the statistical model are simulated with an error included in the measurement accuracy. So, the pattern established for macroscopic membrane deteriorations can be considered satisfying and reliable to simulate membrane ageing in function of the tested parameters. These results show high deteriorations involved by NaOCl (increase of permeability, decrease of strength at break, modifications of surface properties, apparition of crackles, and disappearance of specific peaks from ATR-FTIR spectra). The results at 20 °C of fibers aged in NaOCl and P 3 -Oxysan ZS at their respective industrial concentrations show that degradations of membrane are far more detrimental with NaOCl than with P 3 -Oxysan ZS. Concerning the other detergents tested (and considering the long ageing duration applied in this study) it could be concluded that the ECOLAB formulated detergents are quite harmless for the membrane for a time corresponding to the effective cumulated industrial time of contact. For the first time in the chemical membranes ageing researches, designs of experiments were used to organize at best the experiments in order to achieve a relevant establishment of an ageing pattern without using an accelerated ageing. Results showed that this scientific approach could provide a satisfying and reliable pattern established to simulate membrane ageing in function of the chemical parameters. Then, results show that NaOCl causes the worst ageing deteriorations on membranes after extended exposure: changes in membrane chemical groups, hydraulic performances, mechanical properties and physical structure. Only <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> is presented in this abstract. To complete this work, dynamic ageing experiments have also been realized (in the same conditions of concentration, time and temperature as the ones studied during <b>static</b> <b>ageing).</b> The aim is to be able to compare the ageing due to the chemical contact and the ageing due to the mechanical stress (pressure, scratches, abrasions…) induced by process parameters such as cycling during operation or extreme pressure...|$|E

Coarse and fine NbX precipitates and also s-phase precipitates were formed in the temperature range 500 - 700 °C. A new method for accurate measurement of &# 963;-phase volume fraction using scanning electron microscopy and backscattered electrons (SEM/BSE) was developed. The volume fraction and precipitate size of coarse NbX precipitates and of s-phase particles were determined using different SEM techniques. Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) {{was used to determine}} the volume fraction and precipitate size of secondary NbX precipitates. Atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) was used to follow the changes in matrix composition and to measure NbX composition. The material was affected by nitrogen uptake when aged at 800 °C leading to the formation of Z-phase, Cr 2 N and M 23 C 6. The iron-rich austenitic Alloy 800 was investigated for statically aged and creep deformed conditions between 600 °C and 1000 °C for up to 84 000 h. Coarse TiX precipitates were present in all investigated conditions. M 23 C 6 and &# 947;´-precipitates were found in material creep tested at 600, 650 and 700 °C. M 23 C 6 was also found at 800 °C but not at 1000 °C. The volume fraction and precipitate size of &# 947;´ particles were determined using EFTEM at 600, 650 and at 700 °C.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission (AE) generated during Luders and Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) {{deformation bands}} {{has been studied}} in Al- 2. 5 % Mg and Cu- 30 % Zn. It has been observed that the cumulative AE detected during the Luders deformation increases at decreasing strain rates while Luders bands become shorter and are increasingly serrated, especially in AlMg. Once PLC bands develop, AE appears in a stepwise fashion. The acoustic activity concentrates mainly on the beginning of every new band, but preceding the first load drop. Once nucleated, the PLC bands propagate with relatively low AE. Some burst activity is recorded during the stress raise after the load drops, while a continuous type burst is emitted during the load drop. Total AE increases with decreasing strain rate during serrated flow, as during the Luders regime. The increase in total AE correlates very well either with the shortening of Luders bands or the increase in serration amplitude of PLC bands at decreasing imposed deformation rates. A close correspondence can be established between the phenomenology of AE and TEM and in situ HVTEM observations concerning dislocation dynamics and dislocation breeding in localized slip bands. The relatively low AE recorded at high imposed deformation rates when the bands (Luders or PLC) move smoothly can be ascribed to the multislip mechanism of coarse slip bands involved in the bands movement, which clearly may preclude the emission of large acoustic bursts. On the other hand, at low deformation rates stress relaxation and <b>static</b> <b>ageing</b> during discontinuous band movement immobilizes previously operative sources, so that activation of fresh sources become {{necessary in order to}} resume deformation. Dislocation movements in undeformed slip systems is presumably very fast so that a high level AE should be possible when fresh sources are put into operation. As a consequence, AE increases at decreasing strain rates. At increasing strain rates the available time for stress relaxation and pile up stabilization at the band front after load drops is progressively reduced. Previously operative sources can now be reactivated to a larger extent, decreasing the need for fresh sources activation. Reactivation of previously operative sources presumably occurs with low level AE due to the high dislocation density in the slip planes. In this way the strain per active plane increases with strain rate while acoustic activity decreases. The correspondence between stress amplitude of serrations and AE can be rationalized in the same terms. A complementary explanation in terms of the crystallographic microbands involved in the macro shear bands nucleation seems possible in the case of PLC bands. When the band is smooth at high strain rates the stress level at the band front is continuously high and the number of unsuccessful microbands needed to originate every localized shear band is presumably lower than at low strain rates when the stress level decreases after the load drops. AE is therefore higher at the lower strain rates than at the higher ones. Something essentially similar must occur when every new PLC band is nucleated. No stress concentrations nor mobile dislocations are available after a band traverses the entire gauge length and the deformation must be started by copious activation of new sources (microbands), with high emission preceding the first load drop. Once the band is formed the deformation mode involved reduces the acoustic activity during the band movement, so that a step-wise AE is observed...|$|E
