50|$|The {{frequency}} of data loss {{and the impact}} can be greatly mitigated by taking proper precautions, those of which necessary can {{vary depending on the}} type of data loss. For example, multiple power circuits with battery backup and a generator only protect against power failures, though using an <b>Uninterruptable</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> can protect your drive against sudden power spikes. Similarly, using a journaling file system and RAID storage only protect against certain types of software and hardware failure. For hard disk drives, which are a physical storage medium, ensuring minimal vibration and movement will help protect against damaging the components internally, as can maintaining a suitable drive temperature.|$|R

30|$|The NPM {{design is}} {{considerably}} simpler and more compact than a similar research-grade magnetometer, {{such as the}} THEMIS GBO fluxgate magnetometer. The THEMIS GBO magnetometers that were distributed {{as part of the}} NASA THEMIS mission consisted of multiple components: 1.1 m long fluxgate magnetometer sensor tube, AC-powered magnetometer electronics unit, GPS antenna and receiver card, desktop PC and display, <b>uninterruptable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (UPS), remote booting device, assorted cables, and data collection software (Russell et al, 2008). NPM was intentionally designed to encapsulate these components into a single unit in order to simplify installation. The operator of an NPM unit only needs to bury the instrument and provide power and Internet access. We chose to eliminate the desktop PC computer entirely because we felt was a major point of failure in terms of software and hardware reliability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{adopted a}} Holtek HT 66 F 50, {{featured}} with Flash Memory A/D type 8 -bit microcontroller (MCU), and {{connected with a}} MQ 7 gas sensor and ventilation fans on the ceiling to input the level of carbon monoxide (CO) into the MCU for calculating. As the level of CO in the air reaches 100 ppm, the fans will be activated to exhaust CO out to the space; besides, if the level of CO in the air is over 200 ppm, the buzzer will sound indicating “Alarm”.

40|$|A {{very fast}} phase angle {{estimation}} algorithm for a single-phase system under a sudden phase angle jump condition is proposed in this work. When a source voltage {{changes in a}} step manner, e. g., when an electrical railway traction crosses over to the <b>power</b> section <b>supplied</b> by another voltage source, the phase angle detector of normal use such as a phase locked loop (PLL), a low pass or notch filter typically generates phase delay and results in a sluggish response, and causes some time-critical machine to malfunction. In this work, a method of estimating the fundamental component and the phase angle of the source voltage without a significant delay is presented, by using the weighted least-squares estimation (WLSE) method with the covariance resetting technique. A frequency update law is also proposed to accommodate the frequency varying environments.

Such power which comes from the main energy provider is most of the times supported by local <b>uninterruptable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> devices (UPS) which should therefore have a higher order of magnitude in terms of exploitability and reliability with respect to the hardware they are locally supporting.

40|$|Abstract—Power {{failures}} in data centers and Cloud Computing infrastructures can cause loss {{of data and}} impact revenue. Exist-ing best practice such as persistent logging and checkpointing add overhead during operation and increase recovery time. Other solutions like {{the use of an}} <b>uninterruptable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> incur additional costs and are maintenance-intensive. Novel persistent main memory, i. e. memory that retains stored data without an external source of power, firstly prevents data loss in case of a power outage, secondly reduces the time for a system reboot and thirdly enables to continue operation at full-speed after a recovery.
