40|$|The {{formation}} of aerosol particles by homogeneous nucleation in a supersaturated vapor containing <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> {{has been studied}} experimentally and theoretically. In the laboratory, a room-temperature gas optionally containing zinc chloride particles is continuously mixed with a high-temperature gas saturated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) vapor in a previously discussed device {{for the study of}} aerosol nucleation known as a particle size magnifier (PSM). A highly supersaturated vapor is rapidly formed in the mixing zone of the PSM, and gas-to-particle conversion ensues. The vapor may be converted to the aerosol phase by condensation onto the preexisting particles or by homogeneous nucleation to form new particles which then serve as condensation sites themselves. The split between these alternate pathways for gas-to-particle conversion may be deduced from measurements of the resulting aerosol concentrations for different initial supersaturations, <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentrations, and <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> sizes. The measured final aerosol concentrations are compared with those predicted by a dynamic model that combines expressions for classical nucleation theory and for steady-state particle growth, and agreement is found to within experimental uncertainties. Suppression of homogeneous nucleation by <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> is not predicted to be strong unless <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> number concentrations are larger than the number concentrations which would result from homogeneous nucleation alone...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{oxidation}} state and molecular composition of α-pinene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) by varying the types and surface areas of inorganic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> {{that are used}} to promote the condensation of SOA-forming vapors. The oxidation state of α-pinene SOA is found to increase with inorganic seed surface area, likely a result of enhanced condensation of low-volatility organic compounds on particles versus deposition on the chamber wall. α-Pinene SOA is more highly oxygenated in the presence of sodium nitrate (SN) seed than ammonium sulfate seed. The relative abundance of semivolatile monomers and low-volatility dimer components that account {{for more than half of}} α-pinene SOA mass is not significantly affected by the composition of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Enhanced uptake of highly oxidized small carboxylic acids onto SN seed particles is observed, which could potentially explain the observed higher SOA oxidation state in the presence of SN <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Overall, our results demonstrate that a combined effect of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> composition and surface area leads to an increase in the O:C atomic ratio of α-pinene SOA by as much as a factor of 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} vapor-wall {{deposition}} on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation has gained significant attention; however, uncertainties in experimentally derived SOA mass yields due to uncertainties in particle-wall deposition remain. Different approaches {{have been used}} to correct for particle-wall deposition in SOA formation studies, each having its own set of assumptions in determining the particle-wall loss rate. In volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compound (VOC and IVOC) systems in which SOA formation is governed by kinetically limited growth, the effect of vapor-wall deposition on SOA mass yields can be constrained by using high surface area concentrations of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> to promote the condensation of SOA-forming vapors onto <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> instead of the chamber walls. However, under such high <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> levels, the presence of significant coagulation may complicate the particle-wall deposition correction. Here, we present a model framework that accounts for coagulation in chamber studies in which high <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area concentrations are used. For the α -pinene ozonolysis system, we find that after accounting for coagulation, SOA mass yields remain approximately constant when high <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area concentrations ([*]≥[*]  8000  µm 2  cm − 3) are used, consistent with our prior study (Nah et al., 2016) showing that α -pinene ozonolysis SOA formation is governed by quasi-equilibrium growth. In addition, we systematically assess the uncertainties in the calculated SOA mass concentrations and yields between four different particle-wall loss correction methods over the series of α -pinene ozonolysis experiments. At low <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area concentrations (<  3000  µm 2  cm − 3), the SOA mass yields at peak SOA growth obtained from the particle-wall loss correction methods agree within 14  %. However, at high <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area concentrations ([*]≥[*]  8000  µm 2  cm − 3), the SOA mass yields at peak SOA growth obtained from different particle-wall loss correction methods can differ by as much as 58  %. These differences arise from assumptions made in the particle-wall loss correction regarding the first-order particle-wall loss rate. This study highlights the importance of accounting for particle-wall deposition accurately during SOA formation chamber experiments and assessing the uncertainties associated with the application of the particle-wall deposition correction method when comparing and using SOA mass yields measured in different studies...|$|E

40|$|Smog chamber {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the hygroscopicity of particles generated from photooxidation of alpha-pinene/NOx with different sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> or oxidation conditions. Hygroscopicity of particles was measured by a tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) in terms of hygroscopic growth factor (Gf), with a relative humidity of 85 %. With sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> present, Gf of the aerosols decreased very fast before notable secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation was observed, indicating a heterogeneous process between inorganic seeds and organic products might take place as soon as oxidation begins, rather than only happening after gas-aerosol partition of organic products starts. The final SOA-coated sulfate particles had similar or lower Gf than seed-free SOA. The hygroscopicity of the final particles was not dependent on the thickness but on the hygroscopicity properties of the SOA, which were influenced by the initial sulfate seed particles. In the two designed aging processes, Gf of the particles increased more significantly with introduction of OH radical than with ozone. However, the hygroscopicity of SOA was very low even after a long time of aging, implying that either SOA aging in the chamber was very slow or the Gf of SOA did not change significantly in aging. Using an aerosol composition speciation monitor (ACSM) and matrix factorization (PMF) method, two factors for the components of SOA were identified, but the correlation between SOA hygroscopicity {{and the proportion of}} the more highly oxidized factor could be either positive or negative depending on the speciation of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> present...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{relative}} humidity (RH) on aerosol formation by the semi-volatile oxidation {{products of the}} α-pinene/O_ 3 system has been comprehensively studied. Experiments were performed {{in the presence of}} ammonium sulfate (aqueous, dry), ammonium bisulfate seed (aqueous, dry), and aqueous calcium chloride <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> to ascertain their effect on the partitioning of the oxidation products. The yield of organic aerosol varies little with RH, and is not affected by the presence of dry inorganic salt aerosols. Aqueous salt aerosols reduce the yield of organic aerosol compared to that under seed-free or dry seed conditions. The degree of reduction is electrolyte dependent, with aqueous ammonium sulfate leading to the largest reduction and aqueous calcium chloride the smallest. Hygroscopic growth of the organic aerosol from < 2 % to 85 % RH was also monitored, and could be satisfactorily represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the organic and inorganic fractions. The implications of the growth factor measurements for concentration/activity relationships of the condensed phase organic material (assuming a liquid solution) was explored. The formation of the organic aerosol was investigated using a simple two component model, and also one including the 12 product compounds identified in a previous study. The experimental results for < 2 % and 50 % RH (without salt <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols)</b> could be satisfactorily predicted. However, the aqueous salt <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> are predicted to increase the overall yield due to the dissolution of the organic compounds into the water associated with the seed aerosol—the opposite effect to that observed.

In this study, the chemical composition of aerosol formed from glyoxal is identical {{in the presence}} or absence of OH. In addition, there was no observed OH dependence on either glyoxal uptake or glyoxal-driven aerosol growth for this study. These findings demonstrate that, for the system used here, glyoxal uptake is not affected by the presence of OH. In combination with previous studies, this shows that the exact nature of the type of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol,</b> in particular the presence of a coating, has a large influence on fast photochemical uptake of glyoxal.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that particle-phase {{reactions}} contribute {{to the formation of}} secondary organic aerosol (SOA), with enhancements of SOA yields in the presence of acidic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> In this study, the chemical composition of SOA from the photooxidations of α-pinene and isoprene, in {{the presence or absence of}} sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol,</b> is investigated through a series of controlled chamber experiments in two separate laboratories. By using electrospray ionization−mass spectrometry, sulfate esters in SOA produced in laboratory photooxidation experiments are identified for the first time. Sulfate esters are found to account for a larger fraction of the SOA mass when the acidity of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> is increased, a result consistent with aerosol acidity increasing SOA formation. Many of the isoprene and α-pinene sulfate esters identified in these chamber experiments are also found in ambient aerosol collected at several locations in the southeastern U. S.

40|$|Laboratory chambers, {{invaluable}} in {{atmospheric chemistry}} and aerosol formation studies, {{are subject to}} particle and vapor wall deposition, processes {{that need to be}} accounted for in order to accurately determine secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass yields. Although particle wall deposition is reasonably well understood and usually accounted for, vapor wall deposition is less so. The effects of vapor wall deposition on SOA mass yields in chamber experiments can be constrained experimentally by increasing the <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area to promote the preferential condensation of SOA-forming vapors onto <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Here, we study the influence of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> surface area and oxidation rate on SOA formation in α -pinene ozonolysis. The observations are analyzed using a coupled vapor–particle dynamics model to interpret the roles of gas–particle partitioning (quasi-equilibrium vs. kinetically limited SOA growth) and α -pinene oxidation rate in influencing vapor wall deposition. We find that the SOA growth rate and mass yields are independent of seed surface area within the range of seed surface area concentrations used in this study. This behavior arises when the condensation of SOA-forming vapors is dominated by quasi-equilibrium growth. Faster α -pinene oxidation rates and higher SOA mass yields are observed at increasing O 3 concentrations for the same initial α -pinene concentration. When the α -pinene oxidation rate increases relative to vapor wall deposition, rapidly produced SOA-forming oxidation products condense more readily onto <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles, resulting in higher SOA mass yields. Our results indicate that the extent to which vapor wall deposition affects SOA mass yields depends on the particular volatility organic compound system and can be mitigated through the use of excess oxidant concentrations...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{isoprene}} as {{a precursor}} to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) over Europe is studied with the two-way nested global chemistry transport model TM 5. The inclusion {{of the formation of}} SOA from isoprene oxidation in our model almost doubles the atmospheric burden of SOA over Europe compared to SOA formation from terpenes and aromatics. The reference simulation, which considers SOA formation from isoprene, terpenes and aromatics, predicts a yearly European production rate of 1. 0 Tg SOA yr − 1 and an annual averaged atmospheric burden of about 50 Gg SOA over Europe. A fraction of 35 % of the SOA produced in the boundary layer over Europe is transported to higher altitudes or to other world regions. Summertime measurements of organic matter (OM) during the extensive EMEP OC/EC campaign 2002 / 2003 are better reproduced when SOA formation from isoprene is taken into account, reflecting also the strong seasonality of isoprene and other biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions from vegetation. However, during winter, our model strongly underestimates OM, likely caused by missing wood burning in the emission inventories. Uncertainties in the parameterisation of isoprene SOA formation have been investigated. Maximum SOA production is found for irreversible sticking (non-equilibrium partitioning) of condensable vapours on particles, with tropospheric SOA production over Europe increased by a factor of 4 in summer compared to the reference case. Completely neglecting SOA formation from isoprene results in the lowest estimate (0. 51 Tg SOA yr − 1). The amount {{and the nature of the}} absorbing matter are shown to be another key uncertainty when predicting SOA levels. Consequently, smog chamber experiments on SOA formation should be performed with different types of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> and without <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> in order to derive an improved treatment of the absorption of SOA in the models.

40|$|A large oxygenated organic uptake to {{aerosols}} {{was observed}} when exposing ambient urban air to inorganic acidic and non-acidic sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> For non-acidic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> the uptake {{was attributed to}} the direct condensation of primary vehicle exhaust gases, and was correlated to the initial seed sulfate mass. The uptake of primary oxygenated organic gases to aerosols in this study represents {{a significant amount of}} organic aerosol (OA) when compared to that reported for primary organic aerosol (POA), but is considerably more oxygenated (O : C ~ 0. 3) than traditional POA. Consequently, a fraction of measured ambient oxygenated OA, which correlate with secondary sulfate, may in fact be of a primary, rather than secondary source. These results represent a new source of oxygenated OA on neutral aerosol and imply that the uptake of primary organic gases will occur in the ambient atmosphere, under dilute conditions, and in the presence of pre-existing SO 4 aerosols. Under acidic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> conditions, oligomer formation was observed with the uptake of organics being enhanced by a factor of three or more compared to neutral aerosols, and in less than 2 min. This resulted in a trajectory in Van Krevelen space towards higher O : C (slope ~ − 1. 5), despite a lack of continual gas-phase oxidation in this closed system. The results demonstrate that high molecular weight species will form on acidic aerosols at the ambient level and mixture of organic gases, but are otherwise unaffected by subsequent aerosol neutralization, and that aerosol acidity will affect the organic O : C via aerosol-phase reactions. These new processes under both neutral and acidic conditions can contribute to ambient OA mass and the evolution of ambient aerosol O : C ratios and may be important for properly representing organic aerosol O : C ratios in air quality and climate models...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} SO 2 and NH 3 on {{secondary}} organic aerosol formation have rarely been investigated together, while {{the interactive effects}} between inorganic and organic species under highly complex pollution conditions remain uncertain. Here we studied the effects of SO 2 and NH 3 on secondary aerosol formation in the photooxidation system of toluene /NOx in {{the presence or absence}} of Al 2 O 3 <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> in a 2 m(3) smog chamber. The presence of SO 2 increased new particle formation and particle growth significantly, regardless of whether NH 3 was present. Sulfate, organic aerosol, nitrate, and ammonium were all found to increase linearly with increasing SO 2 concentrations. The increases in these four species were more obvious under NH(3) rich conditions, and the generation of nitrate, ammonium, and organic aerosol increased more significantly than sulfate with respect to SO 2 concentration, while sulfate was the most sensitive species under NH 3 -poor conditions. The synergistic effects between SO 2 and NH 3 in the heterogeneous process contributed greatly to secondary aerosol formation. Specifically, the generation of NH 4 NO 3 was found to be highly dependent on the surface area concentration of suspended particles, and increased most significantly with SO 2 concentration among the four species under NH 3 -rich conditions. Meanwhile, the absorbed NH 3 might provide a liquid surface layer for the absorption and subsequent reaction of SO 2 and organic products and, therefore, enhance sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. This effect mainly occurred in the heterogeneous process and resulted in a significantly higher growth rate of <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> compared to without NH 3. By applying positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis to the AMS data, two factors were identified for the generated SOA. One factor, assigned to less-oxidised organic aerosol and some oligomers, increased with increasing SO 2 under NH 3 -poor conditions, mainly due to the wellknown acid catalytic effect of the acid products on SOA formation in the heterogeneous process.

40|$|Abstract. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) {{formation}} {{from the}} photooxidation of m-xylene, toluene, and benzene is investigated in the Caltech environmental chambers. Experiments are performed under two limiting NOx conditions; under high-NOx conditions the peroxy radicals (RO 2) react only with NO, while under low-NOx conditions they react only with HO 2. For all three aromatics studied (m-xylene, toluene, and benzene), the SOA yields (defined as {{the ratio of}} the mass of organic aerosol formed to the mass of parent hydrocarbon reacted) under low-NOx conditions substantially exceed those under high-NOx conditions, suggesting the importance of peroxy radical chemistry in SOA formation. Under low-NOx conditions, the SOA yields for m-xylene, toluene, and benzene are constant (36 %, 30 %, and 37 %, respectively), indicating that the SOA formed is effectively nonvolatile under the range of Mo(> 10 µg m − 3) studied. Under high-NOx conditions, aerosol growth occurs essentially immediately, even when NO concentration is high. The SOA yield curves exhibit behavior similar to that observed by Odum et al.

The yields measured under high-NOx conditions are higher than previous measurements, suggesting a “rate effect ” in SOA formation, in which SOA yields are higher when the oxidation rate is faster.

Although this photochemical system has been studied extensively, the mechanistic details associated with {{its role in the}} oxidation of dissolved organic matter within aqueous aerosol remain largely unknown. This study utilizes glycolaldehyde as a model organic species to examine the oxidation pathways and evolution of organic aerosol initiated by the photodissociation of aqueous iron (III) oxalate complexes.

Both the gas phase and the aerosol phase of the reaction chamber were monitored in detail using a comprehensive suite of on-line and off-line chemical and physical measurement techniques.

In contrast, all three tropical species were found to be high isoprene emitters with trace emissions of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. In tropical plant experiments without <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> there was no measurable SOA nucleation, but aerosol mass was shown to increase when <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> was present. Although principally isoprene emitting, the aerosol mass produced from tropical fig was mostly consistent (i. e. in 78 out of 120 aerosol mass calculations using plausible parameter sets of various precursor specific yields) with condensation of photo-oxidation products of the minor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) co-emitted; no significant aerosol yield from condensation of isoprene oxidation products was required in the interpretations of the experimental results. This finding is in line with previous reports of organic aerosol loadings consistent with production from minor biogenic VOCs co-emitted with isoprene in principally isoprene-emitting landscapes in Southeast Asia. Moreover, in general the amount of aerosol mass produced from the emissions of the principally isoprene-emitting plants was less than would be expected from published single-VOC experiments, if co-emitted species were solely responsible for the final SOA mass. Interpretation of the results obtained from the fig data sets leaves room for a potential role for isoprene in inhibiting SOA formation under certain ambient atmospheric conditions, although instrumental and experimental constraints impose a level of caution in the interpretation of the results.

These experimental findings indicate the formation of organic layers on the particles. With the aid of an aerosol dynamic model we demonstrate that the observations are consistent with the formation of multilayered organic films having thicknesses of approximately 10 nm. The results also suggest that the films were formed through condensation of low-volatile oxidation products that did not take up water considerably. Even though dissolution of oxidation products into the particle aqueous phase cannot be conclusively ruled out, the most plausible interpretation of the results is that the monoterpene ozonolysis lead to the formation of organic coatings on aqueous aerosols. Such films are likely to form in regions with monoterpene emissions...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse {{gases and}} cirrus clouds {{regulate}} outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and cirrus cloud coverage {{is predicted to}} be sensitive to the ice fall speed which depends on ice crystal size. The higher the cirrus, the greater their impact is on OLR. Thus by changing ice crystal size in the coldest cirrus, OLR and climate might be modified. Fortunately the coldest cirrus have the highest ice supersaturation due to the dominance of homogeneous freezing nucleation. Seeding such cirrus with very efficient heterogeneous ice nuclei should produce larger ice crystals due to vapor competition effects, thus increasing OLR and surface cooling. Preliminary estimates of this global net cloud forcing are more negative than − 2. 8 W m− 2 and could neutralize the radiative forcing due to a CO 2 doubling (3. 7 W m− 2). A potential delivery mechanism for the seeding material is already in place: the airline industry. Since <b>seeding</b> <b>aerosol</b> residence times in the troposphere are relatively short, the climate might return to its normal state within months after stopping the geoengineering experiment.

40|$|Jang et al. (1) report {{measurements}} of organic particulate matter (OPM) {{formed in the}} presence of acidic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> using both a flow reactor and a Teflon chamber and examine their data using two modeling approaches. The study is a continuation of work by Jang et al. (2) on whether acidity in atmospheric PM can promote the formation of OPM by “heterogeneous” reaction of a variety of relatively volatile (C 5 -C 10) aldehydes and ketones. Jang et al. (1) state that (a) “no predictivity power was achieved” for their experimental systems when using the absorptive partitioning model of Pankow (3) and (b) “These results suggest that semiempirical approaches can vastly improve our ability to predict the organic aerosol growth of a variety of different carbonyls {{in the presence of}} inorganic acid. For equilibrium conditions in the atmosphere this approach can be applied directly. ” In our view, (a) Jang et al. (1) misapplied the Pankow (3) model and (b) their proposed “semiempirical model” is inherently a characterization of the kinetics ofOPMformation (see their eqs 5 - 12) under specific conditions and so is not easily applicable to the prediction of how much OPM will form under other kinetic conditions and certainly not at equilibrium in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Organosulfates of isoprene, α-pinene, and β-pinene have {{recently}} been identified in both laboratory-generated and ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In this study, the mechanism and ubiquity of organosulfate formation in biogenic SOA is investigated by a comprehensive series of laboratory photooxidation (i. e. OH-initiated oxidation) and nighttime-oxidation (i. e. NO 3 -initiated oxidation under dark conditions) experiments using nine monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, d-limonene, l-limonene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, Δ 3 -carene, and β-phellandrene) and three monoterpenes (α-pinene, δ-limonene, and l-limonene), respectively. Organosulfates were characterized using liquid chromatographic techniques coupled to electrospray ionization combined with both linear ion trap and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Organosulfates are formed only when monoterpenes are oxidized {{in the presence of}} acidified sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol,</b> a result consistent with prior work.

40|$|The {{effect of}} particle-phase acidity on {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) formation from isoprene is investigated {{in a laboratory}} chamber study, in which the acidity of the inorganic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol</b> was controlled systematically. The observed enhancement in SOA mass concentration is closely correlated to increasing aerosol acidity (R^ 2 = 0. 979). Direct chemical evidence for acid-catalyzed particle-phase reactions {{was obtained from the}} SOA chemical analyses. Aerosol mass concentrations for the 2 -methyltetrols, as well as the newly identified sulfate esters, both of which serve as tracers for isoprene SOA in ambient aerosols, increased significantly with enhanced aerosol acidity. Aerosol acidities, as measured in nmol of H^+ m^(- 3), employed in the present study are in the same range as those observed in tropospheric aerosol collected from the eastern U. S...|$|E
40|$|A product-specific {{model for}} {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) formation and composition based on equilibrium gas-particle partitioning is evaluated. The model {{is applied to}} represent laboratory data on the ozonolysis of α-pinene under dry, dark, and low-NOx conditions {{in the presence of}} ammonium sulfate <b>seed</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Using five major identified products, the model is fit to the chamber data. From the optimal fitting, SOA oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) and hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios are modeled. The discrepancy between measured H/C ratios and those based on the oxidation products used in the model fitting suggests the potential importance of particle-phase reactions. Data fitting is also carried out using the volatility basis set, wherein oxidation products are parsed into volatility bins. The product-specific model is best used for an SOA precursor for which a substantial fraction of the aerosol-phase oxidation products has been identified...|$|E
40|$|Small {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC) such as methane (CH 4) have long been considered non-relevant to aerosol formation due to the high volatility of their oxidation products. However, even low aerosol yields from CH 4, the most abundant VOC in the atmosphere, would contribute significantly to the total particulate carbon budget. In this study, organic aerosol (OA) mass yields from CH 4 oxidation were evaluated at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) smog chamber {{in the presence of}} inorganic and organic <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Using labeled 13 C methane, we could detect its oxidation products in the aerosol phase, with yields up to 0. 09 (+ 0. 26 / - 0. 09) %. Overall, we estimate a maximum contribution of CH 4 oxidation of 0. 13 % to the total global organic aerosol budget. We present evidence that oxidation of formaldehyde, a product of methane oxidation, contributes only a minor fraction to the observed aerosol yields. Therefore, other mechanisms appear to be more important for OA production from CH 4 oxidation. A thorough elucidation of such mechanisms is still required. However, our results imply that many other small, volatile, and abundant hydrocarbons thus far considered irrelevant for OA production may contribute to the atmospheric OA budget...|$|R

40|$|The uptake of gaseous glyoxal onto {{particulate}} matter {{has been studied}} in laboratory experiments under conditions relevant to the ambient atmosphere using an aerosol mass spectrometer. The growth rates and reactive uptake coefficients, γ, were derived by fitting a model of particle growth to the experimental data. Organic growth rates varied from 1. 05 × 10 − 11 to 23. 1 × 10 − 11 μg particle− 1 min− 1 {{in the presence of}} ∼ 5 ppb glyoxal. Uptake coefficients (γ) of glyoxal varied from 8. 0 × 10 − 4 to 7. 3 × 10 − 3 with a median γ = 2. 9 × 10 − 3, observed for (NH 4) 2 SO 4 <b>seed</b> <b>aerosols</b> at 55 % relative humidity. Increased γ values were related to increased particle acidity, indicating that acid catalysis {{played a role in the}} heterogeneous mechanism. Experiments conducted at very low relative humidity, with the potential to be highly acidic, resulted in very low reactive uptake. These uptake coefficients indicated that the heterogeneous loss of glyoxal in the atmosphere is at least as important as gas phase loss mechanisms, including photolysis and reaction with hydroxyl radicals. Glyoxal lifetime due to heterogeneous reactions under typical ambient conditions was estimated to be τhet = 5 – 287 min. In rural and remote areas the glyoxal uptake can lead to 5 – 257 ng m− 3 of secondary organic aerosols in 8 hours, consistent with recent ambient measurements...|$|R
