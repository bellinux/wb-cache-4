25|$|Subordinated {{bonds are}} those that have a lower {{priority}} than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the <b>subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds.

A large private equity fund was demanded if large to medium-sized banks of Italy were required to be bailed out.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of credit spreads for Japanese mega-banks with emphasis on comparing subordinated CDS spreads with the <b>subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> spreads {{from the viewpoint of}} price discovery in both credit markets. The main findings are summarized as follows. First, subordinated CDS and <b>subordinated</b> <b>bond</b> spreads are significantly cointegrated for most banks, and price discovery measures suggest that the CDS spread plays a more dominant role in price discovery than the bond spread. Second, although both CDS and bond spreads significantly react to the Japanese sovereign CDS spread, only the CDS spread reacts significantly to other financial market variables including its own volatility and equity return. Third, both spreads are responsive to the changes in fundamental accounting variables such as the capital? asset ratio and the nonperforming loan ratio. These accounting variables are likely to constitute common factors that are behind the cointegration relationship. Last, significant volatility spillovers are detected from the CDS to bond spreads. This result implies that new information flows more in this direction. <b>Subordinated</b> <b>Bond,</b> Credit Default Swap, Japanese Banks, Price Discovery, Volatility Spillover, Bivariate GARCH...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public debt {{mezzanine}} instruments, which include participating <b>bonds,</b> <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds,</b> convertible bonds and bonds with warrants, by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public debt mezzanine by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public debt mezzanine instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public debt mezzanine instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public debt mezzanine instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> and participating bonds), the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants), or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of participating bonds) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{particularly}} important example of <b>subordinated</b> <b>bonds</b> {{can be found}} in bonds issued by banks. Subordinated debt is issued periodically by most large banking corporations in the U.S. Subordinated debt can be expected to be especially risk-sensitive because subordinated debt holders have claims on bank assets only after senior debtholders and they lack the upside gain enjoyed by shareholders.|$|R

We also find that implicit safety nets weaken the predictive power of spreads. Further, the results suggest complementarity between both indicators. We also examine the interaction of the indicators with other information and find that their additional information content may be small but not insignificant. The results suggest that market indicators reduce type II errors relative to predictions based on accounting information only. ...|$|E

5000|$|Credit {{enhancement}} is key {{in creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing <b>subordinate</b> <b>bonds.</b> The <b>subordinate</b> <b>bonds</b> are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement. As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|R
