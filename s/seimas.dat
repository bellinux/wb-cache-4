5|$|The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, {{elected in}} April 1920, adopted a {{constitution}} in August 1922; elections to the First <b>Seimas</b> {{took place in}} October 1922. The most-disputed constitutional issue was {{the role of the}} presidency. Eventually, the powers of government were heavily weighted in favor of the unicameral parliament (<b>Seimas).</b> Members of the <b>Seimas</b> were elected by the people to three-year terms. Each new <b>Seimas</b> directly elected the president, who was authorized to appoint a prime minister. The Prime Minister was then charged with confirming a cabinet of ministers. The presidential term was limited to no more than two three-year terms in succession. The parliamentary system proved unstable: eleven cabinets were formed between November 1918 and December 1926.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanian Democratic Party and Ernestas Galvanauskas {{used the}} <b>Seimas</b> as an {{opportunity}} to organize the Peasant Union, which largely represented the interests of large and mid-size farmers. The Union helped spread the influence of the <b>Seimas</b> into the countryside. A few days after the <b>Seimas,</b> Jonas Basanavičius founded the Lithuanian National Democratic Party (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The first {{traces of}} large nobility {{meetings}} in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{can be found in}} the Treaty of Salynas of 1398 and the Union of Horodło of 1413. It is considered that the first <b>Seimas</b> of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Lithuanian Council of Lords. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged the country almost continuously between 1492 and 1582, the Grand Duke needed more tax revenues to finance the army and had to call the <b>Seimas</b> more frequently. In exchange for cooperation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening of the <b>Seimas.</b> At first the <b>Seimas</b> did not have the legislative power. It would debate on foreign and domestic affairs, taxes, wars, state budget. At the beginning of the 16th century, the <b>Seimas</b> acquired some legislative powers. The <b>Seimas</b> could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws.|$|E

5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the <b>Seimas</b> met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the <b>Seimas.</b> Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The <b>Seimas</b> also passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|The Great Sejm, {{also known}} as the Four-Year Sejm (Polish: respectively, Sejm Wielki or Sejm Czteroletni; Lithuanian: Didysis <b>seimas</b> or Ketverių metų <b>seimas)</b> was a Sejm (parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that was held in Warsaw between 1788 and 1792. Its {{principal}} aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the Commonwealth politically and economically.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the <b>Seimas</b> adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The <b>Seimas,</b> unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the <b>Seimas,</b> rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the <b>Seimas,</b> near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E

5|$|The Freedom Wars {{started and}} {{political}} processes were derailed during the turmoil. Lithuanian elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania were not held until April 1920. The council was not {{replaced by a}} parliament (<b>Seimas)</b> until 2 August 1922, when the Constitution of Lithuania was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Article 2 {{of the law}} {{states that}} the anthem is to be played at the {{following}} occasions: At the beginning or ending of solemn sessions of the <b>Seimas,</b> on national holidays and memorial days, and at receptions and farewells of foreign heads of state on official visits to Lithuania—but only after the anthem of the foreign country has been played.|$|E
5|$|Before Kudirka's death, {{the first}} {{performance}} of the poem occurred at a concert in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. The concert was conducted by Česlovas Sasnauskas and was attended by Lithuanians, which St. Petersburg had the largest population of at that time. The anthem was first performed in Lithuania during the Great <b>Seimas</b> of Vilnius on December 3, 1905.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great <b>Seimas</b> of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the <b>Seimas</b> wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E
5|$|The President of Lithuania {{was officially}} given a {{standard}} by the <b>Seimas</b> in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania {{charged in the}} center on a single-color background. Under state law, the background color is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{political actors}} {{at the time}} of the coup had been active during the independence movement and the republic's first few years. Antanas Smetona had served as Lithuania's first president between April 1919 and June 1920; he then withdrew from formal political involvement, although he published political criticism, for which he served a brief prison term in 1923. Augustinas Voldemaras represented Lithuania at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918 and later served as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He resigned from the government in 1920, although he continued to write and publish political criticism, for which he also was sentenced to a short prison term. Kazys Grinius had chaired a post-World War I repatriation commission, and went on to serve as head of the 6th Cabinet of Ministers and in the First and Second <b>Seimas.</b> Mykolas Sleževičius served as prime minister in 1918 and 1919, oversaw the organization of the Lithuanian armed forces in 1920, and was a member of the Second <b>Seimas</b> between 1922 and 1926.|$|E

5|$|With Soviet troops already {{stationed}} in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty, {{it was impossible to}} mount effective military resistance. On June 15, Lithuania unconditionally accepted the ultimatum and lost its independence. The Soviets sought to show the world {{that this was not a}} military occupation and annexation, but a legitimate socialist revolution, initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviets followed semi-legal procedures: they took control of the government institutions, installed a new puppet government, and carried out show elections to the People's <b>Seimas.</b> During its first session, the <b>Seimas</b> proclaimed creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to be admitted into the Soviet Union. The petition was officially accepted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940. At the same time almost identical processes took place in Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Most of the signatories of the Act {{remained}} {{active in}} the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania. Jonas Vileišis served in the <b>Seimas</b> and as mayor of Kaunas, temporary capital of Lithuania; Saliamonas Banaitis was involved in finance, opening several banks. Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, Antanas Smetona and Aleksandras Stulginskis. Jonas Basanavičius, chairman of the Council of Lithuania, returned to an academic life, pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore. Five signatories died before World War II started; three died during the Nazi occupation. Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became political prisoners after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|President Smetona {{received}} memoranda {{from nine}} nationalistic organizations urging {{the government to}} reject the ultimatum. However, a decisive comment was made by General Stasys Raštikis, {{the commander of the}} Lithuanian army: He testified that a military victory over Poland was impossible and argued for a peaceful resolution. The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth <b>Seimas</b> with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.|$|E

5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming <b>Seimas</b> elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} {{autonomy}} was not accomplished at this time, but the <b>Seimas</b> {{was an important}} development in the Lithuanian bid for independence. It consolidated efforts, spearheaded the organization of political parties, strengthened national conscience, and energized the rural populace. The assembly resolutely rejected ideas to restore the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{and for the first}} time voiced the demands for autonomy. Many of the political and religious rights that were granted by the October Manifesto were retained. A number of agricultural, educational, scientific, literary and artistic societies emerged.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the Lithuanian Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the Lithuanian people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} the Lithuanian state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the <b>Seimas.</b> It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
50|$|The black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes) is an {{endangered}} species of douc found in forests of Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. This species is unique among the doucs in having a largely greyish-blue face. A {{recent report by the}} Wildlife Conservation Society estimated that approximately 42,000 black-shanked doucs were present in Cambodia's <b>Seima</b> Biodiversity Conservation Area and recently was also recorded in Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary by BirdLife International Cambodia Programme. Prior to the recent discovery in the <b>Seima</b> Biodiversity Conservation Area, the largest known populations were believed to be in adjacent Vietnam, where the black-shanked douc population hovers at 600. The total population of the species remains unknown. They are primarily arboreal and their diet consists on leaves, of which they obtain most of their water.|$|R
50|$|Historical {{distribution}} {{of this species}} included Cambodia, southern Laos, southeast Thailand, and western Vietnam. They {{are thought to be}} extinct in all areas outside of Cambodia.
