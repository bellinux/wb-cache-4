5|$|Beonna's rule {{coincided with}} the anointing of Pippin III as king of the Franks after 742 and the {{subsequent}} disempowerment of the Merovingian dynasty, and also with the martyrdom of Saint Boniface and his followers in Frisia in 754. Two coins use a runic 'a' in the name Beonna; the runic 'a' has only been found elsewhere in Frisia, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were both trading and language links between Frisia and East Anglia during the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may have been a Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, {{the rich}} {{vertebrate}} fauna found at Baden-Württemberg reflect a moist {{region of the}} Middle Triassic in Germany. Along with Batrachotomus, palaeontologists recovered remains of fishes, amphibians, such as Gerrothorax and Mastodonsaurus, and even animals like nothosaurs and the distinct marine reptile Tanystropheus. Flora of the locality consisted of horsetails, ferns, cycads and conifers, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was rich vegetation.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was at least some {{physical}} aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no exposed surface ice.|$|E

5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up {{position}} {{in support of the}} 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} visible {{difference}} between the sexes {{in most of the}} family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

50|$|Among the Stoics, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} concerning the number of virtues {{and parts of the}} soul.

On the parts of the soul Plato divided it into two parts; Zeno into three; Panaetius into five or six; Soranus into seven; Chrysippus into as many as eight; Apollophanes into as many as nine; while other Stoics declared as many as twelve parts in the soul.|$|R
