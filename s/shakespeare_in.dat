5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in <b>Shakespeare,</b> <b>in</b> Gielgud's view.|$|E

5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by <b>Shakespeare.</b> <b>In</b> it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
5|$|Other {{events have}} {{included}} Artquake, an art festival that attracted 200,000 people on Labor Day weekends in the Park Blocks from 1982 {{until at least}} 2003 and based on an art show that began in July 1949, a 1983 protest against U.S. nuclear missiles placed in Europe (3,000 protesters), an Oregon Public Employees Union strike in 1987, a rally with presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988, <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> the Parks in 1989, a 1990 rally {{to pay tribute to}} Mulugeta Seraw, killed in Portland by white power skinheads in 1988, which had 1,500 people with 150 police officers defending against skinheads, and the Homowo Festival of African Arts held from 1990 to at least 2004. Lara Flynn Boyle filmed scenes from The Temp in the South Park Blocks in 1992, and The Hunted was filmed partially in the South Park Blocks in 2003, including a crash scene by Benicio del Toro.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{made his}} Broadway debut in 1929, {{when he played}} the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton's stage thriller, Rope's End.

The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla (born 1932). He returned to the works of William <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> 1931, playing Claudio in Measure for Measure at London's Fortune Playhouse. In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the Embassy Theatre.

5|$|Several {{performing}} arts groups and facilities {{are on the}} University of Michigan's campus, as are museums dedicated to art, archaeology, and natural history and sciences. Founded in 1879, the University Musical Society is an independent {{performing arts}} organization that presents over 60 events each year, bringing international artists in music, dance, and theater. Since 2001 <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> the Arb has presented one play by Shakespeare each June, in a large park near downtown.

5|$|The {{authors have}} named several other authors {{as sources of}} {{inspiration}} when writing the novels.

According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books. Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo.|$|E
