40|$|Abstract—The {{implementation}} of DNA alignment tools for Bioinformatics lead to face different problems that dip into performances. A single alignment takes {{an amount of}} time that is not predictable and there are different factors that can affect performances, for instance the length of sequences can determine the computational grain of the task and mismatches or insertion/deletion (indels) increase time needed to complete an alignment. Moreover, an alignment is a strong memory-bound problem because of the irregular memory access pat-terns and limitations in memory-bandwidth. Over the years, many alignment tools were implemented. A concrete example is Bowtie 2, one of the fastest (concurrent, Pthread-based) and state of the art not GPU-based alignment tool. Bowtie 2 exploits concurrency by instantiating a pool of threads, which have access to a global input dataset, share the reference genome and have access to different objects for collecting alignment results. In this paper a modified {{implementation of}} Bowtie 2 is presented, in which the concurrency structure has been changed. The proposed implementation exploits the task-farm <b>skeleton</b> <b>pattern</b> implemented as a Master-Worker. The Master-Worker pattern permits to delegate only to the Master thread dataset reading and to make private to each Worker data structures that are shared in the original version. Only the reference genome is left shared. As a further optimisation, the Master and each Worker were pinned on cores and the reference genome was allocated interleaved among memory nodes. The proposed implementation is able to gain up to 10 speedup points over the original implementation. I...|$|E

The 62 -yr-old female patient presented with multiple joint pain and showed typical blood test results for RA, i. e., an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration, and positive for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. RA was clear based on a total score of 10 when applying the classification criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (2010). In an autoimmune target test, speckled and skeleton patterns were observed. In an ANCA test, p-ANCA was observed (titer, 1 : 2, 560), and tests for anti-proteinase 3 (PR 3) and anti-MPO antibodies were negative.

So, several studies tried to {{correlate}} patients with normal nasorespiratory functions with different malocclusions and airway dimensions. A narrow upper airway is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Currently neck size and obesity are considered to be the most important physical characteristics of patients with sleep apnea. Aim: To study the interaction between craniofacial structures and pharyngeal airway space along with soft palate and tongue in patients with different anteroposterior skeletal patterns using lateral cephalogram. The correlation of upper airway and soft-tissue measurements with neck circumference (NC) and body mass index (BMI) was elucidated to evaluate the predictors on lateral cephalogram, in order to determine the etiology of OSA. Materials and Methods: Lateral cephalograms of 45 subjects were used to measure the pharyngeal airway and were divided into three groups (each group included 15 subjects) according to ANB angle: Class I (ANB angle 2 °- 4 °), Class II (ANB angle > 4 °), and Class III (ANB angle < 2 °). Velar morphology along with its length was also analyzed and categorized into different types. The NC and BMI of all the patients were also calculated. Student′s t-test for paired samples was used to compare the mean values of the study variable vital parameters. Results: Significant reduction was found in pharyngeal airway in ANB group II. The soft palate and tongue size increased with increasing BMI and NC. Conclusion: Sagittal <b>skeleton</b> <b>pattern</b> had a close association with the dimensions of pharyngeal airway passage. The correlation of NC with increase in soft-tissue size (soft palate and tongue) suggested that obesity mediates its effects in OSA through fat deposition in the neck...|$|E

Mice carrying a Tbx 5 null allele (Tbx 5 +/Δ) have malformations in digits, wrists, and sternum joints, regions where Tbx 5 is expressed. We demonstrate that mice deficient in connexin 40 (Cx 40), a Tbx 5 -regulated gap junction component, shared axial and appendicular skeletal malformations with Tbx 5 +/Δ mice.

50|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the 21-kD protein FGF4 {{functions as}} a signaling molecule that is involved in many important processes. Studies using Fgf4 gene knockout mice showed developmental defects in embryos both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that FGF4 facilitates the survival and growth of the inner cell mass during the postimplantation phase of development by acting as an autocrine or paracrine ligand. FGFs produced in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) are critical for the proper forelimb and hindlimb outgrowth. FGF signaling in the AER is involved in regulating limb digit number and cell death in the interdigital mesenchyme. When FGF signaling dynamics and regulatory processes are altered, postaxial polydactyly and cutaneous syndactyly, two phenotypic abnormalities collectively known as polysyndactyly, can occur in the limbs. Polysyndactyly is observed when an excess of Fgf4 is expressed in limb buds of wild-type mice. In mutant limb buds that do not express Fgf8, the expression of Fgf4 still results in polysyndactyly, but Fgf4 is also able to rescue all skeletal defects that arise {{from the lack of}} Fgf8. Therefore, the Fgf4 gene compensates for the loss of the Fgf8 gene, revealing that FGF4 and FGF8 perform similar functions in limb <b>skeleton</b> <b>patterning</b> and limb development. Studies of zebrafish Fgf4 knockdown embryos demonstrated that when Fgf4 signaling is inhibited, randomized left-right patterning of the liver, pancreas, and heart takes place, showing that Fgf4 is a crucial gene involved in developing left-right patterning of visceral organs. Furthermore, unlike the role of FGF4 in limb development, FGF4 and FGF8 have distinct roles and function independently in the process of visceral organ left-right patterning.Fgf signaling pathway has also been demonstrated to drive hindgut identity during gastrointestinal development, and the up regulation of the Fgf4 in pluripotent stem cell has been used to direct their differentiation for the generation of intestinal Organoids and tissues in vitro.|$|R

While the former processes of mesenchyme specification and mineralization are under study elsewhere, the means by which ectodermal cues directing skeletal growth are activated and localized is not known. Using molecular genetics, including gene knock downs and mis-expression, as well as microsurgical manipulations of early cleavage embryos, I show how a previously undescribed territory within the ectoderm, the border ectoderm (BE) is specified with short range signaling inputs. Then, experiments show that the BE provides signals that initiate, and contribute to the propagation of skeletogenesis. From this dataset, and from biological experiments I outline a model for how the BE patterns and contributes to the directed growth of the skeleton. I also discuss challenges to this model {{that need to be addressed}} in future research. In principle, the mechanism proposed herein depends on the integration of information from both the primary and secondary embryonic axes. It requires both short-range signaling by Wnt 5 from the endoderm to establish the BE fate, and TGFß signaling from the oral and aboral ectoderm which subdivides the BE into four territories. These findings demonstrate that the short-range signaling cascade that subdivides the embryo into first mesoderm and then endoderm also specifies ectodermal fates. Ultimately, this research paves the way for understanding how the larval <b>skeleton</b> is <b>patterned</b> during embryogenesis and may provide a paradigm for understanding other, more complex, developmental problems.

Second, experimental studies in finned vertebrates, such as catshark and zebrafish, have disclosed unexpected correspondence between the development of digits and the development of both the endoskeleton and the dermal skeleton of fins. Finally, detailed mathematical models in conjunction with analyses of the {{evolution of}} putative Turing system components have permitted formulation of scenarios for the stepwise evolutionary origin of patterning networks in the tetrapod limb. The confluence of experimental and biological physics approaches in conjunction with deepening understanding of the developmental genetics of paired fins and limbs has moved the field closer to understanding the fin-to-limb transition.
