EchoStar Corp. is a [...] case {{stretching}} from 2004 to 2011, {{which took place}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. [...] claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, infringing product redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single <b>step</b> <b>test.</b> The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} examine sex and age {{differences}} of various stepping {{movements in the}} elderly and to clarify useful stepping movements for evaluation of their dynamic balance. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-six healthy elderly subjects who could walk independently (male mean age = 71. 2 ± 7. 1 years; female mean age = 71. 5 ± 6. 0) performed the following stepping tests: back and forth; {{up and down with}} a 5 cm tall step; and in-place stepping matching three tempos (44, 66 and 132 b. p. m.). Step number, single and double support times in the former two <b>stepping</b> <b>tests,</b> and time difference between metronome sound and grounding time in the latter tempo <b>stepping</b> <b>tests</b> were selected as evaluation parameters. Results: An insignificant sex difference was found in all parameters. Hence, the data of men and women was pooled to examine age differences. Significant age differences were found in the step number and double support time of back and forth and up and down <b>stepping</b> <b>tests</b> and in the time difference of three tempo <b>stepping</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>step</b> number in younger age groups and the support times in older age groups tended to be larger. Conclusion: No sex difference was found in evaluation parameters of all <b>stepping</b> <b>tests,</b> and all parameters tended to be superior in the younger elderly. The elderly experienced more difficulty matching slow tempos than fast tempos in the in-place <b>stepping</b> <b>test.</b> The back and forth, up and down and in-place matching tempo <b>stepping</b> <b>tests</b> may be useful for evaluating dynamic balance ability of the elderly. © 2008 Japan Geriatrics Society...|$|R
40|$|<b>Step</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} widely used to assess {{cardiorespiratory}} fitness. Work rate is determined by step height and step frequency, whereas the total amount of work done depends upon the number and duration of work periods. In all <b>step</b> <b>tests</b> which are suitable for mass testing, performance is based on heart rate during recovery. A review of the literature strongly suggests that <b>step</b> <b>tests</b> can give reliable and valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness provided that (a) the subjects have received adequate instruction and practice in taking the test prior to the criterion test performance, and (b) the work load is above a certain threshold...|$|R
40|$|The Integrator-Delay (ID) {{model is}} {{commonly}} used to model canal pools which do not exhibit resonance behavior. Simple <b>step</b> <b>tests</b> are often used to estimate ID model parameters; namely, delay time and backwater surface area. These <b>step</b> <b>tests</b> change the canal inflow at the upstream {{end of the pool}} and observe water depth variations at the downstream end. Some knowledge of the canal pool characteristics are needed to determine the amount of flow change and its duration. The Auto Tune Variation (ATV) method is one method for determining the duration of these <b>step</b> <b>tests.</b> Pools that are under backwater over their entire length tend to exhibit oscillations due to resonance waves. Binary-Random-Sequence (BRS) tests have been used to determine the resonance frequency of such pools, where <b>step</b> <b>tests</b> with different durations are used. PBRS tests are difficult to implement in practice and may not provide the resonance frequency. The intent {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate on a real canal that the ATV method can determine both the resonance frequency and the resonance peak height for canal pools whose water levels oscillate...|$|R
50|$|The Tecumseh <b>step</b> <b>test</b> is a {{modified}} version of the Harvard <b>Step</b> <b>Test</b> developed by Professor Henry J. Montoye. The main differences from the original protocol were the lower step height (8 inches instead of 20), the more moderate stepping rate (24 steps/min instead of 30) and the shorter duration (3 minutes instead of 5 minutes). These alterations made this test easier to perform and suitable for epidemiological studies. In fact, this modified <b>step</b> <b>test</b> was employed in the Tecumseh Community Health Study run between the 1950s and 60s. During this epidemiological study around 5,488 people performed the Tecumseh <b>Step</b> <b>test.</b> The number of heart beats from 30 seconds after the end of the 3-minute <b>step</b> <b>test</b> to 1 minute after the <b>step</b> <b>test</b> was used to assess cardiovascular fitness level.|$|E

40|$|Whether {{there are}} {{correlations}} between the stomatognathic system and body posture remains controversial. Here, we have investigated whether malocclusal traits and having a Helkimo Index ≥ 5 show detectable correlations with body-posture alterations in children and young adults. A total of 1178 11 - to 19 -year-old subjects were divided into four groups: (i) controls; (ii) malocclusion; (iii) Helkimo Index ≥ 5 and (iv) malocclusion + Helkimo Index ≥ 5. Dental occlusion assessment included the following: overbite, overjet, posterior crossbite, scissorbite, mandibular crowding and dental class. Subsequently, body-posture assessments were performed through static analyses of body inclination and trunk asymmetry, {{and according to the}} dynamic Fukuda <b>stepping</b> <b>test.</b> Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Although at the univariate level both the trunk asymmetry and Fukuda <b>stepping</b> <b>test</b> showed significant differences among the groups, the multivariate level revealed that age and gender were mostly responsible for this. The only significant correlation that was seen was for the malocclusion + Helkimo Index ≥ 5 group: these subjects had a positive (worse) trunk asymmetry and a negative (better) Fukuda <b>stepping</b> <b>test</b> performance. At the further multivariate analyses of each single malocclusal trait ⁄Helkimo Index ≥ 5 (irrespective of the groups), only an increased overbite showed a statistically significant association with a slightly better Fukuda <b>stepping</b> <b>test</b> performance. Given the small number of significant associations seen and their limited entities, this study does not support the existence of clinically relevant correlations for malocclusal traits and Helkimo Index ≥ 5 with body posture in children and young adults...|$|R

30|$|Three {{different}} types of triaxial tests were performed: (1) pore pressure <b>stepping</b> <b>tests</b> at variable pore pressure conditions. During the pore pressure <b>stepping</b> <b>tests,</b> the confining pressure (σ 3) was held constant at 55 and 65  MPa, respectively. The pore pressure was decreased in three steps from 80 % to 50 % and 25 % of the confining pressure or from 90 % to 60 % and 30 % of the confining pressure, respectively. This allowed examining the peak strength at different effective confining pressure conditions. (2) In the confining pressure <b>stepping</b> <b>tests,</b> deformation tests were conducted at up to five different confining pressures. In these tests, the confining pressure was increased in each deformation phase in 10 -MPa steps up to five times from 25 to 65  MPa, while the pore pressure was generally 80 % of the confining pressure. Confining pressure <b>stepping</b> <b>tests</b> allow {{the determination of the}} peak strength at different confining pressure conditions of a sample. Deformation was stopped at the yield point in the pre-failure phase (Kovári and Tisa 1975) to avoid damage of the specimen and permit multiple tests. This procedure allows calculations of Mohr envelopes from the data to derive cohesion and angles of internal friction. Also, the influence of the variable pore pressure conditions can be studied in these tests. (3) A cyclic test (18  cycles) at constant confining pressure and constant pore pressure: In this test, confining pressure and pore pressure were kept constant (σ 3 [*]=[*] 55  MPa, pore pressure = 80 % of σ 3). The sample was cyclically loaded to a differential stress of 70  MPa. After the holding times, the axial load was decreased. This procedure was repeated 18 times. The cyclic test allows simulation of the effect of cyclic loading during earthquake cycles.|$|R
