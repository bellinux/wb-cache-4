30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 b, when a {{continuous}} <b>sweep</b> positive <b>pulse</b> voltage from 0 to 1.4  V {{is applied to}} the device, the conductivity decreases continuously with six easily recognized states; when a continuous <b>sweep</b> negative <b>pulse</b> voltage from 0 to − 0.6  V {{is applied to the}} device, the conductivity increase continuously with difficultly distinguishable ones. In order to clearly illustrate this change trend, the curves of current and voltage versus time are plotted in Fig.  2 c. Figure  2 d shows the device conductivity can also be increased or decreased by consecutive potentiating or depressing pulses. It is easily observed that the conductance in the last set pulse is different from the one in the first reset pulse. This can be ascribed to the partial change in internal structure after the device has experienced a process from very low conductivity to high conductivity. As known, the migration of oxygen vacancies in oxide-based memristor leads to the conductivity change during the device operation, even if the reverse bias voltage cannot be completely restored the memristor to the initial state. This is also a common phenomenon in other memristor devices [12].|$|R

The electroactivity of lactoferrin was studied by three various electrochemical methods (linear <b>sweep,</b> differential <b>pulse</b> and square wave voltammetry). Based on the results obtained, we utilized flow injection analysis with electrochemical detection (FIA-ED) for determination of lactoferrin. We found out that the most suitable FIA-ED conditions were as follows: working electrode potential of 900 mV, Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4. 5) as the mobile phase, its flow rate 1 ml min(- 1).

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{reduction of the}} antidepressant drug fluoxetine was investigated by cyclic, linear <b>sweep,</b> differential <b>pulse</b> and square wave voltammetry using a hanging mercury drop electrode in alkaline buffer solution in water and in a water/acetonitrile mixed solvent. Cyclic voltammograms in aqueous solution showed very strong adsorption of fluoxetine on the electrode with formation of a compact film. The effect of addition of different percentages of acetonitrile on the voltammetric response was evaluated. It is shown that acetonitrile protects the electrode surface, thus preventing the adsorption of fluoxetine as a compact film, although reduction occurs at more negative potentials. Adsorption was used to accumulate the drug onto the electrode surface. The adsorbed species were measured voltammetrically by reduction at - 1. 3 V in an aqueous 0. 05 M Ringer buffer, pH 12, 20 % acetonitrile v/v. Linear calibration graphs were obtained in the range 0. 52 - 5. 2 M.

Next, a 1.5 -nm-thick AlOy layer was deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system using H 2 O and Al (CH 3) 3 and a 5.5 -nm-thick SiOx layer underwent plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) by reacting 5 % SiH 4 /N 2 (160  sccm), N 2 O (1300  sccm), and N 2 (240  sccm) at 300  °C. Subsequently, a 50 -nm-thick vanadium (V) top electrode (TE) with a diameter of 100  μm was deposited by DC sputtering a V target with Ar gas (30  sccm). Finally, a 50 -nm-thick Al as a protective layer was deposited by DC sputtering to prevent further oxidation of V TE.

40|$|The SET and RESET {{switching}} kinetics of Ag–GeSx-based ECM {{memory cells}} are experimentally investigated. The results were qualitatively and quantitatively reproduced by our simulation model, accounting for a tunneling {{gap between the}} tip of the growing filament and the active electrode. Key processes are the nucleation, the electron transfer at the interfaces, and ionic hopping in the electrolyte. Current–voltage <b>sweeps</b> and <b>pulse</b> measurements were used to study the switching kinetics with respect to variety of factors like voltage, current, resistance, time, electrolyte thickness, and stoichiometry. Multilevel operations through the adjustability of the ON resistance by current compliance and sweep rate were confirmed. The SET kinetics for low voltages was limited by the nucleation process. SET time and SET voltage strongly depend on the Ag-ion normalized concentration in the electrolyte. The RESET behavior was mostly independent of the current compliance and the ON resistance. However, lower ON resistances require higher RESET currents {{but at the same time}} the RESET time was independent of the ON resistance for nearly 2 orders of magnitude. By pulsed measurements of the RESET kinetics two voltage ranges in the RESET time versus RESET voltage behavior were identified for the first time. Limiting factors in these two ranges were found to be the electron transfer and the ion migration for low and high voltages, respectively...|$|R

In order to {{be representative of the}} divers gas tension level (supersaturation) and thus, to optimize decompression stages, the measurements (made in the right ventricle region) should be performed during {{a short period of time}} (ventricle filling < 20 ms), efficient to detect a broad range of bubbles' radii population (radius from 20 to 200 _m) and harmless (Mechanical Index MI< 0. 3). Materials and methods: Based on a bi-frequency ultrasound excitation, the purpose of our method is to measure the relative and the absolute microbubble size variations. Because of our research interests, the experimental investigations were conducted on natural microbubbles, with radius ranging between 20 and 200 μm, excited around their resonance frequencies by a low frequency transducer. Different types of excitation were tested (<b>sweep,</b> burst, <b>pulse).</b> A pair of high frequency transducers were arranged to focus at a common point. One of the transducers was used to transmit a 2 ms duration high-frequency (1 MHz) pulse while the other was used to passively receive backscattered signals. The scattered signal was acquired and visualized on a digital oscilloscope and transferred for offline calculations. Signal treatment were conducted in order to recover the amplitude and frequency modulations. Results: Using the same experimental setup, simple signal processing applied on both the amplitude and the frequency modulations leads to a double characterization of the microbubble dynamics. Moreover, under the assumption of small radial oscillations, the equilibrium radius of the microbubble can be accurately estimate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Echolocating bats {{adjust the}} time–frequency {{structure}} such as <b>sweep</b> rate and <b>pulse</b> interval of their sonar calls {{when they move}} from open space to vegetation-dense environments. Emitted call intensity is equally important for echolocation, but adjustment of signal intensity to different habitats has never been systematically studied in any bat species. To address this question, we recorded sonar calls of the Neotropical trawling insectivo-rous bat Macrophyllum macrophyllum (Phyllostomidae) at three sites with different obstacle densities (clutter). We found a clear correlation between emitted intensity and degree of clutter, with intensity proportional to decreasing clutter. In highly cluttered, semicluttered, and open spaces, M. macrophyllum emitted calls with mean source levels (sound pressure level (SPL) 10 cm from the bat’s mouth) of 100, 105, and 111 dB SPL root mean square (rms), respectively. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} documen-tation of dynamic intensity adjustments in bats. Phyllosto-mid bats were previously considered silent, but the 111 -dB SPL rms emitted by free-ranging M. macrophyllum in open space is comparable to output in aerial insectivorous bats from other families. Our results suggest that the acoustic constraints of habitats are better predictors of call intensity than phylogeny and therefore likely to be major drivers shaping the sonar system of bats in the course of evolution...|$|R
40|$|We present {{high time}} {{resolution}} polarimetric profiles of 27 predominantly southern hemisphere millisecond pulsars, 15 {{of which have}} no previously published polarimetry. These observations were made with a new 128 -MHz baseband recorder at the Parkes Observatory. There has been some suggestion that millisecond pulsar profiles can undergo radical changes in both pulse shape and polarimetry, mainly due to discrepancies between the Bonn and Jodrell Bank polarimetric studies. If millisecond pulsars are intrinsically unstable, this has ramifications for precision timing and the millisecond pulsar emission mechanism. However, {{we find ourselves in}} good agreement with the Jodrell Bank data, and, in most cases, very poor agreement with the Bonn results. The presented polarimetric observations do display some phenomena common to those displayed by normal pulsars, including orthogonal mode transitions in position angle and associated sense changes of circular polarization. The behaviour of the position angle presented by these pulsars is, with some significant exceptions, a shallow or flat <b>sweep</b> across the <b>pulse.</b> This behaviour lends support to theories that suggest millisecond pulsar emission regions are wider, {{at least in terms of}} pulse longitude, than those of the normal pulsars.

40|$|AbstractPyrazinamide (Pyrazinecarboxamide – PZA) is a {{drug that}} is used to {{treatment}} tuberculosis. In the present work, the voltammetric behavior of PZA was studied using a screen-printed modified electrode (SPCE). The modified electrode was constructed using poly-histidine films, and it showed an electrocatalytic effect, thus promoting a decrease in PZA reduction potential and improving the voltammetric response. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques have been employed in order to elucidate of the electrodic reaction. The results allowed the proposal that in the PZA reduction, a further chemical reaction occurs that corresponds to a second-order process which is subsequent to the electrode reaction. In addition, a sensitive voltammetric method was developed, and it was successfully applied for PZA determination in human urine samples. The best response was found using SPCE modified with poly-histidine prepared by histidine monomer electropolymerization (SPCE/EPH).

This work shows the voltammetric behavior of nitrofurazone and a comparison with those of metronidazole and chloramphenicol using cyclic, linear <b>sweep</b> and differential <b>pulse</b> voltammetries. For these drugs also the prediction of the diffusion coefficients using Wilke-Chang equation was performed. The reduction of nitrofurazone is pH-dependent and in acidic medium the hydroxylamine derivative, involving four electrons, is the principal product formed. In aqueous-alkaline medium and with a glassy carbon electrode pre-treatment the reduction of nitrofurazone occurs in two steps, the first involving one electron to form the nitro-radical anion and the second corresponding to the hydroxylamine derivative formation. Hydroxymethylnitrofurazone presented the same voltammetric behavior and electroactivity, indicating that the molecular modification performed in nitrofurazone did not change its capacity to be reduced. A brief discussion regarding the differences in biological activity between the two compounds is also presented. © 2005 Sociedade Brasileira de Química...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The electrochemistry of planar and porous lead dioxide electrodes has been investigated using the techniques: linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry, potentiostatic <b>pulse</b> experiments and Faradaic (a. c.) impedance studies. The first two techniques were digitally controlled and the data were acquired at high speed and could be easily retrieved after storage. A morphological examination on the electrodes was also carried out using scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical behaviour of flat lead in sulphuric acid at concentrations in excess of 5 mol dm- 3 has been studied. Various solid lead alloys in different sulphuric acid concentrations were investigated together with porous PbO 2 on different lead alloy supports. It {{was found that the}} acid concentration had a marked effect on the electrochemistry of the electrodes. The current transients obtained from potentiostatic step experiments with the porous PbO 2 electrodes were nearly all of a complex nature and some attempt was made to match the data with established mathematical relationships for electracrystallisation processes. The alloys used were of industrial importance and they were lead-antimonyp lead-tin-calcium and lead-tin-bismuth-calcium. Also various automotive positive pastes were employed to form the porous PbO 2 structure. A. C. impedance studies were carried out on the porous PbO 2 electrodes. An analogue was found which described the discharge process of Pb 02...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} buzepide methiodide (BZP) was investigated by cyclic, linear <b>sweep</b> and differential <b>pulse</b> voltammetric (DPV) techniques. The electrochemical studies {{were carried out}} on a glassy carbon electrode at room temperature. BZP showed a pair of quasireversible peaks. The effect of peak current and peak potential on scan rate, pH, concentration and different electrolytes was investigated. The oxidation and reduction currents were observed to be diffusion controlled between the scan rates of 5 to 500 mV s- 1 and 5 to 50 mV s- 1, respectively. The oxidation and reduction currents of BZP were observed to be pH dependent. Bulk electrolysis was performed to obtain the oxidized product and the same was identified by IR spectroscopy. Probable mechanism was proposed for redox reaction of BZP. Considering the sensitivity, anodic peak was selected for analytical application. Highly resolved diffusion controlled oxidation peak was noticed in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer of pH 2. 5. An analytical method with adequate precision and accuracy was developed for the determination of BZP with the detection limit of 1. 13 x 10 - 6. A linear response of current-concentration was obtained in the range of 1. 6 x 10 - 6 to 1. 7 x 10 - 5 M for DPV with a correlation coefficient value of 0. 9978. The proposed procedure was successfully applied to the determination of BZP in tablets...|$|R
40|$|We report {{experimental}} studies of the spectral linewidth and chirp characteristics of the mm-wave rf radiation of the Israeli Electrostatic-Accelerator free electron laser (EA-FEL), along with theory and numerical simulations. The simulations, matching the experimental data, were carried out using a space-frequency-domain model. EA-FELs {{have the capacity to}} generate long pulses of tens microseconds and more, that in principle can be elongated indefinitely (cw operation). Since a cold beam FEL is by nature a “homogeneously broadened laser,” EA-FEL can operate, unlike other kinds of FELs, at a single longitudinal mode (single frequency). This allows the generation of very coherent radiation. The current status of the Israeli Tandem Electrostatic-Accelerator FEL, which is based on an electrostatic Van de Graaff accelerator, allows the generation of pulses of tens microseconds duration. It has been operated recently past saturation, and produced single-mode coherent radiation of record narrow inherent relative linewidth ∼Δf/f= 10 ^{- 6 } at frequencies near 100  GHz. A frequency chirp was observed during the pulses of tens of microseconds (0. 3 – 0. 5 [*][*]MHz/ms). This is essentially a drifting “frequency-pulling effect,” associated with the accelerator voltage drop during the pulse. Additionally, damped relaxation of the FEL oscillator was experimentally measured at {{the beginning and the end}} of the lasing pulse, in good correspondence to our theory and numerical simulations. We propose using the chirped signal of the pulsed EA-FEL for single <b>pulse</b> <b>sweep</b> spectroscopy of very fine resolution. The characteristics of this application are analyzed based on the experimental data...|$|R
