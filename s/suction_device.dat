25|$|Vitrectomy may be {{successful}} in treating more severe cases. The technique usually involves making three openings through {{the part of the}} sclera known as the pars plana. Of these small gauge instruments, one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye, the second is a fiber optic light source, and the third is a vitrector. The vitrector has a reciprocating cutting tip attached to a <b>suction</b> <b>device.</b> This design reduces traction on the retina via the vitreous material. A variant sutureless, self-sealing technique is sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving {{device with}} {{continuous}} suction often used during sinus surgery. It {{is made up}} of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a <b>suction</b> <b>device.</b> The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, {{founding}} {{members of the}} feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap <b>suction</b> <b>device</b> {{that made it possible}} for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called menstrual extraction. During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in manual vacuum aspiration as a method of early surgical abortion. This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (as soon as a week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective early abortion options, both surgical and medical. An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe as soon as a positive pregnancy test is received. This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|Intramedullary tumors of {{the spinal}} cord account for 35 - 40 % of {{intraspinal}} tumors in children. The biological behavior of these tumors is of slow progression, and hence aggressive surgery has been advocated. Surgical adjuncts include use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, preoperative ultrasound, microsurgical techniques and ultrasonic <b>suction</b> <b>devices.</b> Osteoplastic laminoplasty approaches avoid post-laminectomy deformities in younger children.

40|$|To analyse the {{performance}} of mushroom-shaped fibrillar adhesive microstructure, its behaviour was studied during different stages of attachment–loading–detachment cycle. Visualizing the evolutions of real contact area of single microfibres, it is shown that the mushroom-shaped geometry of contact elements promotes fast and simple generation of reliable adhesion. The mushroom-shaped geometry seems to transform fibrillar contact elements into passive <b>suction</b> <b>devices</b> and makes them tolerant to overload, thus enhancing their robustness and stability. These findings may also be extrapolated to biological fibrillar attachment devices sharing the same geometry...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1970s, biopsies were {{obtained}} using metal capsules {{attached to a}} <b>suction</b> <b>device.</b> The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine.
