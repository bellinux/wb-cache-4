5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to <b>safe</b> <b>mode.</b> The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of <b>safe</b> <b>mode</b> and healthy.|$|E
5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into <b>safe</b> <b>mode</b> due to a low thermal limit sensor.

5|$|On March 19, 2007 the Command and Data Handling {{computer}} {{experienced an}} uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft {{to go into}} <b>safe</b> <b>mode.</b> The craft fully recovered within two days, with some data loss on Jupiter's magnetotail. No other data loss events {{were associated with the}} encounter. Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system to Earth in comparison to the closeness of Pluto to Earth, New Horizons sent back more data to Earth from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter.|$|E
40|$|Cluster is a multi-spacecraft ESA mission {{launched}} in 2000 {{to study the}} Earth's magnetic environment. After more than 11 years in space, {{the performance of the}} batteries and the solar arrays has decreased dramatically limiting the available power on-board. This is becoming a serious problem for contingency situations because hard-coded sequences executed during <b>safe</b> <b>modes</b> require much more power than what it is provided by the solar arrays. As a consequence <b>safe</b> <b>modes</b> are no longer safe and they can trigger main bus under-voltages, multiple reboots or even an uncontrolled switch off of the on-board computer. Several techniques have been studied to avoid or minimize the impact of <b>safe</b> <b>modes</b> and have been successfully implemented and validated during 2011 eclipse season.

5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter <b>safe</b> <b>mode,</b> which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter <b>safe</b> <b>mode,</b> which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

25|$|The {{most severe}} {{effect of the}} {{radiation}} were current leakages somewhere in spacecraft's power bus, most likely across brushes at a spin bearing connecting rotor and stator sections of the orbiter. These current leakages triggered a reset of the onboard computer and caused it to go into <b>safe</b> <b>mode.</b> The resets occurred when the spacecraft was either close to Jupiter or {{in the region of}} space magnetically downstream of the Earth. A change to the software was made in April 1999 that allowed the onboard computer to detect these resets and autonomously recover, so as to avoid <b>safe</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

25|$|On July 4, 2015, New Horizons {{experienced}} a software anomaly {{and went into}} <b>safe</b> <b>mode,</b> preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem. On July 5, NASA announced that the problem {{was determined to be}} a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission's main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives.|$|E
25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered <b>safe</b> <b>mode,</b> and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue.

50|$|Pipeline {{networks}} {{are the most}} economic and <b>safest</b> <b>mode</b> of transportation for oil, gases and other fluid products. As a means of long-distance transport, pipelines have to fulfill high demands of safety, reliability and efficiency. If properly maintained, pipelines can last indefinitely without leaks. Most significant leaks that do occur are caused by damage from nearby excavation. If a pipeline is not properly maintained, it can corrode, particularly at construction joints, low points where moisture collects, or locations with imperfections in the pipe. However, these defects can be identified by inspection tools and corrected before they progress to a leak. Other reasons for leaks include accidents, earth movement, or sabotage.|$|R
40|$|Coaches are {{considered}} the <b>safest</b> <b>mode</b> of road transport for school trips. In the last decade alone, 1191 children were injured in 371 coach crashes in the UK.

25|$|The brain {{structure}} {{that is the}} center of most neurobiological events associated with fear is the amygdala, located behind the pituitary gland. The amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. It is essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdala generates the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdala may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in <b>safe</b> <b>mode,</b> meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdala will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties.

On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E
