50|$|The Eureka was an American {{automobile}} {{made from}} 1907 to 1909. It was a wheel-steered high wheeler from St. Louis, Missouri, with a two-cylinder 10/12 hp air-cooled engine and conventional <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic design}} of the car, {{including}} <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission, 100 in wheelbase and shaft drive, remained unchanged over the years; however, in 1904, and again in 1905, the four-cylinder engine was [...] "beefed up." ...|$|R
50|$|The Great Smith of 1907 was {{priced at}} US$2500 with a 318 in3 (5213 cc) (4.5×5-inch, 114×127mm) {{water-cooled}} four, four-speed <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission (three forward, one reverse), multi-disk clutch. It featured 34×4 in (86×10 cm) spoke wheels and a 107 in (2718 mm) wheelbase.|$|R
5000|$|The 1904 model had a one-cylinder, 7 hp, {{water-cooled}} engine, {{a planetary}} transmission and a <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> suspension. It had a 65" [...] wheelbase. One version, called the Sandusky, was advertised at $650, {{in a review}} of 88 current models in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a 226.2 in³ (3.7 L) four-cylinder L-head design {{producing}} , which was re-rated to 25 for 1908 with no changes made. The Model G eschewed the complicated planetary transmission used on other luxury four-cylinder cars {{of the era}} for a less-complicated <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 Compound was a {{touring car}} model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 7 {{passengers}} and sold for $6000 to 8000. The vertical-mounted straight-3, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 35 hp (26.1 kW). A 3-speed <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission was fitted. The car weighed 3100 lb (1406 kg).|$|R
50|$|The 1906 {{delivery}} wagon had {{an improved}} 2-cyliner opposed motor delivering 20-horsepower at normal engine speed. Drive was by shaft to bevel gear on rear axle and the transmission was <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> giving two forward speeds and one reverse. The truck came with solid tires {{and had a}} capacity of 1500 lb. The price was US$1,500.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Hondamatic, {{like all}} following Honda automatics, featured <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> on parallel axes rather than planetary gears {{like most other}} automatic transmissions. The design preserved engine braking by eliminating a sprag {{between the first and}} second gears. Shifting between 1st and 2nd gears was done by simply <b>sliding</b> the <b>gear</b> selector from 1 to 2. It did not automatically shift, but because of the torque converter, could be driven entirely in 2nd gear. The Honda torque converter had a lockup, leading the company to sell the original Hondamatic (which had just two forward gear ratios) as a three-speed. The true three-speed H3 was launched in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|The Greater Eight {{models were}} built on Hudson's 119 in [...] {{wheelbase}} [...] "T-Series" [...] chassis riding on solid {{front and rear}} axles with semi-elliptic leaf springs and four-wheel mechanical brakes. Power for the 1931 models was supplied by a 233.7 CID L cast iron L-head inline eight-cylinder (I8) engine producing [...] mated to a three-speed <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> manual transmission.|$|R

All top hung <b>sliding</b> door <b>gear</b> systems have a maximum weight limit per pair of trolley hangers. When specifying a {{suitable}} sliding system the estimated weight of the door is a critical factor, although most suppliers of <b>sliding</b> door <b>gear</b> can advise on door weights ...|$|R
5000|$|The Atlas car {{was built}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1906-1907. The Atlas Automobile Company was {{established}} on College Avenue in the East End of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in late 1906 in a [...] "fireproof garage." [...] It was a four-cylinder car rated at 25/30 hp with shaft drive and a 3-speed <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission. It was offered as a touring car or runabout. The firm was out of business by the next year.|$|R
50|$|The L Series used a Sterling six-cylinder L-head engine {{rated at}} 35 bhp and was offered with an Auto-lite {{electric}} starter. A cone style clutch was mounted {{to the engine}} with a drive shaft that was connected to a rear end mounted <b>selective</b> <b>sliding</b> 3 speed transmission. The car used a 3/4 floating type rear suspension with 34 x 4 inch tires.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a fine four-cylinder {{motorcar}} that featured <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission and shaft drive, and price tags in the $2,000 range, which were quite reasonable considering the specification. The matter Dragon skimped upon, it would appear, was quality control in production. Melanowski left early on to design the Aerocar from Detroit, and Joe Tracy didn't hang around long either. The company had been incorporated in Maine {{in the summer of}} 1906 with Harold P. Knowlton as president, Albert E. Knowlton as treasurer.|$|R

25|$|Within the 15 {{years that}} make up this era, the various {{experimental}} designs and alternate power systems would be marginalised. Although the modern touring car had been invented earlier, {{it was not until}} Panhard et Levassor's Système Panhard was widely licensed and adopted that recognisable and standardised automobiles were created. This system specified front-engined, rear-wheel drive internal combustion engined cars with a <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission. Traditional coach-style vehicles were rapidly abandoned, and buckboard runabouts lost favour with the introduction of tonneaus and other less-expensive touring bodies.|$|R
5000|$|The 1905 model had 24-horsepower and was {{priced at}} US$2,500. It was advertised as [...] "light, strong and speedy" [...] and had 4 {{vertical}} cylinders and <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission with 3 speeds forward and reverse. It {{also had a}} bevel gear drive, side entrance, removable tonneau and was air-cooled via a rotary supercharger which forced air through aluminum jackets surrounding the cylinders. This [...] "single handedly" [...] solved the air cooling automobile problem and the vehicle had no water pump, radiator, water tank or piping.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson planetary gearsets. Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two central sun gears, and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets. Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R
5000|$|Prices for the Model A {{ranged from}} US$385 for a {{roadster}} to US$1400 for the top-of-the-line Town Car. The engine was a water-cooled L-head inline 4-cylinder with a displacement of 201 CID L. [...] This engine provided [...] Top speed was around 65 mph. The Model A had a 103.5 in wheelbase {{with a final}} drive ratio of 3.77:1. The transmission was a conventional 3-speed <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> manual unsynchronized unit with a single speed reverse. The Model A had 4-wheel mechanical drum brakes. The 1930 and 1931 models were available with stainless steel radiator cowling and headlamp housings.|$|R

5000|$|... Friden and Monroe calculators used a {{biquinary}} {{variant of}} this mechanism. Both {{were made in}} large numbers; Monroe started early in the 20th century; Friden in the 1930s. (The Marchant used a radically different and unique mechanism.) The variant mechanism worked with digits from 1 through 4 {{as shown in the}} animation; digits larger than 4 engaged a five-tooth gear as well as the teeth of the Leibniz wheel. This made it unnecessary for the <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> to travel longer distances for the higher-number digits. Otherwise, pressing a 5..9 key would require either a longer stroke (as in a Comptometer) or excessive force combined with a gently sloping cam surface.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a sliding door is called <b>sliding</b> door <b>gear.</b> There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types {{do not have a}} perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used.|$|R
50|$|Within the 20 {{years that}} make up this era, the various {{experimental}} designs and alternative power systems would be marginalised. Although the modern touring car had been invented earlier, {{it was not until}} Panhard et Levassor's Système Panhard was widely licensed and adopted that recognisable and standardised automobiles were created. This system specified front-engined, rear-wheel drive internal combustion engined cars with a <b>sliding</b> <b>gear</b> transmission. Initially the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling the horse buggy of before 1900) was in its heyday, with over 75 makers, including Holsman (Chicago), IHC (Chicago), and Lincoln Motor Car Works but were only gradually abandoned, in favor of the more advanced runabouts, tonneaus and other more expensive closed bodies - and killed off by the Ford Model T.|$|R

2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a <b>slide</b> <b>gear,</b> which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{concepts}} of concurrency in design and develops an approach that involves reliability and other functional perspectives at the conceptual design stage. The paper uses graph theory to represent a product and define the relationships between its components. It employs the graph-theory concepts of the `tree 2 ̆ 7 and the `forest 2 ̆ 7 to represent a functional design artefact and idle condition, respectively. The approach presented in the paper provides a more refined visualization of the energy flow and is applicable to numerous designs including <b>sliding</b> <b>gears,</b> clutches, overrunning clutches and flywheels, amongst others. It {{can be used to}} concurrently modify the design taking into consideration various constraints, e. g. expected mechanical failures and cost considerations. A case study is presented to illustrate the benefits of the approach discussed in the paper...|$|R
