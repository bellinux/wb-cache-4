6000|$|But in our {{newspapers}} the compounding-disease lingers {{a little}} to the present day, but with the hyphens left out, in the German fashion. This is the shape it takes: instead of saying [...] "Mr. Simmons, clerk of the county and district courts, was in town yesterday," [...] the new form puts it thus: [...] "Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town yesterday." [...] This saves neither time nor ink, and has an awkward sound besides. One often sees a remark like this in our papers: [...] "MRS. Assistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season." [...] That is a case of really unjustifiable compounding; because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers a title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. But these little instances are trifles indeed, contrasted with the ponderous and dismal German system of piling jumbled compounds together.
