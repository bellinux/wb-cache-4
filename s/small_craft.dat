5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of <b>small</b> <b>craft.</b> The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|As Gladys {{strengthened}} in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau {{predicted that}} the storm would bring high surf to areas {{as far north as}} North Carolina. Additionally, it was suggested that Gladys could have threatened northern Florida, as the storm was on a similar path as Hurricane Dora. As a result, residents along the coast of the Southeastern United States were advised to remain alert and <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisories were issued. On September20, <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisories were issued for The Bahamas. After Gladys turned northwestward on September21, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau issued hurricane watches for North Carolina, Virginia, and some Mid-Atlantic states. Gale warnings and <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisories were issued on September23 from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, ships of the United States Navy were diverted to Narragansett Bay as a precaution. At 0400UTC on September24, the gale warnings for New England were lowered as Gladys turned northeastward away from the coast however, small water craft were advised to remain in port until the seas subsided.|$|E
5|$|On August24, {{fishing vessels}} and <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> off the {{northern}} and eastern coasts of Luzon, Philippines were advised to not venture out due to large swells produced by Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, despite predictions that Hazel would {{pass to the}} north; these warnings were canceled a day later. After the storm had turned northward, tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and {{the waters of the}} Mona Passage. <b>Small</b> <b>craft</b> near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm. The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base, ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened, fortified Quonset huts, flying aircraft out of the storm's path, and positioning surface ships out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. <b>Small</b> <b>craft</b> warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E
5|$|The {{low that}} {{eventually}} became Arlene prompted wind warnings and <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisories for both coasts in southern Florida on May 27. The <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisory was significantly expanded {{the next day}} when the low was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene. The new warnings stretched from Sabine Pass, Texas to Saint Marks, Florida. Gale warnings were also issued upon the upgrade from Morgan City, Louisiana to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Rough seas and tides of two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 metres)—also known as storm surge—were expected in the areas under the gale warning. By May29, all craft were advised not to leave port in Louisiana. Memories of Hurricane Audrey led to numerous residents evacuating coastal areas upon hearing about Arlene. In Pierre, 50 families evacuated to higher grounds. Officials reported that 25 families were also evacuated from low-lying areas in Vermilion Parish. As Arlene neared landfall, the <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisory was canceled from Pensacola, Florida southward. The new warnings extended from Pensacola to Galveston, Texas. The gale warnings shifted more towards the west, now extending from Galveston, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Carrie {{and the high}} pressure area to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds, and by extension high seas. In response, the National Weather Service issued <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> warnings starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Gale warnings were posted the next day from southern New Jersey to the coast of central New England, and the <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> warnings were brought north to Maine. Ongoing, {{as well as the}} threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of flash flood watches throughout eastern Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire, and southern and central Maine on September 3. Due to rough surf, the beach at Virginia Beach, Virginia was closed to swimmers on August 31.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for {{the coast of}} the United States from Savannah, Georgia to Wilmington, North Carolina at 1600 UTC on September 28, which were quickly updated to hurricane warnings by 1900 UTC the same day. By 1900 UTC, gale warnings were in effect from Daytona Beach, Florida to Savannah, Georgia as well as from Wilmington to Morehead City, North Carolina. At 1200 UTC on September 29, gale warnings were dropped south of Brunswick, Georgia. At 2200 UTC, gale warnings were extended northward to Cape May, New Jersey, including Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. At 0400 UTC on September 30, all warnings south of Cape Hatteras were dropped, leaving gale warnings in effect from Cape Hatteras northward. At 1000 UTC, <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> were advised to remain in port from Cape May northward to Block Island, Rhode Island. By 1600 UTC, due to Gracie's continued weakening, all remaining gale warnings were downgraded to <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> warnings.|$|E
5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered the <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> {{out to the}} anchorage. It {{took two}} hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E

While SCATTOR trained Vietnamese replacement crews for the patrol boats of Squadron One, VECTOR trained and prepared Vietnamese repair personnel to maintain them.|$|E
5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch, and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E

5|$|As Bob moved {{towards the}} U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service issued gale {{warnings}} for coastal regions extending from Vermilion Bay, Louisiana to Biloxi, Mississippi at 1600 UTC on July 10. These warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon Bob's strengthening {{to such an}} intensity. During the storm's existence, forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average. In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches, the agency also advised <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida to remain in port.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rapid movement, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. As the storm weakened, the watches were discontinued. In {{response to the}} threat of the hurricane, officials posted a <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> advisory along the coastline of northern Puerto Rico. There, the weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall, though there was no reported damage. Lili moved through Hispaniola as an area of squally weather, but damage, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|For the German part, the High Seas Fleet {{determined}} not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port {{for much of the}} remainder of the war. Other theatres showed the role of <b>small</b> <b>craft</b> in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in November 1918 were casualties of Italian torpedo boats and frogmen.|$|E
