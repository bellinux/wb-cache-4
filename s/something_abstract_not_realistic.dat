40|$|Virtual spaces allow {{abstract}} {{representations of}} reality {{that not only}} encourage student self-directed learning but also reinforce core content of the learning objective through visual metaphors not reproducible in the physical world. One {{of the advantages of}} such a space is the ability to escape the restrictions of the physical classroom, yet reproduction of reality may surpass what is needed to encourage feelings of presence. Simultaneously, too high an abstraction level may change participants' attitudes in relation to the core learning goals. This quantitative study examined the relationship between level of environment abstraction, within a virtual space, and feelings of presence for business negotiation role playing. Negotiation values were also measured, in relation to environment abstraction. Two levels of virtual space abstraction were implemented, through the open source software Open Wonderland, where class lectures and student driven negotiation role playing took place over a semester. Results indicated a high abstract environment reduced feelings of presence compared to a low abstract environment, even when the low <b>abstract</b> level was <b>not</b> <b>realistic</b> but rather employing a metaphor related to instructional goals. The values students used in negotiation across the two abstraction levels exhibited no difference, indicating the fundamental approach to negotiating was not related to the virtual environment design...|$|R

40|$|Basically the {{acquisition}} of moral values {{is seen as the}} regeneration of the traits of a person. It can be said that the moral values as continuity of psychological processes such as perception, attitude, and belief in oneself. On the other hand, some are saying that {{the acquisition}} of moral values as the social interaction between the individual and his environment. Current perspective is more emphasis {{on the role of the}} outside world as a factor that facilitates value system. The role of parents, teachers, community and moral value system that is maintained in an environment in which he lives is an important factors for the possession of the moral values of the individual self. In the view of philosophy, moral values are often associated with the problem of goodness. Something is said to have a moral value if something is useful, true (truth value), beautiful (aesthetic value), good (moral values), religious (religious values), and so forth. Moral values and the ideal is something that is good. Hence the value is regarded as <b>something</b> <b>abstract</b> and can <b>not</b> be touched by the five senses. In connection with this, the Fraenkel (in Hamid Darmadi, 2007 : 27) states that this nilaimoral presence in the "people 2 ̆ 7 s minds" (human chimera) as well as different other. The opinion similar to the view of this Fraenkel is Rokeah, stating that moral values is something valuable that is considered valuable, fair, good and beautiful as well as to guide or handle themselves...|$|R

In studying geometry, the steps to change <b>something</b> <b>abstract</b> into concrete and than returns it back into abstract is good if it matched with Jerome Bruner’s theory.
