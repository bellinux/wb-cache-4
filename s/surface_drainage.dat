5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The checked <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> systems {{consist of}} check gates {{placed in the}} {{embankments}} surrounding flat basins, such as those used for rice fields in flat lands. These fields are usually submerged and only need to be drained on certain occasions (e.g., at harvest time). Checked <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> systems are also found in terraced lands used for rice.|$|E

25|$|In literature, {{not much}} {{information}} {{can be found on}} the relations between the various regular <b>surface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems, the reduction in the degree of waterlogging, and the agricultural or environmental effects. It is therefore difficult to develop sound agricultural criteria for the regular <b>surface</b> field <b>drainage</b> systems. Most of the known criteria for these systems concern the efficiency of the techniques of land leveling and earthmoving.|$|R

25|$|While {{there are}} more than two types of {{drainage}} systems employed in agriculture, there are two main types: (1) <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> and (2) sub-surface drainage.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it can also}} happen that a <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> system diminishes the {{recharge}} of the groundwater {{to such an extent}} that the subsurface drainage problem is considerably reduced or even eliminated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>drainage</b> {{systems are}} usually applied in {{relatively}} flat lands that have soils {{with a low}} or medium infiltration capacity, or in lands with high-intensity rainfalls that exceed the normal infiltration capacity, so that frequent waterlogging occurs on the soil surface.|$|E

25|$|The most {{economical}} {{method of}} coal extraction from coal seams {{depends on the}} depth {{and quality of the}} seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or underground. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a coal preparation plant. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> patterns; ground water conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.|$|E
25|$|The Cors Caron {{sequence}} of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving {{example in the}} UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a con{{sequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum – Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|E

500|$|In 1278 {{the town}} was granted its first market to be held on a Thursday. In 1356 the town gained its first water supply by a deed of gift of the Abbot of Buckland. The water (known as the Town Lake or watercourse) came from a stream rising at Coombe Farm and flowed into a pond near Shortlands. From there it flowed in several open {{channels}} to {{all parts of the}} town. Water bailiffs were employed to protect the interests of the town and a tradition of [...] "possessioning" [...] took place. [...] This was a ceremony which took place every seven years where a group of townsfolk would inspect the channel and ensure that it was not being abused. The first recorded possessioning was in 1716. In the mid nineteenth century the water courses were used for boiling vegetables, <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> and emptying cesspools. A Board of Health Inspector in 1854 concluded that [...] "typhus and other epidemic diseases are so prevalent here more so than in any other parish in the Union". They were eventually only used to keep the streets clean and continued to flow until 1962 when the town council decided that they were not willing to pay for their upkeep.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that the first sewers of ancient Rome were built between 800 and 735 BC.

The sewage system as a whole did not really take off until the arrival of the Cloaca Maxima, an open channel that was later covered, and one of the best-known sanitation artifacts of the ancient world. Most sources believe it was built during the reign of the three Etruscan kings in the sixth century BC. This [...] "greatest sewer" [...] of Rome was originally built to drain the low-lying land around the Forum. It is not known how effective the sewers were, especially in removing excrement.|$|E

6000|$|When the {{castings}} near Nice {{had been}} ejected on an inclined surface, the disintegrated fragments rolled downwards, without losing their distinctive shape; {{and in some}} places could [...] "be collected in basketfuls." [...] Dr. King observed a striking instance of this fact on the Corniche road, where a drain, about 2.5 feet wide and 9 inches deep, {{had been made to}} catch the <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> from the adjoining hill-side. The bottom of this drain was covered for a distance of several hundred yards, to a depth of from 1.5 to 3 inches, by a layer of broken castings, still retaining their characteristic shape. Nearly all these innumerable fragments had rolled down from above, for extremely few castings had been ejected in the drain itself. The hill-side was steep, but varied much in inclination, which Dr. King estimated at from 30 degrees to 60 degrees with the horizon. He climbed up the slope, and [...] "found every here and there little embankments, formed by fragments of the castings that had been arrested in their downward progress by irregularities of the surface, by stones, twigs, &c. One little group of plants of Anemone hortensis had acted in this manner, and quite a small bank of soil had collected round it. Much of this soil had crumbled down, but a great deal of it still retained the form of castings." [...] Dr. King dug up this plant, and was struck with the thickness of the soil which must have recently accumulated over the crown of the rhizoma, as shown by the length of the bleached petioles, in comparison with those of other plants of the same kind, where there had been no such accumulation. The earth thus accumulated had no doubt been secured (as I have everywhere seen) by the smaller roots of the plants. After describing this and other analogous cases, Dr. King concludes: [...] "I can have no doubt that worms help greatly in the process of denudation." ...|$|E

50|$|Drainage systems {{reduce the}} water level inside a {{potentially}} unstable hillside, which leads to reduction in pore water pressures {{in the ground and}} an increase in the shear strength within the slope.
