One of the remnants of this industry is a 100 m highdeposit with high contents of uranium, arsenic, molybdenum, vanadium and otherelements. Presently the leakage of metals from the deposit into nearby streams israther modest but will most likely accelerate in the near future. One way to preventan uncontrolled leakage of these elements from the deposit into the environmentwould be to install a filter with an effective adsorbent that after saturation could easilybe regenerated and reused. The filter could not only be used to reduce the impact ofmetal leakage to the environment but also to reclaim valuable elements like nickel,vanadium, uranium and molybdenum. Unfortunately such a filter does not existtoday, {{but there are a}} wide range of minerals that have high adsorbing capacities andcould serve as filter components in a mineral barrier system. The adsorbingproperties of some natural minerals with respect to selected metals that are abundantin the Kvarntorp deposit are studied in this project.

40|$|Table Head and Goose Tickle group strata {{in western}} Newfoundland are a deepening-upward, {{carbonate}} to clastic sequence deposited on the convergent, paleosouth-facing, North American continental margin during Middle Ordovician time. Preceding passive margin platform growth was abruptly terminated by widespread, early Middle Ordovician block-faulting and differential uplift (St. George Unconformity) caused by migration of a peripheral bulge across the platform interior. Subsequent sea level rise led to widespread peritidal, then shallow subtidal, carbonate deposition (Table Point Formation) on a tectonically unstable platform {{that formed the}} western flank of the evolving Taconic foreland basin. Synsedimentary faulting and differential subsidence profoundly influenced sedimentation, leading to marked variations in thickness and abrupt lateral and vertical changes in platformal carbonate lithofacies. Episodic seismicity and changes in slope triggered gravitational slides and flows. This platform was in turn tectonically drowned by extensional faulting and differential collapse as it {{became part of the}} outer trench slope of the subduction zone. Thin-bedded, hemipelagic and turbiditic limestone and shale (Table Cove Formation) accumulated on discontinuous, gently-dipping carbonate slopes and basin margins of variable duration and facing direction. Massive, polymictic, carbonate debris flow conglomerate, calciturbidite and shale (Cape Cormorant Formation) were deposited in an isolated basin adjacent to a high relief fault scarp that exhumed several hundred metres of buried, older, passive margin platformal carbonate. Laminated black <b>shale</b> (<b>Black</b> Cove Formation) accumulated in remote, sediment-starved basins, and on the tops of isolated, rapidly foundered, relict platforms.

Terrigenous mud, silt and sand, transported mostly by turbidity currents travelling southwest parallel to the trench axis, accumulated in topographic depressions controlled by antecedent structural domains.

Many <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> units are enriched in metals everalfold above expected amounts in ordinary <b>shale.</b> Some <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> units have served as host rocks for syngenetic metal deposits. <b>Black</b> <b>shales</b> have formed throughout the Earth's history and {{in all parts of}} the world.

From a deep-time ocean evolution perspective, this important observation suggests that enrichment in these metals cannot necessarily be attributed to metal incorporation at an interface between sediment and euxinic water. Instead, in Arctic Bay Formation <b>black</b> <b>shale,</b> the metals were either scavenged onto dolomite as it precipitated in the water column, or secondarily re-distributed within the sediment according to its dolomite content. The base metals that are concentrated in the <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> (e. g., Zn) were probably sourced from diffuse hydrothermal venting, and although there is no evidence at the studied location for a nearby point source of metals (vent), persistent bottom- water euxinia would have ensured the effective scavenging of any dissolved metals supplied, and so the basin has at the very minimum a hypothetical potential for SEDEX and polymetallic mineralisation. Whole-rock U-Th-Pb isotope analysis of <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> yielded a date of 1092 ? 59 Ma, which is considered to be the Arctic Bay Formation 2 ̆ 7 s depositional age...|$|R

Detailed mineralogical and geochemical {{studies were}} carried out on the middle member of the <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga province to infer their source rocks, paleo-weathering and provenance of the sources. The studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> are highly fossiliferous and fissile. They are texturally classified as phosphatic marly mudstone microfacies. Mineralogically, they are composed mainly of calcite, apatite, quartz, pyrite and clay minerals. The studied clay fraction reveals that the well-crystalline Na-montmorillonite is the dominating clay mineral with mixed layer montmorillonite-illite and minor kaolinite. These shales {{could be used as a}} source for the sodium bentonite. The studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> are highly mature, detrital and authigenic in origin. They are most probably derived from basic volcanic rocks by intensive chemical weathering. The provenance constituted a part of passive and active continental margins similar to those the Devonian/Mississippian shales in USA. The Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga area are part of Mes-Neoarchean Shales, and are typically comparable to the Archean Shale Average. The average values of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr, V, As and Se and, with the ratios Rb/Sr and Cr/Ni, are enriched with respect to those of the PAAS values. This could be attributed to the abundance of mafic components. The felsic source rocks were considered as an added source similar to Cretaceous and Cambrian <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> in India and China; respectively. The ratios V/Cr, V/(V + Ni) and Mo/Al and the high concentrations of the redox sensitive elements revealed that the studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> were deposited under relatively euxinic to anoxic reducing marine environments coupled with hydrothermal solutions. They were found comparable to the Cretaceous Gulf of California, Posidonia, Cretaceous/Tertiary <b>black</b> <b>shales,</b> and those in the Black Sea. The studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> can be classified as good to excellent source of oil and trace elements. The chemical composition of the studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of the Duwi Formation (Cretaceous) was correlated to published data at different localities and ages...|$|R

Study of a mineralized profile shows a good correlation between the S, TOC and Cu, Co and Ag content, suggesting syngenetic bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) accumulation. The presence of disseminated and fracture filling rather than framboidal Cu-minerals, suggests formation via diagenetic processes. Compared to the <b>black</b> <b>shale,</b> the LC shows a lower HI and a higher OI, and a much more diverse ore mineral content. The <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> ore is composed of 15 vol. % sulfide, this proportion reaches 27 % in the LC whereas the TOC is similar in the LC and LBS.

In this study, the Dukpyung and the Chubu areas were selected to investigate the migration and enrichment of As and other toxic elements in soils and crop plants in areas covered with <b>black</b> <b>shale.</b> Rock and soil samples digested in 4 -acid solution (HCl+HNO 3 +HF+HClO 4) were analyzed for As and other heavy metals by ICP-AES and ICP-MS, and plant samples by INAA. Mean concentration of As in Okchon <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> is higher than those of both world average values of <b>shale</b> and <b>black</b> <b>shale.</b> Especially high concentration of 23. 2 mg As kg- 1 is found in <b>black</b> <b>shale</b> from the Dukpyung area. Mean concentration of As is highly elevated in agricultural soils from the Dukpyung (28. 2 mg kg- 1) and the Chubu areas (32. 6 mg kg- 1). As is highly elevated in rice leaves from the Dukpyung (1. 14 mg kg- 1) and the Chubu areas (1. 35 mg kg- 1). The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of As in plant species decreases in the order of rice leaves > corn leaves > red pepper = soybean leaves = sesame leaves > corn stalks > corn grains. This indicates that leafy plants tend to accumulate As from soil to a greater degree than cereal products such as grains...|$|R
