40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ontological <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> success. The {{literature}} shows that success {{has historically been}} {{considered to be an}} objective property of a project, one that can be assessed and the status of the project as a success or failure determined. However, this approach is shown to have serious deficiencies in dealing with certain project results. As an alternative, this paper suggests that following the subjective view of project success; success should be considered as a politically determined social construction. The paper advocates using Archer’s Morphogenetic Social Theory (Archer 1995; Cuellar 2010 b) to explanatory mechanism. Under that theory, success is conceptualized as an ideological social structure, which is arrived at via a morphogenetic sequence. An examination of Larsen and Myers ’ (1997) case study under the various definitions shows the validity of this approach...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The South Florida ecosystem covers about 18, 000 square miles and {{is home to the}} Everglades, a national resource. Over the past 100 years, efforts to manage the flow of water through the ecosystem have jeopardized its health. In 2000, a strategy to restore the ecosystem was set; restoration was expected to take at least 40 years and cost $ 15. 4 billion. The restoration comprises hundreds of projects, including 60 key projects known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), to be undertaken by a partnership of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Given the size and complexity of the restoration, GAO was asked to report on the (1) <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> implementation and expected benefits, (2) factors that determine project sequencing, (3) amount of funding provided for the effort and extent that costs have increased, and (4) primary mathematical models that guide the restoration. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{manufacturing}} involves {{high volume}} of complex operational processes, distributed resources and international/intersectional collaborations, which cause {{the evaluation of}} performance for related engineering projects to become a challenge. The performance of project is a key factor that determines the quality of output, and its temporal changes could reflect the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> execution at current time, as well as indicate the potential issues for the near future. As a result, monitoring the change of performance is an essential approach to ensure the project execution is on track. It could raise awareness of project participants upon any issue occurs, and enable them to make appropriate decisions on a real-time basis. To facilitate the evaluation of project performance in collaborative environments, this research aims to propose an automatic approach to extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) from project related data, and also to demonstrate how the domain knowledge can facilitate the process of KPIs identification and visualisation...|$|E

40|$|Demonstration of {{compliance}} with the Texas Building Energy Conservation Design Standard involves completion of a summary checklist for each of its sections. This manual checking is tedious. Furthermore, no comprehensive documentation of the user's compliance is provided and the compliance checker must manage the data collected. To assist designers in complying with the Standard and to reduce the time required, the Center for Energy Studies (CES) at the University of Texas at Austin has developed an expert system to serve as both the compliance procedure and its documentation. This expert system directs the user with queries (screen menus), prompting the user for all relevant information. A graphical user interface has been developed to facilitate quick navigation through the Standard, easy data entry, and identification {{of compliance}} failures. This paper describes the research approach to the expert system, the system features, current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project,</b> and the benefits {{to be derived from}} this innovative compliance tool...|$|E

40|$|To ensure mobility, future {{road traffic}} {{management}} needs actual and reliable {{information about the}} traffic over wide areas. Nowadays, outside of motorways the actual traffic situation is almost unknown {{due to the lack}} of sensor installations. Traffic monitoring with radar from high altitudes delivers a new approach which allows the capture of traffic data in wide areas and at every position in the road net. Radar can look through clouds and can operate independently of weather and sight conditions at day and night and it can detect vehicles independently of their instrumentation onboard. At the German Aerospace Center (DLR) the practical feasibility of airborne radar for road traffic management in general but also in specific situations of big events or occurred disasters is under investigation. This paper gives an overview over the actual <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> works and will present aspects for future applications of airborne radar for road traffic and disaster management...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a surge in}} self-organizing voluntary teams collaborating online to produce goods and services. Motivated by this phenomenon, this research investigates how these teams are formed and how individuals make decisions about which teams {{to join in the}} context of open source software development (OSSD). The focus {{of this paper is to}} explore how the collaborative network affects developers ’ choice of newly-initiated OSS projects to participate in. More specifically, by analyzing software project data from real world OSSD projects, we empirically test the impact of past collaborative ties with and perceived <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> members in the network on the self-assembly of OSSD teams. Overall, we find that a developer is more likely to join a project when he has strong collaborative ties with its initiator. We also find that perceived status of the non-initiator members of a project influences its probability of attracting developers. We discuss the implications of our results with respect to self-organizing teams and open source software development...|$|E

The practical part deals with putting SELinux into operation and evaluation of the security policy tool Multi-Level Security and the subsequent testing of its functionality for selected Linux distributions. The findings are drawn from the project documentation, technical articles, blogs, and conferences in English and Czech languages. Benefits of the bachelor thesis lies mainly in the development of rules for Multi-Level Security on a concrete example, where there is evidence of the functionality of all knowledge and experience gained during the elaboration of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Before {{summarizing}} the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> work efforts, {{it is appropriate}} to reiterate the philosophy being followed by Meridian in developing the Maintenance Decision Support System. The Pooled Fund Study (MDSS PFS) is a deterministic approach based upon physical and chemical laws of nature. The model deals with the surface conditions atop paved highways or bridge structures and focuses on the addition and subtraction of materials within the transient layer immediately atop the pavement. Additions to this layer may include precipitation, dew, frost, absorption of moisture, various chemicals, and grit materials. Subtractions from this layer include plowing, runoff, traffic impacts, evaporation, and sublimation. The PFS model simulates the state of this transient layer handling the balance of materials {{into and out of the}} layer, the balance of heat, the physical state of the water component (solid, liquid, or slush), and the concentration of chemicals or grit materials in the mixture. The PFS model attempts to emulate the existing and future condition of “contaminants ” on the pavement at numerous locations along a segment o...|$|E
