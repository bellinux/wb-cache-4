40|$|Current {{deformable}} mirrors {{used for}} adaptive optics employ many actuators {{to adjust the}} mirror in order to compensate for optical irregularities. These mechanical actuators, which can number in the hundreds for a given mirror, require {{a significant amount of}} electrical wires in order to be controlled. The objective of this research is to implement a different type of actuator that can be controlled without the use of wires. The actuator developed employs a laser to quickly heat and expand the air in a closed "cell. " When the air expands, it pushes a membrane that causes the mirror to move. Creating an array of these cells, and scanning them with a laser can control a deformable mirror. Testing showed that a single cell with a 5 -mm diameter and 10 -mm length can deflect a membrane of aluminized mylar in excess of our minimum requirement of 20 microns. These cells can now be assembled in a 5 x 5 matrix and attached to many small Mirrors.

40|$|Acts of {{insurgency}} {{have become}} an increasing threat resulting in extensive measures being taken by the law enforcement authorities to mitigate their devastating effects on human life and infrastructure. This thesis introduces a magnetometry-based information, and signal processing methodology for detecting concealed ferrous objects in vehicle body panels. From extensive literature research, {{it was observed that}} while magnetic sensors have been used in a variety of related applications, but they have not been extensively applied to the on-road detection of firearms and explosives concealed in vehicles. This study utilized an extensive experimental protocol for preliminary concept validation. The main idea behind the approach was that almost all concealed weapons and explosives are made up of a considerable amount of ferrous material, and hence produce a local distortion in the Earth’s magnetic field. This distortion can then be identified by utilizing sensitive magnetic sensors. To detect concealed ferrous objects, magnetic signatures of a vehicle door panel were obtained by using a <b>scanning</b> <b>assembly</b> design in this thesis project, and compared to a base magnetic signature of the same vehicle door panel. The base magnetic signature is the magnetic field data of the same vehicle where no foreign ferrous objects were present. To analyze the data, a signal processing methodology was designed. To achieve the objective of accurately detecting concealed ferrous objects, simple measures such as magnetic field strength and its energy density were computed. These simple measures were then used in conjunction with more sophisticated statistical methods such as, normalized cross-correlation and Mahalanobis distance. Although all these methodologies were able to detect a magnetic footprint anomaly {{in the presence of a}} concealed object, the Mahalanobis distance approach, in particular provided the most conclusive results in all the test cases considered...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{integrally}} stiffened composite materials, manufactured {{for use in}} the next generation of commercial and military aircraft, are being increasingly used for structural components such as wings and fuselages. However, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, small variations in the shape of {{integrally stiffened}} composite structures often occur. Thus, a prioriknowledge of the part shape often does not provide sufficient tolerance to allow an automated conventional ultrasonic inspection. Many of the advantages of laser-based ultrasonics, including its noncontacting nature and applicability to rapid scanning of contoured and integrally stiffened structures, have been described previously [1 – 5]. To further extend the utility of laser-based ultrasonics, enable limited access inspections and also provide an upgrade/retrofit path for existing ultrasonic scanning systems, it is desirable {{to reduce the size of}} current laser-based ultrasound (LBU) system scan heads and provide both generation and detection laser beam delivery via optical fibers. A promising approach is the use of a scanning head based on a Cassegrain optical collection system. This approach minimizes the load carrying requirements of the <b>scanning</b> <b>assembly</b> and is also well-suited for integration with fiber optics to allow the delivery and reception of the ultrasonic generation and detection laser beams via long lengths of optical fiber. This provides increased mobility of the LBU scan head and allows the ultrasonic generation and detection lasers and other sensitive equipment to be housed in a clean environment which potentially can be located hundreds of meters from the inspection area. The use of a pulsed CO 2 laser has been reported previously for generation of ultrasonic waves in composite materials [4]. However, the CO 2 laser wavelength (λ = 10. 6 μm) and the high peak power laser pulses precludes the use of fiber-optic beam delivery over all but very short lengths (3 ̆c 1. 5 m) of specialized optical fiber. Consequently an alternative generating laser has been sought that can be transmitted efficiently over standard quartz optical fiber. An alexandrite laser, which is tunable over the 720 – 800 nm wavelength range, is being investigated for this application. Progress towards the implementation of a fiber-based LBU system for rapid NDE of large-area composites, and the use of an alexandrite laser for ultrasonic generation in composite materials are described below...|$|E

40|$|Portable 3 D {{scanners}} {{with low}} measurement uncertainty are ideally suited for capturing the 3 D shape of objects {{right in their}} natural environment. However, elaborate manual post processing was usually necessary to build a complete 3 D model from several overlapping scans (multiple views), or expensive or complex additional hardware (like trackers etc.) was needed. On the contrary, the NavOScan project[1] aims at fully automatic multi-view 3 D <b>scan</b> <b>assembly</b> through a Navigation Unit attached to the scanner. This light weight device combines an optical tracking system with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for robust relative scanner position estimation. The IMU provides robustness against swift scanner movements during view changes, while the wide angle, high dynamic range (HDR) optical tracker focused on the measurement object and its background ensures accurate sensor position estimations. The underlying software framework, partly implemented in hardware (FPGA) for performance reasons, fusions both data streams in real time and estimates the navigation unit’s current pose. Using this pose to calculate the starting solution of the Iterative Closest Point registration approach allows for automatic registration of multiple 3 D scans. After finishing the individual scans required to fully acquire the object in question, the operator is readily presented with its finalized complete 3 D model!

40|$|AbstractScanning ion {{conductance}} microscopy (SICM) is a super-resolution live {{imaging technique}} {{that uses a}} glass nanopipette as an imaging probe to produce three-dimensional (3 D) images of cell surface. SICM {{can be used to}} analyze cell morphology at nanoscale, follow membrane dynamics, precisely position an imaging nanopipette close to a structure of interest, and use it to obtain ion channel recordings or locally apply stimuli or drugs. Practical implementations of these SICM advantages, however, are often complicated due to the limitations of currently available SICM systems that inherited their design from other scanning probe microscopes in which the <b>scan</b> <b>assembly</b> is placed right above the specimen. Such arrangement makes the setting of optimal illumination necessary for phase contrast or the use of high magnification upright optics difficult. Here, we describe the designs that allow mounting SICM scan head on a standard patch-clamp micromanipulator and imaging the sample at an adjustable approach angle. This angle could be as shallow as the approach angle of a patch-clamp pipette between a water immersion objective and the specimen. Using this angular approach SICM, we obtained topographical images of cells grown on nontransparent nanoneedle arrays, of islets of Langerhans, and of hippocampal neurons under upright optical microscope. We also imaged previously inaccessible areas of cells such as the side surfaces of the hair cell stereocilia and the intercalated disks of isolated cardiac myocytes, and performed targeted patch-clamp recordings from the latter. Thus, our new, to our knowledge, angular approach SICM allows imaging of living cells on nontransparent substrates and a seamless integration with most patch-clamp setups on either inverted or upright microscopes, which would facilitate research in cell biophysics and physiology...|$|R

30|$|The main {{relevant}} inaccuracy {{sources for}} the overall acquisition system are: (i) the inaccuracy of the robot in reproducing a selected target trajectory; (ii) the uncertainty associated to the laser displacement-sensors; (iii) the precision in assembling the support frame; (iv) {{the sensitivity of the}} assembly to environmental effects such as temperature and vibrations. The first two sources can be evaluated with Type-B uncertainty estimation approach via the manufacturer specifications. The effects of the third error source could be reduced and estimated by using additional knowledge on the mounting tolerance. In particular, the apparatus mounting inaccuracy, which affects the displacement measures with both systematic and predictable components, can be corrected by using additional geometrical references, acquired during the artwork laser <b>scanning.</b> The <b>assembly</b> sensitivity to temperature and vibrations, instead, cannot be modeled, and, therefore, this phenomenon has to be reduced as much as possible by strengthening the frame and reducing the robot speed at minimum.|$|R

40|$|Range-imaging {{instruments}} {{of a type}} now under development are intended to generate the equivalent of three-dimensional images from measurements of the round-trip times of flight of laser pulses along known directions. These instruments could also provide information on characteristics of targets, including roughnesses and reflectivities of surfaces and optical densities of such semi-solid objects as trees and clouds. Unlike in prior range-imaging instruments based on times of flight along known directions, {{there would be no}} moving parts; aiming of the laser beams along the known directions would not be accomplished by mechanical scanning of mirrors, prisms, or other optical components. Instead, aiming would be accomplished by using solid-state devices to switch input and output beams along different fiber-optic paths. Because of the lack of moving parts, these instruments could be extraordinarily reliable, rugged, and long-lasting. An instrument of this type would include an optical transmitter that would send out a laser pulse along a chosen direction to a target. An optical receiver coaligned with the transmitter would measure the temporally varying intensity of laser light reflected from the target to determine the distance and surface characteristics of the target. The transmitter would be a combination of devices for generating precise directional laser illumination. It would include a pulsed laser, the output of which would be coupled into a fiber-optic cable with a fan-out and solid-state optical switches that would enable switching of the laser beam onto one or more optical fibers terminated at known locations in an array on a face at the focal plane of a telescope. The array would be imaged by the telescope onto the target space. The receiver optical system could share the aforementioned telescope with the transmitter or could include a separate telescope aimed {{in the same direction as}} that of the transmitting telescope. In either case, light reflected from the target would be focused by the receiver optical system onto an array of optical fibers matching the array in the transmitter. These optical fibers would couple the received light to one or more photodetector(s). Optionally, the receiver could include solid-state optical switches for choosing which optical fiber(s) would couple light to the photodetector(s). This instrument architecture is flexible and can be optimized for a wide variety of applications and levels of performance. For example, it is scalable to any number of pixels and pixel resolutions and is compatible with a variety of ranging and photodetection methodologies, including, for example, ranging by use of modulated (including pulsed and encoded) light signals. The use of fixed arrays of optical fibers to generate controlled illumination patterns would eliminate the mechanical complexity and much of the bulk of optomechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Furthermore, digital control of the selection of the fiber-optic pathways for the transmitted beams could afford capabilities not seen in previous three-dimensional range-imaging systems.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{to estimate the}} shape attribute of plutonium assemblies using the Nuclear Materials Identification System (NMIS) is described. The proposed method possesses a number of advantages. It is passive no external radiation source is required to estimate the shape of plutonium assemblies. Instead, inherent gamma and neutron emissions from spontaneous fission of {sup 240 }Pu and subsequent induced fission of {sup 239 }Pu are detected to estimate the shape attribute. The technique is also stationary: shape is estimated without <b>scanning</b> the <b>assembly</b> by moving the detectors relative to the assembly. The proposed method measures third order correlations between triplets of gamma/neutron-sensitive detectors. The real coincidence {{of a pair of}} gammas is used as a ''trigger'' to approximately identify the time of a spontaneous or induced fission event. The spatial location of this fission event is inferred from the real coincidence of a subsequent neutron with the initial pair of correlated gammas by using the neutron's time-of-flight (approximately the delay between the gamma pair and the neutron) and the fission neutron spectra of {sup 240 }Pu and {sup 239 }Pu. The spatial distribution of fission sites and hence the approximate shape of the plutonium assembly is thereby inferred by measuring the distribution {{of a large number of}} these correlated triplets. Proof-of-principle measurements were performed using {sup 252 }Cf as a surrogate for {sup 240 }Pu to demonstrate that the technique is feasible.

40|$|On-orbit whisk-broom sensors have <b>scanning</b> mirror <b>assemblies,</b> whose {{reflectance}} variations with scan angle must {{be characterized}} prior to launch. One such instrument is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Joint Polar Satellite System 2 (JPSS- 2) platform. The scanning optics inside VIIRS includes a four mirror rotating telescope assembly (RTA) {{and a half}} angle mirror (HAM), rotating at half {{the speed of the}} RTA, which de-rotates the light before it enters the aft-optics assembly. The angle of incidence (AOI) on the HAM varies with scan angle; all of the other optical components in VIIRS have a fixed AOI with scan angle. In general, the reflectance of the HAM will vary with AOI. This parameter is difficult to quantify once in orbit and therefore must be characterized pre-launch. Ground measurements were performed in the summer of 2016 to determine the relative reflectance change of the instrument with scan angle, referred to as the response versus scan angle (RVS). This work will describe the RVS testing performed and the results obtained, including an atmospheric water vapor correction and an uncertainty analysis. Results indicate that the reflectance variation with scan angle is small for spectral bands between 0. 4 μ m and 4 μ m (less than 2 % over the full range of AOI); in contrast, the reflectance variation is between 3 % and 10 % for the spectral bands in the 8 μ m to 12 μ m range.
