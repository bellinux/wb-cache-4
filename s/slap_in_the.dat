5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

In the {{original}} sense, a bitch slap is a powerful, full-swing <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face with {{the front of the}} hand, evoking the way an angry pimp might slap a defiant prostitute (not to be confused with a pimp slap which uses the back of the hand). However, the term is now frequently used figuratively to describe a humiliating defeat or punishment.|$|E

500|$|Georgia Tech {{students}} hold a heated, {{long and}} ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities {{between the two}} institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be [...] "old gold, black, and crimson". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it [...] "symbolized cowardice". After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color. Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891. Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp. [...] Drew Fetherston, reviewing the movie for Newsday, called it [...] "claptrap" [...] and that [...] "action [...] is all that this NBC stinker has to offer". Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a [...] "plodder", complaining that [...] "this film insults its predecessor". Chicago Sun-Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a half-star review calling it [...] "revisionist", [...] "distasteful", and [...] "terrible television". Deriding the film as [...] "poorly written, badly acted, sloppily directed and choppily edited", he called it [...] "another <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face {{of the men and}} women who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job and came home to even dirtier exploitation".

During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team."

500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Nasri {{admitted}} {{he was determined}} to re-capture his form that resulted in Arsenal signing him two years prior.

He was named in Arsenal's starting line-up to play against Liverpool for the first match of the season on 15 August 2010. Nasri played the entire match in a 1–1 draw. After the match, Arsenal confirmed Nasri had suffered a knee injury that would keep him out for a month.

500|$|Caligari was a {{critical}} success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What a lesson to all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face." [...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it [...] "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise {{by means of the}} camera". [...] French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: [...] "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth." [...] The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a [...] "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. In the end, that murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, leaving us gasping and a little confused." [...] Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was [...] "surprisingly good", and that [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments".

Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face to people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] but {{if there is to be}} a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E
