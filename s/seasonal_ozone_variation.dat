40|$|The {{latitudinal}} {{and seasonal}} variation of ozone in the troposphere is discussed. Of particular {{interest is the}} asymmetrical behavior of this gas {{with respect to the}} two hemispheres. These asymmetries, when coupled with a diagnostic photochemical model of the troposphere, lends support to the view that ozone cannot be viewed as an inert tracer of stratospheric origin. In the calculations it is noted that {{it is likely that the}} budgets of carbon monoxide and tropospheric ozone may be quite dependent on each other and the calculations are discussed in light of the uncertainty which currently exists about representative global tropospheric background concentrations of the nitrogen oxides. In addition, the seasonal variation of excess (C- 14) O 2 (a stratospheric tracer) is examined and compared with the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> during the same period of observations at the same location and altitudes. The distinct maxima for ozone found during the summer in the lower troposphere are not present for the (C- 14) O 2 data. This finding likewise suggests that photochemical processes taking place in the troposphere are an important source term for tropospheric ozone...|$|E
40|$|Data {{referring}} to an approximately 8 -year period (1999 - 2007) are analyzed {{in order to}} estimate the trend of the daily maximum hourly value of ozone concentration at {{the east coast of}} central Greece, where the summer background ozone concentration is high. A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter is applied to remove the short-term component from the raw time series of ozone and meteorological variables. Regression models are developed in order to produce meteorologically adjusted ozone time series, involving the noise-free temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed as independent variables. The analysis verifies that the meteorological adjustment provides better results on estimating ozone's trend, which is found to be increasing (alpha = 0. 001) with an annual rate of 1. 34 +/- 0. 07 mu g/m(3). This trend could mainly be attributed to policy and changes in the emissions of ozone's precursors. Additionally, the short-term component of ozone concentration is also meteorologically adjusted {{and its impact on the}} trend is examined. The analysis shows that its contribution is of minor importance when the ozone trend is adjusted by temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Moreover, the sea breeze circulation system that is frequently developed in the area influences the short-term and <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>variation,</b> and therefore, it should be taken into account when producing meteorologically adjusted time series. The study's conclusions could be exploited by environmental and agricultural authorities in order to develop their long-term strategies towards the air quality management...|$|E
40|$|The {{geographic}} area at high latitudes beyond the polar circle is characterized with long darkness {{during the winter}} (polar night) and with a long summertime insolation (polar day). Consequentially, the polar vortex is formed and the surrounding strong polar jet {{is characterized by a}} strong potential vorticity gradient representing a horizontal transport barrier. The ozone dynamics of the lower and middle stratosphere is controlled both by chemical destruction processes and transport processes. To study the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> at high latitudes, ozone vertical distributions are examined, collected from the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) (69. 3 °N, 16. 0 °E,) station at Andenes and from the stations at Sodankylä (67. 4 °N, 26. 6 °E) and at Ny-Ålesund (78. 9 °N, 11. 9 °E). The data sets cover the time period from 1994 until 2004. We find a second ozone maximum near 13 – 15 km, between the tropopause and the absolute ozone maximum near 17 – 20 km. The maximum is built up by the combination of air mass transport and chemical ozone destruction, mainly caused by the NOx catalytic cycle, which begins after the polar night and intensifies with the increasing day length. Formation of a troposphere inversion layer is observed. The inversion layer is thicker and reaches higher altitudes in winter rather than in summer. However, the temperature inversion during summer is stronger. The formation of an enhanced ozone number density is observed during the spring–summer period. The ozone is accumulated or becomes poor by synoptic weather patterns just above the tropopause from spring to summer. In seasonal average an ozone enhancement above the tropopause is obtained. The stronger temperature inversion during the summer period inhibits the vertical stratosphere–troposphere exchange. The horizontal advection in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is enforced during summer. The combination of these mechanisms generates a layer with a very low ozone number density above the troposphere inversion layer subsisting from June/July until the late autumn...|$|E

40|$|A multilinear {{parametric}} {{regression analysis}} was performed to assess the seasonal and interannual <b>variations</b> of stratospheric <b>ozone</b> profiles from the GROMOS (GROund-based Millimeter-wave Ozone Spectrometer) microwave radiometer at Bern, Switzerland (46. 95 ° N, 7. 44 ° E; 577  m). GROMOS takes part in the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The study covers the stratosphere from 50 to 0. 5  hPa (from 21 to 53  km) and extends over the period from January 1997 to January 2015. The natural variability was fitted during the regression analysis through the annual and semi-annual oscillations (AO, SAO), the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the solar activity cycle. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> mainly appear as an annual cycle {{in the middle and}} upper stratosphere and a semi-annual cycle in the upper stratosphere. Regarding the interannual variations, they are primarily present in the lower and middle stratosphere. In the lower and middle stratosphere, <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> are controlled predominantly by transport processes, due to the long lifetime of ozone, whereas in the upper stratosphere its lifetime is relatively short and ozone is controlled mainly by photochemistry. The present study shows agreement in the observed naturally induced ozone signatures with other studies. Further, we present an overview of the possible causes of the effects observed in stratospheric ozone due to natural oscillations at a northern midlatitude station. For instance regarding the SAO, we find that polar winter stratopause warmings contribute to the strength of this oscillation since these temperature enhancements lead to a reduction in upper stratospheric ozone. We have detected a strong peak amplitude of about 5  % for the solar cycle in lower stratospheric ozone for our 1. 5 cycles of solar activity. Though the 11 -year ozone oscillation above Bern is in phase with the solar cycle, we suppose that the strong amplitude is partly due to meteorological disturbances and associated ozone anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere. Further, our observational study gave the result that ozone above Bern is anti-correlated with the ENSO phenomenon in the lower stratosphere and correlated in the middle stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-regression {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed on 32 years of total ozone column data that was spatially gridded with a 1 × 1. 5 ° resolution. The total ozone data consist of the MSR (Multi Sensor Reanalysis; 1979 – 2008) and 2 years of assimilated SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) ozone data (2009 – 2010). The two-dimensionality in this data set allows us to perform the regressions locally and investigate spatial patterns of regression coefficients and their explanatory power. Seasonal dependencies of ozone on regressors {{are included in the}} analysis. A new physically oriented model is developed to parameterize stratospheric ozone. Ozone variations on nonseasonal timescales are parameterized by explanatory variables describing the solar cycle, stratospheric aerosols, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and stratospheric alternative halogens which are parameterized by the effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine (EESC). For several explanatory variables, seasonally adjusted versions of these explanatory variables are constructed to account for the difference in their effect on ozone throughout the year. To account for seasonal variation in ozone, explanatory variables describing the polar vortex, geopotential height, potential vorticity and average day length are included. Results of this regression model are compared to that of a similar analysis based on a more commonly applied statistically oriented model. The physically oriented model provides spatial patterns in the regression results for each explanatory variable. The EESC has a significant depleting effect on ozone at mid- and high latitudes, the solar cycle affects ozone positively mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, stratospheric aerosols affect ozone negatively at high northern latitudes, the effect of QBO is positive and negative in the tropics and mid- to high latitudes, respectively, and ENSO affects ozone negatively between 30 ° N and 30 ° S, particularly over the Pacific. The contribution of explanatory variables describing <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> is generally large at mid- to high latitudes. We observe ozone increases with potential vorticity and day length and ozone decreases with geopotential height and variable ozone effects due to the polar vortex in regions to the north and south of the polar vortices. Recovery of ozone is identified globally. However, recovery rates and uncertainties strongly depend on choices that can be made in defining the explanatory variables. The application of several trend models, each with their own pros and cons, yields a large range of recovery rate estimates. Overall these results suggest that care has to be taken in determining ozone recovery rates, in particular for the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based Fourier-transform {{infrared}} (FTIR) {{solar absorption}} spectroscopy {{is a powerful}} remote sensing technique providing information on the vertical distribution of various atmospheric constituents. This work presents the first evaluation of a mid-resolution ground-based FTIR to measure tropospheric ozone, independently of stratospheric ozone. This is demonstrated using a new atmospheric observatory (named OASIS for "Observations of the Atmosphere by Solar absorption Infrared Spectroscopy"), installed in Créteil (France). Indeed, the information content of OASIS ozone retrievals is clearly sufficient to monitor separately tropospheric (from the surface up to 8 km) and stratospheric ozone. Daily mean tropospheric ozone columns derived from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and from OASIS measurements have been compared for summer 2009 and a good agreement of − 5. 6 (&plusmn; 16. 1) % is observed. Also, a qualitative comparison between in-situ surface ozone measurements and OASIS data clearly shows OASIS's capacity to monitor <b>seasonal</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>variations,</b> as well as ozone pollution episodes in summer 2009 around Paris. Two extreme pollution events were identified (on the 1 July and 6 August 2009) for which ozone partial columns from OASIS and predictions from a regional air-quality model (CHIMERE) were compared by respecting temporal and spatial coincidence criteria. Quantitatively, an average bias of 0. 2 %, a mean square error deviation of 7. 6 %, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 91 was found between CHIMERE and OASIS. This demonstrates that a mid-resolution FTIR instrument in ground-based solar absorption geometry is a promising technique for monitoring tropospheric ozone...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue {{to lack of}} {{observational}} {{studies on}} greenhouse gases in Malaysia, most studies in this field were carried out based on ground station data. These studies did not utilize satellite data from the equatorial area. Satellite remote sensing {{is one of the}} most effective approaches for greenhouse gas distribution monitoring on a global scale. As such, satellite remote sensing exhibits a very high spatial and temporal resolution. <b>Variations</b> of <b>ozone</b> concentrations in Peninsular Malaysia were observed and investigated by means of data retrieved from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). The aim of this study was to determine the monthly and <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations in Peninsular Malaysia from January 2003 to December 2009. We utilized total column ozone at level 2 of the WFMD version 1. 0. A spatial resolution value of 1 °× 1. 25 ° was used. Analysis indicated that the five selected sites exhibited strong <b>seasonal</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> concentration <b>variations.</b> These variations resulted from the significant differences between the northeast monsoon (NEM) and the southwest monsoon (SWM). As the NEM prevails, cold air breaks out from Siberia and spreads to the equatorial region in the form of northeasterly cold surge winds. These winds manifest in low–level anticyclones over Southeast Asia. Inversely, the air masses from the southwest contribute to long–range air pollution. During SWM, the transport of atmospheric ozone by wind is associated with biomass burning in Sumatra, Indonesia. HYSPLIT was also utilized to identify the air pollutant transport between NEM and SWM toward Peninsular Malaysia. Comparisons were made between the ozone data from five sites in 2009. Data were retrieved from SCIAMACHY and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The relative difference average of the ozone data measured by SCIAMACHY and AIRS was approximately 6 %...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{observational}} {{evidence on}} the extratropical cross-tropopause transport between the stratosphere and the troposphere via quasi-isentropic processes in the middleworld (the part of the atmosphere in which the isentropic surfaces intersect the tropopause), this report presents {{an analysis of the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> of the <b>ozone</b> latitudinal distribution in the isentropic layer between 330 K and 380 K based on the measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II. The results from SAGE II data analysis are consistent with (1) the buildup of ozone-rich air in the extratropical middleworld through the large-scale descending mass circulation during winter, (2) the spread of ozone-rich air in the isentropic layer from midlatitudes to subtropics via quasi-isentropic transport during spring, (3) significant photochemical ozone removal and the absence of an ozone-rich supply of air to the layer during summer, and (4) air mass exchange between the subtropics and the extratropics during the summer monsoon period. Thus the SAGE II observed <b>ozone</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> in the middleworld are consistent with the existing model calculated annual cycle of the diabatic circulation as well as the conceptual role of the eddy quasi-adiabatic transport in the stratosphere-troposphere exchange reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{anomalous}} ozone distributions over cloudy {{areas in}} Nimbus- 7 (N 7) and Earth-Probe (EP) TOMS version- 7 data and analyzes the causes for ozone anomaly formation. A 5 °-longitude by 5 °-latitude region is defined {{to contain a}} Positive Ozone Anomaly (POA) or Negative Ozone Anomaly (NOA) if the correlation coefficient between total ozone and reflectivity is > 0. 5 or 750 hPa). Most tropical NOAs result from negative errors induced by large cloud-height errors, and most tropical POAs are caused by positive errors due to intra-cloud ozone absorption enhancement. However, positive and negative errors offset each other, reducing the ozone anomaly occurrence in TOMS data. Large ozone/reflectivity slopes for mid-latitude POAs show seasonal variation consistent with total ozone fluctuation, indicating that they result mainly from synoptic and planetary wave disturbances. POAs with an occurrence fraction of 30 [...] 60 % occur in regions of marine stratocumulus off {{the west coast of}} South Africa and off the west coast of South America. Both fractions and ozone/reflectivity slopes of these POAs show seasonal variations consistent with that in the tropospheric ozone. About half the ozone/reflectivity slope can be explained by ozone retrieval errors over clear and cloudy areas. The remaining slope may result from there being more ozone production because of rich ozone precursors and higher photolysis rates over high-frequency, low-altitude clouds than in clear areas. Ozone anomalies due to ozone retrieval errors have important implications in TOMS applications such as tropospheric ozone derivation and analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation...</b>|$|R

The data obtained mostly from March to October in the 1992 – 1998 time period are analyzed {{as a function of}} equivalent latitude in order to discriminate the measurements performed inside, at the edge or outside the vortex. The subsidence rate derived from the ozone measurements in the lower stratosphere prior to the destruction period and from the volcanic aerosol measurements in 1992 is in good agreement with the estimation provided by radiative transfer models. The analysis of the <b>ozone</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> shows that the ozone destruction starts in the beginning of August and affects essentially the inner vortex or inner edge regions. The destruction lasts up to the end of September and low ozone values are found up to the end of October, confirming the isolation of the polar vortex above 400 K. Ozone destruction rates of the order of 3 %/d in the 400 – 475 K region and 1. 5 %/d around 550 K are derived from the data obtained inside the vortex. The ozone measurements obtained in October allow to study the vortex confinement which shows the increase of the ozone meridional gradient through the vortex edge from 400 to 650 K.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Photochemistry of Ozone Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) field mission was to obtain data to better characterize the summertime <b>seasonal</b> decrease of <b>ozone</b> at mid to high latitudes.

Instrumented balloons and aircraft were used in POLARIS, along with satellites, to measure ozone and chemical species which are involved with stratospheric ozone chemistry. In order to close the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> budget, however, ozone transport must also be estimated. Comparison to a global chemistry and transport model (CTM) of the stratosphere indicates how well the summertime ozone loss processes are simulated and thus how well we can predict the ozone response to changing amounts of chemical source gases. Moreover, the model gives insight into the possible relative magnitude of transport contributions to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> decline. Initial comparison to the Goddard CTM, which uses transport winds and temperatures from meteorological data assimilation, shows a high ozone bias in the model and an attenuated summertime ozone loss cycle. Comparison of the model chemical partitioning and ozone catalytic loss rates to those derived from measurements shows fairly close agreement both at ER- 2 altitudes (20 km) and higher.

Here, we derive a monthly climatology of the daily ozone cycle from 17 yr of GROMOS observation. We present the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Characterizing the diurnal cycle of stratospheric ozone is important for correct trend estimates {{of the ozone layer}} derived from satellite observations. The diurnal ozone cycle from GROMOS is compared to two models: The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA). Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS) ozone data, from night- and daytime overpasses over Bern, have also been included in the comparison. Generally, observation and models show good qualitative agreement: in the lower mesosphere, daytime ozone is for both GROMOS and models around 25 % less than nighttime ozone (reference is 22 : 30 – 01 : 30). In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. It is important that diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> of this order are taken into account when merging different data sets for the derivation of long-term ozone trends in the stratosphere. Further, GROMOS and models indicate a seasonal behavior of daily <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> in the stratosphere with a larger afternoon maximum during daytime in summer than in winter. At 0. 35 hPa, observations from GROMOS and Aura/MLS show a seasonal pattern in diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> with larger relative amplitudes during daytime in winter (− 25 ± 5 %) than in summer (− 18 ± 4 %) (compared to mean values around midnight).

We use this relationship and MERRA temperatures to estimate <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> loss from 1993 to 2004 when inorganic chlorine levels were in the same range as during the Aura period. Using these loss estimates and the observed March mean 63 - 90 N column O 3, we quantify the sensitivity of the ozone dynamical resupply to wave driving, separating it from the sensitivity of ozone depletion to wave driving. The results show that about 2 / 3 of the deviation of the observed March Arctic O 3 from an assumed climatological mean is due to variations in O 3 resupply and 13 is due to depletion. Winters with a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) before mid-February have about 1 / 3 the depletion of winters without one and export less depletion to the midlatitudes. However, a larger effect on the spring midlatitude ozone comes from dynamical differences between warm and cold Arctic winters, which can mask or add to the impact of exported depletion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study investigates {{anomalous}} ozone distributions over cloudy {{areas in}} Nimbus- 7 (N 7) and Earth-Probe (EP) TOMS version- 7 data and analyzes the causes for ozone anomaly formation. A 5 °-longitude by 5 °-latitude region is defined {{to contain a}} Positive Ozone Anomaly (POA) or Negative Ozone Anomaly (NOA) if the correlation coefficient between total ozone and reflectivity is > 0. 5 or - 0. 5. The average fractions of ozone anomalies among all cloud fields are 31. 8 ± 7. 7 % and 35. 8 ± 7. 7 % in the N 7 and EP TOMS data, respectively. Some ozone anomalies are caused by ozone retrieval errors, and others are caused by actual geophysical phenomena. Large cloud-height errors {{are found in the}} TOMS version- 7 algorithm in comparison to the Temperature Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) cloud data. On average, cloud-top pressures are overestimated by ~ 200 hPa (THIR cloud-top pressure 200 hPa) for high-altitude clouds and underestimated by ~ 150 hPa for low-altitude clouds (THIR cloud-top pressure > 750 hPa). Most tropical NOAs result from negative errors induced by large cloud-height errors, and most tropical POAs are caused by positive errors due to intra-cloud ozone absorption enhancement. However, positive and negative errors offset each other, reducing the ozone anomaly occurrence in TOMS data. Large ozone/reflectivity slopes for mid-latitude POAs show seasonal variation consistent with total ozone fluctuation, indicating that they result mainly from synoptic and planetary wave disturbances. POAs with an occurrence fraction of 30 [...] 60 % occur in regions of marine stratocumulus off the west coast of South Africa and off the west coast of South America. Both fractions and ozone/reflectivity slopes of these POAs show seasonal variations consistent with that in the tropospheric ozone. About half the ozone/reflectivity slope can be explained by ozone retrieval errors over clear and cloudy areas. The remaining slope may result from there being more ozone production because of rich ozone precursors and higher photolysis rates over high-frequency, low-altitude clouds than in clear areas. Ozone anomalies due to ozone retrieval errors have important implications in TOMS applications such as tropospheric ozone derivation and analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Generalized Maximum Covariance Analysis (GMCA) {{has been}} {{developed}} and applied to diagnosing the dynamical modes associated with variations in the Antarctic spring ozone hole. GMCA is used to identify the most important patterns of co-variability between interannual <b>ozone</b> mixing ratio <b>variations</b> in the Antarctic region and temperature, zonal, meridional and vertical velocities between 100 and 10 hPa in the same region. The most important two pairs of GMCA time coefficients show large year-to-year variations and trends, which are connected {{with the growth of}} the Antarctic Ozone Hole and the increase of ozone depleting substances. The associated spatial patterns of <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> may be characterized as being quasi-symmetric and asymmetric about the pole. These patterns of <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> are associated with comparable patterns of variations of temperature and winds through most of the vertical domain. The year 2000 is shown to be dominated by the asymmetric mode, whereas the adjacent year 2001 is dominated by the quasi-symmetric mode. A case study, focusing on the asymmetric differences between these two years, shows the magnitude of the ozone mixing ratio, temperature and zonal wind differences to be in the range of 2 e– 6 kg/kg, 10 &deg;C and 10 m/s, respectively. Budget calculations show that transport processes contribute substantially to the ozone and temperature changes in the middle stratosphere over the Antarctic continent. However, both radiative and chemical processes also play important roles in the changes...|$|R

For comparison, the surface ozone time series (1988 - 1996) at Zugspitze (ZUG; 47 ° 25 'N, 10 ° 59 'E, 2960 m above sea level) on the northern fringe of the Alps in Germany is also examined. The applied structural model in state space form is flexible enough to isolate a statistically significant decrease in the estimated seasonal component for May ozone concentrations over the last 10 years, in both the original JFJ and ZUG ozone records. A negative trend in May is also displayed by ordinary linear regression but is not statistically significant, demonstrating the advantage of the employed methodology over simple regression approaches in the analysis of changing seasonal cycles of tropospheric ozone records. We attempt to isolate potential mechanisms underlying the observed changes in the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycles at JFJ by analyzing filtered-ozone records. Sieving was carried out with wind direction, wind speed, and time windows to exclude the confounding influences from the atmospheric boundary layer and outflow from southern Europe. Taking only nighttime (2400 - 0500 central European time (CET)) ozone values into account, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle at JFJ is characterized by a broad spring-summer maximum. This filter is believed to represent the lower free troposphere over the Alps and also shows a significant decrease in May ozone concentrations. It is suggested that the results may reflect ozone changes in the free troposphere over continental Europe...|$|R
40|$|Free OH {{species at}} the ice surface play an {{important}} role in ozone hole chemistry occurring on clouds surface. Photodecomposition of CFCl 3 on an ice surface grown on Ru(001) is studied in connection with the formation of chlorine reservoir in ozone hole chemistry. We have evidenced that the photolysis of CFCl 3 on the ice surface leaves anionic chlorine are coordinated to the free OH species. This enables high concentration storage of chlorine on the ice surface. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion above the Antarctic has been of particular interest because it has suffered extensive damage: this is well known “ozone hole”. 1) The ozone layer over the Antarctic becomes a catastrophically damaged in spring;in winter, however, the hole is closed. The theory that accounts for <b>seasonal</b> depletion of <b>ozone</b> considers thereservoirs. 2) Less reactive compounds such as HCl or ClONO 2 are considered as the reservoirs.

These seasonal variations change with latitude and altitude partly due to seasonal variation in transport and temperature, partly due to differences in the balance between photochemical production and loss processes, and partly due to differences in the relative importance of the various ozone loss processes. Comparisons of modeled <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> behavior with observations test the following: the seasonal dependence of dynamical processes where these dominate the <b>ozone</b> tendency; the <b>seasonal</b> dependence of photochemical processes in the upper stratosphere; and the seasonal change in the balance between photochemical and dynamical processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{high density}} of European surface ozone {{monitoring}} sites offers good opportunities forinvestigation {{of the regional}} ozone representativeness and for evaluation of chemistry climatemodels. In this thesis we analyze both aspects with close relation of one to another. As starting point we analyze ozone trends and the <b>seasonal</b> behavior of <b>ozone</b> concentrations atselected individual stations in different regions of Europe. At this step we are interested to find outhow the observed long-term trends in surface ozone concentrations are consistent across stations,and would the annual ozone behaviour give any distinctive patterns within Europe. The nextanalysis is extended to seasonal-diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>variations,</b> which appear as the main components ofozone time series and therefore allow to describe the ozone behavior more comprehensively. Theregional representativeness of European ozone measurements is investigated through a clusteranalysis (CA) of ozone air quality data from 1492 European surface monitoring stations (Airbasedatabase). K-means clustering is implemented for 3 sets of properties: (i) seasonal-diurnal variationsin absolute mixing ratio units, (ii) normalized seasonal-diurnal variations, and (iii) averaged andnormalized seasonal and diurnal variations. Each CA identifies different ozone pollution regimes,and each of them is compared with {{the output of the}} multi-year global reanalysis produced withinthe Monitoring of Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project. Recent methods for evaluation of global chemistry-climate models often provide only thecomparison of the simulated output mean to individual ozone observations or arbitrarily aggregatedsets of observations. This can give general information about the model biases for area, captured bysites, but does not help in the interpretation of these biases. Our CA approach yields useful information for the evaluation of numerical models, as it allows for apre-selection of stations and uses clusters as means to stratify the comparison with the respectivemodel output. Comparing the MACC data to cluster results allows to see whether the model is ableto capture specifics of each group and how well it describes the various ozone pollution regimes. The selected parameters for the investigation of ozone representativeness provide severalpossibilities to distinguish representative groups of ozone over Europe. Relying on the most stableconditions, there are 5 and 4 clusters which adequately describe the seasonal-diurnal ozoneEuropean patterns in case of absolute and normalized properties, respectively. Comparison of the model with observations for individual clusters reveal first of all differentoverestimation biases, and secondly differences mainly in <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> behavior. These biases aremostly driven by summertime ozone rather than wintertime, where ozone is generally wellpredicted. Such biases decrease from more polluted clusters to cleaner ones. Also the seasonal anddiurnal cycles are described better for clusters with relatively clean signatures. The best fit isobserved for clusters, which stations are influenced more by regional rather than local factors...|$|R
