40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the operational performance {{and cost of}} an integrated harvesting system that harvested <b>sawlogs</b> and biomass (i. e., energy wood chips) in stand conversion clearcut operations. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees were processed into <b>sawlogs</b> while whole trees of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), and sub-merchantable materials (small-diameter trees, tops and limbs) were fed directly into a chipper to produce biomass for energy production. A standard time study method {{was used to determine}} productivity and costs. Over 26 working days, the integrated system produced 1, 316 bone-dry metric tonnes (BDTs) of <b>sawlogs,</b> and 5, 415. 89 BDT of chips, with an average moisture content of 43. 2 %. Using the joint products allocation costing method, the costs of the integrated system were $ 29. 87 /BDT for biomass and $ 4. 26 /BDT for <b>sawlogs.</b> Chipping utilization was as low as 41 %, directly affecting production and cost of chipping operation. Single-lane, dirt, spur roads were the most costly road type to transport whole trees to a centralized processing site: transportation costs for biomass and <b>sawlogs</b> were increased by $ 0. 08 /BDT and $ 0. 02 /BDT, respectively, for every 50 meter increase in traveling distance. Diesel fuel price could raise total system cost for each product by $ 0. 78 /BDT and $ 0. 08 /BDT for each $ 0. 10 /liter increase...|$|R

The main aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the assortments supply structure (quality management), prices development for the coniferous <b>sawlogs</b> and to set the future prediction of this development in new global market conditions, which are affected mainly by the global climate changes. Price changes were analysed for the period of the years from 2000 to March 2016 for the spruce and fir <b>sawlogs.</b> Data about the volume supply of raw-wood assortments in Slovakia for years 2005 - 2014 were collected from “Green Reports“ published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic. From the influence factors in the studied period, the biggest impact was assigned to the global economic crisis. The prediction captures the further decline of prices of raw-wood assortments. In the second half of the year 2016 the price of <b>sawlogs</b> decreased by € 4 per 1 m 3.

50|$|Cut-to-length logging is {{the process}} of felling, delimbing, bucking, and sorting (pulpwood, <b>sawlog,</b> etc.) at the stump area, leaving limbs and tops in the forest.

This method is routinely available for trees up to 900 mm in diameter. Harvesters are employed effectively in level to moderately steep terrain. Harvesters are highly computerized to optimize cutting length, control harvesting area by GPS, and utilize price lists for each specific log to archive most economical results during harvesting.|$|E

40|$|This study compares two principally {{different}} harvesting systems {{used for}} the thinning of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] plantations in the Alps. The first system was whole-tree harvesting (WTH), producing only whole-tree chips for energy purposes. This system minimizes the production costs by simplifying the harvesting process. The other system was cut-to-length (CTL) mechanical harvesting with an excavator-based harvester. This system maximizes value recovery by producing both short <b>sawlogs</b> and quality fuel chips. Trials were conducted on two similar sites in the Dolomites, in northern Italy, and demonstrated that the CTL system resulted in slightly higher harvesting costs, and also higher revenue. The price differences between the different products determine which system offers the best economic results. If the delivered price of <b>sawlogs</b> does not exceed € 25 t- 1, WTH and CTL harvesting offer very similar economic performances, and become profitable only if the delivered price of raw chip wood exceeds € 40 t- 1. If the delivered price of <b>sawlogs</b> increases to € 50 t- 1, the mechanized CTL system always becomes preferable, and it will turn some profits {{when the price of}} raw biomass exceeds € 35 t- 1. The CTL system is less sensitive to long extraction and transport distances than the WTH system. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

50|$|Timber {{harvest in}} Southeast Alaska {{consisted}} of individual handlogging operations {{up until the}} 1950s, focusing on lowlying areas and beach fringe areas. In the 1950s, in part to aid in Japanese recovery from World War II, the Forest Service set up long-term contracts with two pulp mills: the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) and the Alaska Pulp Company. These contracts were scheduled to last 50 years, and originally intended to complement independent <b>sawlog</b> operations in the region. However, the two companies conspired to drive log prices down, put smaller logging operations out of business, and were major and recalcitrant polluters in their local areas.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} regional variation-in market characteristics and log quality for radiate pine sawlogs in New Zealand, {{which should be}} reflected in a corresponding variation in <b>sawlog</b> prices between regions. This thesis presents a study of log price variation for three broad categories of domestic sawlogs (P, S and L grades) in four wood supply regions in New Zealand (Central North Island, Nelson/Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago/Southland). A survey of log producers was used to gather data on log price and log quality data. The survey data covered the years 1997 - 1999. Additional information on regional <b>sawlog</b> market characteristics and firm characteristics was obtained from published sources, as well as directly from the firms covered in the survey. Differences between <b>sawlog</b> prices for the three <b>sawlog</b> grades were tested using ANOVA. <b>Sawlog</b> prices in the four regions {{were found to be}} significantly different. This result was consistent over the period 1997 - 99, and across all three <b>sawlog</b> grades. A hedonic price model was used to predict log prices that could be compared to actual prices. <b>Sawlog</b> physical attributes were used to calculate a single <b>sawlog</b> residual value, using programme SAWMOD and a spreadsheet developed by INTERFACE. The relationship between <b>sawlog</b> prices and physical log attributes was tested for significance by a regression that used residual value to predict saw log prices. The regressions were highly significant for both pruned and unpruned sawlogs For unpruned sawlogs, the <b>sawlog</b> residual value explained most of the variation in <b>sawlog</b> prices in the survey data. However, regional and firm factors also had a significant effect on prices. A regression using the four wood supply regions in the study, the size of the firm, the market knowledge of the firm, and whether the firm sold wood on the open market as additional explanatory variables, had an R-squared value of 96. 1 %. The estimated coefficients for the dummy variables denoting regions, and firms' market knowledge were statistically significant. Further research arising from this study could be undertaken into the degree to which firms are using log scanning and database technology to capture data on <b>sawlog</b> physical attributes. In addition, this study found no clear evidence of differences in the competitiveness of regional <b>sawlog</b> markets. A closer investigation of buyer and seller behaviour at the firm level, as well as the potential for outside firms to enter a regional <b>sawlog</b> market, may shed more light on this issue. Finally, the methods used by forestry consultants and forestry companies to estimate <b>sawlog</b> prices for valuation are usually not disclosed. Research into price estimation methods used by forestry firms may reveal the extent to which <b>sawlog</b> price estimates take account of regional and inter-firm differences in <b>sawlog</b> and market attributes...|$|E
