5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as <b>scarabaeiform,</b> more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), <b>scarabaeiform</b> (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E

50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include larder beetle, hide or leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are <b>scarabaeiform</b> and also have setae.|$|E
50|$|Symphrasinae larvae are {{sedentary}} parasitoids on bee, wasp or scarab beetle larvae. Larvae of the Calomantispinae are predators {{of small}} arthropods, and {{in at least}} one species they are mobile. Mantispinae have the most specialized larval development among all mantidflies studied to date (the life history of the Drepanicinae remains unknown): their campodeiform larvae seek out female spiders or their egg sacs which they then enter; the <b>scarabaeiform</b> larvae then feed on the spider eggs, draining egg contents through a piercing/sucking tube formed by modified mandibles and maxillae, pupating in the egg sac.|$|E

5000|$|Larvae {{have the}} typical <b>scarabaeiform</b> characteristics, C-shaped bodies {{generally}} a creamy white. They feed on {{roots in the}} soil, often deep beneath the host plant. Details of the larval stage are only known for some species; they have nine or more instars, and may take up to 13 years to mature. After a late summer pupation, adults of both sexes dig {{their way to the}} surface, emerging around the onset of the fall/winter rainy season typical of, for instance, California's climate; some species are active as late as early spring. Females have only vestigial wings, so the males fly around (often while it is raining), homing in on pheromones released by the females. They mate on the surface or in a burrow dug out by the female, then the female lays eggs {{in the bottom of the}} burrow. The [...] "triggering" [...] conditions required for some species to fly are so stringent that a given population may only be active for a single day in a given year. Males are commonly attracted to bright lights.|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the turmoil}} and vast {{changes in the}} {{classification}} of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea during the last 20 years, particularly in North America, {{we were asked to}} provide an update for the readers of Scarabs wherein we offer our perspectives. Much of what follows is extracted from our scarabaeoid introduction in American Beetles (Jameson and Ratcliffe 2002). By the time this overview is printed, there may have been more changes in the classification because of the rapidly accumulating evidence supporting new hypotheses. These rapid changes are a result of intensified study of the family groups using both traditional morphological evidence combined with increasingly insightful molecular studies. While possibly disruptive now, these new studies are exciting because, for the first time, we are establishing the higher classification of the Scarabaeoidea based on evidence and facts rather than intuition. This research confirms many of our hypotheses of classification but also clearly refutes others. Be on the lookout for future publications by Team Scarab and David Hawks! The superfamily Scarabaeoidea is a large, diverse, cosmopolitan group of beetles. As a personal aside (and, of course, with no bias), these are probably the finest beetles in the world. Scarabaeoids are adapted to most habitats, and they can be fungivores, herbivores, necrophages, coprophages, saprophages, and sometimes carnivores. They are widely distributed around the globe, even living in the Arctic in animal burrows. Some scarabs exhibit parental care and sociality. Some are myrmecophilous, termitophilous, or ectoparasitic. Many possess extravagant horns, others are able to roll into a compact ball, and still others are highly armored for inquiline life. A very few are occasionally agricultural pests that may destroy crops (even beetles have to eat!) while others are used in the biological control of dung and dung flies. Scarabaeoids are popular beetles due to their large size, bright colors, and interesting natural histories. Early Egyptians revered the scarab as a god, Jean-Henri Fabre studied their behavior, and Charles Darwin used observations of scarabs in his theory of sexual selection. What characterizes a scarabaeoid? The antennal club is lamellate, the prothorax is often highly modified for burrowing (with large coxae, usually with concealed trochantins and closed cavities), the protibia is usually dentate with a single spur, the wing venation is reduced and with a strong intrinsic spring mechanism for folding, tergite 8 forms a true pygidium and is not concealed by tergite 7, there are four Malpighian tubules, and larvae are <b>scarabaeiform</b> (cylindrical, cshaped) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Caurinus dectes Russell is a minute, {{brachypterous}} scorpionfly {{which was}} discovered at Marys Peak, Benton County, Oregon, in 1976, and subsequently {{described as the}} only representative of the subfamily Caurininae within the Boreidae (snow scorpionflies). Caurinus dectes is now known to range from the Olympic Peninsula and Northern Cascades in Washington, to northern Lane County, Oregon. The habitats of C. dectes include moist, forested sites with both coniferous and deciduous canopies. Larvae and adults {{have been found in}} bryophytes occurring as epiphytes, or on logs and stumps, and in terrestrial stands of mosses and liverworts. Feeding studies showed that both adults and larvae of Caurinus are specialized feeders on leafy liverworts (Jungermanniales). Twenty-five species of Jungermanniales in 15 genera were highly acceptable to adults, while 11 species in 10 genera were accepted slightly, if at all. Adults of C. dectes fed to some degree on two of four genera of the thalloid Metzgeriales, while liverworts of the Marchantiales and Anthocerotae were not accepted at all. Larval feeding preferences paralleled those of adults. The eggs of C. dectes are glued to the leaves of the host liverworts. Eggs hatch in spring, but some eggs may remain in diapause for a year or more. Larval feeding is within the shoot tissues, and is completed within 2 to 3 months of eclosion. There appear to be 3 larval instars. The fully grown larva constructs a silk-lined pupal cell within or under the substrate. The pupal molt occurs between July 1 and August 15, adult emergence is between September 1 and October 15. The major period of adult activity extends from eclosion to April. Mating and oviposition may occur through most of this period. There is evidence that some fraction of the adult population may perenniate. The univoltine life cycle, probable perenniation of adults, and extended egg diapause all are unusual within the Boreidae. The external morphology of larva and pupa, and internal and external morphology of adults are described. The larva is curculioniform, as compared with the <b>scarabaeiform</b> larvae of other Boreidae; the pupa is decticous and exarate. The most aberrant structures of adult Caurinus (cf. other Boreidae), the short rostrum and retractable postabdomen of the female, are probably adapted to the dorsoventral organization of the host liverworts. C. dectes is highly specialized, but a number of characters are primitive with respect to other boreids. These characters justify the recognition of Caurinus as the sister- group of all other boreids. Certain characters of C. dectes, including the free cerci of the female, support the view that the Boreidae are not closely related to other mecopteran families...|$|E
