In total, the film has over 400 visual effects shots. ILM was responsible only for creating a helicopter crash sequence in the film. Berg requested that the sequence be done by ILM, who had also worked on his previous film Battleship. Image Engine's effects work consisted mainly of set extensions and location enhancements; scenes were supplemented with computer-generated mountains, buildings and backgrounds, as well as muzzle flashes for firearms.

This distinction must be made as traditional 'tandem seals' can also utilize a pressurized barrier fluid.|$|R
40|$|The Saimaa {{ringed seal}} {{is one of}} the most {{endangered}} seals in the world. It is a symbol of Lake Saimaa and a lot of effort have been applied to save it. Traditional methods of seal monitoring include capturing the animals and installing sensors on their bodies. These invasive methods for identifying can be painful and affect the behavior of the animals. Automatic identification of seals using computer vision provides a more humane method for the monitoring. This Master's thesis focuses on automatic image-based identification of the Saimaa ringed seals. This consists of detection and segmentation of a seal in an image, analysis of its ring patterns, and identification of the detected <b>seal</b> <b>based</b> on the features of the ring patterns. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with a dataset of 131 individual <b>seals.</b> <b>Based</b> on the experiments with 363 images, 81 % of the images were successfully segmented automatically. Furthermore, a new approach for interactive identification of Saimaa ringed seals is proposed. The results of this research are a starting point for future research in the topic of seal photo-identification...|$|R

40|$|The Saimaa {{ringed seal}} is {{considered}} to be endangered and is facing a very high risk of extinction. he conservation efforts largely depend on the ability to track and monitor each individual seal. Photo-identification using camera traps has been successfully used for wildlife monitoring. Each seal has a unique fur pattern that a human expert can match to a specific seal labeled earlier. This thesis focuses on automatic identification of Saimaa ringed <b>seals</b> <b>based</b> on fur pattern extraction. This consists of segmentation of an image with the goal of extracting the seal, extraction of fur pattern from the segmented seal image and searching for the same seal in the seal database. Two methods of Saimaa ringed <b>seal</b> identification <b>based</b> on transfer learning are proposed in this work. The first method involves re-training of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN). The second method involves using the existing CNN trained for image classification as a means to extract features from seal images which are then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Both methods are implemented, tested and compared. Both approaches show good results with total accuracy of 91. 2 % for CNN and 90. 5 % for SVM...|$|R
