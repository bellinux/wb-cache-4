5|$|Of the season's {{fourteen}} tropical cyclones, thirteen {{became a}} tropical storm, and six of those strengthened into a hurricane. With no major hurricanes {{occurring in the}} following year, 1901 and 1902 were {{the first time that}} two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865. The fourth and eighth systems were the deadliest and most damaging storms of season. The fourth storm, known as the Louisiana hurricane, which left about $1million (1901USD) in damage and 10-15fatalities in Louisiana. In September, the eighth cyclone impacted some islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, including Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba.

5|$|While {{based in}} Newfoundland, Admiral Murray hosted {{a visit from}} the Free French Admiral Muselier. Acting on orders from the Admiralty, Murray gave Muselier {{temporary}} command of three French corvettes and a submarine that were assigned to Murray's fleet, for passage to Halifax. On return from Halifax, Muselier took the vessels to Vichy-controlled <b>Saint</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon,</b> and on 24 December 1941 raised the Free French flag on the islands. This was interpreted as a territorial claim on behalf of General Charles de Gaulle, thereby creating a diplomatic incident between France, Canada and the United States. De Gaulle's seizure of the archipelago was over the opposition of Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, which were concerned about pushing the Vichy government into an openly pro-German stance.|$|E
5|$|On September20, {{roughly one}} day prior to Igor's arrival in Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issued {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings for southern Newfoundland and the French territory of <b>Saint</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon.</b> The following day the CHC issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} eastern and northern coasts. Although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island, warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Early on September22, all advisories were discontinued as Igor {{moved away from the}} region. In response to the storm's arrival, schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at St. John's International Airport. Offshore, an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of Newfoundland on September19. In comparison to Hurricane Earl two weeks earlier, there was substantially less media attention given to Igor, attributed to the possibility of it going out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Ordered on 4 March 1858, Invincible {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Toulon on 1 May 1858, {{launched}} on 4 April 1861 and completed in March 1862. In September–October 1863, she conducted tactical trials with other ironclads. While assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship made a port visit in August 1865 to Brest where the fleet hosted the British Channel Fleet. As part of the festivities, Invincible put on a banquet for the midshipmen of both fleets that was reportedly the noisiest and most enjoyable of the visit. A few days later the French fleet made a reciprocal visit to Portsmouth where it was hosted by the Channel Fleet. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the ship was sent to defend the islands of <b>Saint</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon</b> from Prussian commerce raiders. Built of unseasoned timber, Invincible was in poor shape upon her return and was decommissioned. Condemned on 12 August 1872, the ship was scrapped in 1876 at Cherbourg.|$|E

5|$|Most {{populations are}} resident, but the {{northern}} and eastern populations are more migratory, relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May. Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer, and retracts in winter. They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands, particularly {{in the winter and}} spring, and occasionally to Iceland. Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in north-western Kazakhstan, the north Caspian, and the Tian Shan region of western China. They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan, and are winter vagrants to Lebanon, where they were first recorded in 1962. In Syria, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place. The soemmerringii subspecies occurs in south-central Siberia and extreme north-west China and is accidental to Hokkaido, Japan. A small number of western jackdaws reached the north-east of North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania. They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar, Mauritania, and <b>Saint</b> <b>Pierre</b> <b>and</b> <b>Miquelon,</b> and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt.|$|E
