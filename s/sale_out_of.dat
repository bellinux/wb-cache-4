60|$|It is {{therefore}} {{the very essence}} of Browning's genius, and {{the very essence of}} The Ring and the Book, that it should be the enormous multiplication of a small theme. It is the extreme of idle criticism to complain that the story is a current and sordid story, for the whole object of the poem is to show what infinities of spiritual good and evil a current and sordid story may contain. When once this is realised, it explains at one stroke the innumerable facts about the work. It explains, for example, Browning's detailed and picturesque account of the glorious dust-bin of odds and ends for <b>sale,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which he picked the printed record of the trial, and his insistence on its cheapness, its dustiness, its yellow leaves, and its crabbed Latin. The more soiled and dark and insignificant he can make the text appear, the better for his ample and gigantic sermon. It explains again the strictness with which Browning adhered to the facts of the forgotten intrigue. He was playing the game of seeing how much was really involved in one paltry fragment of fact. To have introduced large quantities of fiction would not have been sportsmanlike. The Ring and the Book therefore, to re-capitulate the view arrived at so far, is the typical epic of our age, because it expresses the richness of life by taking as a text a poor story. It pays to existence the highest of all possible compliments--the great compliment which monarchy paid to mankind--the compliment of selecting from it almost at random.|$|E

These include dōjinshi, dōjin music, dōjin anime, and dōjin games (even though the Touhou games themselves are dōjin games). The vast scope of Touhou derivatives prompted commentary, noting that Touhou Project became an unmissable aspect of Japanese consumer generated media. These dōjin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions {{on the use of}} his works. The major restrictions are on unauthorized commercial distribution (as opposed to dōjin) and the spoiling of endings; proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice is a recommendation. ZUN stated himself {{that he did not want}} the Touhou Project game series to be officially commercialized.The first recent publication of Touhou derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of Perfect Cherry Blossom; seven circles sold Touhou derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003.

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{tendency to}} overestimate probabilities of loss can affect a farmer’s participation in water markets. We examine this issue with a theoretical {{model of a}} non-expected utility maximizing farmer who places subjective weights on the actual probabilities of loss of water rights due to market transactions. The farmer bargains over sharing of surpluses with the buyer of water. The farmer then incorporates the bargaining outcome in his inter-temporal expected benefit maximization problem that accounts for the possible loss of water rights due to its <b>sale</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> agriculture. Three key results emerge. First, subjective weighting of probabilities leads to discounting of resources when farmers overestimate probabilities of loss. Second, if farmers have idiosyncratic time preferences, total water supply in the market {{would depend on the}} level of heterogeneity in the population. Third, considering the case for two farmers, we find that the farmer with lower endowments bears the burden of risk reduction, whereas the one with higher endowments sells more water for profits. As the level of risk increases, however, the relative difference in risk sharing declines...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of solar cells in Sweden, real estate companies have become interested in the possibility of installing solar panels when constructing new apartment buildings. Riksbyggen is one of these companies that sees solar energy as an interesting alternative when constructing energy-efficient buildings with low energy consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate optimal system solutions and the profitability of a PV-system in a newly produced apartment building containing 28 apartments in Västerås. This investigation is made possible by creating and simulating the PV-system in the simulation program PVSyst. The PV-system that will be installed on Brf. Sjökortet has an installed capacity of 54 kW. 40 kW will be placed on the roof with a tilt of 4 ° while 14 kW will be placed on the facade with a tilt of 90 °. According the simulation results, the PV-system will produce 43, 6 MWh per year, which means the specific electricity production becomes 807 kWh/kWp. Own use of solar electricity is estimated to be 61 %, which means that 26, 7 MWh will be utilized directly by the housing association, while 16, 9 MWh must be submitted for <b>sale.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the solar electricity that can be used directly 9, 9 MWh will cover the property electricity meanwhile the remaining 16, 8 MWh covers the residents household electricity. The residents of the housing cooperative will thus gain access to a large portion of the produced solar electricity without having to pay for it. The PV-system will without investment aid become unprofitable with an annuity of – 16 304 SEK per year. When the investment aid covering 35 % of the investment cost is included, the PV-system becomes profitable with an annuity of 2 687 SEK per year. The own use of solar electricity is difficult to improve by only changing the tilt of the solar panels. However, the results shows that a greater amount of solar electricity can be utilized by the housing cooperative in the winter months by increasing the amount of solar panels on the facade while decreasing the amount of solar panels on the roof with the same amount. A higher amount of solar panels on the facade will though decrease the yearly solar electricity production, making it more difficult for the PV-system to show profitability. The determined distribution of solar modules on the roof and facade is optimally distributed if the goal for the housing association is to utilize as much solar electricity as possible directly...|$|E
