40|$|Eccrine {{sweat glands}} in the mouse are found {{only on the}} footpads and, when mature, {{resemble}} human eccrine glands. Eccrine gland anlagen were first apparent at 16. 5 days postconception (DPC) in mouse embryos as small accumulations of cells in the mesenchymal tissue beneath the developing epidermis resembling hair follicle placodes. These cells extended into the dermis where significant cell organization, duct development, and evidence of the acrosyringium were observed in 6 - to 7 -postpartum day (PPD) mice. Mouse-specific keratin 1 (K 1) and 10 (K 10) expression was confined to the <b>strata</b> <b>spinosum</b> and granulosum. In 16. 5 and 18. 5 DPC embryos, K 14 and K 17 were both expressed in the stratum basale and diffusely in the gland anlagen. K 5 expression closely mimicked K 17 throughout gland development. K 6 expression was not observed in the developing glands of the embryo but was apparent in the luminal cell layer of the duct by 6 to 7 PPD. By 21 PPD, the gland apertures appeared as depressions in the surface surrounded by cornified squames, and the footpad surface lacked the organized ridge and crease system seen in human fingers.

40|$|Secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) encoded by 10 {{genes of}} Candida albicans are {{important}} virulence factors for {{different types of}} candidiasis. Distinct SAP genes have previously been shown to contribute to tissue damage in a model of oral candidiasis. In this study a progressive SAP expression in the order SAP 1 and SAP 2 >SAP 8 > SAP 6 > SAP 3 was observed in an in vitro model of cutaneous candidiasis based on reconstituted human epidermis. Transcripts of SAP 1 and SAP 2 were detected during initial invasion of the stratum corneum by C. albicans. Deeper, extensive penetration of the corneal layer was accompanied by additional SAP 8 mRNA. SAP 6 expression occurred concomitantly with germ tube formation and extensive hyphal growth in the <b>strata</b> granulosum, <b>spinosum,</b> and basale. Ultrastructural studies using specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the gene products of SAP 1 – 3 and SAP 4 – 6 revealed predominant expression of Sap 1 – 3.

500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, <b>stratum</b> <b>spinosum,</b> and stratum basale. [...] Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. [...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the <b>stratum</b> <b>spinosum</b> to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer {{to the top of}} the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.|$|E

40|$|Phorbol ester acetate was {{produced}} by the esterification of the free hydroxyl of phorbol ester C (the tumor promoting agent from croton oil). The phorbol ester acetate was used to promote skin tumors in female mice that had previously received a subcarcinogenic dosage of 7, 12 DMBA. The morphology of the tumor revealed an epidermal hyperplasia {{as well as a}} hyperkeratosis of the stratum corneum.

30|$|The {{sloughing}} of virally infected epidermal {{cells from}} a diseased turtle {{into the surrounding}} environment is considered a source of viral shedding. Thus FP tumors are suggested to undergo viral shedding, {{as evidenced by the}} presence of CFPHV-associated intranuclear viral inclusions within cells of the epidermal <b>strata</b> germinativum and <b>spinosum</b> of some cutaneous tumors (Jacobson et al. 1989; Jacobson et al. 1991; Lackovich et al. 1999). In one study, the high prevalence of CFPHV glycoprotein H antibodies in a green turtle population with 0 % tumor prevalence suggests that robust antibody responses to natural infection may develop independently of the appearance of cutaneous tumors (Herbst et al. 2008). Because CFPHV’s primary target seems to be skin, early or latent infection may be represented by the presence of CFPHV DNA in non-tumored skin from turtles with and without tumors (Quackenbush et al. 2001). There is one report of CFPHV polymerase DNA identified in differentiated epidermal and dermal tissues of tumors sampled from green turtles (Work et al. 2009). To date, however, there are no previous reports using the microanatomic location of CFPHV DNA to investigate potential viral shedding from the skin of “normal” turtles (i.e., turtles that do not have tumors). In the present study, application of an innovative technique, laser capture microdissection, permits a precise way to begin assessing the role that cell type plays in disease processes.|$|R

A 3 H- 15 -HETE co-eluting peak selectively occurred in chromatograms obtained from supernatants of fractions containing basal cells. Supernatants of freshly prepared suspensions rich in basal keratinocytes appeared to contain 3 H- 15 -HETE as their main 3 H-AA metabolite, by far exceeding the recovered amounts of 3 H- 12 -HETE. Moreover, keratinocytes cultured for 1 week or longer were found to produce predominantly a 3 H-AA metabolite co-eluting with 3 H- 15 -HETE. In supernatants of cultured cells, little if any 3 H- 12 -HETE was detectable. Cultured human skin fibroblasts were not found to produce relevant amounts of HETE. Genuine tissue rich in basal cells, i. e., cells of hair follicles, were found to form twice as much 3 H- 15 -HETE as 3 H- 12 -HETE (3 H- 15 -HETE/ 3 H- 12 -HETE-ratio = 1. 9 ± 0. 8; n = 7). Apparently, different epidermal layers are able to produce a characteristic pattern of 3 H-AA metabolites. 3 H- 15 -HETE generation {{seems to be a}} marker for proliferating keratinocytes, whereas 3 H- 12 -HETE formation appears to be typical for differentiating suprabasal epidermal cells.

40|$|Cutaneous nerves may {{regulate}} {{the immune system}} and be involved in inflammatory events of the skin. Prurigo nodularis is a skin disease which histologically reveals a massive neural hyperplasia and a local inflammation in the lesional skin. The aim of the thesis is to study normal cutaneous nerves and changes in such nerve fibers in the mechanism of the cutaneous inflammation of prurigo nodularis, by the investigation of certain bioactive substances and their receptors in nerve fibers, and other cells, of normal and diseased skin. The intraepidermal nerves of normal adult human skin were demonstrated by protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) immunoreactivity. The free nerve endings distributed in the <b>strata</b> basale, <b>spinosum</b> and granulosum, appeared as thin and varicose fibers, and branched straight or bent. They existed at every site of the human body, including the face, trunk and extremities, with different densities. The low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p 75 NGFr) immunoreactivity was found mainly in the peripheral part of cutaneous nerve trunks and fibers, whereas the neuron-specific enolase immunoreactivity was mainly seen within the axons. Ultrastructurally, the Schwann cell membrane was strongly p 75 NGFr-immunoreactive (IR). The Schwann cell membrane facing the connective tissue was more strongly p 75 NGFr-IR than that close to the axon. However, the axon seldom showed any such immunoreactivity. For the prurigo nodularis lesional skin, the distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), peptide histidine isoleucine amide (PHI), peptide histidine methionine (PHM), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), p 75 NGFr and PGP 9. 5, was investigated. In summary, the CGRP, p 75 NGFr- and PGP 9. 5 -IR structures in prurigo nodularis were stronger and more densely present than in the controls. Regarding NPY, PHI, PHM and VIP, there were no differences found between patient and control groups. The galanin, and SP staining was very weak. Ultrastructurally, a lot of nerve fibers were found clustered together in the dermal tissue. The axons were enlarged and seldom showed any NGFr immunoreactivity. The Schwann cell membrane showed a strong p 75 NGFr immunoreactivity. The Schwann cell bodies were extended and irregularly shaped, and tended to separate into many branches en-wrapping the axons. The perineurium cells also revealed a strong p 75 NGFr immunoreactivity. The Schwann cells inside the perineurium were less p 75 NGFr-IR than those outside of the perineurium. In histamine and NGFr double-staining, mast cells were seen in close vicinity to NGFr-positive nerves and sometimes seemingly to contact single nerve fiber. The histamine-containing mast cell number was significantly increased in the lesional dermis. At the ultrastructural level, the mast cell bodies become larger, having more abundant cytoplasm and mitochondria, but comparatively fewer characteristic granules. The mast cells were also frequently seen to contact other cell types and a mast cell infiltration into the epidermis was also found. Mast cells were often observed to sprout long dendrites, with or without granules. By a human histocompatibility complex class II (subregion DR) (HLA-DR) and protein S- 100 (S- 100) double-staining, dermal HLA-DR- and S- 100 -IR cells were shown to apparently be more numerous than in the controls. In the involved skin there were also more S- 100 -IR coarse nerve fibres in the dermis as compared to controls. By eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin/eosinophil protein X (EDN/EPX) labeling on lesional skin, the eosinophils were significantly increased in number compared to the uninvolved skin and the normal skin. By ECP and PGP 9. 5 double-labelling, the PGP 9. 5 -IR nerves were found increased in the areas where there were increased numbers of eosinophils. The nerves were in close vicinity to eosinophils, and occasionally contacted each other. By ultrastructural immunogold labelling, CGRP immunoreactivity was demonstrated to be increased in the dense-core vesicles of the axons of lesional skin, the axons which contain CGRP were more enlarged and had more dense-core vesicles than the axons which did not contained CGRP. By CGRP and tryptase (or ECP) double-labelling, the tryptase-containing mast cells and ECP-containing eosinophils were found to be increased in the lesional skin at locations where CGRP-containing nerve fibers were increased as well. The studies in the thesis indicate that normal intraepidermal nerve terminals may have area-specific functions. The cutaneous nerves are maintained and regulated by the surrounding Schwann cells, which mainly express p 75 NGFr. In prurigo nodularis, the over-expression of p 75 NGFr in Schwann cells and the perineurium cells could contribute to the neurohyperplasia. The increased CGRP- or p 75 NGFr-IR nerve fibers may interact with inflammatory cells, e. g. mast cells, eosinophils and the Langerhans cells, which might make the disease persist and result in strong pruritus...|$|R
