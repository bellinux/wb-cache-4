40|$|Processes of {{formation}} of debris fan {{at the mouth}} of the mountain stream are experimentallyand theoretically studied. Two different types of processes - I. e., debris flow deposit and <b>sieve</b> <b>deposit,</b> are defined andeach process is carefully measured on a laboratory flume. Methods to predict the areas of depo-sition and the forms of debris fans due to either mechanism of deposition are proposed and verified...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the comprehensive detection of numerous volatile molecules based on the olfactory information constructed by using olfaction-inspired sensor technology. The sensor system can simultaneously detect multiple odors by the separation and condensation ability of molecularly imprinted filtering adsorbents (MIFAs), where a MIP filter with a molecular <b>sieve</b> was <b>deposited</b> on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The adsorption properties of MIFAs were evaluated using the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrated that the system embedded with MIFAs possesses high sensitivity and specific selectivity. The digitization and comprehensive classification of odors were accomplished by using artificial odor maps constructed through this system...|$|R
40|$|In arid areas, the {{physical}} weathering {{is considered the}} main effect on formation of soil layers. Arar’s city is the main city of Northern Border Region (NBR) at the north part of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In general, many Wadis and Sha’ibs are surrounded Arar’s city. According to the urban development of Arar’s city, the knowledge about underlying soil properties is strongly required. Wadis and Sha’ibs deposit were formed {{as a result of}} the water flow and wind movement in the surrounding arid areas. The top deposits of Wadis and Sha’ibs are mature <b>deposits.</b> <b>Sieve</b> analysis tests were carried out on soil deposit samples of many deposit locations around Arar’s city. The results show that the natural soil deposits are classified intosilty sand (SM) as unified soil classification system (USCS). Also, the average contents of coarse and fine grains are 70 % and 30 % respectively. Comparing of course grains distribution of the studied areas, it was found that th...|$|R
40|$|The {{power of}} {{explosive}} volcanic eruptions {{is reflected in}} the grain size distribution and dispersal of their pyroclastic deposits. Grain size also forms part of lithofacies characteristics that are necessary to determine transport and depositional mechanisms responsible for producing pyroclastic deposits. However, the common process of welding and rock lithification prevents quantification of grain size by traditional <b>sieving</b> methods for <b>deposits</b> in the rock record. Here we show that functional stereology can be used to obtain actual 3 D volume fractions of clast populations from 2 D cross-sectional images. Tests made on artificially consolidated rocks demonstrate successful correlations with traditional sieving method. We show that the true grain size distribution is finer grained than its representation on a random 2 D section. Our method allows the original size of vesicular pumice clasts to be estimated from their compacted shapes. We anticipate that the original grain-size distribution of welded ignimbrites can also be characterized by this method. Our method using functional stereology can be universally applied to any type of consolidated, weakly to non-deformed clastic material, regardless of grain size or age and therefore has a wide application in geology...|$|R
40|$|The panel {{bed filter}} (PBF) is a {{granular}} filter patented by A. M. Squires {{in the late}} sixties. PBFs consist of louvers with stationary, granular beds. Dust is deposited in the top layers and on the bed surface when gas flows through. PBFs are resistant to high temperatures, variations in the gas flow and hot particles. The filter is cleaned by releasing a pressure pulse {{in the opposite direction}} of the bulk flow (a puff back pulse). A new louver geometry patented by A. M. Squires is the filter tray louvers. The new design is believed to reduce the pressure drop and the number of louvers, and to make the filter more compact. We have designed and built a laboratory scale PBF with filter tray louvers based on the patent. Experiments with the prototype show that the new louver can be cleaned with a puff back pulse. A PBF system for a hypothetical biomass combustion plant has been designed. The heat from the flue gas will be used for district heating. The proposed PBF system design consists of double-sided modules with 46 filter tray louvers on top of each other. Five modules are mounted together in module columns, sharing the same clean gas duct and puff back pipe. The granular medium chosen is Sintered Bauxite 20 / 40 (SB). The module columns are placed in an enveloping house. SB and dust fall into bins {{in the bottom of the}} enveloping house during puff back cleaning. A vacuum pneumatic conveying system brings the dust and SB to the top of the filter. Dust and SB are separated in a <b>sieve.</b> Dust is <b>deposited,</b> and SB is transported back to the modules. NTNU is currently involved in the BioSOFC project. The objective of this project is to increase efficiency in energy production from biomass by using producer gas from a biomass gasification plant in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Field tests will be performed at a plant in Güssing, Austria. A PBF will be used for gas filtration. The operating temperature will be 500 °C to avoid tar condensation. We have performed heating experiments on the BioSOFC filter system. The results were not satisfactory, as the temperature in the filter ranged from 384 to 625 °C. The filter system was due to be shipped, and new tests could not be performed. This work proposes that modifications to the heating cable circuits are made, and new heating tests are performed before the field testing. </p...|$|R
