25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand <b>soaps,</b> face <b>cleansers,</b> and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|R

We present {{the case of an}} 18 -year-old woman with a 2 -month history of progressive brown verrucous plaque in her face. Our first impression was seborrheic dermatitis and she was treated with facial <b>cleanser</b> <b>soap</b> and topic hydrocortisone 1 %. One month later, she arrived with new lesions. Because of this our diagnosis changed to Darier's disease versus seborrheic pemphigus versus foliaceus pemphigus. Histopathology and immunofluorescence studies were compatible with seborrheic dermatitis. The patient complained of depression and social withdrawal and denied facial cleansing. Facial cleansing was performed during consultation presenting resolution of the lesions, which confirmed the diagnosis of dermatosis neglecta. Dermatosis neglecta is a disease that can be frequently misdiagnosed, since it has many differential diagnoses, such as hyperkeratotic syndromes. It should be recognized early and aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic methods should be avoided...|$|R

30|$|A. vera {{has been}} used for many centuries for its {{curative}} and therapeutic properties, and although over 75 active ingredients from the inner gel have been identified, therapeutic effects have not been correlated well with each individual component [3]. Many of the medicinal effects of aloe leaf extracts have been attributed to the polysaccharides found in the inner leaf parenchymatous tissue [4, 5], but it is believed that these biological activities should be assigned to a synergistic action of the compounds contained therein rather than a single chemical substance [6]. A. vera is the most commercialized aloe species, and processing of the leaf pulp has become a large worldwide industry. In the food industry, it {{has been used}} as a source of functional foods and as an ingredient in other food products, for the production of gel-containing health drinks and beverages. In the cosmetic and toiletry industry, it has been used as base material for the production of creams, lotions, <b>soaps,</b> shampoos, facial <b>cleansers,</b> and other products. In the pharmaceutical industry, it {{has been used for}} the manufacture of topical products such as ointments and gel preparations, as well as in the production of tablets and capsules [7, 8]. Important pharmaceutical properties that have recently been discovered for both the A. vera gel and whole leaf extract include the ability to improve the bioavailability of co-administered vitamins in human subjects [9]. Due to its absorption enhancing effects, A. vera gel may be employed to effectively deliver poorly absorbable drugs through the oral route of drug administration. Furthermore, the dried powder obtained from A. vera gel was successfully used to manufacture directly compressible matrix-type tablets. These matrix-type tablets slowly released a model compound over an extended period of time and thereby showing potential to be used as an excipient in modified release dosage forms [10].|$|R

[...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners would {{have to go through a}} metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks. Many prisoners have compared their duration at Alcatraz to hell and would have preferred death to continued incarceration.|$|R
