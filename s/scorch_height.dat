50|$|As one {{of their}} {{responses}} to frequent bushfires which would destroy most other plants, many Eucalypt trees found widely throughout Australia have extensive epicormic buds which sprout following a fire, allowing the vegetative regeneration of branches from their trunks. These epicormic buds are highly protected, set deeper beneath the thick bark than in other tree species, allowing both the buds and vascular cambium to be insulated from the intense heat. It should however be noted that not all eucalypt trees possess this means of vegetative recovery, {{and the ability of}} a tree to survive and re-sprout depends on many factors, such as fire intensity, <b>scorch</b> <b>height,</b> and tree height, species, age, and size. Jarrah trees, found in the south-west of Western Australia, have epicormic buds which are activated after a bushfire or other extreme conditions.|$|E

30|$|There was {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between char and scorch heights in the LDS, mostly because {{of the influence of}} very high values of <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> and because there is much less charred material to assess in the lower severity char heights in the EDS. Burned area and severity were strongly correlated in the EDS, with 70 % of burned area explained by mean <b>scorch</b> <b>height.</b> In the LDS, the percentage burned was very high (close to 100 %) across a wide range of <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> values, which explains the weak relationship between the two variables. There is an improvement in the relationship between these variables with spatial aggregation, given that variance is reduced by data smoothing. By aggregating the data (initially collected every 50 m) up to 200 m, disparate observations are diluted, confirming the scale dependence of this relationship.|$|E

30|$|Understanding fine-scale fire patchiness has {{significant}} implications for ecological processes and biodiversity conservation. It can affect local extinction of and recolonisation by relatively immobile fauna and poorly seed-dispersed flora in fire-affected areas. This study assesses fine-scale fire patchiness and severity, and associated implications for biodiversity, in north Australian tropical savanna systems. We used line transects to sample burning patterns of ground layer vegetation in different seasons and vegetation structure types, within {{the perimeter of}} 35 fires that occurred between 2009 and 2011. We evaluated two main fire characteristics: patchiness (patch density and mean patch length) and severity (inferred from char and <b>scorch</b> <b>heights,</b> and char and ash proportions). The mean burned area of ground vegetation was 83 % in the early dry season (EDS: May to July) and 93 % in the late dry season (LDS: August to November). LDS fires were less patchy (smaller and fewer unburned patches), and had higher fire severity (higher mean char and <b>scorch</b> <b>heights,</b> and twice the proportion of ash) than EDS fires. Fire patchiness varied among vegetation types, declining under more open canopy structure. The relationship between burned area and fire severity depended on season, being strongly correlated in the EDS and uncorrelated in the LDS. Simulations performed to understand the implications of patchiness on the population dynamics of fire-interval sensitive plant species showed that small amounts of patchiness substantially enhance survival. Our {{results indicate that the}} ecological impacts of high frequency fires on fire-sensitive regional biodiversity elements are likely to be lower than has been predicted from remotely sensed studies that are based on assumptions of homogeneous burning.|$|R
30|$|Experimental plots (10  m[*]×[*] 10  m) {{were located}} within six {{experimental}} blocks (16  m[*]×[*] 55  m), each block containing one replicate of each burn treatment. Burn treatments {{were randomly assigned}} to the four plots within each block. A 3  m fire break around each experimental block protected it from external wildfire and experimental burns. Fire breaks were created by cutting Sorghum spp. during the wet season (February) and then burning the breaks once the Sorghum spp. had dried (March). Experimental plots were ignited on the downwind edge using a drip torch prior to the upwind edge to provide a fire break of > 2  m. Fire intensity was estimated using standard indices for northern Australian savannas based on <b>scorch</b> <b>heights</b> (Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006).|$|R
30|$|Regression {{analysis}} of fire severity metrics. Regression {{analysis was used}} to assess the existence of a relationship between fire severity and percentage area burned. Char and scorch heights were used as indicators of fire severity, because they are strongly related to fire intensity in northern Australia (Williams et al. 2003), and with fire severity (Keeley 2009, Edwards et al. 2013). Specifically, regression analyses were performed for char height vs. <b>scorch</b> <b>height,</b> char height vs. percentage burned, and <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> vs. percentage burned. The initial char and <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> data, collected every 50 m, were aggregated at different levels (100 m, 150 m, and 200 m) to assess the effects of spatial scale. The highest level of aggregation was kept at 200 m in order to not eliminate data, since several transect units were around 200 m in length.|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: Understanding fire {{ecology of}} main forest species is {{essential}} for a sound, scientifically based on managing of wildlands and also to assess likely implications due to changes in fire regime under a global change scenario. Few references can be found about fire ecology of Pinus uncinata Ram. (PU). PU species grows in the Central Pyrenees where large, severe wildland fires did not occur frequently in the past. However, several fires with extreme fire behavior have affected PU stands in last years and they might disturb other PU forest in the future. Area of study : Cabdella fire (February 2012), in Lleida province, {{is one of the}} several wildland fires occurred in 2012 (winter season) in the Central Pyrenees. Fire affected a large PU plantation (102 ha) located at 1. 800 - 2, 100 meters above the sea. Material and methods : We have analyzed first order fire effects in three fireline intensity thresholds along three years in terms of mortality ratio, <b>scorched</b> <b>height,</b> percentage of <b>scorched</b> crown volume and bark char height. Main results : PU seems to be a very tolerant species to low and medium fire line intensity but fire effects were very significant when fire line intensity was high. In medium fireline intensity sites, probability of mortality ranged from 15 to 30 % and the dead trees had the highest values on <b>scorched</b> <b>height</b> and percentage of scorched crown volume. Research highlights : Results from this work supports that prescribed burning might be used to efficiently decrease fuel load and fuel vertical continuity while avoiding considerable PU mortality. It also displayed that when fuel management has been implemented, PU mortality might be limited even under extreme fire behavior. Abbreviations used : PU: Pinus uncinata Ram. </p...|$|R
30|$|Comparison of burned transects by {{season and}} {{vegetation}} structure type. When considering the partitioned transects by vegetation type, the same overall seasonal trends described for fire transects by season were observed (Appendix 2). Burned area was also {{lowest in the}} EDS, and unburned patch density and mean unburned patch length were highest in the EDS, for almost all vegetation types. Open woodlands were the most extensively burned vegetation type and sandstone woodlands the least. Mean char and <b>scorch</b> <b>heights</b> were highest in open woodlands in the EDS, and in woodlands in the LDS. Unburned patch density was highest in sandstone heaths and lowest in open woodlands.

30|$|Forney Ridge Fire—April 6 to 27, 1998, 149.7 ha (370 ac). The first {{official}} WFU {{fire in the}} park burned in mesic, old-growth, oak-dominated communities and generally stopped upon reaching tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and red maple (Acer rubrum) dominated communities. Fire burned predominantly through the litter layer and persisted through downed logs and stump holes. Along the west flank of the fire there were short up-slope head fires in shrub-dominated communities, with <b>scorch</b> <b>heights</b> of up to 2 m (6.6 ft) on the mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). The fire area received light rain on April 9, 1.3 cm (0.5 in) of snow on April 10, and several centimeters of rain from April 18 to 20. The majority of fire growth occurred {{in the first three}} days of the fire. By April 13, there was no growth in fire size although smoldering continued within the burn.|$|R
30|$|The {{reason that}} the Ryan and Amman {{mortality}} model is so widely applied is due to its simplicity. Only two inputs are required to run the model: bark thickness and percent crown volume scorched. Bark thickness {{is used as a}} measure of thermal resistance to the cambium in the tree stem (Butler and Dickinson 2010) and is calculated from species-specific coefficients and diameter at breast height (1.37 m above ground; DBH). Bark thickness coefficients are included for 219 species, allowing prediction of fire-induced tree mortality for most forest species in the US. Crown volume scorch is calculated from either flame length or <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> and crown characteristics. In FOFEM, the user must also enter tree height and live crown ratio, which is then used to calculate live crown length and crown base height, and convert crown length scorched to crown volume scorched (Reinhardt et al. 1997). This series of nested models allows mortality prediction for any tree for which bark thickness, tree height, crown ratio, and <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> are known. The FOFEM graphics option allows easy visualization of general thresholds at which the chance that a tree will die from fire for a given flame length or <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> begins to sharply increase along the predicted mortality response curvet. Thus, FOFEM can be used for pre-fire planning purposes to develop burn prescriptions that help meet specific tree-mortality related objectives. For example, burn objectives often include acceptable limits to mortality of trees over a specific DBH, or targets to kill a proportion of the smaller-diameter trees that can act as ladder fuels (Ryan et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|Fire {{behaviour}} can {{be described}} in such terms as rate of forward spread, flame height, <b>scorch</b> <b>height,</b> ground fire, crown fire, and so on. A fire may be described as “cool” or “hot” or of “low intensity” or “high intensity.” These are purely qualitative expressions and in no way indicate the damage potential of a fire. If a measure of fuel quantity was introduced, rate of spread would be the most adequate of the above descriptions.|$|E
30|$|Rather, {{seasonality}} {{of burning}} {{has been used}} generally as a surrogate of intensity and severity given strong empirical relationships derived from experimental fire studies that show that fires in the EDS typically are substantially less intense than those later in the dry season (Williams et al. 1998, Russell-Smith et al. 2003 b). These findings have been reinforced {{in a recent study}} where ten years of photo and associated data records from an extensive fire and vegetation effects monitoring program established in two large north Australian National Parks were used to explore relationships between seasonality and fire severity in a variety of different landform and vegetation types (Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006). Using a three-tiered fire severity scale (low severity—leaf <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> < 2 m; moderate severity—leaf <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> > 2 m, but mid-canopy only scorched; high severity—canopy scorched), data for 719 fires recorded from 178 plots over the period 1995 – 2004 indicated that the great majority of early dry season fires were of very low severity (fire-line intensities ≪ 1, 000 kW m− 1), whereas fires later in the dry season were typically of substantially greater severity. Similar trends were evident for vegetation occupying all landform types.|$|E
30|$|Our {{sampling}} design is factorial and unbalanced. Representative fragments of recently burned {{areas in the}} Northern Territory in May to July and August to November for the years 2009 to 2011 form our population. Experimental units are the fragments that were intersected by our 68 transects of haphazard starting points and directions. Two treatments were “applied” to each fragment: the season, which {{was determined by the}} moment when the fire occurred; and the vegetation type, which was determined by the existent vegetation type prior to fire. Since transects are sufficiently separated in time and space, we consider that those treatments were independently applied to each fragment. The number of replicates is not constant for all combinations of season and vegetation type, so the {{sampling design}} is unbalanced. Observational units are either footfall recordings (burned or unburned, surface cover) or 50 -step recordings (char and <b>scorch</b> <b>heights).</b> For each variable, those repeated measures were averaged for each fragment, to obtain the corresponding experimental unit value.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{imply that}} forest {{conditions}} {{before and after}} burning have {{a high degree of}} small, patch scale spatial heterogeneity. Knapp and Keeley (2006) also found evidence for high patch scale heterogeneity in fire severity, as measured by <b>scorch</b> <b>heights</b> and area burned, which they attributed to variation in topography, fuel characteristics and forest structure (including pre-burn species composition), and sometimes, as in our study, season of burning. Higher fuel moistures in early season burns likely inhibit effective fuel continuity, thereby increasing small scale differences in fire severity. High patch scale heterogeneity is similar to the high levels of heterogeneity in fire severity commonly observed at the landscape scale in the Sierra Nevada (Collins et al. 2007) and in other forest systems (e.g., Turner et al. 1994). We suspect that small scale heterogeneity is a general feature of fire effects, particularly in forest types that burn at low to moderate intensity (in contrast to crown fire systems that may have lower patch scale heterogeneity [Turner and Romme 1994]).|$|R
40|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{has increased}} fuel loads and fuel continuity in mixed-conifer ecosystems, resulting in forest structures that {{are vulnerable to}} catastrophic fire. This paper models fire behaviour in a mixed-conifer forest and investigates how silvicultural and fuels treatments affect potential fire behaviour. The computer program FARSITE was used to spatially and temporally model fire growth and behaviour. Fire modelling was performed in the North Crane Creek watershed of Yosemite National Park. Treatments were simulated by adjusting fuel (total load, load-by-size class, depth.) height-to-live crown base, tree height, and crown density parameters. Treatments modeled included prescribed burn, pile and burn, cut and scatter, thinning and biomass, thinning and biomass followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection harvest with and without slash and landscape-level fuel treatment. The prescribed burn, thinning and biomassing followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection with slash and landscape fuel treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline intensities, heat per unit area, rate of spread, area burned, and <b>scorch</b> <b>heights.</b> Cut and scatter, salvage or group selection treatments that do not treat slash fuels resulted in fire behaviour that is more extreme than the untreated forest. Restoration of mixed-conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Combinations of prescribed fire and/or mechanical treatments {{can be used to}} reduce wildfire hazard...|$|R
30|$|In this study, <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> {{was found}} to be a better {{surrogate}} of fire severity than char height, being better related to percentage area burned than char height. Some authors recommend that measurements of fire severity should be restricted to measures of organic matter loss, such as canopy scorch or ash deposition (e.g., Keeley 2009), which is potentially what one is measuring with <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> in tropical savanna habitats dominated with ground fires, given little or no canopy fire spread. Char height may not always be closely correlated with flame length (and thus, fire severity), given localized variation in wind and variation in the size and moisture content of leaves (Williams et al. 2003), but also due to the paucity of vegetation between ground and upper strata. White ash is also an important indicator of fire severity (Edwards et al. 2013). It has been positively correlated with fire intensity and represents near-complete combustion of the available fuel, offering little protection to the soil from rainfall and, therefore, erosion (Roy et al. 2010). The increased percentage of ash in the LDS (twice as high) confirms the greater severity of the LDS fires. Charred vegetation is typically conspicuous in the EDS, associated with variable, low severity fires.|$|E
3000|$|The {{effect of}} fire {{intensity}} on the efficacy or the raking treatment was investigated using mixed effects logistic regression. Fire intensity {{is defined as}} “the energy released during various phases of the fire” (Keeley 2009), and crown scorch is a commonly used proxy for fire intensity (Van Wagner 1973, Williams et al. 1998, Twidwell et al. 2009). We used percent crown volume scorched instead of maximum crown <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> or relative <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> as our measure of fire intensity because it {{is viewed as a}} more accurate assessment of crown scorch (Peterson 1985, Twidwell et al. 2009). The effect of fire intensity on raking treatment efficacy was tested by including an interaction between raking and fire intensity category in a GLMM model. Low intensity was defined as trees with crowns that were not scorched (n = 172), moderate intensity was defined as trees with percent crown volume scorched between 1 % and 80 % (n = 181), and high intensity was defined as trees with a percent crown volume scorched > 80 % (n = 104). A crown scorch value of 80 % was chosen for the high intensity cutoff because this is within the range (75 % to 90 %) often cited as causing death in conifers (McHugh and Kolb 2003, Fowler et al. 2010 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Structural {{heterogeneity}} in {{forests of}} the Sierra Nevada was historically produced through variation in fire regimes and local environmental factors. The amount of heterogeneity that prescription burning can achieve might now be more limited owing to high fuel loads and increased fuel continuity. Topography, woody fuel loading, and vegetative composition were quantified in plots within replicated early and late season burn units. Two indices of fire severity were evaluated in the same plots after the burns. <b>Scorch</b> <b>height</b> ranged from 2. 8 to 25. 4 m in early season plots and 3. 1 to 38. 5 m in late season plots, whereas percentage of ground surface burned ranged from 24 to 96 % in early season plots and from 47 to 100 % in late season plots. <b>Scorch</b> <b>height</b> was greatest in areas with steeper slopes, higher basal area of live trees, high percentage of basal area composed of pine, and more small woody fuel. Percentage of area burned was greatest in areas with less bare ground and rock cover (more fuel continuity), steeper slopes, and units burned in the fall (lower fuel moisture). Thus topographic and biotic factors still contribute to the abundant heterogeneity in fire severity with prescribed burning, even under the current high fuel loading conditions. Burning areas with high fuel loads in early season when fuels are moister may lead to patterns of heterogeneity in fire effects that more closely approximate the expected patchiness of historical fires...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of canopy fuel characteristics in five different forest types provided a unique dataset for simulating the effects of various stand manipulation treatments on canopy fuels. Low thinning, low thinning with commercial dbh limit, and crown thinning had similar effects on canopy bulk density (CBD) and canopy fuel load (CFL), but only the strict low thinning significantly affected canopy base height (CBH). In four of five sampled stands, CBD and CFL responded linearly to increasing treatment intensity in those three thinning treatments. The ponderosa-pine/Douglas-fir stand, with its significant understory component, showed little change in CBD with the commercial limit and crown thinning treatments. The diameterlimit harvest exhibited little consistency among sites and, hence, {{it is not a}} good silvicultural tool for creating canopy fuel reduction prescriptions. Due to fire-induced mortality, crown scorch (from prescribed fire) was more effective than mechanical pruning (to an equivalent height) at modifying canopy fuel characteristics. At achievable <b>scorch</b> and pruning <b>heights,</b> neither treatment had a significant effect on CBD or CFL...|$|R
30|$|Past {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} foliar moisture on ignition (e.g., Van Wagner 1967, Quintilio 1977, Fuglem and Murphy 1979) or a time-temperature relationship to ignition (Stockstad 1975, Bunting et al. 1983, Xanthopoulos and Wakimoto 1993, Dimitrakopoulos and Papaioannou 2001). Clear patterns of tanoak foliage consumption were revealed by this experiment. Consumption of living foliage (foliar moisture content = 70 % and 80 %) declined rapidly with height, demonstrating a clear threshold at 0.75 m (near the flame height), above which only minimal consumption (∼ 1 %) was observed (Figure 2). Living foliage was often heavily <b>scorched</b> at this <b>height,</b> but the leaves failed to ignite. What minimal weight loss that did occur was likely dehydration and not dry matter consumption. Dead foliage (foliar moisture content = 5 % and 9 %) consumption diminished at a slower rate as height increased, showing a greater threshold at 1.25 m, above which mass loss was minimal (∼ 3 %; also likely dehydration losses). Dead foliage at the 1.5 m height did not ignite. The differences observed between living and dead foliage suggest that, as foliar moisture content drops to low values, the relative effect on crown ignition is magnified. Whether the changes wrought by disease affect only moisture and not other foliar chemistry (Jolly et al. 2012 a) or physical characteristics is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Following the Star Fire, 287 trees {{greater than}} or equal to 75 cm {{diameter}} at breast height (DBH), were tracked for post-fire mortality. The Star Fire, located in the western Sierra Nevada, burned mostly at low to moderate intensity during late summer of 2001. The mixed conifer forest was dominated by Psuedotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Abies concolor (white fir), Pinus labertiana (sugar pine), and Libocedrus decurrens (incense cedar). Several Pinus jeffreyi (Jeffrey pine) and P. ponderosa (ponderosa pine) were also sampled. Trees were measured for crown length, <b>height</b> of crown <b>scorch,</b> live crown <b>height,</b> and bole <b>scorch</b> within several weeks of the fire in the fall 2001. Species, DBH, and location of each tree were recorded. After 1 yr, 92 percent of the trees were still alive, although 8 percent appeared in poor condition. Four percent had died and were standing and a little over 1 percent had died and fallen. Two percent were cut as hazard trees. These mortality rates were compared with those predicted in the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service’s fire model, First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM). Logistic regression was used to develop models to predict probability of mortality. Independent variables were DBH, percent live crown height, percent live crown volume, and species. For all species, percent live crown height was the best predictor of mortality. Results for individual species varied. Percent live crown height was the best predictor of mortality for Douglas fir, live crown height was the best predictor of mortality for white fir, and percent live crown volume was the best predictor of mortality for Sugar pine...|$|R

For juniper, pinyon, and oak species, we recorded diameter at root crown instead of dbh. Height and dbh were recorded for all fire-killed trees.

30|$|A {{resource}} manager {{planning to}} use prescribed fire or {{deciding how to}} manage a wildfire needs to translate resource objectives, such as optimizing conditions for desired species, into burn objectives, which might address litter and duff removal, <b>scorch</b> <b>height,</b> spatial uniformity, and burn size. Weather and fuel conditions, fire season, and fire frequency are then selected to safely meet burn objectives and help meet resource objectives. Where invasive species are present or occur nearby, managers also need to anticipate potential impacts of invasives on the postfire community; these impacts may include interference with desired species, changes in community structure, and alterations in fuel characteristics and behavior of future fires.|$|E
30|$|This study {{extends the}} {{findings}} of previous work on fire patchiness in tropical savannas of northern Australia (e.g., Price et al. 2003, Russell-Smith et al. 2003, Williams et al. 2003). Table 3 shows {{that the percentage of}} burned area is only significantly affected by seasonality. Moreover, of the two patchiness metrics, patch density and patch length, the first is more sensitive to season while the second depends mostly on vegetation type and on the interaction between both factors. Concerning fire severity, the two-way ANOVA suggests that only variables related to the abundance of combustion products (percentage char and percentage ash) differ significantly with both season and vegetation type. This indicates that <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> and char height are not sensitive to those two factors.|$|E
30|$|Of {{interest}} were plume exposures {{above the}} height at which foliage necrosis would {{be caused by}} the direct effects of foliage heating. Van Wagner (1973) determined that foliage necrosis from heat would occur at the height at which 60 °C was reached in a plume above a surface fire, the 60 °C threshold being the temperature at which tissue necrosis would occur nearly instantaneously. Because foliage temperature tracks plume temperatures closely, necrosis (scorch) heights predicted from the 60 °C plume temperature compare favorably with <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> predictions generated {{from a series of}} linked models including plume model predictions of gas temperature and velocity, needle heating from a lumped capacitance heat-transfer model, and tissue necrosis from a thermal tolerance model (Butler and Dickinson 2010).|$|E
30|$|Very early {{dry season}} burns in May, {{approximating}} patchy burning for finch habitat management, were of low intensity {{and resulted in}} only partial consumption of leaf litter and ground layer vegetation. Early to mid dry season burns conducted in late June, and approximating early wildfires in the region, resulted in moderate intensity fires with complete consumption of ground layer vegetation and greater <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> than very early burns. The early wet season burn treatment was included to assess impacts of management or lightning ignited fires that can affect Sorghum spp. seedlings post germination (Lonsdale et al. 1998). Early wet season burns were of moderate intensity. High intensity late dry season burns (Jul to Nov), representing late wildfire conditions, could not be conducted experimentally because of total fire bans during this season.|$|E

Percentage burned was calculated by dividing the number of burned points {{by the total number}} of points on a transect. Unburned patch density (km− 1), was obtained by counting the number of unburned patches (contiguous unburned footfall points) on a transect, and dividing this by the total length of the transect. Mean unburned patch length was obtained by averaging the length of unburned patches. Unburned patch density and mean unburned patch length were used for assessments of fire patchiness; char height, <b>scorch</b> <b>height,</b> and mean percentage of char and ash were used for assessments of fire severity.|$|E

A long-term, diachronic study, incorporating detailed monitoring of the plant community, was chosen in an attempt to overcome the problems of interpretation of spatial variation which are inherent in any synchronic approach to the study of succession. The species composition of a Hawkesbury Sandstone plant community was assessed before it was experimentally burnt in 1973.

For this purpose the FIRESTAR 2 D and FIRETEC wildfire simulators are used. We simulated the fire line by a heat source at ground level and mainly investigated the temperature field. As a first step, we ran computations of thermal plumes with no-wind and with no canopy, for first comparison to plume theory. The influence of crown existence on the temperature field above the heat source, as well as on crown scorch, was then investigated. As a second step, the effect of a wind to the plume, as well as to crown scorch, was shown for the no-canopy and canopy cases...|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} {{seasonal}} timing of fires affected burned area, vegetation structural type influenced fire patchiness, {{and the interaction}} between season and vegetation type affected fire severity. All initial hypotheses were supported: 1) burned area and fire severity {{were higher in the}} LDS and patchiness lower (shorter and less frequent unburned patches) than in the EDS; 2) patchiness differed by vegetation structure type, with sandstone heaths having the highest patch frequency (low fuel continuity due to larger proportion of exposed rock surfaces), open woodlands the lowest (associated with greater continuity of grassy fuels), open forests had the longest mean unburned patches (associated with highest canopy cover and possibly greater fuel moisture content); 3) fire severity and percentage area burned were strongly related in the EDS, with 70 % of EDS burned area being explained by mean <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> with the relationship between these two variables increasing with spatial aggregation of the data, and, most importantly from a biodiversity conservation perspective, 4) even small increases in fire patchiness were shown to substantially enhance the survival of fire-sensitive (obligate seeder) species.|$|E
30|$|Within a month {{following}} each prescribed fire, {{crown scorch}} (percent of crown volume scorched, maximum <b>scorch</b> <b>height),</b> stem char (percent of basal stem circumference charred, max stem char height), {{and consumption of}} litter and duff were measured. Scorch and char heights were measured using an Impulse handheld laser rangefinder (Laser Technologies, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA), and percent crown volume scorch was visually estimated. Litter and duff consumption was measured by using a duff pin placed at the uphill side of the unraked trees {{at the top of}} the litter layer prior to fire, measuring from the top of the pin down to any unconsumed litter or duff or mineral soil following the fire. Duff pins were not installed for raked trees because all of the litter and duff at the base of the tree had been removed. The vigor of each tree and beetle activity were monitored for three summers following the fires. There were several areas within each burn unit that did not burn. Trees within these areas were excluded from the analysis, reducing the final sample sizes to 58, 153, and 246 trees in Cabin Creek, Redwood Canyon, and Wall Spring, respectively, for a total of 457 trees.|$|E

Methods Geographical information system and global positioning system technologies were used to measure spatial and temporal changes in fire patterns over a one decade period in a 100 x 80 km area that included a cluster of Aboriginal settlements and a large uninhabited area. The major vegetation types were mapped and fire activity was assessed by systematic visual interpretation of sequences of cloud-free Landsat satellite images acquired in the first (May to July) and second (August to October) halves of the 7 -month dry season. Fire activity {{in the middle and}} end of one dry season near an Aboriginal settlement was mapped along a 90 -km field traverse. Canopy <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> was determined by sampling burnt areas beside vehicle tracks. Results Satellite fire mapping was 90 % accurate if the satellite pass followed shortly after a fire event, but the reliability decayed dramatically with increasing time since the fire. Thus the satellite mapping provided a conservative index of fire activity that was unable to provide reliable estimates of the spatial extent of individual fires. There was little landscape fire activity {{in the first half of}} the dry season, that was mostly restricted to areas immediately surrounding Aboriginal settlements, with burning of both inhabited and uninhabited landscapes concentrated in the second half of the dry season. The mean decadal fire indices for the three dominant vegetation types in the study area were three in the plateau savanna, two in the sandstone and five in the wet savanna. The spatial and temporal variability of Aboriginal burning apparent in the satellite analyses were verified by field traverse surrounding a single settlement. Fires set by Aborigines had low <b>scorch</b> <b>height</b> of tree crowns reflecting low intensity, despite generally occurring late in the dry season. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that Aboriginal burning created a fine-scale mosaic of burnt and unburnt areas but do not support the widely held view that Aboriginal burning was focused primarily in the first half of the dry season (before July). The frequency and scale of burning by Aborigines appears to be lower compared with European fire regimes characterized by fires of annual or biennial frequencies that burn large areas. The European fire regime appears to have triggered a positive feedback cycle between fire frequency and flammable grass fuels. The widely advocated management objective of burning in the first half of the dry season burning provides one of the few options to control fires once heavy grass fuel loads have become established, however we suggest it is erroneous to characterize such a regime as reflecting traditional Aboriginal burning practices. The preservation of Aboriginal fire management regimes should be a high management priority given the difficulty in breaking the grass-fire cycle once it has been initiated...|$|E

To accommodate the mixtures of zeros and continuous data, we modeled responses of each tree using a common two-stage modeling approach (Gelman and Hill 2007). The first-stage models estimated the probabilities tree damage variables were non-zero, and the second-stage models estimated damage variables conditional on them being non-zero. The first-stage models were mixed effects probit models for binary data (Albert and Chib 1993), and the second-stage models were mixed effects linear models with responses transformed to natural logarithms. Both models included transects as random effects and hill slope, DBH, total fuel within the drip line, raking, season of burn, and raking × season of burn interactions as fixed effects. Extensive zeros precluded use of the two-stage model for analyzing the cambium mortality data, so bootstrap confidence intervals were used to estimate percent cambium mortality for raked and not-raked trees that burned in spring and in fall (Efron and Tibshirani 1993). To estimate prescribed burning effects on the various fuel size classes, we calculated average post-burn fuels minus average pre-burn fuels for each transect and fit a multivariate linear regression with season of burn as a predictor. We constructed FORTRAN programs to fit the models (Intel Corporation 2013), and assessed model fit using posterior predictive checking procedures that compared the observed data to data simulated from the fitted models (Gelman et al. 2014).|$|E
