All Marriott School students may apply for several school-specific and university-wide financial aid opportunities. Some are program-specific, others are need-based. The Hawes Scholars program is the highest scholarship distinction given to MBA students at the school. The program awards $10,000 to second-year students who are nominated by <b>students</b> <b>or</b> faculty, and who are then selected based on academic performance, leadership maturity, and a commitment to high ethical standards.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by <b>students</b> <b>or</b> fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 23 laureates {{affiliated}} with Washington University in St. Louis. Washington University considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate <b>students</b> <b>or</b> {{were members of the}} faculty as affiliated laureates. Arthur Compton, the chancellor of the university from 1945 to 1953, was the first laureate affiliated with the university, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Washington University laureates; Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Spencer Gasser won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Carl Ferdinand Cori and wife Gerty Cori won the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Arthur Kornberg and Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and Daniel Nathans and George Davis Snell won the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Seventeen Washington University laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other category. With the exception of Daniel Nathans, who received his M.D. from Washington University and William E. Moerner who received his undergraduate degrees from the university, all Washington University laureates have been members of the university faculty.|$|E

Otto Fritz Meyerhof, a research professor in physiological chemistry, was the first University of Pennsylvania laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922. Two Nobel Prizes were shared by University of Pennsylvania laureates; Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Three laureates, Christian B. Anfinsen, Gerald Edelman, and John Robert Schrieffer, won different Nobel Prizes in 1972, and were awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1973.

5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the <b>students</b> <b>or</b> younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, 11 then-current {{faculty and}} {{research}} staff at Princeton University were Nobel laureates. By 2013, the cumulative total of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton was 36. Princeton claims laureates who attended as <b>students</b> <b>or</b> who were employed when they received the Prize {{or did the}} research leading to it. Woodrow Wilson, {{the former president of}} Princeton, was the first Princeton-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Princeton laureates: James Cronin and Val Logsdon Fitch won the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics, Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics, David Gross and Frank Wilczek won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims won the 2011 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Seventeen Princeton laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, more than any other category. Twenty-five laureates were members of the Princeton faculty, 12 laureates received their Ph.D. at Princeton, and four laureates, Woodrow Wilson, Eugene O'Neill, Gary Becker, and Michael Spence, were Princeton undergraduates.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{division}} {{was used to}} provide a pool of reinforcements for {{the division}}s which {{had been sent to}} the Korean War theater, and in January 1951 it provided 650 enlisted fillers for overseas service. Later that month, it was given 4,006 new recruits for its three infantry regiments and artillery assets, and each unit created a 14-week training program to prepare these new soldiers for combat. Because of heavy casualties and slow reinforcement rates, the Army looked to the National Guard to provide additional units to relieve the beleaguered Eighth Army. At the time, the 45th Infantry Division was comprised overwhelmingly of high school <b>students</b> <b>or</b> recent graduates and only about 60 percent of its divisional troops had conducted training and drills with the division for a year or more. Additionally, only about 20 percent of its personnel had prior experience of military service from World War II. Nevertheless, the division was one of four National Guard divisions identified as being among the most prepared for combat based on the effectiveness of its equipment, training, and leadership. As a result, in February 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was alerted that it would sail for Japan.|$|E

5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by <b>students</b> <b>or</b> employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting <b>students,</b> <b>or</b> students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E
