Due to the surfactant nature of PFOA, {{it has been found}} to concentrate in the top layers of ocean water. PFOA is detected widely in surface waters, and is present in numerous mammals, fish, and bird species. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, <b>striped</b> <b>mullet,</b> gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, {{in the middle of the}} North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. However, wildlife has much less PFOA than humans, unlike PFOS and other longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids; in wildlife, PFOA is not as bioaccumulative as longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids.|$|E

40|$|<b>Striped</b> red <b>mullet</b> (Mullus surmuletus) {{belongs to}} the species for which individualization of stocks is {{advanced}} by ICES in western Europe for areas including the Bay of Biscay and the areas bordering the Iberian peninsula. Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to this stock. These recommendations are given for two years and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES advice consisted in a 20 % reduction in catches (average of the last 3 years:- 2009 - 2011) as a precautionary measure. Since that, no new advice has been formulated, the advice remains the same. Considering the impacts of such measurements on the French fishing fleet, improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority. The project ROMELIGO aims to change this situation by contributing to the improvement of the knowledge on three stocks (<b>striped</b> red <b>mullet,</b> whiting and pollack) {{on the basis of the}} available data (declaring landing data or sampling data for French fishermen, data from scientific campaigns, etc.) or data to be collected (biological parameters). The first phase of the project analyzes the catches and the activity of the French professional fishery with regards to the species (composition and evolution of catches, seasonality, spatial distribution, gear used and discards).

40|$|International audienceStock {{identification}} is of primary importance for population structure assessment of economically important species. This study investigates stocks of <b>striped</b> red <b>mullet</b> using three automatic methods of stock identification based on otolith shape and growth marks. Otolith shape {{is known to}} be a promising approach for stock identification but interpreting patterns of variance is a difficult problem. In this study, images in reflected and transmitted light were acquired from 800 otoliths sampled in the Northwest European seas from South Bay of Biscay to North Sea. The growth marks are pointed out manually by an expert. The external shape of otoliths was automatically extracted by computer vision process and then three automatic classification methods were compared, two classical state-of-the-art methods based on Fourier descriptors and principal component analysis (PCA), and a recently proposed method based on shape Geodesics. From a methodological point of view, results show that the shape geodesic approach significantly outperforms other classical methods. From a biological point of view, this study shows that the population of <b>striped</b> red <b>mullet</b> in Northwest European seas can be divided in three geographical zones: the Bay of Biscay, a mixing zone composed of the Celtic Sea and the Western English Channel and a northern zone composed of the Eastern English Channel and the North Sea (67 % of correct classification rate using both shape and growth pattern information).
