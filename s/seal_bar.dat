40|$|Packaging protects food {{products}} from environmental influences, assuring quality and safety throughout shelf life if properly performed. Packaging quality {{depends on the}} quality of the packaging material and of the closure or seal. A common problem possibly jeopardizing seal quality is the presence of seal contamination, which can cause a decreased seal strength, an increased packaging failure risk and leak formation. Therefore, early detection and removal of seal contaminated packages from the production chain is crucial. In this work, a pulsed-type active thermography method using the heated <b>seal</b> <b>bars</b> as an excitation source was studied for detecting seal contamination. Thermal image sequences of contaminated seals were recorded shortly after sealing. The detection performances of six thermal image processing methods, based on a single frame, a fit of the cooling profiles, thermal signal reconstruction, pulsed phase thermography, principal component thermography and a matched filter, were compared. High resolution digital images served as a reference to quantify seal contamination, and processed thermal images were mapped to these references. The lowest detection limit (equivalent diameter 0. 60 mm) was obtained for the method based on a fit of the cooling profiles. Moreover, the detection performance of this method did not depend strongly on the time after sealing at which recording of the thermal images was started, making it a robust and generally applicable method. status: publishe...|$|R

A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using biodegradable films suitable for fresh-cut lettuce with commercial vertical-form-fill-and-seal packaging machines (VVFS) equipped with heat-sealing bars. Biodegradable high-density polyethylene (BHDPE) and polypropylene (BPP) films were tested. Commercial bags of pre-cut Romaine sealed in a polyethylene/oriented polypropylene (PE/OPP) bag formed on a WFS machine were used as the control. All bags were held at 4. 4 °C, 80 % RH and assessed for reduction in quality during storage per a commercial (in-house) standard utilized by a large pre-cut salad packer in Salinas, California. When the biodegradable films were sealed with a VFFS machine equipped with a thermal-bar heat sealer, a 52. 5 % fail rate was observed due to the non-continuity of the seals. Leaks were found when bags were vacuum tested to 14 in Hg absolute for 15 seconds. However, a 45. 5 % fail rate was also observed for commercial bags made using the same VFFS machine, suggesting similar seal concerns for current industry film structures. Though an attempt was made to only store bags that were sealed properly, bags made from the biodegradable films sealed with the thermal-bar did not perform as well as the commercial packages and the shelf-life of the pre-cut Romaine was shortened.

40|$|The {{formation}} of protein absorption droplets in {{the cells of}} the proximal convolution was studied in mouse kidney. Ox hemoglobin was administered intraperitoneally and kidney specimens were collected at intervals of 30 minutes to 4 days after injection. In the lumen of the nephron, hemoglobin was concentrated to an opaque mass whose relations with the brush border and the epithelium could be easily followed. It was found that hemoglobin passes through the brush border in between the microvilli, enters the channels of tubular invaginations at the bases of the brush border, and is transported in bulk into vacuoles in the intermediate cell zone. These vacuoles increase in size and are transformed through further concentration into dense absorption droplets. Using the opaque hemoglobin content of the nephron as a tracer, functional continuity of the system of the tubular invaginations with the lumen {{on one side and the}} vacuoles on the other was demonstrated. Mitochondria lie closely apposed to vacuoles and droplets, but are not primarily involved in droplet formation. 15 hours after injection and later, ferritin and systems of layered membranes become visible in the droplets as their density decreases. These membranes are interpreted as lipoprotein membranes; similar membranes are found in the lumen of the tubuli. It is suggested that phospholipids enter into the vacuoles together with hemoglobin from the tubular lumen and form membrane systems of lipoproteins in the droplets.

40|$|In September 2009 the European Union adopted Regulation 1007 / 2009 {{on trade}} in seal {{products}} (Basic Regulation) due to {{concerns over the}} welfare of seals in the non-indigenous commercial seal hunts, particularly in Canada. Throughout the policy-making process these moral concerns were a crucial element of {{the political will to}} <b>bar</b> <b>seal</b> products from the EU market. Also research carried out as part of the preparatory works leading to the Basic Regulation appeared to support the claim that the seal hunt, unless conducted by indigenous communities, is cruel and unnecessary, calling for a legislative response in the European Union. This dissertation screens the legislative process of the EU seal regime and considers in how far problem identification, goal setting and goal attainment are streamlined. Throughout this thesis it becomes obvious that also the claim of a European ‘moral concern’ is ambiguous although the Union successfully defended the regime under the ‘moral exception’ clause in international trade law. Even though animal welfare in general can be regarded as a Community value, the EU seal regime cannot be linked to other EU animal welfare laws as the regime does not have an impact on animal welfare in the seal hunts. Instead, the dissertation shows that, although the seal regime appears to be based on ‘objective’ scientific knowledge, it is based on an inherently biased approach towards the non-indigenous seal hunts. Indicative for the neglect of remote coastal communities in which the seal hunt is carried out is the lack of recognition of its socio-economic and cultural value for the people involved in it. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a seal hunting community and in the processing industry this dissertation shows how closely interlinked the seal hunt at sea is with the social fabric on land. Indeed, a lack of knowledge on conditions in the sealing industry existed prior to the seal regime’s adoption although its impacts were expected to be drastic.

40|$|In the agro-food industry, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for non-destructive quality inspection tools that allow to inspect every individual product. This {{is the result of}} an increased focus on food safety and quality over the past decades. Several fast, non-destructive and contactless technologies have been studied for food quality inspection, many of them based on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the food product. Nevertheless, in some situations the search for a suitable technique remains. This is for example the case when {{there is an}} interest in detecting subsurface cavities or inhomogeneities which are not visible with the naked eye or by using classical machine vision. It was hypothesized in this PhD research that active thermography has exactly the right properties to fill in this gap in the field of non-destructive food quality inspection. The technique is based on recording and analyzing the surface temperature of an object as a function of time in response to an external thermal excitation. Defect detection is based on the principle that (sub) surface regions with different thermo-physical properties result in differences in this temperature-time output. Active thermography is a versatile technology with respect to the experimental configuration and the data processing techniques. Although active thermography is being studied and applied extensively in several domains (e. g. automotive and aerospace engineering and building applications), {{only a limited number of}} studies on the active thermography inspection of agro-food products have been performed. The overall objective of this PhD research was to explore the potential of active thermography for rapid, non-destructive and contactless quality inspection in the agro-food sector. In this study, the focus was on pulsed thermography, because this method allows for high inspection speeds and poses a low risk on thermal damage of the inspected products. Both aspects are crucial for quality inspection in the agro-food chain. An active thermography experimental set-up was elaborated to be able to perform high quality experiments. It was shown that it is important to minimize reflections and to optimize the spatial uniformity of the applied thermal excitation. A long-pass infrared filter was installed in front of the thermal camera to avoid direct reflections of a part of the excitation energy via the sample surface into the camera’s detector. Moreover, the excitation sources were equipped with frosted glass diffusers to increase the spatial uniformity of the excitation. Next, an industrial application of active thermography for the detection of seal contamination in heat-sealed food packages was studied. The heat of the <b>seal</b> <b>bars</b> was used as the thermal excitation source. The detection performances of six thermal image processing methods were compared. High resolution digital images served as a reference to quantify seal contamination. The lowest detection limit was obtained for the method based on a fit of the cooling profiles, although this limit was only slightly lower than that of the method based on a single frame. In this application, the excitation was predetermined by the industrial context and was found not to be ideal with respect to defect detection. This case highlights the importance of optimizing the excitation and recording parameters to improve defect detection. Although model-based active thermography was studied in other domains, it was not yet explored for the agro-food domain. Therefore, a methodology for the model-based optimization of active thermography experiments was developed next. Five finite element models of the heat transfer occurring during an active thermography inspection were proposed and experimentally validated. The five models differed with respect to their spatial dimension (2 D or 3 D), the way in which the excitation was handled (as a boundary heat flux or as a prescribed radiosity from an external heat source) and the way in which the convection of air around the sample was included (through correlation formulas based on the Rayleigh number or through explicitly modeling the non-isothermal flow physics). Although all proposed models were able to capture the general aspects of the temperature-time profiles obtained at sound and defective regions, the model including the non-isothermal flow physics showed the best correspondence to the experimental output. All proposed models were found to be computationally intensive. Therefore, a framework to rapidly and efficiently predict the temperature-time output of a heat transfer model for a wide range of input parameters was developed. The framework combines a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the concept of Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE). It involves setting up a meta-model that interpolates between the output of a limited number of simulations that were selected based on an efficient, space-filling experimental design. This PCA+DACE framework is a generic tool that can be modified with respect to the heat transfer model and the input parameters considered. The PCA+DACE framework was illustrated for a case in which the thermo-physical properties were the inputs and the temperature-time output of sound and defective regions in a PVC sample with subsurface defects was predicted. Next, the PCA+DACE framework was applied to determine the optimal pulse duration for the pulsed thermography detection of subsurface defects located at different depths in a PVC sample. In this application, the pulse duration and the defect depth were considered as the input parameters of the PCA+DACE approach. The principle of pulsed phase thermography was applied to calculate the phase contrast between defective and sound areas in the PVC sample. The simulation results provide us with insight into the more narrow region of the design-space within which the experimental optimum is situated. The largest phase contrast was obtained for the most shallow (1 mm) subsurface defect excited for the shortest time (0. 5 s). This indicates that applications in which surface or shallow subsurface defects are considered are the most interesting for active thermography inspections since only a short thermal excitation is required. Finally, the PCA+DACE framework was applied to optimize the pulsed thermography settings for a confidential, practical case study in the agro-food sector. In this study, it was shown that the in silico approach combining PCA and DACE is a powerful tool to pinpoint the most promising region for the experimental settings. It thus proves that computer-based simulations can help the practitioner to limit the time-consuming and often expensive physical experiments. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the developed finite element model combined with the proposed PCA+DACE framework has the potential to optimize inspection applications in which there is an interest in measuring (defects related to) differences in (sub) surface thermo-physical properties of agro-food products. Interesting paths for future research are to further improve the accuracy of the finite element heat transfer model, to derive information on the defects directly from the principal components of the PCA+DACE framework, to tailor the experimental set-up to the needs of specific agro-food inspection applications, to increase the inspection and data processing speed, to develop image processing algorithms for the active thermography inspection of objects in motion and to extend the application scope of the proposed methodological framework within the agro-food domain. status: publishe...|$|R

Additionally, this case study provides an assessment of the methodology applied to the construction of a coherent structural and property model with facies distribution by highlighting weaknesses and strengths of each singular process and its ultimate impact {{on the quality of the}} end product. Fristad et al. (1997) previously conducted a similar case study of the fault-sealing potential in the Oseberg area calibrated to well data, and concluded that for Brent level reservoirs in the Oseberg field, sealing faults exhibit typical ranges of SGR (Shale Gauge Ratio). Fristad et al. (1997) found that SGR values of 18 % corresponds to significant fault <b>sealing</b> (> 8 <b>bar).</b> This thesis provides comparison to Fristad et al. (1997) and ultimately addresses whether the analogue dataset used to determine limiting SGR values in the STAR tool is applicable. The STAR tool operates with a global database based on analogues from the Niger Delta, Oman, Brunel, GOM, DW Brazil, and the Central and Southern North Sea. Based on this dataset, STAR has predetermined probabilistic column heights associated with specific SGR values. After correlating the SGR calculations in this thesis with cross-fault formation pressure surveys, it was found that faults classified as sealing indicate that higher SGR values (> 30 %) can support hydrostatic pressure differences of > 8 bar. It was also found that faults displaying SGR values between 24 % and 30 % can be linked with minor cross fault pressure differences of around < 1 - 4 bars. SGR zones displaying values < 24 % are found to be acting as conduits for cross-fault fluid communication between some structural segments. Finally, by applying these SGR calculations, even the P(10) case from STAR underestimate the retained column heights in the defined structural elements in the Oseberg area. As a result, is can be argued that STAR needs to be recalibrated to the specific components and parameters that we see in the Brent Group to be better suited in predictive analysis and fault seal evaluation in the northern North Sea if future opportunities are not to be missed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence of cyanide in the industrial aluminium electrolytic cell. Therefore, it was an aim of this investigation to identify the favoured regions of cyanide formation in potlining, and conduct parallel laboratory studies to determine some of the chemical factors likely to influence cyanide formation. The study was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved autopsies of cells of various ages, design and construction in detail. This was followed by extensive sampling of sections of the trenched sidewalls and cathode combined with chemical analyses of the specimens, to enable mapping of the cyanide distribution profiles. Examination of these profiles revealed that major amounts of cyanide were generally concentrated in the carbon sidewall region near the collector bars and to a lesser extent in the cathode near the mid-section of the pot. In particular, carbon that was heavily impregnated with metallic sodium and easily accessible to air ingress, was found to contain high concentrations of cyanide. Thus, from the cyanide profiles it: was evident that air ingress through the collector <b>bar</b> <b>seals</b> of the cathode, and sodium penetration of the carbon governed the favoured region for cyanide formation during normal pot operation. In the second stage, an examination of the kinetics of sodium cyanide formation in carbon-mix was performed in the laboratory. Metallic sodium was reacted with carbon and gaseous nitrogen over a range of temperatures. Rate plots derived from a combination of thermogravimetric and integral analysis techniques indicated that there was increasing reactivity with increase in sodium content during the initial stages of reaction. Furthermore, rate data obtained appeared to fit a second-order reaction relative to reactant sodium after the initial burst of reaction. Further laboratory investigations were conducted to establish the temperatures required for cyanide formation, and determine the susceptibility of different forms of carbon to cyanide generation. The carbon types ranged from plant derived carbon-mix through commercial preformed cathode material to high purity graphite. Whilst cyanide formation was found to readily occur in the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C in all the carbons tested, the less ordered carbon-mix was significantly more vulnerable. However, highly graphitised carbon was the least susceptible to cyanide formation within its structure. Moreover, the reaction was accelerated by the presence of small amounts of iron impurity. Laboratory tests also indicated that the predominant cyanide-containing species formed in potlinings was most likely uncomplexed sodium cyanide. The overall results obtained from laboratory studies were consistent with plant measurements and observations derived from the complex industrial situation. Conclusions drawn from this work may have implications in terms of future cell design, and the ultimate impact of spent potlinings on the surrounding environment...|$|R
