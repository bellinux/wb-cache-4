60|$|Renouard, {{his hand}} {{grasping}} {{the back of}} a chair, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him dumbly.|$|E
60|$|He {{held the}} {{envelope}} in his hand, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the postmark between his horny thumbnails.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded. He {{got to his}} feet, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the shoes, {{and walked}} slowly toward the door, where he turned.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} in tweeds turned to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, surprised.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Bill Brasky <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the gang}} in the skit, Holiday Inn ...|$|R
60|$|The other {{continued}} still unruffled, {{and staring}} {{over the edge}} idly as an angler <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a stream.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the picture}} interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} her chin thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're rather nice. Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again Holmes {{flattened}} out {{the paper}} upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the curious inscription, which ran as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|Kells <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the gold. His jaw worked convulsively. He had {{the eyes}} of a trapped wolf. Yet he seemed not wholly to {{comprehend}} what had happened to him.|$|E
6000|$|... [Then, motionless, he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his brother's open, [...] sightless eyes. Suddenly he wets {{his finger}} and holds it to the [...] girl's lips, then to LARRY'S.] ...|$|R
6000|$|CARMODY (pleased). Ah, don't be talkin'! She'll {{know more}} than the lot of us before she's grown even. (He pauses in his walk and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Eileen, frowning.) Are you sick, Eileen, that you're keepin' your eyes shut without a word out of you? ...|$|R
5000|$|Wachter often {{stands in}} a [...] "pigeon-toed" [...] stance (both feet turned in toward each other) when he plays his bass, and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his feet. He says doing this allows him {{to focus on what}} he's playing and keeps him from being distracted by fans.|$|R
60|$|She did not move, {{save the}} convulsive motion of {{her breath and}} the nervous action of her fingers. She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{a spot in the}} carpet; she couldn't face him.|$|E
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He {{showed it}} as he <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mrs. Teeter {{just in front of}} him. [...] "I don't see any nest or eggs or anything," [...] said he rather testily.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} we'll ever see him again." [...] Gross <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{indicator}} dot, still hanging {{at the edge}} of the board. [...] "I wonder if he'll ever move back this way." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled at}} his choking collar, {{looked at his}} watch, opened the window to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to God she {{had never}} set them on the captain, {{whatever}} colour they are," [...] retorted Franklin. [...] "She and that old chap with the scraped jaws who sits over her and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her dead-white face with his yellow eyes--confound them! Perhaps you will tell us that his eyes are not yellow?" ...|$|R
50|$|Things get instense between Ramsey Nijem and Juilian Lane {{during their}} <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the weight-in. So {{much so that}} the {{assistant}} coaches from each team, Justin Buchholz and Duane Ludwig get into an argument over their respective gyms and how Duane believes he's the one who turned T.J. into a champion. They, along with Cody and T.J. have to be separated.|$|R
6000|$|Thurston's tone carried {{conviction}} with it, but Savine cut him short. [...] "It is {{the practical}} aspect {{that appeals to}} me," [...] he said. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the river for several minutes before he asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked to}} Mr. Pike {{that the men}} seemed thinner and weaker than when they came on board, and he delayed {{replying}} for a moment while he <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them with that cattle-buyer's eye of his.|$|E
60|$|All on the Mary Turner, {{fore and}} aft, lined {{the rail and}} <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> apprehensively <b>at</b> the {{leviathan}} that was {{as long as the}} schooner.|$|R
50|$|Bruenor is {{fighting}} a terrible battle with Grguch which {{ends with a}} disemboweled and headless Grguch. A battered Bruenor and dying Regis are brought before Obould. As Obould <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Bruenor, the Shaman messenger meant for the parlay heals Regis at Obould's command. Obould lowers his weapon and seemingly agrees to a parlay with Mithral Hall and the North. Hralien allows Tos'un {{to live in the}} Moonwood and the group returns home.|$|R
40|$|As Hafez al Assad <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{situation}} in Syria from that {{special place in}} heaven for Syrian dictators, surely the thought that a Libyan styled intervention happening in Syria would have crossed his mind. As much as it would make him turn in his grave, {{there is very little}} moral credit these days to staunchly deny that an imminent {{or at the very least}} a likely intervention is just around the corner...|$|R
6000|$|Bill {{leaned out}} of the winder and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Joe Barlcomb, and then he ses, in a choking voice, [...] "Is that wot you’ve come {{disturbing}} my sleep for at this time o’ night?" [...] he ses.|$|E
6000|$|They all <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the sample}} case. It {{seemed to be}} an {{ordinary}} leather case, with a metal handle and a snap lock. [...] "I'm getting curious," [...] Thacher said. [...] "What's in there? You're all so tense. Diamonds? Stolen jewels?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor, {{then out}} the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't even tell you that, sir," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|Enraged, Gerardo {{attempts}} to throw Miranda from the cliff, only {{to realize he}} cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down {{with his wife and}} sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards the balcony at the now off-screen Miranda.|$|R
6000|$|... "I WON'T answer it," [...] she cried. [...] "Why should I?" [...] And {{she looked}} away into the restless hive of the theatre. She spoke so wildly that she {{attracted}} attention. But it half pleased her. She <b>stared</b> abstractedly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the pit.|$|R
5000|$|TrapGold was {{released}} on 11 October 2012. [...] She dedicated the mixtape to her [...] "loyal fans", whom she calls Azaleans, saying: [...] "TrapGold is a project I created, to bring me back the feeling I used to get before I meet those men in suits who tried to find every way to suck the life and magic out of me." [...] She explained, [...] "It's the fun and cockiness of being young and feeling bulletproof. It's winding down your car window, extending your middle finger out and up into the sun as those men behind their desks <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> you from their high-rise offices... 'FU*K EM!'" ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Robert {{tugged at}} his red beard and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor. Presently {{he lifted his head}} and I saw that his face was troubled, the face of a man, indeed, who is {{struggling}} with himself, or, as I thought, with his pride.|$|E
60|$|Raut {{gripped the}} {{hand-rail}} tightly, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the cone. The heat was intense. The boiling {{of the iron}} and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had to be gone through now. Perhaps, after all...|$|E
6000|$|Once on {{the veranda}} Mr. Van Wyk put {{his hands in his}} pockets, and, {{straddling}} his legs, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a black panther skin lying on the floor before a rocking-chair. [...] "It looks as if the fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly," [...] he thought.|$|E
50|$|But {{the plot}} thickens. The police {{find out that}} Serge is living by himself and attempt {{to put him in}} an orphanage. Just before they enter the building, however, Mme Lambin's friends and Isabelle's mother show up with papers informing the police of Serge's situation, namely that Serge will be under the {{guardianship}} of Dédé and Jeannot (his grandmother's friends) - his father is in Africa, his grandmother in the hospital. Isabelle's mother admits that she called the police in the first place, as she was bitter about Isabelle and Djamal. She appears to fully regret her actions. As Serge leaves, a mysterious boy <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him from a high window, his hands pressed against the glass.|$|R
60|$|The nephew, {{who had a}} sleepy, hairless {{face and}} little Chinese eyes, bowed, and sitting <b>down,</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Lavender with a certain embarrassment.|$|R
50|$|The group emerges into bright {{sunshine}} {{and sit in}} stunned silence on the grass until a bus arrives. They are shown being driven home on the bus; clean, dressed, and paid {{for participation in the}} experiment. Travis and Barris share a silent glance as Barris <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his $14,000 check. Nix asks Travis if he still believes humans are higher in the chain of evolution than monkeys. Travis responds that he does because people have the ability to change. Audio news snippets suggest that Archaleta is being tried for manslaughter. Travis meets his girlfriend in India. She notices that his knuckles are bruised, in contrast {{to the beginning of the}} film, when she noted his pristine knuckles, an indication that he was, at the time, incapable of violence.|$|R
