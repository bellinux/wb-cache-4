30|$|Most IR-system-based self-localization {{applications}} for an indoor mobile robot depend on known artificial landmarks, {{which can be}} classified into active and passive. Passive landmarks are fabricated with IR light-reflecting materials without using any external power. A CMOS IR camera and an IR LED array are integrated into the mobile robot to locate the robot based on the detected passive landmarks [17, 18]. IR emitters are usually used as active landmarks [19, 20] that are positioned at <b>stationary</b> <b>locations</b> and continuously emit an IR signal.

50|$|This eclipse was {{observed}} {{by a group}} of scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory using two airplanes to extend the apparent time of totality by flying along the eclipse path {{in the same direction as}} the Moon's shadow as it passed over Africa. One of the planes was a prototype (c/n 001) of what was later to become the Concorde, which has a top speed of almost 1300 mph(Mach 2). This enabled scientists from Los Alamos, the Paris Observatory, the Kitt Peak National Observatory, Queen Mary University of London, the University of Aberdeen and CNRS to extend totality to more than 74 minutes; nearly 10 times longer than is possible when viewing a total solar eclipse from a <b>stationary</b> <b>location.</b> That Concorde was specially modified with rooftop portholes for the mission, and is currently on display with the Solar Eclipse mission livery at Musée de l’air et de l’espace. The data gathered resulted in three papers published in Nature and a book.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a typical electron-beam processing device are illustrated in the figure. An electron gun (consisting of a cathode, grid, and anode) is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam. A magnetic optical (focusing and deflection) system is used for controlling {{the way in which}} the electron beam impinges on the material being processed (the [...] "workpiece"). In operation, the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode (grid and anode) configuration used. The electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground-plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage (gun operating voltage) being applied to the cathode. This use of a direct high voltage to produce a high-energy electron beam allows the conversion of input electrical power to beam power at greater than 95% efficiency, making electron-beam material processing a highly energy-efficient technique. After exiting the gun, the beam passes through an electromagnetic lens and deflection coil system. The lens is used for producing either a focused or defocused beam spot on the workpiece, while the deflection coil is used to either position the beam spot on a <b>stationary</b> <b>location</b> or provide some form of oscillatory motion.|$|E
50|$|Lux Aeterna Theater has no <b>stationary</b> <b>location</b> and {{operates}} internationally; {{it can be}} easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with threaded openings. The drives are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam {{with a set of}} lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and transfocators are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). Lighting plot involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.|$|E

5000|$|Nanosponges are {{introduced}} to the body by injection, and {{take the form of}} a red blood cell so that the bacteria or venom attacks it. Once it is attacked, it is trapped within the scaffolding of the nanosponge. After the nanosponge is full of toxins and cannot trap anymore it moves to the liver to filter out the toxins. Researchers are posed with is how to tackle all the different types of bacteria and venom, making a lot of different nanosponges for each specific bacteria and venom is nearly impossible. As of now they are focusing on toxins such as; E. Coli, MRSA, pneumonia, bee venom, snake venom and sea anemone venom. These venoms all use a pore-forming strategy, which is useful when dealing with nanosponges. A single nanosponge can capture many of the bacteria and venoms, instead of being tailored to each individually. [...] Another obstacle researchers are faced with is the lifespan of the nanosponges. Once nanosponges are injected they can move rapidly through the blood system, and be found in the liver to be filtered out within hours. Researchers are working on a technique using hydrogel to coat the nanosponges to increase the life of the nanosponge and help them to remain stationary after injection. What essentially will happen is before the nanosponges are injected they will be coated in a hydrogel that with prolong life, and keep the nanosponges from moving around the body. Having a <b>stationary</b> <b>location</b> for all nanoparticles to reside can more effectively tackle specific regions affected with disease. It was found that 80 percent of nanosponges coated with a hydrogel lasted more than two days after injection. Only 20 percent of nanosponges not coated in the hydrogel lasted two hours after injection, and diffused to other locations in the body.|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of motion {{is an essential}} prerequisite to responding adequately to the dynamic aspects of sensory information in the environment. The neural substrates of auditory motion processing are, at present, still a matter of debate. It has been hypothesized that motion information is, as in the visual system, processed separately from other aspects of auditory information, such as <b>stationary</b> <b>location.</b> Here we report data on auditory {{perception of}} stationary and motion stimuli from a subject with right-sided resection of the anterior temporal-lobe region including medial aspects of Heschl's gyrus, and from three subjects with unilateral (right-sided or left-sided) hemispherectomy. All these subjects had undergone cortectomy decades earlier. The subjects with hemispherectomy were completely unable to perceive auditory motion, but showed slight to moderate deficits in judging <b>stationary</b> <b>location.</b> The subject with temporal lobectomy exhibited quite similar stationary auditory deficits as found in the subjects with hemispherectomy, but was completely normal in judging auditory motion. Thus, {{there was a clear}} dissociation of the effects of unilateral temporal lobectomy and hemispherectomy on auditory motion perception. Collectively, these findings suggest that the unilateral anterior temporal-lobe region plays {{a significant role in the}} analysis of stationary, but not moving, sound. One may assume that the cortical “motion network” is distinct from the “stationary network”, and is located either in the most posterior aspects of temporal lobe, or in non-temporal, most likely parietal, areas...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the dynamic scene analysis is presented which departs from previous work by emphasizing a qualitative strategy of reasoning and modeling. Instead of refining a single quantitative description of the observed environment over time, multiple qualitative interpretations are maintained simultaneous-ly. This offers superior robustness and flexibility over traditional numerical techniques which are often ill-conditioned and noise-sensitive. The main tasks of our approach are (a) to detect and to classify the motion of individual objects in the scene, (b) to estimate the robot's egomotion, and (c) to derive the 3 -D struc-ture of the stationary environment. These three tasks strongly depend on each other. First, the direction of heading (i. e. trans-lation) and rotation of the robot are estimated with respect to <b>stationary</b> <b>locations</b> in the scene. The focus of expansion (FOE) is not determined as particular image location, but as a region of possible FOE-locations called the Fuzzy FOE. From this infor-mation, a rule-based system constructs and maintains a Qualitative Scene Model. Results of this approach from real and synthetic imagery are presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|Super-virtual {{refraction}} interferometry {{enhances the}} signal-to-noise ratio of far-offset refractions. However, {{when applied to}} 3 D cases, traditional 2 D SVI suffers because the stationary positions of the source-receiver pairs might be any place along the recording plane, not just along a receiver line. Moreover, the effect of enhancing the SNR can be limited because of the limitations {{in the number of}} survey lines, irregular line geometries, and azimuthal range of arrivals. We have developed a 3 D SVI method to overcome these problems. By integrating along the source or receiver lines, the cross-correlation or the convolution result of a trace pair with the source or receiver at the stationary position can be calculated without the requirement of knowing the <b>stationary</b> <b>locations.</b> In addition, the amplitudes of the cross-correlation and convolution results are largely strengthened by integration, which is helpful to further enhance the SNR. In this paper, both synthetic and field data examples are presented, demonstrating that the super-virtual refractions generated by our method have accurate traveltimes and much improved SNR...|$|R

Two experiments were conducted in which participants swung a hand-held pendulum while tracking an oscillating stimulus or while keeping their eyes fixed on a <b>stationary</b> <b>location</b> directly above an oscillating stimulus. It was expected that the participants ’ rhythmic movements would become entrained to the oscillating stimulus in both conditions but that visual tracking would strengthen this entrainment. Experiment 1 investigated the role of visual tracking in establishing unintentional entrainment. Experiment 2 investigated the role of visual tracking in intentional entrainment. As predicted, participants exhibited greater unintentional coordination and more stable intentional coordination when they tracked the stimulus. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of eye movements in environmental coordination...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors present three methods {{to detect the}} {{position}} and orientation of an observer, such as a mobile robot, {{with respect to a}} corridor wall. They use an inexpensive sensor to spread a wide ultrasonic beam. The sensor is rotated by means of an accurate servomotor in order to propagate ultrasonic waves towards a regular wall. Whatever the wall material may be the scanning surface appears to be an acoustic reflector as a consequence of low air impedance. The realized device is able to give distance information in each motor position and thus permits the derivation of a set of points as a ray trace‐scanner. The dataset contains points lying on a circular arc and relating to strong returns. Three different approaches are herein considered to estimate both the slope of the wall and its minimum distance from the sensor. Slope and perpendicular distance are the parameters of a target plane, which may be calculated in each observer’s position to predict its new location. Experimental tests and simulations are shown and discussed by scanning from different <b>stationary</b> <b>locations.</b> They allow the appreciation of the effectiveness of the proposed approaches...|$|R
40|$|To {{what extent}} are {{the left and}} right visual hemifields {{spatially}} coded in the dorsal frontoparietal attention network? In many experiments with neglect patients, the left hemisphere shows a contralateral hemifield preference, whereas the right hemisphere represents both hemifields. This pattern of spatial coding is often used to explain the right-hemispheric dominance of lesions causing hemispatial neglect. However, pathophysiological mechanisms of hemispatial neglect are controversial because recent experiments on healthy subjects produced conflicting results regarding the spatial coding of visual hemifields. We used an fMRI paradigm that allowed us to distinguish two attentional subprocesses during a visual search task. Either within the left or right hemifield subjects first attended to <b>stationary</b> <b>locations</b> (spatial orienting) and then shifted their attentional focus to search for a target line. Dynamic changes in spatial coding of {{the left and right}} hemifields were observed within subregions of the dorsal front-parietal network: During stationary spatial orienting, we found the wellknown spatial pattern described above, with a bilateral hemifield representation in the right hemisphere and a contralateral preference in the left hemisphere. However, during search, the right hemisphere had a contralateral preference and the left hemisphere equally represented both hemifields. This finding leads to novel perspectives regarding models of visuospatia...|$|R
