There is considerable evidence that small and medium-sized enterprises generally face significant barriers to engagement with formal training programmes. Consequently, the LEED programme of the OECD initiated a project to identify ways of overcoming barriers to workforce development in SMEs. New Zealand participated in that project, submitting a case study on the Canterbury region. This paper explains the study’s conceptual framework and presents the major research results.
