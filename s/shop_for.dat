40|$|A {{steady stream}} of {{research}} {{over the past few}} decades has focused on store and shopping mall patronage and consumers’ associated enjoyment of the shopping experience. Based on previous research, the sources of shopping enjoyment were identified as shopping to socialize, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> bargains, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> gratification, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> entertainment, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> others, <b>shopping</b> to browse, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> exercise and <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> sensory stimulation. The objective of this study was to investigate gender differences in the sources of shopping enjoyment. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires distributed at a large metropolitan shopping centre in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria. The findings indicate significant gender differences on all the sources of shopping enjoyment except ‘shopping for entertainment’. This study contributes to the current literature and provides valuable information to South African retailers, specifically with regard to marketing and promotional strategies aimed at male and female shoppers separately. Suggestions for future research are offered. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|Tibbets {{flew the}} lead bomber Butcher <b>Shop</b> <b>for</b> the first American {{daylight}} heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a marshalling yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew {{with him in}} Enola Gay. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.|$|E

5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E
