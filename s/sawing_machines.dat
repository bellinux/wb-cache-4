50|$|Since 1963, {{after the}} Trust decided to {{distribute}} production of machine tools for wood over several factories in Poland, {{the company began}} to specialise {{in the production of}} circular <b>sawing</b> <b>machines,</b> shredders and fragmentisers for processing wood and wood-based materials.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} between 1953-62 the {{production}} program became extremely varied.

40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} paper explores {{the design of}} an automatic safety brake mechanism on a manual circular table <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> which stops the blade from rotating when human flesh is detected in the blade proximity.

50|$|Several early sawmills in England {{were burned}} by sawyers who were fearful {{of losing their}} livelihoods. However, the {{increased}} efficiency of the sawmill, and the back-breaking nature of the saw pit work, resulted in saw pits generally going out of use in the United Kingdom {{at the time of}} the industrial revolution. Old OS maps circa 1860 often show the location of saw pits, but by the start of the 20th century very few remained and most are no longer in use.

50|$|Cold <b>saw(ing)</b> <b>machines</b> are {{circular}} saws {{that are used}} in many metal cutting operations. The saw blades used are quite large in diameter and operate at low rotational speeds, and linear feeds. There are three common types of blades used in {{circular saws}}; solid-tooth, segmental tooth, and the carbide inserted-tooth. The circular saw is typically fed into the workpiece horizontally, and as the saw advances into the material, it severs the material by producing narrow slots. The material is usually held in place during the cutting operation by means of a vise. The chips produced by cutting are carried away from the material by both the teeth of the blade as well as the coolant or other cutting fluid used.|$|E
50|$|After {{being in}} charge of {{production}} control for a while, Kōdate became a design engineer for a manufacturing company producing <b>sawing</b> <b>machines</b> and trying {{to emerge from the}} industrial void of the period. Kōdate was willing to understand how to provide a greater contribution to the recovery of Japan and improve efficiency among its workers with the limited resources available (both material and human). He sought contacts and reference literature that could fulfill his objectives and open the minds of people to the idea that work could be made easier and more effective. One of his senior colleagues suggested to him to read a book by Shigeo Shingō, which he found definitely interesting. Kōdate realized, especially, that all of the academic teaching he had received so far indulged in technical aspects, but almost no consideration had been given to notions or information referring to the way working activities were planned, done, and controlled (the PDCA or Deming Cycle); however, Shingō noted that a widespread interest for business management was arising at the same time all over the country.|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} approach, energetic effects (cutting forces and cutting power) of wood sawing process are generally calculated {{on the basis}} of the specifi c cutting resistance, which is in the case of wood cutting the function of more or less important factors. On the other hand, the cutting forces (power) problem may be tackled with an innovative, up-to-date fundamental analysis of the mechanics of sawing based on modern fracture mechanics. This line of attack is an improvement on traditional approaches for cutting forces and power, many of which are empirical and based upon limited information. Such formulae do not permit generalisation to new conditions of operation of sawmills, such as e. g. the use of narrow-kerf blades. The presented algebraic model, for cutting power determination while sawing, in addition to timber ‘strength’ and friction between tool and workpiece, takes into account the property called ‘fracture toughness’ (resistance to cracking), which is a vital ingredient. Furthermore, forecasting of the shear plane angle with this model is achievable even for small values of uncut chips. Moreover, the mentioned model is a universal one, and useful for determination of energetic effects of sawing of every kinematics such as: frame <b>sawing</b> <b>machines,</b> bandsawing machines and circular <b>sawing</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|E

40|$|Increased {{problems}} of hardwood timber availability have caused many sawmiller, industry analysts, and planners {{to recognize the}} importance of sawmill conversion efficiency. Conversion efficiency not only affects sawmill profits, but is also important on a much broader level. Timber supply issues have caused resource planners and policy makers to consider the effects of conversion efficiency on the utilization and depletion of the timber resource. Improvements in sawmill conversion efficiency would favorably impact sawmill profits, and would be equivalent in effect to extending existing supplies of standing timber. An equation was developed to estimate lumber recovery factor for hardwood sawmills based on the characteristics of <b>sawing</b> <b>machines</b> and log resources. Variables included in the model were headrig type, headrig kerf, average log diameter and length, and the influence of total sawing variation.

40|$|Although CNC marble <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> can {{automatically}} cut marble slabs {{to desired}} dimensions, saw speed and feed rate are selected by operator according to stone parameters, {{features of the}} saw, and its immersion depth. If the feed rate is selected lower than the optimal value, there will be time-loss and capacity deficiencies {{or if it is}} selected faster, cutting quality will decrease, spindle motor will draw more current, and saw blade will corrode faster. While cutting especially thick materials, saw may be stacked in the stone, cutting quality may be impaired, saw blade may be abraded earlier, precision quality may go down because of increase in measurement errors, and machine may be damaged with the increase in vibrations when improper feed rates are selected. Because of nonhomogeneity of the slabs and deterioration of the saw blade, operator cannot determine a persistent feed rate. This study is targeted to find saw speeds according to saw diameter and optimum feed rate by means of limiting vibrations and current drawn from saw motor and torque accordingly in order to increase working performance of CNC marble <b>saw</b> <b>machines.</b> Thanks to adaptive adjustment of feed rate, one can save on material as well as time, labour, and cost by making use of optimum energy...|$|R
