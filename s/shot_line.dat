5|$|A <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> is a rope {{between a}} float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> float should be sufficiently buoyant {{to support the}} weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the line is all taken up. Various configurations of <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S., the USPA Rules and Rules Interpretations govern all sanctioned events. The {{rules of}} arena polo {{are very similar}} to those of outdoor field polo with the main {{differences}} accounting for the presence of the walls surrounding the playing field.

50|$|Recognisable {{topographical}} features may {{be remembered}} or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility {{is sufficient to}} see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, <b>shot</b> <b>lines,</b> jackstays and guide lines.|$|R
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
25|$|If {{the route}} of the dive is {{constrained}} or can be reliably planned, cylinders for bailout of decompression gas can be dropped along the route at the points where they will be needed on the return or ascent. The cylinders are usually clipped to a distance line or <b>shot</b> <b>line,</b> to ensure that they are easy to find and unlikely to get lost. These cylinders would typically contain a gas mixture close to optimal for the sector of the dive in which they are intended to be used. This procedure is also known as staging, and the cylinders then known as stage cylinders, but the term stage cylinder has become generic for any cylinder carried at the diver's side in addition to the bottom gas.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>line</b> and flaking box: The <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> {{is tied to}} the {{projectile}} and is {{the first}} line to reach the shipwreck. This is the thinnest line used in the drill and is stored in a special pattern the flaking box. This special pattern allows it to pay out freely as the gun is fired. After the drill, the <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> is returned to the box by carefully laying it in the flaking pattern, ensuring that it is ready for the next use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The studied {{camera is}} {{basically}} just {{a line of}} pixel sensors, which can be rotated on a full circle, describing a cylindrical surface this way. During a rotation we take individual <b>shots,</b> <b>line</b> by line. All these line images define a panoramic image on a cylindrical surface. This camera architecture (in contrast to the plane segment of the pinhole camera) comes with new challenges, and this report is about a classification of different models of such cameras and their calibration.

5000|$|A [...] "lazy shot" [...] is a shot {{which is}} {{suspended}} above the bottom. It may be {{tethered to the}} main <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> at a convenient depth. It is used for decompression and frees the main <b>shot</b> <b>line</b> for other divers. The lazy shot's line {{does not need to}} be longer than the decompression depth and is often only deep enough for the longer stops. It only needs a weight heavy enough to provide diver buoyancy control and sufficient buoyancy to avoid being dragged down under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} {{were discovered}} in a mud diapir in the leased block Mississippi Canyon 798 - Gulf of Mexico, through piston coring. Subsequently, a seismic experiment {{was set up to}} investigate the dynamics behind the hydrate formation. Wide aperture seismic traveltime data obtained from the experiment have been inverted to estimate 2 D P-wave velocity models of the five <b>shot</b> <b>lines.</b> The results from modeling indicate the presence of free gas in regions that show up as zones of high reflectivity on the reflection profiles. The topography of the study area suggests presence of active salt bodies, which in turn, makes it plausible for the gas in the Mississippi Canyon 798 to have deeper sources...|$|R
50|$|With {{a seventh}} episode slot left {{over at the}} end of production, Grant and Naylor decided to go back and re-shoot certain scenes and drop others that they felt did not work. Scenes removed include Lister {{ejecting}} the crew members' canisters into space and Rimmer conducting his own eulogy. One of the more drastic changes was the ship's computer, Holly. Initially shot as a voice over, Norman Lovett had convinced the creators to have a disembodied head on screen. The Holly scenes from the first three episodes were re-edited to feature the newly <b>shot</b> <b>lines</b> with the head of Holly. Altogether, approximately two-thirds of the broadcast episode was composed of reshoot footage.|$|R
