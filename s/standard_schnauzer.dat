5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The first Giant Schnauzers {{emerged from}} Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and WÃ¼rttemberg in the 17th century. These {{original}} Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated {{version of the}} German pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer is {{a working}} breed of dog {{developed}} in the 17th century in Germany. It is {{the largest of the}} three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> and the Miniature Schnauzer. Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.|$|E

50|$|Distinguished {{by their}} long beards and eyebrows, <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are always pepper and salt or less {{commonly}} black in color, {{with a stiff}} and wiry hair coat on the body {{similar to that of}} other wirehaired breeds. Their hair will perpetually grow in length without properly shedding, but contrary to popular belief <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are not hypo-allergenic and they all shed to some degree. The more wiry - and correct and weather-resistant - the coat, the more that the coat will shed, though the hair dropped from a single dog is said to be nearly unnoticeable.|$|R
25|$|The poodle {{has contributed}} to many other dog breeds, such as the Miniature Schnauzer, <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer,</b> and dogs of the Bichon type in order to either save those breeds from extinction, reduce size, or by dog fanciers to improve their appearance.|$|E
500|$|Although the Giant Schnauzer {{is called}} 'Giant', {{this is not}} in {{comparison}} to other large dog breeds such as the Great Dane or the Rottweiler, but instead {{in comparison to the}} Standard and Miniature Schnauzers. The AKC breed standard calls for males to stand from [...] at the withers, and for females to stand from [...] Giant Schnauzers are square in shape, and should resemble a larger version of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer.</b> The tail is long and the ears are small button ears carried high on the head. Where it is legal, it is possibly docked and the ears cropped.|$|E
500|$|The Miniature Schnauzer is a {{breed of}} small dog of the Schnauzer type that {{originated}} in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers developed from crosses between the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> {{and one or}} more smaller breeds such as the Poodle and Affenpinscher, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as [...] "spunky" [...] but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{are also}} widely {{known to be}} {{intelligent}} and easy to train. They have been called [...] "the dog with a human brain", and in Stanley Coren's book The Intelligence of Dogs, they are rated 18th out of 80 breeds {{on the ability to}} learn new commands and to obey known commands. <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are extremely versatile, excelling at dog sports such as agility, obedience, tracking, disc dog, flyball and herding. Members of the breed have been used in the last 30 years in the United States as for bomb detection, search and rescue, and skin and lung cancer detection.|$|R
50|$|Like most working dogs, <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> will be rambunctious {{until about}} the age of two; and lots of {{exercise}} will keep them busy. Owners must be prepared to mentally and physically stimulate their Schnauzer every day, even into their old age. Like other high-intelligence breeds, a bored Schnauzer is a destructive Schnauzer.|$|R

Adair and her husband, David, have two daughters; they keep two <b>standard</b> <b>schnauzers,</b> Max and Chase, who compete nationally in agility trials. A voracious reader, she began to have story ideas of her own and transferred her creative process from interior design to writing novels, writing seventeen full books before her first novel, The Mercenary, sold to Harlequin for their Temptation line in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The current <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> excels at obedience, agility, tracking, herding, therapy work and, in Germany, schutzhund. Despite being {{a popular}} pet in Europe, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> has never gained wide {{popularity}} in North America.

5000|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{are either}} salt-and-pepper or black in color, and {{are known for}} exhibiting many of the [...] "ideal" [...] traits of any breed. These include high intelligence, agility, alertness, reliability, {{strength}} and endurance. This breed of dog has been very popular in Europe, specifically Germany, where it originated. The breed was first exhibited at a show in Hanover in 1879, and since then have taken top honors in many shows including the prestigious [...] "Best in Show at Westminster Kennel Club" [...] in the United States in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Inside the U.S. and Canada, {{ears and}} tail and dewclaws are {{typically}} docked as a puppy. Veterinarians or experienced breeders will cut tails and dewclaws {{between 3 and 7}} days of age. Tails are traditionally docked to around three vertebrae. Ear cropping is usually performed at about 10 weeks {{of age in}} a veterinary clinic. Many breeders inside North America have begun to crop only those puppies retained for show purposes, or those puppies whose owners request it. There is still somewhat of a bias against natural ears in the North American show ring. However, there is a growing sentiment among breeders and judges that both ear types are equally show-worthy, and many North American show breeders enjoy both cropped and natural eared dogs in their kennels. However, unlike in Europe, the majority of North American breeders believe that the choice of whether to cut ears and/or tails should continue to remain with the breeders and owners. Outside of North America, most <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> retain both their natural ears and tail as docking is now prohibited by law in many countries.|$|R
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is <b>standard</b> among the <b>Schnauzer</b> breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|R

50|$|According to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> Club of America, âThe <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is {{considered}} a high-energy dog. They need ample exercise not only for physical well-being, but also for emotional well-being. The minimum amount an adult dog should get {{is the equivalent of}} a one long walk a day. This walk should be brisk enough to keep the dog at a steady trotting pace {{in order to keep the}} dog in prime physical condition. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> puppy is constantly exploring, learning and testing his limits. As adults, they are always ready for a walk in the woods, a ride in the car, a training session or any other activity that allows them to be with their owner. This is a breed that knows how to be on the alert, even when relaxing by the feet of their owner.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} breeds: the giant, the standard, and the miniature. Toy and teacup are not breeds of schnauzer, but these common terms {{are used to}} market {{undersized}} or ill-bred miniature schnauzers. The original schnauzer was {{of the same size}} as the modern <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> breed, and was bred as a rat catcher, yard dog, and guard dog. The miniature schnauzer and the giant schnauzer were developed from the <b>standard</b> <b>schnauzer</b> and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the schnauzer's original purpose.|$|E
50|$|The poodle {{has contributed}} to many other dog breeds, such as the Miniature Schnauzer, <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer,</b> and dogs of the Bichon type in order to either save those breeds from extinction, reduce size, or by dog fanciers to improve their appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Standard Schnauzers {{were mixed}} with the German Black Standard Poodle, giving the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> a [...] "regal" [...] look. In the {{earliest}} days of the show schnauzer, puppies from a single litter could be classified as either German Pinschers (short-haired puppies) or schnauzers (long-coated wire-haired puppies), dependent only on coat length. Some original coat types of the German Pinscher may have been lost during World War I, having since been brought back from different stock. The pepper-and-salt coat, that is the trademark of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> breed in North America, could be seen in the German Pincher (called the silberpinsch), attesting to the close relationship between the two breeds in modern times. It was also in the late 19th century that the medium-sized schnauzer was developed into three different breeds/sizes: the Miniature, the Standard (the original), and the Giant.|$|E
50|$|In modern history, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> {{has taken}} on a variety of roles. The Red Cross used the dogs for guard duty during World War I. Both German and (in one {{documented}} instance) American police departments have put the dogs to work as well. Several Standard Schnauzers have been used in the USA for drug and bomb detection, and also as search-and-rescue dogs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> (then {{referred}} to as the Wire Haired Pinscher) was originally born in the same litter as the German Pincher. Over time, breeders decided to separate the [...] "varieties," [...] changing them to actual [...] "breeds". After three generations of the same coat were born, the Pinscher-Schnauzer club allowed them to be registered as their respective [...] "breed".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is a {{dog breed}} that {{originated}} in Germany in the 15th and 16th centuries. [...] The literal translation is [...] "snouter" [...] from the German word for [...] "snout" [...] and means colloquially [...] "moustache", {{because of the}} dog's distinctively bearded snout. Although the schnauzer is considered a terrier-type dog, {{they do not have}} the typical terrier temperament.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{hereditary}} within the breed are: hip dysplasia and hereditary eye disease. Both {{problems can be}} tested for and identified in breeding stock before they pass the trait onto the next generation, so the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> Club of America recommends that every kennel test their breeding stock for hip and eye problems before breeding and to breed only healthy animals.|$|E
50|$|The Wire Haired and Smooth Haired Pinschers, as the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> and German Pinscher were {{originally}} called, were shown in dog books {{as early as}} 1884. However drawings of the German Pinscher date back to at least 1780, and the breed likely traces its roots to varieties of ratters well established on farms in Germany {{as far back as}} the 15th century. These medium-sized dogs descended from early European herding and guardian breeds.|$|E
50|$|Giant Schnauzers {{are around}} 2 ft tall at the {{shoulder}} and weigh between 55 and 80 lb. They are working dogs that were developed in Swabia in the 17th century, as a rough coated variant of the pinscher breeds. The Giant Schnauzer was developed independently through crosses of black Great Danes, Munchener German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer.</b> It was originally bred to drive livestock to market and guard farms.|$|E

50|$|The German Pinscher (original name Deutscher Pinscher, FCI No. 184) is a {{medium-sized}} breed of dog, a Pinscher type that originated in Germany. The breed {{is included in}} the origins of the Dobermann, the Rottweiler, the Miniature Pinscher, the Affenpinscher, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> (and, by extension, the Miniature Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer). The breed is rising in numbers in the U.S., mainly due to their full acceptance to AKC in 2003. In Australia, the breed is established with a rise in popularity becoming evident.|$|E

5000|$|The {{smallest}} of the working breeds, the <b>Standard</b> <b>schnauzer</b> makes a loyal family dog with guardian instincts.

In general, they typically are good with children and were once known in Germany as [...] "kinderwachters". If properly trained and socialized early to different ages and temperaments of people, {{they can be very}} patient and tolerant in any situation.
