The measurement site is at 57  m {{above sea level}} compared to ITB which is at 700  m above sea level and during the La Niña year. The antenna elevation angles at USM and ITB are at 40.10 ° and 64.70 ° with antenna diameters of 2.4 and 1.8  m, respectively, which highlights that the <b>scintillation</b> <b>amplitude</b> decreases as the elevation angle increases and increases as the antenna diameter increases. For example, at 0.1 % of the time, the fade <b>scintillation</b> <b>amplitude</b> is 1.3  dB at USM and 0.5  dB at ITB. The average temperatures at USM and ITB were around 27 °C and 23 °C, respectively, during the measured years. This indicates that the scintillation intensity reduces as the temperature reduces.

40|$|Tropospheric {{scintillation}} {{can become}} a significant impairment in satellite communication systems, especially in those with low fade-margin. Moreover, fast amplitude fluctuations due to scintillation are even larger when rain is present on the propagation path. Few studies of scintillation during rain have been reported and the statistical characterization is still not totally clear. This paper presents experimental results {{on the relationship between}} scintillation and rain attenuation obtained from slant-path attenuation measurements at 50 GHz. The study is focused on the probability density function (PDF) of various scintillation parameters. It is shown that scintillation intensity, measured as the standard deviation of the amplitude fluctuations, increases with rain attenuation; in the range 1 - 10 dB this relationship can be expressed by power-law or linear equations. The PDFs of scintillation intensity conditioned to a given rain attenuation level are lognormal, while the overall long-term PDF is well fltted by a generalized extreme valué (GEV) distribution.

The daytime scintillation with a maximum in the summer is consistent with localized blanketing sporadic E observations and could also be possibly due to lightning activity around the observing station. Annual percentage occurrence shows that scintillations occurred mostly in the daytime with peak occurrence at around 05 : 00 – 09 : 00 LT. The daytime strong scintillation events were not associated with vTEC depletions and phase scintillations, but the signal to noise ratio during the scintillation events decreased with increase in scintillation index (S 4). However, the post-midnight strong <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillations</b> were associated with vTEC depletions and phase scintillations indicative of large scale irregularities (spread-F). The geomagnetic activity effect showed enhanced occurrence on geomagnetically disturbed days as compared to quite conditions. The geomagnetic storm effect on scintillations for 17 storms of different strengths (Dst ≤ 50 nT) during 2010 – 2011 showed an increase in the occurrence of post-storm scintillations, on the days following the storm...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillations</b> {{produced}} by the F-region in equatorial areas are presented. The equipment used for conducting the observations is described. The use of transmissions from the ATS- 1, ATS- 3, and ATS- 5 for obtaining data is described. The two principal subjects discussed are: (1) correlation between satellite and incoherent radar observations of scintillations and (2) simultaneous observations of scintillations at 136 MHz and 1550 MHz...|$|R
