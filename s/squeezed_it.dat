Should the centre of gravity be destroyed, {{a major factor in}} Yugoslavian will to resist would be broken or removed. In Milošević's case, the centre of gravity was his hold on power. He {{manipulated}} hyperinflation, sanctions and restrictions in supply and demand to allow powerful business interests within Serbia to profit and they responded by maintaining him in power. The damage to the economy, which <b>squeezed</b> <b>it</b> to a point where there was little profit to be made, threatened to undermine their support for Milošević if the air campaign continued, whilst causing costly infrastructure damage.|$|E

5000|$|After Sony {{released}} The Beatnuts's first hits compilation, 1999's World Famous Classics, The Beatnuts did not record another album until 2001's Take <b>It</b> or <b>Squeeze</b> <b>It.</b> Their 2001 album contained two slightly popular singles, [...] "No Escapin' This" [...] and [...] "Let's Git Doe", but {{was unable}} to match the commercial or critical success of A Musical Massacre.
