50|$|On July 6, 1971, he {{was awarded}} a patent, with George H.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis {{is the study of}} {{temperature}} effects on a concrete cylindrical structure representing the primary biological <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> The study was carried out using a model of a simplified analogous structure formed by cutting the cylinder by two planes parallel to the same diameter and linking the two part by means of a slender cross-wall representing the action of the removed parts of the cylinder. The model was built at the Battersea College of Technology and the results of tests were compared with the results obtained by the author from the analysis of the scaled model of the prototype, a joint programme carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd. The science of model testing was extended in this work to cover investigations of the effects of short terra temperature loading. The programme aimed at the development of a, simplified model as an inexpensive method of testing, development of an experimental technique and theoretical analysis which {{could be used as a}} "yard stick" in comparison between different tests or even different models. Comparison of results between the scaled model of the prototype (three dimensional model) and a simplified model and checking that the principle of superposition applies to the temperature loading was also sought. Some twenty tests were carried out on one of the three dimensional models but only part of one test was singled out for the comparison of results with the simplified model. The main work was carried out on the simplified model and, out of eighteen tests, one test was fully worked up in the form of tables and graphs showing the experimental and analytical approach in detail. The results of representatives of other groups of tests were shown in graphical form. The experimental technique is fully described pointing to the encountered difficulties. The successful development of a simplified model raises confidence that this approach could be extended to other types of structures...|$|R
