40|$|Background and Purpose: Inadequate {{supply of}} wood raw {{material}} {{is one of}} the major obstacles for the global furniture industry’s growth. Several secondary timbers/Lesser-Utilized-Species (LUS) that could substitute the scarce traditional timbers for furniture production exist in tropical forests. However, the industry continuously faces persistent timber shortages. The extent to which manufacturers utilize LUS as alternatives is unclear, which this study sought to ascertain. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from 300 Timber Firms from Ghana primarily through questionnaires using the stratified random sampling technique. Results: Continuous decline and non-availability of preferred traditional timbers and competition from imported furniture were the main challenges confronting the furniture industry. Data obtained indicated that most manufacturers (85 %) hardly use any LUS; 44 % of these mentioned lack of information on their properties and prospective uses and 32 % attributed it to non-availability on the domestic timber markets. However, 22 % of these producers rely on traditionally ‘well-known’ timbers (e. g. mixed red wood, Guarea cedrata and Tectona grandis) owing to their strength properties, 20 % due to their strength and durability and 14 % because of their strength and aesthetic properties. Many LUS (with prospects for furniture-making) available in great quantities in many tropical forests could substitute the over-dependent timbers. However, information on their properties and uses are hardly available to local producers, which affects their popularity among timber suppliers and manufacturers. Conclusion: To improve on the level of utilization of <b>secondary</b> <b>timbers,</b> wood workers must be supplied with comprehensive information about their properties and economic values. This will contribute to reducing pressure on the primary timbers, ensuring consistent supply of timber and keeping the sector operational...|$|E

40|$|The {{commitments}} to sustainable development {{made by the}} member countries of the UN, together with the Kyoto Protocol, has raised the profile of {{issues related to the}} ecological evaluation of products, production processes and services. In each of the studies underlying this thesis a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) perspective was adopted. Firstly, site-specific data were collected from three forest management regions in northern, central and southern Sweden in the late 1990 s. Secondly, silvicultural and technological forestry developments between the early 1970 s and late 1990 s were evaluated by comparing the energy use in the forestry system at each of these times. <b>Secondary</b> transport of <b>timber</b> was found to be the most energy-demanding part of the forestry system usually, accounting for about 50 percent of the energy demands, and logging was generally the second most energy-demanding process (33 - 40 percent), except in systems involving mechanized logging operations in 1972, when logging required the most energy (60 percent). These findings show that increased mechanization since 1972 has not resulted in a rise in total energy use; in fact, it has led to more energy-efficient logging machines, from motor-manual and early mechanised systems, to current machines that {{are on the verge of}} automisation. In contrast, energy use in silviculture has increased, possibly due to the use of more supposedly advanced technology and more intensive silvicultural treatments. The same is also true for secondary haulage because of the greater use of road vehicles and longer haulage distances. An analyse of future possible <b>secondary</b> <b>timber</b> transport scenarios involving lorry or lorry-and-train combinations using a variety of potential fuels/energy carriers showed that in biobased-fuel cycles the greenhouse gas emissions are about 96 percent lower than in corresponding fossil fuel cycles. In addition, they involve little fossil energy. Given the expected future scarcity of fossil fuels, and potential consequences of global warming, it could be advantageous for the forest sector to both produce and use a renewable fuel, since it could increase the overall value of forest products and have a low environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|Balancing forest {{harvesting}} {{and restoration}} {{is critical for}} forest ecosystem management. In this study, we used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to evaluate the effects of 21 alternative forest management initiatives which were drafted for forests in the upstream region of the Hun River in northeastern China. These management initiatives included {{a wide range of}} planting and harvest intensities for Pinus koraiensis, the historically dominant tree species in the region. Multivariate analysis of variance, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and planting efficiency (which indicates how many cells of the target species at the final year benefit from per-cell of the planting trees) estimates were used as indicators to analyze the effects of planting and harvesting regimes on forests in the region. The results showed that the following: (1) Increased planting intensity, although augmenting the coverage of P. koraiensis, was accompanied by decreases in planting efficiency and forest diversity. (2) While selective harvesting could increase forest diversity, the abrupt increase of early succession species accompanying this method merits attention. (3) Stimulating rapid forest succession may not be a good management strategy, since the climax species would crowd out other species which are likely more adapted to future climatic conditions in the long run. In light of the above, we suggest a combination of 30 % planting intensity with selective harvesting of 50 % and 70 % of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>timber</b> species, respectively, as the most effective management regime in this area. In the long run this would accelerate the ultimate dominance of P. koraiensis in the forest via a mor...|$|R
40|$|The Greek {{island of}} Lefkada {{is one of}} the areas in Europe with the highest seismic hazard, both for the {{frequency}} of events and their magnitude. The local traditional architecture is characterized by its particular resilience to earthquake thanks to a unique and effective anti-seismic constructive system. This system is based on two autonomous structures that act simultaneously, but independently: a massive stone structure, which primarily performs the load-bearing function and a <b>secondary</b> <b>timber</b> frame. The direct observation of the seismic behavior of the built heritage and the wise use of local materials, suitably used depending on their resistance characteristics, led over time to the development of an empirical solution, progressively recalibrated, which offers a seismic behavior of great interest. Numerous and in-depth studies of the dynamics and of the consequences of seismic events in 2003 and 2015 in Lefkada have highlighted that buildings which present this system and have been subjected to adequate maintenance over time, have shown greater resistance and lower damages than reinforced concrete buildings, recently built and conceived. The aim of the paper is twofold: on the one hand, it is intended to illustrate the constructive features of this system, which is a still alive and currently used tradition, the dynamics of its seismic behaviour and the level of resistance of the masonry. On the other hand, it aims to raise the awareness of designers to seismic improvements in the existing building heritage, which {{can take advantage of the}} residual seismic performance of the building and grasp at the suggestions of the past in the anti-seismic conception of contemporary construction...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{conversion}} of tropical forests {{is a major}} driver of biodiversity loss. Slowing rates of deforestation is a conservation priority, {{but it is also}} useful to consider how species diversity is retained across the agricultural matrix. Here we assess how bird diversity varies in relation to land use in the Taita Hills, Kenya. We used point counts to survey birds along a land-use gradient that included primary forest, <b>secondary</b> vegetation, agroforest, <b>timber</b> plantation and cropland. We found that the agricultural matrix supports an abundant and diverse bird community with high levels of species turnover, but that forest specialists are confined predominantly to primary forest, with the matrix dominated by forest visitors. Ordination analyses showed that representation of forest specialists decreases with distance from primary forest. With the exception of forest generalists, bird abundance and diversity are lowest in timber plantations. Contrary to expectation, we found feeding guilds at similar abundances in all land-use types. We conclude that while the agricultural matrix, and agroforest in particular, makes a strong contribution to observed bird diversity at the landscape scale, intact primary forest is essential for maintaining this diversity, especially among species of conservation concern...|$|R

40|$|Information is {{essential}} in making marketing decisions. This paper presents an assessment of information concerning the timber market in Leyte Island, focusing on sources, how to access supply and demand information, and usefulness and limitations of available information. The sources of timber market information include (i) Philippine Forestry Statistics, (ii) a database of registered tree plantations, (iii) a barangay-based inventory of trees on farms, and (iv) tree measurements and data collected in the timber enterprise {{survey conducted by the}} ACIAR Tree Farm Project. Based on available secondary data, there are 27, 635 ha of forest in Leyte that is potentially harvestable. In addition, based on the findings of the barangay-based tree farm inventory, there are approximately 2. 7 M trees on tree farms on Leyte Island. Timber demand by entrepreneurs on Leyte Island has not been calculated yet from the available survey data of the ACIAR Tree Farmer Project; however, estimates show that the annual per capita timber consumption of the Philippines for 2005 was 7. 8 board feet.

40|$|There are {{significant}} commercial forestry activities in Botswana and in Zimbabwe. Operations in Botswana, unlike those in Zimbabwe, {{are limited to}} the felling and milling of indigenous timber. Zimbabwean operations include large- scale production, milling, and <b>secondary</b> conversion of <b>timber.</b> Technologies used in all these operations are basically traditional but generally satisfactory with respect to reliability and with respect to meeting market product specifications. In general, the industry in both countries takes a positive view to emerging technologies and attempts to keep abreast with developments in this area. The industry is, however, cautious about adopting these technologies. This caution derives mostly from the apparent satisfactory operations from the current technologies and from some fear of possible difficulties which may arise with respect to indigenizing these technologies once adopted. Besides these considerations, capacity exists for Zimbabwe particularly to engage some of these technologies. The most promising ones for Zimbabwe are {{in the area of}} secondary biobleaching for the expanding pulp and paper industry, timber drying kilns to enable effective control of timber delivery times, and information technology for operations management. ETs potential for Botswana is more limited. Prospects are greatest in timber waste conversion to charcoal and in localised power generation using timber wastes from field and sawmill operations. Any acquisition or development of these technologies will, however, be individual company effort without any significant assistance from government or from parent multinational companies...|$|R
40|$|Within {{a single}} decade, {{bioenergy}} {{has shifted from}} a largely local energy source with marginal trade volumes to a globally traded item. The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate the links between national renewable energy support and trade policies and market forces on past global bioenergy trade volumes and feedstock choices and to sketch possible future trade scenarios under different sustainability criteria. The three supporting objectives, translating into three research questions, are (1) to evaluate the interaction between policies and market forces and their impacts on global bioenergy trade, (2) to analyze the feedstock specific environmental risks for forest biomass {{with a focus on}} temporal carbon in order to define potential future environmental criteria, and to (3) simulate how these requirements may influence future woody biomass trade in a global competitive market. Results show that world biofuel production and trade has grown from below 30 PJ in 2000 to 572 PJ in 2009 for biodiesel, and from 340 PJ in 2000 to over 1, 540 PJ in 2009 for fuel ethanol. Solid biofuel trade has grown from about 56 to 300 PJ between 2000 and 2010; during which period wood pellets grew strongest from 8. 5 to 120 PJ. The defining factor for international trade is economic viability, i. e. the difference between supply, i. e. production, transport, and potential tariff costs vs. destination market prices. The EU has been and is also expected to remain the predominant destination for globally traded biomass for energy (liquid and solid) at least until 2020 due to demand increases under current policy projections and limited regional resources (i. e. land and time constraints to increase productivity levels). The EU sustainability requirements will be the key defining factors for future trade. The key environmental concerns regarding an increased use of forest biomass for energy (excluding deforestation and land-use change) have been found to encompass impacts on soil productivity, biodiversity, and the overall carbon balance. Exact risk levels vary in terms of scientific certainty but are generally site, time, and feedstock dependent. Sustainable forest management is a pre-requisite to avoid most of the risk factors. There are also several mitigation options to reduce short-term soil impacts, e. g. leaving residues on site until foliage has dropped. Regional best management practices and habitat protection are key first order measures to prevent unwanted adverse biodiversity impacts. Current analyses determining the temporal imbalance between the release and sequestration of forest carbon apply different modelling frameworks, the calculated payback and parity times however are typically affected by the same parameters: plant growth rates, and the choice and construction of the forest baseline and the alternative energy system. Comparisons indicate that residue and salvage wood entail shorter payback times than additional fellings of low-grade roundwood. The bulk of forest biomass used for energy today is made up of primary and <b>secondary</b> residues. <b>Timber</b> quality roundwood in particular from less productive or slow growing forest biomes is generally not used for energy due to the higher value for timber (products) ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the harvest}} season in Iowa, {{it is common}} to have single axle loads on {{secondary}} roads and bridges that are excessive (typical examples are grain carts) and well beyond normal load limits. Even though these excessive loads occur only during a short time of the year, they may do significant damage to pavements and bridges. In addition, the safety of some bridges may be compromised because of the excessive loads, and sometimes there may be little indication to the users that damage may be imminent. At this time there are no Iowa laws regulating axle loads allowed for agricultural equipment. This study looks at the potential problems this may cause on <b>secondary</b> roads and <b>timber</b> stringer bridges. Both highway pavement and timber bridges are evaluated in this report. A section (panel) of Iowa PCC paved county road was chosen to study the effects of heavy agricultural loads on pavements. Instrumentation was applied to the panel and a heavily loaded grain cart was rolled across. The collected data were analyzed for any indication of excessive stresses of the concrete. The second study, concerning excessive loads on timber stringer bridges, was conducted in the laboratory. Four bridge sections were constructed and tested. Two of the sections contained five stringers and two sections had three stringers. Timber for the bridges came from a dismantled bridge, and deck panels were cut from new stock. All timber was treated with creosote. A hydraulic load was applied at the deck mid-span using a foot print representing a tire from a typical grain cart. Force was applied until failure of the system resulted. The collected data were evaluated to provide indications of load distribution and for comparison with expected wheel loads for a typical heavily loaded single axle grain cart. Results of the pavement tests showed that the potential of over-stressing the pavement is a possibility. Even though most of the tension stress levels recorded were below the rupture strength of the concrete, there were a few instances where the indicated tension stress level exceeded the concrete rupture strength. Results of the bridge tests showed that when the static ultimate load capacity of the timber stringer bridge sections was reached, there was sudden loss of capacity. Prior to reaching this ultimate capacity, the load sharing between the stringers was very uniform. The failure was characterized by loss of flexural capacity of the stringers. In all tests, the ultimate test load exceeded the wheel load that would be applied by an 875 bushel single axle grain cart...|$|R
