2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{excavations}} {{in the area}} revealed that the monument <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a quadrangular enclosure. The skeletons of 254 men laid out in seven rows were found buried within it. A tumulus near the monument was also tentatively identified {{as the site of}} the Macedonian polyandrion where the Macedonian dead were cremated. Excavation of the tumulus between 1902 and 1903 by the archeologist Georgios Soteriades confirmed this. At the center of the mound, about [...] deep, was a layer of ashes, charred logs, and bones about [...] thick. Recovered among these were vases and coins dated to the 4th century BC. Swords and remarkably long spearheads measuring about [...] were also discovered, which Soteriades identified as the Macedonian sarissas.|$|E

6000|$|How {{would he}} greet her? Would he be {{exactly as he}} was when they <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Tod's orchard, above the dreamy, darkening fields, joining hands and lips, moved as {{they had never been}} moved before? ...|$|E
60|$|It was now so dark {{that our}} hero could see but little. As he <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the river, {{he heard a}} patter on {{the leaves of the}} trees and knew it had begun to rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't scratch your face," [...] {{said her}} aunt, who <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pit, {{regarding}} the girl {{as she held}} on amid the glistening green and scarlet masses of the tree. [...] "Will you walk with me to meet him this evening?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{centre of}} the village has many old {{historic}} buildings, including with around 75 listed buildings across the parish. Smallbridge Hall, once an Elizabethan Manor House, <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> village {{on the bank of}} the River Stour.|$|R

"It's {{of no use}} goin' farther," [...] {{observed}} Robin, as he and {{his companions}} <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the forest and looked across the plain; [...] "the wind blows too hard, and the drift is keen; besides there ain't much to be got hereaway, even in seasons of plenty." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, uttering {{a mighty}} roar, the tiger bounded from the jungle, and <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the terrace. Startled at his sudden appearance, the {{elephants}} recoiled, shaking {{the aim of}} their riders. Three shots were, however, fired almost at the same moment; and the tiger, with another roar, bounded back into the jungle.|$|E
6000|$|In pursuance of {{this plan}} the two went to the wharf, after having {{refreshed}} themselves, and set {{to work with the}} fishing-line. Nelly baited the hook, and Roy cut a hole in the ice with his axe. Having put in the hook, and let it down to the bottom, they <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the hole--expectant! ...|$|E

5000|$|The Kosić tower, as an {{offshoot}} of mediaeval residential architecture, is a typical fortified house. It is stone-built and <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> town, so it probably served some defence purpose, given that the Blagaj fort {{was on the other}} side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} it would be safe in any {{farmhouse}} within ten miles of here; but if you like to come with me, my hut <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a wood, and you could leave him there without much risk." ...|$|R
60|$|Amabel, in {{obedience}} to a sign from her mother, {{sat on a}} root of the tree while the Lesson was read, and afterwards she moved forward and <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the grave, her hands tightly clasped, and her head somewhat raised, as if her spirit was following her husband to his repose above, rather than to his earthly resting-place.|$|E
60|$|Then, as Malbihn <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the disordered pile of blankets, Meriem {{suddenly}} {{ceased to}} draw away from him, and as quickly hurled her weight against him {{with the result that}} he was thrown backward, his feet stumbled against the bedding and he was hurled to his back. Instinctively his hands flew out to save himself and at the same instant Meriem leveled the revolver at his breast and pulled the trigger.|$|E
60|$|He led the way, and in {{a minute}} they <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a little ravine some fifteen feet deep running through the wood. The girls were {{carefully}} carried down to the bottom. The change in the temperature, now they were sheltered from the wind, was very great. All three girls were conscious, the motion and {{the heat of the}} guides' bodies having revived both the Fortescues; none of them were, however, able to stand.|$|E
5000|$|The Category 5 {{through station}} {{has been reduced}} to one track, {{formerly}} having had two.

Reservable bicycle stands are available.|$|R
50|$|Further north are the {{earthworks}} of Woodwalton Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle which formerly {{held the}} manor of the parish. In 1886 a hoard of Roman coins was dug {{up in the}} parish. <b>The</b> village <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of Woodwalton Fen, an area of special scientific interest.|$|R
60|$|Amyntas <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> Dared he venture? What {{could there}} be behind that {{darkness}}? The darkness was blacker than the blackest night. He stepped into the boat. Should he go? With beating heart he untied the rope; he hardly dared to breathe. He pushed away.|$|R
60|$|With redoubled caution they again {{advanced}} {{until they}} <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the clearing. It was {{a patch of}} land some hundred yards wide, and extending from {{the shore of the}} lake nearly {{a quarter of a mile}} inland. In the center stood a log hut, neatly and carefully built. A few flowers grew around the house, and the whole bore signs of greater neatness and comfort than was usual in the cabins of the backwood settlers.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was exactly}} as Cheeko would have spoken, and I could but {{feel sorry for}} him even though he had insulted me. He <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the thorn bushes a minute, {{twisting}} and turning his tail {{as if he wanted to}} attract the attention of every member of the club to his folly, and then out he went, running the best he knew how across the open space at the foot of the tree.|$|E
60|$|Awatok now {{whispered to}} his comrades, and {{attempted}} {{to get them to}} understand that they must follow him as fast as possible at the next run. Suddenly the walrus dived. Awatok rushed forward, and in another instant <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the hole with his spear in readiness in his right hand, and the coil of line in his left. The others joined him instantly, and they had scarcely come up when the huge monster again rose to the surface.|$|E
50|$|Accessing {{the upper}} tiers can be sketchy since {{one has to}} <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> canyon, 150 feet above the raging creek, to see them. Reaching {{the base of the}} falls is almost as bad, as one has to climb down a slick and {{slippery}} rock face to reach it.|$|R

60|$|He {{had been}} paid decently—four one-shilling pieces—and he {{contemplated}} them in perfect stillness, {{as if they had}} been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem. The slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing. His form was squat and without flexibility. Stevie, slender, his shoulders a little up, and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of his warm overcoat, <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the path, pouting.|$|E
60|$|Little Gyp, aged {{nearly four}} and a half that first of May, <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the tulip border, bowing to two hen turkeys who were poking their heads elegantly here and there among the flowers. She was absurdly like her mother, the same oval-shaped face, dark arched brows, large and clear brown eyes; but she had the modern child's open-air look; her hair, that curled over at the ends, was not allowed to be long, and her {{polished}} brown legs were bare to the knees.|$|E
60|$|The skipper and {{the hands}} were still ashore and the ketch looked so lonely that the mate, {{thinking}} better of {{his idea of}} retiring, thrust his hands deep {{in his pockets and}} sauntered round the harbor. It was nearly dark, and the only other man visible <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the quay gazing at the water. He stood for so long that the mate's easily aroused curiosity awoke, and, after twice passing, he edged up to him and ventured a remark on the fineness of the night.|$|E
50|$|The older part of Trata <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> plain {{immediately}} {{south of}} Šentvid, extending {{east of the}} railroad to Jesenice, and the newer part stands near Klagenfurt Street (Celovška cesta). There are meadows near the houses further from the main road, and fields to the east where the soil is sandy.|$|R
50|$|Vorder-Unterberg Farm, {{which was}} built in 1636-1638 by local {{carpenters}} and was lived in until 1952, <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> forest above the little church in Inneralpbach. Today the building is a mountain farming museum, and the exhibits include the old parlour, chapel, a combined kitchen and smokehouse, and over 800 artefacts of daily life and work.|$|R
