40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the level of ochratoxin A (OTA) in cocoa beans and derived products along with the estimation of the dietary intake in adults. Throughout harvesting seasons from 2005 to 2009, as many as 1895 samples of cocoa beans were collected at ports and areas of cocoa production and thereafter analyzed. OTA concentrations were determined by HPLC according to the standards of the European Communities (CE 401 / 2006). OTA intakes were assessed using data obtained from the analysis and the estimated Ivorian adult daily consumptions of cocoa beans and chocolate. Average OTA levels depending on cocoa grades were as follows: 0. 64 ± 0. 53 µg/kg for marketable beans, 1. 90 ± 1. 87 µg/kg for non-marketable beans and 1. 40 ± 1. 32 µg/kg for total beans). As regards the types of beans, OTA concentrations ranged from 0. 19 ± 0. 16 µg/kg (<b>shelled</b> <b>beans)</b> to 1. 90 ± 1. 87 µg/kg (unshelled beans). OTA levels in beans were below the maximum concentration of OTA allowed (2 µg/kg of beans). Besides, OTA concentrations obtained from chocolate were comprised between 0. 048 ± 0. 040 µg/kg for sweet chocolate made from marketable <b>shelled</b> <b>beans</b> and 0. 66 ± 0. 65 µg/kg for dark chocolate made from non-marketable unshelled beans. Dietary intakes were respectively equal to 3. 70 ± 3. 00 pg/kg body weight/day for the marketable <b>shelled</b> <b>beans</b> and 36. 5 ± 34. 0 pg/kg body weight/day for the unshelled non-marketable beans. Those dietary intakes appeared to be by far lower than the Tolerable Daily Intake set by the Scientific Committee o Food (5000 pg/kg body weight/day). However, in view of the toxicity of OTA, it is imperative to foster best practices of harvesting, pod breaking, drying and storage of the beans for the total elimination of OTA from Ivorian cocoa beans. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mobile money (MM) {{services}} {{can contribute to}} welfare gains in smallholder farm households. Previous research showed that one important pathway is through higher remittances received from relatives and friends. Here, the role of other impact pathways is examined, especially focusing on agricultural marketing and off-farm economic activities. The analysis builds on panel data from smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda. Regression models show that the adoption of MM technology has contributed to higher household incomes and consumption levels. Off-farm income gains are identified {{to be an important}} pathway, also beyond remittances. Typical off-farm income sources are small businesses in trade, transport, and handicrafts, which benefit from novel savings and money transfer opportunities through MM. In terms of agricultural marketing, MM users sell a larger proportion of their coffee as <b>shelled</b> <b>beans</b> to buyers in high-value markets, instead of selling to local traders immediately after harvest. MM services help reduce cash constraints and facilitate transactions with buyers from outside local regions. In conclusion, MM can contribute to rural development through various important pathways. Analysis of adoption patterns suggests that MM services are socially inclusive...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of soil salinity on plant growth, gas exchange, and leaf nutrients of a salt sensitive species, green <b>shelled</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv.

Leaf area development, stomatal conductance, transpiration, photosynthesis, leaf ion concentrations, and plant dry weight were measured. Salinity stress severely reduced plant growth and leaf area development in bean. and increased leaf senescence.

The study showed that untreated CBS can be used economically at 100 g/kg inclusion in rabbit feed while hot Water treated CBS (WCBS) can be included up to 200 g/kg in rabbit feed. The study recommends the use of hot water treatment of CBS at 200 g/kg inclusion for optimum profitability of rabbit production.

40|$|Nematode {{communities}} are valuable bioindicators of soil disturbance induced by agricultural practices. We report {{the results of}} a short term experiment set on a field previously cultivated with <b>shell</b> <b>beans,</b> where different agricultural practices were applied, namely disinfection with chemicals or organic alternatives (neem, basil, marigold and clove oils). We provide {{a detailed description of the}} soil nematode community before and after the application of agricultural practices, in terms of trophic structure, nematode functional indices and diversity. We also employ network analysis techniques to analyze the structure of nematode assemblages on the basis of co-occurrence of genera in samples. Chemical disinfection had a direct lethal effect on all nematode genera reducing or even eliminating their populations, while organic amendments favored only the free living nematodes without affecting plant feeders. These differences were poorly reflected on changes of diversity and even less on those of nematode indices. Network analysis offered significant insights into the structural changes in the web of interactions among nematode genera. The network after chemical disinfection was smaller, poorly connected and almost entirely dependent on the dominant phytoparasite Paratylenchus. In the absence of chemicals, large and more complex networks were formed...|$|R
