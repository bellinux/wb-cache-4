500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> now know, I have learned {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E

However, a remix single version of [...] "All Night Long" [...] featuring Pitbull was released as the third single from the album instead in May 2010.

In an interview with Eamonn Holmes for Sky News Sunrise in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] was released as a promotional single for the re-release of Overcome and for Christmas. During an interview talking about the song for Virgin Media in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] is a [...] "very special song" [...] and that despite it being a [...] "very emotional song to sing", it is one of her most favourite songs on Overcome.|$|E

[...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days.

In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads [...] "1 COR 6:9-11" [...] can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: [...] "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." [...] The cups in the 33 cent store read That '70s Show, a reference which Danny Masterson, one of the lead actors in That '70s Show, was entertained by, according to Scully. Battling Seizure Robots, the seizure-inducing television show that the Simpsons watch in their hotel room, is based on an episode of Pokémon, called [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon", which caused 685 children to develop epileptic seizures. According to Scully, the staff received [...] "several angry letters" [...] from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode [...] "In Marge We Trust", can be seen on the television screen. Barney, while impersonating Homer, says [...] "That boy ain't right", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series King of the Hill. The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film Godzilla, in which three of the main The Simpsons cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.|$|E
