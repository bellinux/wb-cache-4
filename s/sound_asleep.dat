5|$|The {{earliest}} of Evanescence's {{material was}} released in the late 1990s through independent label Bigwig Enterprises, beginning with their self-titled EP in 1998, followed by the <b>Sound</b> <b>Asleep</b> EP the following year. The band recorded and released a demo album in 2000, titled Origin, and sold it at their concert venues. Very few copies of Origin were pressed, and soon went on sale for high prices online.|$|E

Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the {{shoreline}} and fell <b>sound</b> <b>asleep.</b> Over the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune.|$|E
25|$|The band {{released}} two EPs. The {{first is}} the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at the band's early live performances. The second is the <b>Sound</b> <b>Asleep</b> EP, {{also known as the}} Whisper EP (1999). There was also a third EP called Mystary EP (2003). For their first full-length demo CD, Origin (2000), about 2,500 copies were produced and sold to concert audiences. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some songs on their debut album, Fallen. During a radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from November 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Will and John are prosperous young businessmen and close friends. Will has {{an apartment in the}} city, while John lives in the suburbs. When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the latchkey of his apartment with his chum, telling him to make himself at home. The landlady in the house in which Will lives is seized with a bright idea that she can sublet his apartment during his absence. May and Belle, two pretty girls who are in business, decide to try their hand at housekeeping. They rent Will's apartment and settle down in their new quarters. John decides to take advantage of his friend's invitation and make use of his rooms. He lets himself in with the latchkey, and is amazed to find the two girls <b>sound</b> <b>asleep.</b> Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation. John thinks the joke too good to spoil, so does not try to square himself, but pleads for mercy. May secures his promise that he will never 'burgle' again, and allows him to escape. Unknown to John, May has been engaged by his partner as a typist, and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe, she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red-handed. She calls for help, and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer. Amid explanations, the 'burglar' and the lady shake hands and become good friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{dispatcher}} {{was informed that}} the local airspace would be traversed by military aircraft at an altitudes of [...] On the same day, at 16:00 and 16:01 local time two Tupolev Tu-16K left Zavitinsk air base for weather reconnaissance. At 16:21 local time one of them (serial number 6203106) collided with the Aeroflot An-24RV, 70 km east of Zavitinsk air base. The collision occurred in good lighting conditions, with a visibility of over 10km. Savitskaya was <b>sound</b> <b>asleep</b> at that moment. The Tu-16K razed off the An-24RV's roof and severed both wings. The temperature inside An-24RV's cabin dropped from [...] to [...] Both aircraft disintegrated and fell on taiga terrain. The fragments of Antonov An-24RV were scattered in a south-western direction, 1020 m from the collision point, on a 2500Ñ…900 m area. The Tu-16K exploded after the ground impact, its fragments were scattered approximately 2000 m from the collision point.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that he is no longer on {{full-time}} active duty, McGarrett's military background and SEAL training are still evident in his daily routine and habits; he still takes a [...] "Navy shower", keeps his house impeccably neat and tidy, maintains a fitness regimen and is extremely sensitive to <b>sound</b> even when <b>asleep.</b> His military mannerisms are also apparent in the way he approaches his cases, some of the lingo he uses and his ability to remain calm even when under intense pressure, and he is frequently mocked by Danny for his lack of [...] "human" [...] touch, although in later seasons he would be seen cracking jokes with other team members. Despite his stoicism, he has a soft spot for children, especially his adoptive niece Joan and Danny's daughter Grace, and is extremely protective of his younger sister Mary.|$|R
40|$|Adults {{diagnosed}} with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a reduced sensitivity (degree of selective response) to social stimuli such as human voices. In {{order to determine}} whether this reduced sensitivity {{is a consequence of}} years of poor social interaction and communication or is present prior to significant experience, we used functional MRI to examine cortical sensitivity to auditory stimuli in infants at high familial risk for later emerging ASD (HR group, N = 15), and compared this to infants with no family history of ASD (LR group, N = 18). The infants (aged between 4 and 7 months) were presented with voice and environmental <b>sounds</b> while <b>asleep</b> in the scanner and their behaviour was also examined in the context of observed parent-infant interaction. Whereas LR infants showed early specialisation for human voice processing in right temporal and medial frontal regions, the HR infants did not. Similarly, LR infants showed stronger sensitivity than HR infants to sad vocalisations in the right fusiform gyrus and left hippocampus. Also, in the HR group only, there was an association between each infant's degree of engagement during social interaction and the degree of voice sensitivity in key cortical regions. These results suggest that at least some infants at high-risk for ASD have atypical neural responses to human voice with and without emotional valence. Further exploration of the relationship between behaviour during social interaction and voice processing may help better understand the mechanisms that lead to different outcomes in at risk populations...|$|R
2500|$|After Mr. Rogers {{had been}} long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length {{unjustly}} and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, {{in the year of}} our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then <b>sound</b> <b>asleep,</b> could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, [...] "If it be so, I need not tie my points." [...] And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. Mr. Rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him.|$|E
2500|$|Lee co-founded {{the rock}} band Evanescence with guitarist Ben Moody. The two {{met at a}} youth camp after Moody heard Lee playing Meat Loaf's [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)" [...] on the piano. Within a month, the pair were playing {{acoustic}} sets at Arkansas book stores and coffee houses, and they eventually recorded two EPs, Evanescence EP (1998) and <b>Sound</b> <b>Asleep</b> EP (1999), selling them at various local venues. In 2000, Evanescence recorded the longer EP Origin. This demo contains three songs from the debut album Fallen written by Lee and Moody: [...] "Whisper", [...] "Imaginary" [...] and [...] "My Immortal". Whereas [...] "Whisper" [...] and [...] "Imaginary" [...] were altered before being included on Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] is virtually unchanged, apart from additional string arrangements. A later band version of [...] "My Immortal" [...] was made available for download {{for those who had}} bought an official version of Fallen through their web site, but required that a CD checker program also be downloaded for verification before it would play. The band version was included on later copies of Fallen, notably the Brazilian, Bolivian, and Argentine editions.|$|E
2500|$|They {{begin their}} crusade at Askwood races, {{where it is}} Cup Day. They cause {{considerable}} curiosity, being still clothed in the costumes of Arcady (everyone else is dressed up formally in this scene, anticipating the similar scene in My Fair Lady 50 years later). But instead of improving the Londoners, the Arcadians adopt some of their wicked ways, including betting on the races. Here Simplicitas meets his wife Mrs. Smith, who, not recognising her husband, proceeds {{to fall in love}} with the young stranger. Simplicitas flirts with her and agrees to help her open up an Arcadian restaurant in London. Then comes an opportunity for Simplicitas to distinguish himself. Jack Meadows, who was to have ridden his temperamental horse [...] "The Deuce" [...] has been thrown by the animal, and Peter Doody, the hapless replacement jockey, has also been injured by [...] "The Deuce". Sombra arranges that Simplicitas shall take his mount, as the Arcadians have the gift of speech with animals, and the brute becomes as gentle as a lamb. Simplicitas (while <b>sound</b> <b>asleep),</b> upon [...] "The Deuce," [...] wins the race, to the great satisfaction of its owner. Romantic complications ensue between Meadows and Eileen Cavanagh, a young Irish woman.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took the}} door-handle in his clammy grasp; he had to cover it with a {{handkerchief}} to get a firm hold. He turned discreetly, and the door was pushed open in perfect stillness, except for that dreadful husky thumping of his own heart. At this moment the postman's hard {{knock at the door}} nearly made him cry out aloud. Then he entered; a dreadful visitor, had anyone seen him. She did not see him; she was <b>asleep,</b> <b>sound</b> asleep; in the dirty brown twilight of a London winter day, he could make out that much. He did not dare draw close enough to observe her face minutely, or bend down and listen for her breath. And the oranges! Eagerly he looked at them. There were only five of them. Surely--no! a sixth had fallen on the floor, where it was lying. With a great sigh of relief he picked up all the six oranges, put them in his pockets, and, as shrinkingly as he had come-yet shaking his hand at the girl, and cursing his own cowardice under his breath--he stole down stairs, opened the dining-room door, and advanced into the blind, empty dusk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} the cherry trees are {{blooming}} in spring, brilliant leaves among scarlet petals. For {{how many times}} did my sister come to my rescue in my plight? Other were keen, yet helpless. I have only so few sisters born of the same mother. (We were like) wild geese having fun flying across the Sushui River together. Till the Mujin year (1748), I have been showered in your grace. And now, all of a sudden, you passed away. How sad! I do not know how my elder brother looked like. Who else could relieve my sorrow? Morning drums thundered. I could not fall <b>asleep.</b> <b>Sound</b> of the pan (hitting the bells) in discord. Servants clad in purple coat send morning greetings. Looking back to the days (we had at the) waterfront pavilion, I was in a daze throughout the night. I eschewed my own desolation to console my grieving mother. Riding on chariots, sorrows soared into the ninth Heaven. Feathery flags fluttering along the celestial path. Illness did not erode the filial piety in you. You would remind me to be diligent in my studies. Even in dreams, you would send regards to inquire about His Majestyâ€™s health. Should I joy or mourn? I must be looking haggard, for tears are streaming down my cheeks as if a river breached its banks. Who had no brothers? To whom could I pour out my heart to? In the northern garden, the moon shore on the pine forest. Underneath the eastern hill, wild birds shrieking. How could (a bird) fly with broken wings? It is such a pity that yellow birds did not have a hundred lives. The flock of wild geese is shrinking with just three of us left. Tree branches rustling, I sink into deep melancholy. Are dreams real or is reality a dream? Embraced by the cherry blossoms, I coalesced my thoughts to let bitterness fade with time. Times flies relentlessly, like the water that flows and never returns.|$|R
