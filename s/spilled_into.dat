5|$|Although {{no serious}} {{injuries}} arose from any short-pitched deliveries while a leg theory field was actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling {{between the two}} teams, particularly when Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds.

5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers {{in the area are}} so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the stands, and also stretched {{to the other end}} of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence provoked a riot at the Forum that <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the streets. The riot caused an estimated $100,000 in property damage, thirty-seven injuries, and 100 arrests. Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment and promising to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head coach Dick Irvin.|$|E
5|$|As Saomai {{approached}} South Korea, the typhoon {{forced the}} cancellation of flights beginning on September12. Four airports had their air service suspended. Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10national parks and 43mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As {{a result of the}} inclement weather, the operation of 149passenger ships were cancelled. On September13, the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province. The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though not as much as what had taken place in Japan. Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270tons of oil <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the ocean from a broken oil container.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battle}} around Taechon {{dragged into the}} night of November 26, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment on the division's right became disorganized. Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division soon brought up the 15th Infantry Regiment from his reserve to relieve the 11th Infantry Regiment. After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. As the morning came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not stop their assault even under punishing UN air strikes, {{and some of the}} attacks <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> US 24th Infantry Division's area. Upon noticing their flank was buckling, the US 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment started the retreat southward to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E

5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|Things {{escalate}} {{quickly and}} the police arrive, responding to a noise complaint. The partygoers remain silent, convincing the officers that the party has already ended. The police leave and the party resumes. T-Rick's gnome is smashed, revealing that it contains {{a large amount of}} ecstasy tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers. Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as they are about to have sex and leaves the party upset. The noise and chaos of the party, which has now <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house.

5|$|When Ali Bey of Egypt, {{who opposed}} Ottoman overlordship, invaded Syria in 1771, {{the city of}} Damascus {{surrendered}} to him without a fight, except for the citadel. Ali Bey withdrew after a short siege. Two further sieges took place in 1787 and 1812, both successful and both initiated because the citadel's garrison had revolted against the governor of Damascus. The last siege of the citadel took place in 1831. In that year, the citizens of Damascus and the local garrison of Janissaries revolted against governor Mehmed Selim Pasha, who took refuge in the citadel. He was promised safe passage after a siege lasting 40 days but was murdered before he could leave the city. In 1860, Christian refugees from the Druze-Maronite conflict in Lebanon <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> Damascus, resulting in tensions with the Muslim population. There was a massacre of the Christian population, many of whom sought refuge in the citadel and eventually fled the city {{with the help of}} the Algerian–Damascene notable Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri. Descriptions and photographs of the citadel by nineteenth-century European travellers indicate that the defences remained in relatively good shape until 1895, but that the structures inside the walls were reduced to complete ruins. In 1895, substantial damage was done to the citadel because it was quarried for stone to build barracks.|$|E

50|$|In June 2005, the GPSC {{announced}} that 706 had nearly exhausted its capacity for new telephone exchange prefixes. The supply of numbers was further limited because the 706 territory includes portions of three LATAs that <b>spill</b> <b>into</b> neighboring states. The Atlanta LATA, which includes Columbus, <b>spills</b> <b>into</b> Alabama. The northern portion is {{split between the}} Atlanta and Chattanooga LATAs. The Augusta LATA <b>spills</b> <b>into</b> South Carolina. On June 24, 2005, the NANPA assigned area code 762 for this purpose. However, the Columbus area was not large enough for its own area code, but was too large to stay in 706. For this reason, {{it was decided to}} make 762 an overlay, with 10-digit dialing to be allowed on September 3. On April 1, 2007, 10-digit dialing became mandatory in the 706/762 territory.|$|R

25|$|After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan's {{relations}} to Euro-American powers became more prominent and involved. This <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> a broader {{interacting with the}} modern world, which in terms of interior design, resulted in the introduction of western style interiors, while the vernacular style came to be more associated with tradition and the past.

25|$|Scholz regards this preoccupation as a {{reflection}} of a belief in a divine will and control of history. Many of the worse omens also parallel growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately {{after the end of the}} annals <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> civil war between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of Hilduin’s translation of the relics of St. Sebastian to the Abbey of St. Medard, and Einhard’s transport of the relics of SS.
