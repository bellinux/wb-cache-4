50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|E
40|$|Male field crickets emit {{pure-tone}} mating calls by rubbing {{their wings}} together. Acoustic radiation {{is produced by}} rapid oscillations of the wings, as the right wing (RW), bearing a file, is swept across the plectrum borne on the left wing (LW). Earlier work found the natural resonant frequency (fo) of individual wings to be different, {{but there is no}} consensus on the origin of these differences. Previous studies suggested that the frequency along the song pulse is controlled independently by each wing. It has also been argued that the stridulatory file has a variable fo and that the frequency modulation observed in most species is associated with this variability. To test these two hypotheses, a method was developed for the non-contact measurement of wing vibrations during singing in actively stridulating Gryllus bimaculatus. Using focal microinjection of the neuroactivator eserine into the cricket’s brain to elicit stridulation and micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometry, we monitored wing vibration in actively singing insects. The results show significantly lower fo in LWs compared with RWs, with the LW fo being identical to the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> (N= 44). But during stridulation, the two wings resonate at one identical frequency, the song carrier frequency, with the LW dominating in amplitude response. These measurements also demonstrate that the stridulatory file is a constant resonator, as no variation was observed in fo along the file during sound radiation. Our findings show that, as they engage in stridulation, cricket wings work as coupled oscillators that together control the mechanical oscillations generating the remarkably pure species-specific song...|$|E

50|$|When a {{transmitter}} broadcasts an NTSC signal, it amplitude-modulates a {{radio-frequency carrier}} with the NTSC signal just described, while it frequency-modulates a carrier 4.5 MHz higher with the audio signal. If non-linear distortion {{happens to the}} broadcast signal, the 3.579545 MHz color carrier may beat with the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> to produce a dot pattern on the screen. To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, designers adjusted the original 15,750 Hz scanline rate down {{by a factor of}} 1.001 (0.1%) to match the audio <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> divided by the factor 286, resulting in a field rate of approximately 59.94 Hz. This adjustment ensures that the sums and differences of the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> and the color subcarrier and their multiples (i.e., the intermodulation products of the two carriers) are not exact multiples of the frame rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots to remain stationary on the screen, making them most noticeable.|$|R

40|$|C. E. Chase (1) {{showed that}} the {{attenuation}} coefficient for sound waves in liquid helium goes through a broad maximum {{in the vicinity of}} 0. 9 0 K before falling to zero at lower temperatures. At the top of the curve two minor peaks, separated from each other by a temperature difference of about 0. 1 °K, were observed. Earlier work done at Cambridge University by Chase (2), which had demonstrated that the anomalous increase in absorption just below 1 °K could be ascribed to a relaxation process, had not revealed a fine structure similar to that found at M. I. T., but the Cambridge measurements had been made at only three temperatures below 1 °K, and the additional peak could easily have been missed. The peaks on the absorption curve were therefore interpreted as indicating the presence of two separate relaxation mechanisms in the liquid. For his measurements at M. I. T.

5000|$|Carrier frequency: Usually fixed <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{typically}} {{somewhere between}} 33 and 40 kHz or 50 to 60 kHz. The {{most commonly used}} protocol is the NEC protocol, which specifies a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 38 kHz. The NEC protocol {{is used by the}} vast majority of Japanese-manufactured consumer electronics. The Philips RC-5 and RC-6 protocols both specify a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 36 kHz. However, the early RC-5 encoding chips divided the master frequency of the 4-bit microcontroller by 12. This required a ceramic resonator of 432 kHz to achieve a 36 kHz carrier, which was not widely available. Many companies therefore used a 455 kHz ceramic resonator, which is commonplace due to that frequency being used in the intermediate frequency stages of AM broadcasting radios, resulting in a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 37.92 kHz (essentially 38 kHz). Even documentation for Philips' own controller chips recommended an easier-to-obtain 429 kHz ceramic resonator, yielding a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 35.75 kHz.
