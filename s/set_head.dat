They went off arm in arm. She had seen him at the window, yet she gave no friendly glance; Shelton felt more miserable than ever. He stepped out upon the drive. There was a lurid, gloomy canopy above; the elm-trees drooped their heavy blackish green, the wonted rustle of the aspen-tree was gone, even the rooks were silent. A store of force lay heavy on the heart of nature. He started pacing slowly up and down, his pride forbidding him to follow her, and presently sat down on an old stone seat that faced the road. He stayed a long time staring at the elms, asking himself {{what he had done}} and what he ought to do. And somehow he was frightened. A sense of loneliness was on him, so real, so painful, that he shivered in the sweltering heat. He was there, perhaps, an hour, alone, and saw nobody pass along the road. Then came the sound of horse's hoofs, {{and at the same time}} he heard a motor-car approaching from the opposite direction. The rider made appearance first, riding a grey horse with an Arab's high <b>set</b> <b>head</b> and tail. She was holding him with difficulty, for the whirr of the approaching car grew every moment louder. Shelton rose; the car flashed by. He saw the horse stagger in the gate-way, crushing its rider up against the gatepost.|$|E

50|$|The {{overcheck}} is {{also used}} today in some equestrian riding activities, and for certain types of horse training. In particular, it is used on certain saddle seat horses while on the longe line {{as part of a}} bitting rig that assists the horse in learning the proper high <b>set</b> <b>head</b> position for competition that also emphasizes high knee action. While not normally used by a rider in the saddle, it is common in some places to put an overcheck on ponies when being ridden by very young riders in order to prevent the pony from putting its head down and grazing while being ridden, an act of disobedience that a small child often lacks the physical strength to prevent.|$|E

With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and Cell Global Identity (CGI). Because of high power consumption and extra resource installation requirement in GPS related methods, Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and readily available solution for location information. CGI location information is four <b>set</b> <b>head</b> i. e. Mobile country code (MCC), Mobile network code (MNC), Location area code (LAC) and Cell ID, location information is retrieved in form of longitude and latitude coordinates through any of publically available Cell Id databases e. g.

However due to of fast growth in GSM network, change in topology by the GSM service provider and technology shift toward 3 G exact spatial extraction is somehow a problem in it, so location extraction must dealt with spatial outlier's problem first for mobility building. In this paper we proposed a methodology {{for the detection of}} spatial outliers from GSM CGI data, the proposed methodology is hierarchical clustering based and used the basic GSM network architecture properties...|$|E
40|$|Biological aerated filters (BAFs) are an {{attractive}} process option, particularly when low land usage is required. They can combine BOD, solids and ammoniacal nitrogen removal {{and can be}} utilised at both secondary and tertiary stages of wastewater treatment. Media selection is critical {{in the design and}} operation of BAFs to achieve effluent quality requirements. Two size ranges, 1. 5 – 3. 5 and 2. 5 – 4. 5 mm, of a foamed clay called StarLight C were used in pilot-scale reactors. Both performed well as BAF media, with reactor loads up to 12 kg COD m− 3 d and 4 kg suspended solids m− 3 d (based on working volumes). The most consistent effluent was obtained using the smaller medium since, at flow rates above 0. 4 l min− 1, the BAF using the larger medium produced an effluent containing more than 20 mg l− 1 of suspended solids for over 30 min after backwashing. Up to 70 % longer run times, as determined by reaching a <b>set</b> <b>head</b> loss, were recorded for the BAF containing the larger rather than the smaller medium. Additionally, the development of pressure above the smaller medium filter bed tended to be logarithmic rather than linear. Reactor profiles indicated that suspended solids removal did not occur over the full 2. 3 m depth of the columns. The BAF containing the smaller medium utilised a mean depth of 1. 7 ± 0. 3 m, whereas a mean depth of 2. 1 ± 0. 3 m was used by the larger medium BAF. Both the head loss development data and the suspended solids removal profiles indicated that the smaller medium BAF was underperforming as a filter...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Business Administration) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 The {{researcher}} is an IT {{business manager}} for Woolworths Pty Ltd and manages franchise and back-office applications. Contained in the back-office systems environment is a competency area called Store Productivity, {{which has to}} implement tools and technology {{to assist with the}} creation of a more effective “store environment”. The researcher was tasked with implementing a web-based store portal that would facilitate store communications and automated task management for such stores. The findings from this research study will allow for reflection against the <b>set</b> <b>Head</b> Office business requirements as well as end user expectations and subsequently provide an opportunity to process alternate courses of action or solutions for future releases or upgrades of such applications if required. The researcher pursued a hybrid research approach that was both participatory and evaluative in nature. The reason taken for this approach was that research presents a unique opportunity to assess the criteria against a predetermined “super user group” as well as the eventual intended users being store and divisional managers. The “super user group” was defined as the group of key individuals that understand current and future business processes very well. They will also be involved {{in the design of the}} new solution and will provide critical feedback to the overall project. The view around what user requirements were, have been taken into account and a quantitative component was used to assess whether the original view taken had been met. It is believed that the sample and findings is representative of the targeted population of users of the system. This is further examined in chapters three and four of this study. Effective mitigation of risks inherent in implementing a new technology is vital to the success thereof. The implementation considerations validated through the research conducted were to highlight the critical success factors for the Woolworths implementation and provide recommendations for future releases. These recommendations are contrasted with best practice models in communication, project management and systems development. The findings generated from the research process suggest that business communication and broader business engagement commence immediately at the point of business case formulation, thereby creating awareness and should continue throughout the implementation process to encourage buy- in and use of the solution in the operational environment. The adoption and implementation of the recommended strategies will contribute positively towards future implementations of this nature...|$|E

40|$|Progressive {{addition}} lenses (PALs) are {{an increasingly}} preferred mode for the correction of presbyopia, gaining an increased {{share of the}} prescription lens market. Sales volumes are likely to increase {{over the next few}} years, given the increasing cohort of presbyopic patients in the population. This research investigated adaptation to PAL wear, investigating head movement parameters with and without progressive lenses in everyday visual tasks, and examined symptoms of spatial distortions and illusory movement in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs. Minimum displacement thresholds in the presence and absence of head movement were also investigated across the lens designs. Experiment 1 investigated head movements in two common visual tasks, a wordprocessing copy task, and a visual search task designed to replicate a natural environment task such as looking for products on supermarket shelving. Head movement parameters derived from this experiment were used to <b>set</b> <b>head</b> movement amplitude and velocity in the third experiment investigating minimum displacement thresholds across three PAL designs. Head movements were recorded with a Polhemus Inside Track head movement monitoring system which allows real time six degrees of freedom measurement of head position. Head position in azimuth, elevation and roll was extracted from the head movement recorder output, and data for head movement angular extent, average velocity (amplitude/duration) and peak velocity were calculated for horizontal head movements Results of the first experiment indicate a task dependent effect on head movement peak and average velocity, with both median head movement average and peak velocity being faster in the copy task. Visual task and visual processing demands were also shown to affect the slope of the main sequence of head movement velocity on head movement amplitude, with steeper slope in the copy task. A steeper slope, indicating a faster head movement velocity for a given head movement amplitude, was found for head movements during the copy task than in the search task. Processing demands within the copy task were also shown to affect the main sequence slopes of velocity on amplitude, with flatter slopes associated with the need for head movement to bring gaze to a specific point. These findings indicate selective control over head movement velocity in response to differing visual processing demands. In Experiment 2, parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity were assessed in a group of first time PAL wearers. Head movement amplitude, average and peak velocity were calculated from head movement recordings using the search task, as in Experiment 1. Head movements were recorded without PALs, on first wearing a PAL, and after one month of PAL wear to assess adaptation effects. In contrast to existing literature, PAL wear did not alter parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity in a group of first time wearers either on first wearing the lenses or after one month of wear: this is due to task related effects in this experiment compared to previous work. Task demand in this experiment may not have required wearers to use the progressive power corridor to accomplish identification of visual search targets, in contrast to previous studies where experimental conditions were designed to force subjects to use the progressive corridor. In Experiment 3, minimum displacement thresholds for random dot stimuli were measured in a repeated measures experimental design for a single vision lens as control, and three PAL designs. Thresholds were measured in central vision, and for two locations in the temporal peripheral field, 30 ° temporal fixation and 10 ° above and below the horizontal midline. Thresholds were determined with and without the subjects' head moving horizontally in an approximate sinusoidal movement at a frequency of about 0. 7 Hz. Minimum displacement thresholds were not significantly affected by PAL design, although thresholds with PALs were higher than with a single vision lens control. Head movement significantly increased minimum displacement threshold across lens designs, by a factor of approximately 1. 5 times. Results indicate that the local measures of minimum displacement threshold determined in this experiment are not sensitive to lens design differences. Sensitivity to motion with PAL lenses may be more a global than a localized response. For Experiment 4, symptoms of spatial distortion and illusory movement were investigated in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs, and related to optical characteristics of the lenses. Peripheral back vertex powers of the PALs were measured at two locations in the right temporal zone of the lenses, 15. 6 mm temporal to the fitting cross, and 2. 7 m above and below the horizontal to the fitting cross. These locations corresponded to the zones of the lenses through which minimum displacement thresholds were measured in the previous experiment. The effect of subjects' self movement on symptoms is able to discriminate between PAL designs, although subjective symptoms alone were not related to the lens design parameters studied. Subjects' preference for one PAL design over the other designs studied in this experiment is inversely related to the effect on subject movement on their symptoms of distortion. An optical parameter, blur strength, derived from the power vector components of the peripheral powers, may indicate preference for particular PAL designs, as higher blur strength values are associated with lower lens preference scores. Head movement amplitude and velocity are task specific, and are also influenced by visual processing demands within tasks. PALs do not affect head movement amplitude and velocity unless tasks are made demanding or performed in less natural situations designed to influence head movement behaviour. Both head movement and PALs have large effects on minimum displacement thresholds; these effects may be due in part to complexity of the subjects' task within the experiment. Minimum displacement thresholds however were not influenced by PAL design. The most sensitive indicator for subject's preference of PALs was the effect of subjects' self movement on their perception of symptoms, rather than the presence of actual symptoms. Blur strength should be further investigated for its role in PAL acceptance...|$|E
