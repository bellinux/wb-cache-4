The analysis is classified 5 topics which are BIM <b>submit</b> <b>product</b> list, <b>submit</b> files format, availability of existing 2 D based products, BIM authoring tools and submit process. As a result, It needs a lot of effort to standardize BIM delivery system for road domain because BIM <b>submit</b> <b>product</b> list and BIM authoring tools are changable depending on BIM use cases.

For those areas, we have extracted {{a representative sample of}} scientific products, equal to the 10 % of the reference population of <b>submitted</b> <b>products,</b> to be evaluated both with peer review and biblometric methods. Our analysis shows that peer review and bibliometric evaluations exhibit a level of concordance higher than that observed among two different reviewers of the same article. In almost any scientific discipline, however, there is a systematic difference among peer and bibliometric evaluations: more specifically, bibliometric scores are on average significantly higher than those obtained with the peer review. Overall, our results obtained fully support the choice adopted in the Italian exercise of using both evaluation techniques in order to assess the quality of Italian research institutions. ...|$|R

Based on a review of current product recommendation mechanisms it devises a concept called APriori. APriori leverages the potential of auto-ID-enabled mobile phones (barcode/RFID) to receive and <b>submit</b> <b>product</b> ratings. Since mobile users cannot {{be expected to have}} the patience and time to compose text-based reviews on mobile phones, we introduce a new rating concept that allows users to generate new rating criteria. The concept is tailored to the limited attention and input options of mobile users in real-world environment. This work describes the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of APriori. For an evaluation we have taken the approach of interviewing 26 users in the frames of a formative user study, with the goal to further improve the system for an application in the real world. In addition, the paper discusses open issues regarding community-based product recommendations on mobile phones and proposes solutions...|$|R

We develop a theory of approval regulation in which an uninformed regulator may veto the submission of a better-informed firm.

We find that when experimentation is short, Type I errors (approving bad products) are more likely for <b>products</b> <b>submitted</b> by firms with lower experimentation costs (larger firms), while Type II errors (rejecting good products) should be concentrated among smaller firms.
