Historians conjecture that when he negotiated treaties with the local non-Comanche Indians, he believed those treaties would bind all Native Americans.

25|$|Leather, who {{was born}} in Scotland, played 16 games and kicked 11 goals for North Melbourne in a brief career which {{encompassed}} the 1932 and 1933 VFL seasons. He then appeared in four first-class cricket matches for Victoria in 1934 and 1935, taking 14 wickets at 26.07. On the back of these performances, he was picked to tour Ceylon and India with the Australian cricket team in 1935-36. Australia's Test team was touring South Africa at the time <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> second string side. As a result, the matches against India, which Leather took part in, were given first-class status but were not Test matches.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems likely}} that it was around Lichfield, rather than Enville, that Margaret Lowe and her sisters grew up, and that they came to {{maturity}} while living {{at least some of}} the time at Tymore. Their mother died while they were still children. Perhaps sensing that his profitable lessee was approaching death, Peter Roos sold the Tymore estate to William Skeffington in November 1593: The Skeffington family had held Fisherwick itself since the 1520s and Sir John had handed it over to his son William in 1587, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> natural extension to his estates in Staffordshire. In 1594 Skeffington leased the house at Tymore to Batholomew Farmer for ten years, so it cannot have bee occupied by Michael Lowe’s heirs at that date.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1983–84, {{the team}} was {{determined}} to erase {{the failures of the}} previous two campaigns and came close to doing <b>so.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> season of change for the North Stars and their fans, as Bill Mahoney, a defensive-minded teacher of the game, took over as coach. Very early in the season, a major trade shook the organization, all of Minnesota, and the NHL. The popular Bobby Smith was shipped off to the Montreal Canadiens for a pair of defense-minded forwards, Keith Acton and Mark Napier. The team would go on to post the second-highest victory total in its history with 39, and win its second Norris Division crown in three years. Luckily for the North Stars, the Norris Division was very weak that year; they were the only team in the division to have a winning record that season.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the other}} {{multi-engined}} jet aircraft in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) directly attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized interference drag, but had the major operational disadvantage that an uncontained fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as anti-flutter weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|Following the season, Roux {{retired as}} manager of Auxerre after {{managing}} the club for 44 straight seasons. He was replaced with former France national team coach Jacques Santini. During the season, Diaby featured early on during the campaign, but as the season wore on, he struggled with injuries, which subsequently, led to the player failing to gain the confidence of Santini. Unlike fellow youngsters Sagna and Kaboul who were quickly establishing themselves at their respective positions, Diaby only featured in five league matches {{during the first half}} of the season. The midfielder did score his first professional goal on 10 September 2005 in a 3–1 loss to Rennes. In Europe, Diaby featured as a starter in the team's first round defeat to Bulgarian club Levski Sofia in the UEFA Cup. Midway through the campaign, Diaby was deemed surplus to requirements by management. Following the sale of the player, vice-president Gérard Bourgoin declared that, [...] "We have always kept the young players which our coach wanted to use, but Diaby did not play, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strategic sale for us." ...|$|E
