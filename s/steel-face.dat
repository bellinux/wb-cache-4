60|$|There is {{pleasure}} in the wet, wet clay, When the artist's hand is potting it; There is {{pleasure in}} the wet, wet lay, When the poet's pad is blotting it; There is {{pleasure in the}} shine of your picture on the line At the Royal Acade-my; But the pleasure felt in these is as chalk to Cheddar cheese When {{it comes to a}} well-made Lie: To a quite unwreckable Lie, To a most impeccable Lie! To a water-tight, fire-proof, angle-iron, sunk-hinge, time-lock, <b>steel-face</b> Lie! Not a private hansom Lie, But a pair-and-brougham Lie, Not a little-place-at-Tooting, but a country-house-with-shooting And a ring-fence-deer-park Lie.|$|E
60|$|The {{charge that}} Sir James Lee {{had given to}} Myles to strike at his adversary's helm {{was a piece of}} advice he {{probably}} would not have given to so young a knight, excepting as a last resort. A blow perfectly delivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the recipient to recover from, but then a blow upon the helm was not one time in fifty perfectly given. The huge cylindrical tilting helm was so constructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one point. That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bands welded to the <b>steel-face</b> plates of the helm where it was weakened by the opening slit of the occularium, or peephole. In the very centre of this cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted together, and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given to be perfect, and that stroke Myles determined to attempt.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, the {{modified}} Proctor compaction test was developed as an ASTM standard. A higher and more relevant compaction standard was necessary. There were larger and heavier compaction equipment, like large vibratory compactors and heavier <b>steel-face</b> rollers. This equipment could produce higher dry densities in soils along with greater stability. These improved properties {{allowed for the}} transport of far heavier truck loads over roads and highways. During the 1970s and early 1980s {{the modified}} Proctor test became more widely used as a modern replacement for the standard Proctor test.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the art of line {{engraving}} during {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century, is one of continued decay. It was hoped that technical improvements might save the art, but by the beginning of the 20th century, pictorial line engraving in England was practically non-existent. The disappearance of the art is due to the fact that the public refused to wait for several years for proofs (some important proofs took as long as 12 years to create) when they could obtain their plates more quickly by other methods. The invention of <b>steel-facing</b> S copper plate enabled the engraver to proceed more quickly; but even in this case he can no more compete with the etcher than the mezzotint engraver can keep pace with the photogravure manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|Steel plates can be case {{hardened}} {{to ensure that}} they can print thousands of times with little wear. The copper plates used in traditional engraving and etching, which are softer and so much easier to work cannot be {{case hardened}} but can be steel-faced or nickel-plated by electroplating {{to increase the number of}} impressions that could be printed. From about 1860 the <b>steel-facing</b> of copper plates became widely used, and such prints tend also to be called steel engravings. It can be very difficult to distinguish between engravings on steel and steel-faced copper, other than by date. [...] The most reliable way of distinguishing between unfaced copper engraving and steel or steel-faced engraving is the [...] "lightness and delicacy of the pale lines" [...] in the latter. The hardness of the plate surface made it possible to print a good number of impressions without the metal of the plate wearing the lines out under the pressure of repeated intaglio printing, which would have happened with unfaced copper. So [...] "A shimmering pale grey became for the first time a possibility in line engraving, and it is this that provides the most recognizable characteristic of steel beside the heavier and warmer mood of copper".|$|R
