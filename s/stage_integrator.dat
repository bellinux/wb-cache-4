40|$|International audienceA fully {{differential}} ASIC with cooled input termination {{is presented}} as a solution for the Upgrade of the Calorimeter front end electronics. The LHCb experiment needs to increase about ten times the integrated luminosity in order to study new physics. The increase in signal has to be compensated reducing the gain of the photomultipliers which implies stringent noise requirements. The proposed solution offers an active termination at the input and avoids the noise originated by the use of a resistor.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} architecture {{alternatives for}} delta-sigma modulators in two areas: high-speed operation based on time-interleaving and low-voltage environment by exploiting the input-feedforward concept. Parallelism based on time-interleaving {{can be used}} to increase the speed of delta-sigma modulators. A novel single-path time-interleaved architecture is derived and analyzed. Finite opamp gain and bandwidth result in a mismatch between the noise transfer functions of the internal quantizers which degrades the performance of the new modulator. Two techniques are presented to mitigate the mismatch problem: a hybrid topology where the first <b>stage</b> uses multiple <b>integrators</b> {{while the rest of the}} modulator uses a single path of integrators and a digital calibration method. The input-feedforward technique removes the input-signal component from the internal nodes of delta-sigma modulators. The removal of the signal component reduces the signal swing and distortion requirements for the opamps. These characteristics enable the reliable implementation of delta-sigma modulators in modern CMOS technology. Two implementatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{particles}} accelerated in CERN accelerator chain reach high energies, {{topped by}} the particle energy at collision in the LHC, 7 GeV. During the operation, {{an amount of}} particles is inevitably lost from the beam. Depending {{on the extent of}} the losses, physical damage to machine components may be caused and the shower of secondary emission particles deposits energy in the surrounding equipment constituting the accelerator. The hadronic cascade also activates their materials, representing a hazard to the workers at CERN. In the LHC, the superconducting magnets that constitute the synchrotron lattice are kept at an operating temperature of 1 : 9 K through a cryogenic facility employing superliquid helium, the increase in their temperature potentially initiates a quench. In the SPS, the damage due to a lost beam is also visible. The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system has been developed to reliably protect the machines composing CERN’s accelerator chain and additionally provide information about the beam status: the system provides observations about local aperture restrictions, orbit distortion, beam oscillations and particle diffusion, allowing the operators to tune the machines, measure and maximize the efficiency of the chain. To achieve this, two types of particles detectors are distributed along the machines in the positions where the most intense losses are expected, typically where aperture limitations are present – for exa mple where the collimators are located. The main type of detector in use is the ionization chamber, albeit where a very high dose rate is expected Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) are employed instead. Both types of detectors are sensitive to the hardronic showers initiated by high energy particles and they are characterized by high linearity and accuracy with respect to the energy lost by the particles, a fast responses and good radiation tolerance. Where timely machine protection is in place, for every detector location the fraction of particles from the hardronic showers has been linked to the energy distribution within the coil through simulation-based analysis and maximum allowable energy value has been established. The signal from the detector is acquired by the front-end electronics and, where applicable, the measurement is compared with the threshold relevant for the considered ring location. As the dimensions of the accelerators varies greatly, the signal might be acquired, digitized in the accelerator tunnel and then sent to the surface electronics to be processed – as it happens in the LHC – or the complete processing may occur in a shielded facility closely located. In the former case, radiation tolerant electronics is required. In the LHC, when a threshold is exceeded, the beam permit signal is revoked and the circulating particles are directed towards the dump line. In machines employing warm magnets – such as the PS Booster – the beam parameters are tuned before the next injection, to increase the quality of the beam. A discrete components design of a current digitizer based on the current-to-frequency converter (CFC) principle has been studied in this work. The design targets at rather high input current compared to similar acquisition systems, with a maximum equal to 100 mA and a minimum of 1 nA, as required by the ionization chamber that will be employed in the Proton Synchrotron and Booster accelerators {{as well as in the}} LINAC 4. It allows the integral acquisition of currents of both polarities without requiring any configuration and provides a digital number having an LSB equal to a reference charge complemented with an additional fractional count through an ADC, to increase the resolution. Several architectural choices we considered for the front-end circuit, including charge balance <b>integrators,</b> dual-integrator input <b>stages,</b> <b>integrators</b> with switchable-capacitor, in both synchronous and asynchronous versions. The signal is processed by an FPGA and transmitted over a VME 64 x bus...|$|R

Power consumption is the major issue in VLSI Design.

40|$|Frequency {{filtering}} {{networks have}} numerous applications in consumer products. For high-speed and low-voltage systems, continuous-time filters are the preferred choice [...] -these filters {{have become very}} popular with the wireless industry. Unfortunately, continuous-time filters have a high production cost since they are not geared toward mass production. This thesis proposes an analog filter structure that can be both mass produced and customized for a particular application. Such a structure is possible {{through the use of}} a state-space approach, and log-domain filtering. First, a general state-space formulation is presented; a method of obtaining the state-space coefficients from an equivalent LC ladder network is described. Such a set of coefficients results in a realization with low noise and low sensitivity properties. Next, the effects of coefficient quantization on a state-space filter's response is examined. An optimization procedure is outlined to obtain the best approximation to the desired transfer function. In order to implement the proposed filter structure, a universal log-domain cell is presented. Such a cell can be used to produce the stages required by any filter design (input, output, and <b>integrator</b> <b>stages).</b> Using the universal log-domain cell, a systematic approach to realizing any arbitrary-order filter is described. Next, the peripheral components needed to complete the filter are presented. Included are a novel 8 -bit DAC, used to implement the programmable current sources that bias the filter, and V-to-I and I-to-V converters, used to interface the current-mode filter with voltage-mode instruments. Finally, experimental results from several prototype boards are used to verify the feasibility of the proposed filter structure. These boards make use of ICs fabricated in a 0. 8 mum BiCMOS technology; included are an IC with stand-alone programmable current sources, an IC with a third-order filter, as well as one with a fifth-order filter. The results from the test boards clearly demonstrate the programmability and functionality of digitally programmable state-space filters...|$|R
40|$|Transformation from product {{oriented}} to more service oriented business models {{has been observed}} to create various advantages for companies especially in current competitive situation, where competition with price is pressing the profit margins down. Without proper knowledge on how business models are created, particularly in product-service systems context, this transformation can be difficult or even make or break the company. Furthermore, the literature considering business models for product service systems is still rather uncommon Thus this study aimed at shedding light on business model creation process in practice, describing what role an external researcher can have in this process and mapping the situation and attitudes towards services in engineering workshops. This study was implemented as multi-method qualitative research and single case study, which focused on the case company’s business model creation process. In data collection of the study, observations of the case company’s process of creating business model were made. In addition, the interview study in engineering workshops was used to map the current situation of product-service systems in these traditionally product oriented companies. Moreover, the observations were used to illustrate external researcher’s role in case company’s business model creation process. The literature review described development of product-service systems and business model creation, taking also in consideration the construction industry context. It covered, furthermore, consultant client relationship and its characteristics. Based on this research it may {{be said that the}} process of business model creation in case company revolved around similar issues as it does in the current literature, such as market segmentation and customer analysis. On the other hand, the process in the case company had not quite reached the business model described in the literature when data collection for this thesis ended. It remained more on business planning level. Additionally, research supported the views in which there is place for competitor element in business model framework. This study also supports earlier views; traditionally product oriented engineering workshops are still, according to this study, clearly more product than service oriented. There are clear differences in how these companies see overall service and how they view services in their companies, but in general workshops seemed to be rather close to each other at the assembly or system <b>integrator</b> <b>stage.</b> Considering researcher’s role in project several similar challenges and advantages in cooperation have been recognized as in the current literature. Information flow and mutual trust are observed to be extremely important, and careful consideration on how to use an external researcher is deemed valuable...|$|R
