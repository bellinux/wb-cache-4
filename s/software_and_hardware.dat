In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the ReactOS project {{announced}} an Indiegogo campaign to launch ReactOS Community Edition, {{a version of}} ReactOS based on the 0.4 release. The flexible funding campaign had a goal of US$50,000 with additional stretch goals beyond that. Development of ReactOS Community Edition would be community-centric, with ReactOS users voting and funding to decide which <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> drivers the project will aim to support. On 1 June 2014, the flexible crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo was finished with raising $25,141 {{for the development of}} the community edition, and the voting process to support hardware and software was started shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a wireless modem, and other <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, wearable devices and other devices.|$|E
5|$|Wink is a {{brand of}} <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> {{products}} that connects with and controls smart home devices from a consolidated user interface. Wink, Labs Inc., which develops and markets Wink, was founded in 2014 as a spin-off from invention incubator Quirky. After Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink to Flex in 2015. As of 2016, the Wink software is connected to 1.3 million devices. In July 2017, Flex sold Wink to i.am+ for $38.7M.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry. This in turn led {{to the establishment of}} many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became {{the first of a series}} of networks which evolved into the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{features}} Windows Color System (WCS), {{a platform}} for color management. Its goal is to obtain color consistency across various <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware,</b> including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners. Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC Color Profiles.|$|E
