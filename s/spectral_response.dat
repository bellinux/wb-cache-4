40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{thorough}} theoretical and experimental {{analysis of the}} generation and detection of coherent phonons in superlattices by optical femtosecond pulses. We focus on the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> of both phenomena in pump-probe experiments. The samples consist of two GaAs/AlAs superlattices separated by an intermediate layer through which phonons can propagate. The spatial decoupling of the generation and detection stages in one and the other supperlattice enables the individualization of each phenomenon. We clearly verify experimentally the selection rules for the generation and detection processes, which translate into well-defined maxima at specific frequencies in the corresponding <b>spectral</b> <b>responses.</b> A thickness gradient {{in one of the}} superlattices adds a degree of freedom that permits the variation of the spectral detuning between the maxima in the generation and in the detection <b>spectral</b> <b>responses.</b> The zero-detuning case is investigated. In the analysis of both <b>spectral</b> <b>responses,</b> the full size of the sample is found to play a significant role. Thin (similar to 3 mu m) and thick (similar to 350 mu m) samples are compared. Backreflection of light at sample outer surfaces and inner interfaces induces important alterations to the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> as well...|$|R

2500|$|The SSI was an 800-by-800-pixel {{solid state}} camera {{consisting}} of an array of silicon sensors called a charge-coupled device (CCD). Galileo {{was one of the}} first spacecraft to be equipped with a CCD camera. [...] The optical portion of the camera was built as a Cassegrain telescope. Light was collected by the primary mirror and directed to a smaller secondary mirror that channeled it through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and onto the CCD. The CCD sensor was shielded from radiation, a particular problem within the harsh Jovian magnetosphere. The shielding was accomplished by means of a [...] thick layer of tantalum surrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The <b>spectral</b> <b>response</b> of the SSI ranged from about 0.4 to 1.1micrometres. The SSI weighed [...] and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the use of}} the Transverse Field Detector (TFD) as a device for {{multispectral}} image acquisition is proposed. The TFD is a color imaging pixel capable of color reconstruction without color filters. Its basic working principle is based on the generation of a suitable electric field configuration inside a Silicon depleted region by means of biasing voltages applied to surface contacts. With respect to previously proposed methods for performing multispectral capture, the TFD has a unique characteristic of electrically tunable <b>spectral</b> <b>responses.</b> This feature allows capturing an image with different sets of <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> (RGB, R'G'B', and so on) simply by tuning the device biasing voltages in multiple captures. In this way no hardware complexity (no external filter wheels or varying sources) is added with respect to a colorimetric device. The estimation of the spectral reflectance of the area imaged by a TFD pixel is based in this work on a linear combination of six eigenfunctions. It is shown that a spectral reconstruction can be obtained either (1) using two subsequent image captures that generate six TFD <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> or (2) using a new asymmetric biasing scheme, which allows the implementation of five <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> for each TFD pixel site in a single configuration, definitely allowing one-shot multispectral imaging...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a feature selection method to detect skin tumors on chicken carcasses using hyperspectral data. A chicken skin tumor is an ulcerous lesion that {{is surrounded by}} a rim of thickened skin. Detection of chicken tumors is a difficult detection problem because chicken tumors are of many sizes and shapes; some tumors appear on the side of chicken. In addition, different areas of normal chicken skins have a variety of hyperspectral response variations, some of which are very similar to the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> of tumors. Similarly, different tumors have different <b>spectral</b> <b>responses.</b> Thus, proper training is needed and many false alarms are expected. Since the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> on the lesion and thickened skin regions of tumors are considerably different, we train our feature selection algorithm to detect lesions and thickened skin separately; we then morphologically process the resultant images and we fuse the two detection results to reduce false alarms. Forward selection and modified branch and bound algorithms are used to select a small number of features that are useful for discrimination. Initial results show that our method has a good tumor detection rate and a low false alarm rate...|$|R
2500|$|The photocathodes {{can be made}} of {{a variety}} of materials, with {{different}} properties. Typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission, causing noise and dark current, especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials are Ag-O-Cs (also called S1) transmission-mode, sensitive from 300–1200nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled; GaAs:Cs, caesium-activated gallium arsenide, flat response from 300 to 850nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930nm; InGaAs:Cs, caesium-activated indium gallium arsenide, higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs, between 900–1000nm much higher signal-to-noise ratio than Ag-O-Cs; Sb-Cs, (also called S11) caesium-activated antimony, used for reflective mode photocathodes; response range from ultraviolet to visible, widely used; bialkali (Sb-K-Cs, Sb-Rb-Cs), caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy, similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection; [...] high-temperature bialkali (Na-K-Sb), can operate up to 175°C, used in well logging, low dark current at room temperature; multialkali (Na-K-Sb-Cs), (also called S20), wide <b>spectral</b> <b>response</b> from ultraviolet to near-infrared, special cathode processing can extend range to 930nm, used in broadband spectrophotometers; solar-blind (Cs-Te, Cs-I), sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet, insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320nm, Cs-I at 200nm).|$|E

40|$|Wetlands are {{sites of}} {{important}} biogeochemical processes and remote sensing {{because of its}} capability for collecting data at various spatial scales, frequent intervals, and in several parts of electromagnetic spectrum, {{has been used by}} scientists to examine wetlands. This technology is especially useful in regions which are inaccessible and/or where data collection with conventional methods is not cost effective. Yet, various research questions, related to wetlands in general and inland freshwater wetlands in particular, have been overlooked and are still unanswered. ^ This research was focused on three aspects of wetland vegetation: (1) to provide a basic understanding of the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> of the wetland vegetation over an entire growing season; (2) to understand the link between the <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> acquired in-situ by means of a hand-held sensor and an airborne sensor; and (3) to use <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> from both close range and airborne sensors in estimating leaf area index (LAI) for aquatic macrophytes. ^ It was observed that the amount of reflectance for all species changed over the growing season. In general, <b>spectral</b> <b>responses</b> for both individual species and mixed groups were statistically significantly different from one another in both the visible and NIR regions. The results also show that the best stage to distinguish species is flowering. It was found that the reflectance, in most cases, increased with an increase in the field of view (IFOV) of the sensor, and this change is statistically significant. Also, converting the radiometric resolution of the data from 16 bits to 8 bits resulted in an aggregation and loss of some information. In general, it can be concluded that close range hyperspectral data can be linked with airborne data spatially, radiometrically, and spectrally. Finally, it was determined that the near infrared (NIR) band and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) are the best single band and best vegetation index, respectively, to estimate LAI for wetland vegetation. Also, the best month of the year to predict LAI, in the wetland I studied, is July. ...|$|R
