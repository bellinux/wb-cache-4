40|$|In <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> echo train imaging all {{the data}} {{required}} for a two dimensional image is acquired {{from a series of}} echoes generated following a single RF excitation pulse. Spatial resolution is limited because all samples must be acquired before the signal decays. In this paper we show theoretically that more echoes and hence better spatial resolution can be obtained with <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> GRASE imaging than with either echo planar imaging or <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> RARE imaging. This conclusion holds for both conventional imaging hardware and specialized gradient hardware designed for EPI. High quality <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> GRASE images support the theoretical conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Spectral and {{temporal}} {{characteristics of a}} subpicosecond KrF excimer laser are determined {{with the use of}} a one meter spectrometer, a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> intensity autocorrelator, and a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> phase sensitive autocorrelator. Spectral analysis is shown to be a simple and sensitive method for aligning the laser system. Experimental results and model calculations show that the center of the laser spectrum is influenced by self phase modulation. Near the edge of the amplifier gain bandwidth, the spectrum is also influenced by the vibrational levels of the KrF upper state. To support the spectral analysis, temporal measurements are performed with <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> autocorrelators. Using a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> autocorrelator based on three photon fluorescence of XeF, the pulse width was measure at 477 fs. To determine the frequency chirp of the laser, a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> phase sensitive autocorrelator for ultraviolet lasers was designed, and preliminary tests were performed...|$|R

25|$|The {{siege of}} Plevna also signalled the {{introduction}} of the repeating rifle into European warfare. Russian troops at Plevna were largely armed with the M1869 Krnka, a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> lifting breech block conversion of the muzzle loading M1857 rifled musket even though some units had been reequipped with the more modern, but still <b>single</b> <b>shot,</b> Berdan rifle. The old Krnka was soundly outperformed by the more modern <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> Turkish Peabody-Martini rifles and {{it became clear that the}} new Berdan rifle had also been rendered obsolete even as it was being introduced into service, outclassed by the Turkish Winchester repeaters. Reports of the heavy losses suffered by the Russian army at the hands of the Turks at Plevna forced armies across Europe to begin the process of either reequipping with repeating rifles or finding a way to convert their existing <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> rifles into magazine fed weapons.|$|R
