5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the <b>string(s)</b> and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the <b>strings</b> are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has <b>strings</b> parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the <b>strings</b> extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

5|$|For guitars {{with six}} <b>strings,</b> every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so {{providing}} many options for fingering chords.

5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called <b>strings.</b> These <b>strings</b> look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how <b>strings</b> propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of <b>strings</b> correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between <b>strings</b> and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between <b>strings</b> and branes was reduced to a relationship between <b>strings</b> and <b>strings,</b> and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the null <b>string</b> {{origin of the}} ambitwistor <b>string.</b> Classically, the null <b>string</b> is the tensionless limit of <b>string</b> theory, and so too is the Ambitwistor <b>string.</b> Both have as {{constraint}} algebra the Galilean Conformal Algebra in two dimensions. But something interesting happens in the quantum theory since there is an ambiguity in quantizing the null <b>string.</b> We show that, given a particular choice of quantization scheme and a particular gauge, the null <b>string</b> coincides with the ambitwistor <b>string</b> both classically and quantum mechanically.
