40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{analysis}} of a potential mission scenario {{that could be used for}} testing the Electric Solar Wind Sail (E-sail). Such a propulsive system is more efficient outside the Earth’s magnetosphere, so a translunar mission (where the spacecraft is supposed to be inserted as a secondary payload) is hypothesized, in which at least a part of the spacecraft trajectory is around or beyond the Moon’s orbit. The analysis of potential <b>selenocentric</b> trajectories is conducted with a three-dimensional generalization of the classical patched conic approximation.

40|$|The Moon-to-Earth {{low energy}} trajectories of ‘detour ’ type are found and studied within {{the frame of}} the Moon–Earth–Sun-particle system. These trajectories use a passive flight to the Earth from an initial {{elliptic}} <b>selenocentric</b> orbit with a high aposelenium. The Earth perturbation increases the particle <b>selenocentric</b> energy from a negative value first to zero and then to a positive one and therefore leads to a passive escape of the particle motion from the Moon attraction near the translunar libration point L 2. This results in the particle flight to a distance of about 1. 5 million km from the Earth where the Sun gravitation decreases the particle orbit perigee distance to a small value that leads to the particle approaching the Earth vicinity in about 100 days of the flight.

To decrease the energy consumption for the transfer, an intermediate geocentric orbit with the capture by the Moon is used in this trajectory. During a passive motion along this orbit, the SC comes in the Lunar sphere of influence near the libration point L 1 and goes to the Moon along a <b>selenocentric</b> elliptic orbit. The trajectory for the transfer between the EAS and MAS orbits is studied in frame of the four-body problem (SC, Earth with its oblateness, Moon and Sun). The control is performed by a low thrust.

Primary sporadic and stream meteoroids impacting the surface of the moon at hypervelocity was proposed as the source of micron and submicron particles that leave the lunar craters with velocities sufficient to escape the moon's gravitational sphere of influence. No enhanced flux of lunar ejecta with masses greater than a nanogram was detected by LE 35 or the Lunar Orbiters. Hypervelocity meteoroid simulation experiments concentrating on ejecta production combined with extensive analyses of the orbital dynamics of micron and submicron lunar ejecta in <b>selenocentric,</b> cislunar, and geocentric space have shown that a pulse of these lunar ejecta, with a time correlation relative to the position of the moon relative to the earth, intercepts the earth's magnetopause surface (EMPs).

40|$|More {{and more}} {{stringent}} and unique mission requirements motivate to exploring solutions, {{already in the}} preliminary mission analysis phase, going far beyond the classical chemical-Keplerian approach. The present dissertation deals with the analysis and the design of highly non linear orbits arising both from the inclusion of different gravitational sources in the dynamical models, and {{from the use of}} electric system for primary propulsion purposes. The equilibrium of different gravitational fields, on one hand, permits unique transfer solutions and operational orbits, on the other hand, the high thrust efficiency, characteristic of an electric device, reduces the propellant mass required to accomplish the transfer. Each of these models, and even better their combination, enables trajectories able to satisfy mission requirements not otherwise met, first of all to reduce the propellant mass fraction of a given mission. The inclusion of trajectory arcs powered by an electric thruster, providing a low thrust for extended duration, makes essential the use of optimal control theory in order to govern the thrust law and thus design the required transfers so as to minimizing/maximizing specific indexes. The goal is, firstly, to review the possible advantages and the main limits of dynamical models and, afterward, to define methodologies to preliminary design non-Keplerian missions both in interplanetary contexts and in the Earth-Moon system. Special emphasis is given to the study of dynamical systems through which the main features of the Circular Restricted Three Body Model (the first one among the non-Keplerian models) can be identified, implemented and used. Purely ballistic solutions enabled by this model are first independently explored and after considered as target orbits for electric thrusting phases. Electric powered arcs are used to link ballistic phases arising from the balancing of different gravitational influences. This concept is applied both for the exploration of planetary regions and for interplanetary transfer purposes. Together with low thrust missions to <b>selenocentric</b> orbits designed taking into account both the Earth and the Moon gravity, also transfer solutions toward periodic orbits moving in the Earth-Moon region are presented. These are designed considering electric thrusting arcs and ballistic segments exploring for free specific space regions.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a set of}} post-Newtonian reference frames for a comprehensive study of the orbital dynamics and rotational motion of Moon and Earth by means of lunar laser ranging (LLR) with the precision of one millimeter. We work {{in the framework of}} a scalar-tensor theory of gravity depending on two parameters, and, of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism and utilize the concepts of the relativistic resolutions on reference frames adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2000. We assume that the solar system is isolated and space-time is asymptotically flat at infinity. The primary reference frame covers the entire space-time, has its origin at the solarsystem barycenter (SSB) and spatial axes stretching up to infinity. The SSB frame is not rotating with respect to a set of distant quasars that are assumed to be at rest on the sky forming the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). The secondary reference frame has its origin at the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB). The EMB frame is locally-inertial with its spatial axes spreading out to the orbits of Venus and Mars, and is not rotating dynamically in the sense that equation of motion of a test particle moving with respect to the EMB frame, does not contain the Coriolis and centripetal forces. Two other local frames - the geocentric (GRF) and the <b>selenocentric</b> (SRF) frames - have their origins at the center of mass of Earth and Moon respectively and do not rotate dynamically. Each local frame is subject to the geodetic precession both with respect to other local frames and with respect to the ICRF because of the relative motion. The advantage of dynamically non-rotating local frames is in a more simple mathematical description. The set of the global and three local frames is introduced in order to fully decouple the relative motion of Moon with respect to Earth from the orbital motion of the Earth-Moon barycenter as well as to connect the coordinate description of the lunar motion, an observer on Earth, and a retro-reflector on Moon to directly measurable quantities such as the proper time and the round-trip laser-light distance. We solve the gravity field equations and find out the metric tensor and the scalar field in all frames, which description includes the post-Newtonian definition of the multipole moments of the gravitational field of Earth and Moon. We also derive the post-Newtonian coordinate transformations between the frames and analyze the residual gauge freedom imposed by the scalar-tensor theory on the metric tensor. The residual gauge freedom is used for removal spurious, coordinate-dependent post-Newtonian effects from the equations of motion of Earth and Moon. The work of Y.

40|$|Laser ranges between {{observatories}} on the Earth and retroreflectors on the Moon {{started in}} 1969 {{and continue to}} the present. Recent range accuracies are 2 cm while earliest ranges are an C, order of magnitude less certain. Four retroreflectors are ranged: three located at the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 sites {{and one on the}} Lunakhod 2 rover. Accurate analysis of the range data determines a number of lunar science parameters. The lunar interior variables include a fluid core parameter. The Lunar Laser Ranging effort is reviewed elsewhere. Many parameters are detected through their influence on rotation. Also detected are solid-body tides and accurate <b>selenocentric</b> reflector locations. Determined through the rotation are moment-of-inertia differences, gravitational harmonics, potential Love number, and dissipation effects due to tides and molten core. The rotation of the Moon is not at its minimum energy state; some recently active process has caused free librations. The moment differences contributed to the recent improvement of the Moon's moment of inertia from the Lunar Prospector gravity field. The Love numbers provide bulk elastic properties. Future possibilities for measurement include oblateness of the core-mantle boundary and core moment. A study of dissipation signatures in the rotation determines tidal Q vs. frequency and concludes that the Moon has a molten core. At 1 month the tidal Q is 37 and at 1 yr it is 60. The core radius is < or = 352 km for Fe and < or = 374 km for the Fe-FeS eutectic. The core detection exceeds 3 x its uncertainty. The spin of the core is not aligned with the spin of the mantle and torque arises from the velocity difference at the boundary. Yoder's turbulent boundary layer theory is used to compute the radii. The present heat generation from tides and core interaction is minor compared to radiogenic heating. The heating for ancient times is more interesting. Peale and Cassen investigated lunar tidal heating while the lunar orbit expanded due to tides on Earth. Their calculations predate the measurement of Q and should be multiplied by 3. 45 to match the lunar-laser-determined Love number and monthly Q. Tidal-heating computations depend on how fast the lunar orbit evolved and whether the tidal dissipation is localized. Neither is known, but plausible assumptions lead to early central region temperature increases of several hundred degrees. Most of the energy is deposited early in the Moon's history. The turbulent boundary layer theory allows a prediction of energy dissipated at the core-mantle boundary during orbit evolution. Under the assumption that the properties of the early core are the same as at present, the energy dissipated by core-mantle interaction is about the same as for tidal dissipation, but it is deposited in a smaller volume. This source of energy is capable of promoting convection in an early fluid core and driving a dynamo. This is a transient phase with a duration depending on the rate of orbit evolution. Plausible assumptions lead to a duration of a few hundred million years. Thus, the remnant magnetization of many lunar rocks is compatible with a brief global magnetic field powered by dynamical energy dissipation. Analysis of the lunar laser ranges is providing information on lunar geophysics. Future data will improve accuracies of present solution parameters, and several more interior effects should be detectable...|$|E
