5|$|After {{winning the}} December elections, the Fraser {{government}} took {{the approach that}} trade with <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> political ties with Southeast Asia were {{too important to be}} put at risk for what was seen as a lost cause.

5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system.

Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments.
