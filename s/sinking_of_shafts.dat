The tunnel was finally ready in 1890, the open air section from Cymmer to Blaengwynfi opening on 2 June 1890, followed by opening through the tunnel to Blaengwynfi on 2 July 1890; the short connection from there to the junction with the Taff Vale Railway followed on 14 July 1890. The Rhondda Tunnel was the longest wholly in Wales, at 3,443 yards. The Taff Vale station at Treherbert was used as the terminal station, and from there a quarter mile of Taff Vale track was used to reach Blaenrhondda Junction (later R Junction), where the R itself started. A stiff climb followed to the mouth of the Rhondda Tunnel, and the climb continued in the tunnel, to the summit at the south-western end at Blaengwynfi. From there the line descended steeply.|$|E

First mining {{activities}} started in 1851. Shaft 2 (sunk simultaneously with shaft 1) was opened in 1852. Both shafts featured visually identical stone towers and shared a machine house. This concept was to be adapted by many later twin-shaft coal mines.|$|R

50|$|Bickershaw {{is located}} on the Wigan Coalfield, part of the Lancashire Coalfield, and {{required}} the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>shafts</b> to access the coal. However, access to transport via the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Plank Lane made the distribution of the product relatively easy.|$|R
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{landmark in}} Palmer {{is the old}} coal shaft. At one time it was {{the dream of a}} group of citizens in the area to sink a coal mine, bringing industry, employment, and fuel to the community. The sight selected to sink the mine was in the southwest edge of town, {{on the north side of}} the railroad. According to ledgers still in existence, kept on <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shaft,</b> MacDonald and Bro., did the drilling. On March 30, 1872, the first share of stock was sold to Suplines Judd for $100. Many other shares were also sold for $100, some for $70 and some for $50. A total of seventy-two shares were sold in the amount of $5,460. Corporation papers were recorded on June 14, 1872. The cost <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> the <b>shaft</b> was $2.50 per foot, and it is believed that the depth was approximately 500 ft. The last entry made in the ledger was Nov. 3, 1873, the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shaft</b> was abandoned with no reason given.|$|R
50|$|In 1880, <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> another <b>shaft</b> 3 {{began in}} {{neighboring}} Schonnebeck. It received a steel framework as its winding tower and was opened in 1883. By 1890, the three shafts already had an output of 1 million tons, placing Zollverein {{on top of}} all German mines.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> two <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> the Windsor Colliery {{commenced}} in 1895 by the Windsor Colliery Co. Ltd, to a {{depth of}} around 2,018 feet. The first coal was raised in 1902, with the workings connected underground to the Universal Colliery in Senghenydd for ventilation purposes. The mine was serviced by the Senghenydd branch line of the Rhymney Railway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sinking</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> Maltby Colliery began in 1907, {{as part of}} the development a large estate known as the [...] "Model Village" [...] was constructed as housing for the colliery workers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} supply Dinslaken's {{ironworks}} with coke the industrialists Fritz Thyssen, Joseph Thyssen, August Thyssen {{as well as}} the assessor Arthur Jacob founded the mining corporation Lohberg on December 30, 1905. In 1907 <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shafts</b> Lohberg 1 and Lohberg 2 began at the country road between Dinslaken and HÃ¼nxe.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} founded in 1804, {{following}} the first <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> mine <b>shafts</b> at neighbouring Whitwell. There was great resentment in Whitwell {{at this time to}} the influx of coal miners, and so the Welbeck Abbey estate agreed to Hodthorpe's foundation. The village was on the local branch railway line, with its own (now disused) halt.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the many {{individual}} pits transferred to larger mine complexes with central shafts, at which point the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> inclined <b>shafts</b> and the mixing of layout and equipment with the workings was abandoned entirely. The central, vertical shafts lay in the host rock (usually in the hanging wall), just as permanently established as the main gangways (usually in the footwall).|$|R
50|$|Around 1700 {{poor quality}} coal was found, {{close by the}} surface, just over the River Don from Mexborough and this, in time, led to the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> two <b>shafts,</b> in 1863, for Denaby Main Colliery Company, owned by Messrs Pope and Pearson. The Barnsley bed was reached in September 1867 {{at a depth of}} more than 1,266 feet. In 1893 the company also opened out Cadeby Main Colliery.|$|R
50|$|In October 1874, at the {{ceremony}} for turning the first sod of earth to start the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> two <b>shafts</b> for the Micklefield pit, Mr. Joseph Cliff, senior partner of the Micklefield Coal and Lime Company, expressed his earnest wish that the works begun that day might prosecuted and completed without the slightest accident to life or limb, and that a spirit of respect and union might at all times prevail between employers and employed.|$|R
50|$|Work resumed on {{the mine}} after the war, {{and at the}} <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>shaft</b> in January 1946, B.A. Collieries Ltd. {{chairman}} Claude Lancaster M.P {{said that it was}} estimated that beneath the surface there might be 125 million tons of coal, which if one thousand men were to produce a million tons every year, would provide employment for 125 years. This was to be the last privately sunk shaft, before the coal industry was nationalised on 1 January 1947 and became the property of the National Coal Board (NCB). Since government plans to take the industry into public ownership were a Labour Party manifesto commitment of the post-war election, it seems possible that the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the coal-winding <b>shaft</b> by B.A. Collieries Ltd, before nationalisation, was to ensure the payment of compensation.|$|R
50|$|The 1833 <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} <b>shaft</b> at Haswell Colliery, nestled between Haswell and Haswell Plough, saw {{hundreds}} of miners from around Britain {{flock to the}} area. New houses, churches, schools, pubs and shops were all built to accommodate their needs, {{as well as a}} thriving railway station, now long gone.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the tunnel began with <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>shafts</b> in 2010. In February 2012, the TBM, built by Herrenknecht and named Busy Lizzie, started work at the Beckton end. In 2013, a UK record concrete slipform pour was achieved, with 29 days of continual pouring. The tunnel is the deepest tunnel ever bored in London, exceeding the Crossrail excavations. The TBM reached Abbey Mills in January 2014. The tunnel was completed, and opened by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, in January 2016.|$|R
50|$|The Anglo Saxon mine area {{provides}} {{evidence of}} reef mining, a practice uncommon {{south of the}} Palmer River. Reef mining involved the working of surface deposits and if the results warranted it, the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>shafts.</b> Such activities required additional equipment such as boilers, pumps and winding equipment. Examples of this machinery remain in situ at the Anglo Saxon Mine including a rare and intact Robey undertype semi-portable steam engine probably dating to the 1880s. This is the most intact undertype engine recorded on a Queensland mining site.|$|R
5000|$|The census {{carried out}} between the 3 and 5 June 1854 {{reported}} that there were 86 tents {{on the field and}} a population of 350, comprising 193 males, 58 females and 99 children. Until 1856 Rocky River gold field was small and of comparatively no importance to the remainder of the country. In February 1856 John Jones discovered a few specks of gold lying in cartwheel tracks on what is now known as Mt Jones. Jones's discovery then led to the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> deep-lead <b>shafts</b> in the vicinity and another rush into the area.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1847 with the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> seven {{vertical}} <b>shafts,</b> but the tunnel, which was 1747 yd in length, was not completed until 1853, work having been interrupted and slowed at times {{due to lack}} of funds. During construction illegal drinking houses were built and riots occurred in navvies' temporary accommodation near the tunnel's northern mouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of mineral wealth on {{other parts of}} the Baie Verte Peninsula led to the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> a mine <b>shaft</b> at Nipper's Harbour in the early 1900s. While nearby mining sites, notably Burton's Pond, Bett's Cove, and Tilt Cove, were able to deliver some mineral wealth, Nipperâs Harbour was never able to extract minerals of economic value.|$|R
50|$|The Duke of Newcastle owned {{mineral rights}} {{in much of}} north Nottinghamshire and {{north-east}} Derbyshire. After a seam of coal had been reached at Shireoaks in February 1859, the Shireoaks Colliery Company was formed, and was formally registered in December 1864. The began acquiring mining interests throughout the area, including Whitwell, Clowne and Steetley, where the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> a <b>shaft</b> began in May 1873. The miners reached a seam of coal in December 1875, and this created {{a turning point in}} the history of Worksop: from an agricultural town to an industrial powerhouse, boosting its population and creating a prosperous future.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the growth}} of the village is {{connected}} with the development of coal mines, particularly the Llay Main Colliery. It was first established by the industrialist Sir Arthur Markham in 1913, but <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shafts</b> was interrupted by the First World War and by Markham's death in 1916. The shafts were eventually completed in 1921, and coal production started in 1923. The colliery had a reputation as a well-run, modern pit with a relatively satisfied workforce, and by the 1930s was employing more than 3,000 men, 450 families being installed in new housing schemes in Llay.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1917 the pit {{was bought}} by Messrs. Barber, Walker & Co. for Â£80,100, {{becoming}} full owners in 1921 after the war repayments scheme. The <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shafts</b> was started with preliminary works in 1919, but the first real sinking started in 1921. Water problems were encountered but this was overcome with the solidification of the ground with liquid cement grout. On 29 October 1923 the shaft sinkers eventually reached the Barnsley seam at 848 m although there were problems with underground faults. The second shaft also reached the Barnsley seam on 15 November 1923.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, Mordecai Jones began <b>sinking</b> the <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> the Nantmelyn Colliery. After {{opening in}} 1860, by 1864 the Bwllfa Colliery Company were the owners. In 1867 they sunk a second [...] deep shaft, {{ventilated}} by Guibal fan. Brogden and Sons {{took over the}} colliery in 1873.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Taylor of Pontypridd {{began the}} {{development}} of Nantgarw colliery in May 1910, near {{the base of the}} Caerphilly Syncline seam. The <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the twin <b>shafts</b> in 1911 reached the coal seam at a depth of more than [...] in 1915, placing them 2000 ft below sea level, making Nantgarw the deepest pit to be sunk in the South Wales Coalfield up to that time.|$|R
5000|$|... 1855 - Under the {{supervision}} of William Thomas Mulvany the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> the Hibernia Mine in Gelsenkirchen is begun. As a technical innovation, tubbings {{was used for the}} shaft lining. In the following years, Mulvaney had a hand in the opening of several mines in the Emscherniederung, among them the Shamrock Mine in Herne und the Erin Mine in Castrop. The money came from Irish and Belgian financiers. Their coal was transported over the Cologne-Minden Railway.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Taylor of Pontypridd {{began the}} {{development}} of Nantgarw colliery in May 1910, near {{the base of the}} Caerphilly Syncline seam. The <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the twin <b>shafts</b> in 1911 reached the coal seam at a depth of more than 850 yards in 1915, placing them 2000 ft below sea level and making Nantgarw the deepest pit to be sunk in the South Wales Coalfield up to that time.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{closed because}} of Health and Safety issues, {{which would have}} almost doubled the cost <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> mine <b>shafts</b> and galleries, and because of {{changing}} pollution control legislation which {{would have made the}} owners liable for the quality of the mine discharge into the River Mawddach had the mine remained open.|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 1911, {{the investors}} in the Wykens Collieries formed the new Warwickshire Coal Company Ltd, {{to take over the}} mines of the Wykens company and develop the coal seam at Keresley. The <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> the Coventry Colliery were begun immediately. By 1913, the shafts had reached below the {{geographical}} reach of the single 114 ft <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> the Hawkesbury Junction steam engine pump house supplying water to both the Coventry and Oxford Canals. Originally built in 1821, it housed a Newcomen steam engine, which was brought from Griff Colliery, where it had already worked for 100 years. Named Lady Godiva, it was decommissioned in 1913 but left in place, moved to the Dartmouth Museum in the 1960s. This geographic resource meant that the colliery had an immediate outlet for its pumped-out water ingress.|$|R
50|$|The No. 2 and No. 3 Rhondda {{house and}} {{bituminous}} coals which outcrop along the valley were quickly proved and the Aber, Caedu and Tynewydd collieries were opened by drift mining {{driven into the}} seams from the mountain sides. In {{the latter part of}} 1865, John Brogden and Sons commenced the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>shafts</b> at the Wyndham Colliery to prove and work the high quality smokeless dry steam coals of the Lower Coal Measures.|$|R
