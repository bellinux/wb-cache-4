The effects of 3 - 25 ton da - 1 wastewater applications were also investigated in these experiments. In addition to these, the effects of different wastewater applications in four doses ranging from 6 to 24 were determined on with the treatment of 20 kg da - 1 15 : 15 : 15 NPK composed fertilizer. Significantly increases on the P (mg kg - 1) and K (mg kg - 1) contents of soils and N (g kg - 1), P (g kg - 1), K (g kg - 1), Ca (g kg - 1), Fe (mg kg - 1), Mn (mg kg - 1), Cu (mg kg - 1) and Zn (mg kg - 1) contents of leaves were observed. Increasing the doses of wastewater applications effected yield components positively. As a result of high dose application, a significant yield increase was also observed. When the wastewater was applied to soil, grain yield and nutrient content of barley increased considerably. There was no negative effect on protein content either. As a conclusion, <b>stabilized</b> <b>wastewater</b> can be used under controlled conditions in agricultural areas...|$|E

There presented a method of wastewater purification from pollutants such as dissolved components of urea-formaldehyde resins and free formaldehyde. This paper describes a method of pre-stabilization of wastewater for further treatment, which is achieved by precipitation of the condensation products of urea and formaldehyde. Stabilised wastewater is further subjected to processing by UV-radiation. In-vestigations were carried out with the wastewater, which were selected at the wood-processing enterprises of Belarus and wastewater has the following composition: formaldehyde content − 1. 0 − 5. 0 g/dm{ 3 }, chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the liquid phase – 15. 0 − 60. 0 g O[2]/dm{ 3 } of components UFR − 50. 0 − 80. 0 g/dm{ 3 }.

40|$|Wastewater {{stabilization}} is {{an essential}} component of the spacecraft water cycle. The purpose of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wastewater</b> is two-fold. First, stabilization prevents the breakdown of urea into ammonia, a toxic gas at high concentrations. Second, it prevents the growth of microorganisms, thereby mitigating hardware and water quality issues due to due biofilm and planktonic growth. Current stabilization techniques involve oxidizers and strong acids (pH= 2) such as chromic and sulfuric acid, which are highly toxic and pose a risk to crew health. The purpose of this effort is to explore less toxic stabilization techniques, such as food-grade and commercial care preservatives. Additionally, certain preservatives were tested {{in the presence of a}} low-toxicity organic acid. Triplicate 300 -mL volumes of urine were dosed with a predetermined quantity of stabilizer and stored for two weeks. During that time, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), ammonia, and turbidity were monitored. Those preservatives that showed the lowest visible microbial growth and stable pH were further tested in a six-month stability study. The results of the six-month study are also included in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Composting is {{commonly}} used as {{an effective means of}} <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wastewater</b> biosolids and reducing pathogens to very low concentrations. However, {{it has been shown that}} under certain conditions Salmonella can regrow in previously composted biosolids. Growth of seeded Salmonella typhimurium in composted biosolids ranging from two weeks to two years maturity was monitored. Results from sterile and non-sterile composted biosolids were compared. Seeded S. typhimurium colonized rapidly in sterilized biosolids reaching a maximum population density of more than 108 g- 1. Growth of seeded S. typhimurium was suppressed in non-sterilized compost with a maximum population density of less than 103 g- 1. There was a significant decline in the growth rate of seeded Salmonella in sterilized compost when the compost was stored, suggesting that bio-available nutrients declined with storage. However, in non-sterilized compost this was not the case. This suggests that the indigenous microflora play a significant role in suppression of Salmonella regrowth in composted biosolids. There was a strong negative correlation (- 0. 85) between the Salmonella inactivation rate and the maturity of compost in non-sterilized compost. The Salmonella inactivation rate was seven times higher in biosolids composting for two weeks as compared to compost stored for two years. This suggests that the antagonistic effect of indigenous microorganisms towards Salmonella declined with compost storage. It was concluded that all composted biosolids had a Salmonella regrowth potential. However, the indigenous microflora significantly reduced this regrowth potential. Long-term storage of compost is not recommended as this may increase the pathogen regrowth potential...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{implement}} new water quality standards, increase water reuse and reclamation, and minimize {{the cost of}} waste storage motivate {{the development of new}} processes for <b>stabilizing</b> <b>wastewater</b> residuals that minimize waste volume, water content and the long-term environmental risk from related by-products. This work explores the use of an aqueous-based emulsion process to create an epoxy/rubber matrix for separating and encapsulating waste components from salt laden, arsenic contaminated, amorphous iron hydrate sludges. Such sludges are generated from conventional water purification precipitation/adsorption processes, used to convert aqueous brine streams to semi-solid waste streams, such as ion exchange/membrane separation, and from other precipitative heavy metal removal operations. In this study, epoxy and polystyrene butadiene (PSB) rubber emulsions are mixed together and then combined with a surrogate sludge. The surrogate sludge consists of amorphous iron hydrate with 1 part arsenic fixed {{to the surface of the}} hydrate per 10 parts iron mixed with sodium nitrate and chloride salts and water. The resulting emulsion is cured and dried at 80 °C to remove water. Microstructure characterization by electron microscopy confirms that the epoxy/PSB matrix surrounds and encapsulates the arsenic laden amorphous iron hydrate phase while allowing the salt to migrate to internal and external surfaces of the sample. Salt extraction studies indicate that the porous nature of the resulting matrix promotes the separation and removal of as much as 90 % of the original salt content in only one hour. Long term leaching studies based on the use of the infinite slab diffusion model reveal no evidence of iron migration or, by inference, arsenic migration, and demonstrate that the diffusion coefficients of the unextracted salt yield leachability indices within regulations for non-hazardous landfill disposal. Because salt is the most mobile species, it is inferred that arsenic leaches from the host material at an even slower rate, making the waste forms amenable to unregulated land disposal options. These results indicate that the environmentally-benign, water-based emulsion processing of epoxy/PSB polymeric hosts show great promise as a separation and fixation technology for treating brine streams from wastewater treatment facilities...|$|R

The present study records {{for the first time}} the aspects of zooplankton diversity in relation to physico-chemical environment of five selected sites of the East Calcutta wetlands, a Ramsar site of Kolkata city, India, heavily contaminated by industrial and municipal wastewaters. The study revealed the occurrence of 22 species of zooplankton, among these 3 species of Cladocera, 2 species of Copepoda, 15 species of Rotifera, and 2 species of Ostracoda were recorded. The copepod Mesocyclops leuckarti was found in all the five sites, rotifers Asplanchna brightwelli, Brachionus angularis, B. calyciflorus and Cladocera Ceriodaphnia cornuta were found in four sites; Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma sarsi were found at three sites. Site wise variation in dominance, diversity, evenness and richness were calculated. Site 1, a fish-pond that <b>stabilized</b> composite <b>wastewater,</b> showed the maximum species richness having 17 species, while Site 2, SWF wastewater carrying canal, showed only 4 species. The calculated Jack 1 values of Sites 1 to 5 were 21. 78, 3. 77, 18. 63, 12. 5 and 16. 95 respectively.

40|$|Thickened {{wastewater}} {{activated sludge}} was treated in 13 pilot-scale sludge treatment wetlands of various configurations that operated continuously {{for three years}} in North Greece. Sludge was loaded for approximately 2. 5 years, and the beds were left to rest for the remaining period. Three different sludge loading rates were used that represented three different population equivalents. Residual sludge stability and maturity were monitored for the last year. Sludge was regularly sampled and microbial respiration activity indices were measured via a static respiration assay. The phytotoxicity of sludge was quantified via a seed germination bioassay. Measurements of total solids, organic matter, total coliforms, pH and electrical conductivity were also made. According to microbial respiration activity measurements, the sludge end-product was classified as stable. The germination index of the final product exceeded 100 % in most wetland units, while final pH values were approximately 6. 5. The presence of plants positively affected the stability and maturity of the residual sludge end-product. Passive aeration did not significantly {{affect the quality of}} the residual sludge, while the addition of chromium at high concentrations hindered the sludge decomposition process.

30|$|As the {{reaction}} continues, {{the total amount}} of total organic matter, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter somewhat decreases. The reason is that they are converted into organic matter with a low MW when as a carbon source of the system in {{the reaction}} and are consumed to be biochemically reacted with the original soluble organic matter. In the A 2 /O process, the nitrification stage takes autotrophic nitrobacteria as the dominant species. The autotrophic nitrobacteria utilize ammonia in wastewater as energy and CO 2 as a sole carbon source to convert ammonia into NO 2 − and NO 3 −, and obtain energy for their growth needs simultaneously, thus enabling CO 2 to synthesize cellular organic matter. With no organic matter as the carbon source, there are no constraints from the low organic matter concentration in the course of nitrification. C/N mainly effects denitrification. Denitrification bacteria use oxygen of nitrate as electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment and organic matter in wastewater as the carbon source and the electron donor to supply energy and <b>stabilize</b> oxidation. When <b>wastewater</b> lacks organic matter, microorganisms consume their own protoplasm for endogenous denitrification, which reduces cellular matter and generates NH 3. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the carbon source is of great importance in denitrification. If the C/N ratio is too low, then denitrification lacks a carbon source, which leads to incomplete denitrification and a failure to remove nitrogen.|$|R

The study was started in July 1989 with support from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources. Waste stabilization ponds are considered the most economical and efficient method of waste water treatment of small communities. This form of wastewater treatment relies upon the natural ability of a body of water to achieve self-purification. Self-purification involves the reduction of the bacterial content, satisfying the biochemical oxygen demands of the <b>wastewater,</b> <b>stabilizing</b> the organic content) and returning the dissolved oxygen content to desirable levels. Overall efficiency of waste stabilization ponds is a function of many interacting processes. The objective of the present study is to gain an understanding of the important factors and an insight into methods of stabilization pond management· that would ensure acceptable discharge standards. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize observations and information gathered at the Harris ponds during the period of July 1989 through October 1990.
