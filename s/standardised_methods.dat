2500|$|A {{pattern for}} British attacks was {{established}} and Second Army orders and artillery instructions became routine, with an Attack Map showing stages of attack and timetable for the corps involved; corps moves {{and the time}} of attack were briefly noted. Nine divisions were to attack on a [...] front; the Second Army had three times and the Fifth Army twice the ammunition than for Pilckem Ridge. In late August, destructive fire by super-heavy artillery began and counter-battery fire commenced in early September, in poor visibility. The RFC plan incorporated <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> used by battery commanders and artillery observation crews, as informal liaison methods had been found to be insufficient with the increase in the amount of artillery and aircraft in the BEF since 1915. Wireless codes were harmonised and better training introduced for air–ground liaison. Attacks were to be made on German billets, railways, aerodromes and infantry counter-attacks. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) contributed 26 squadrons, including the two night-bombing squadrons and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) Handley-Pages from Coudekerque, beginning the night before the attack. After dawn, aerodromes were periodically to be attacked by small formations of low-flying fighters and by day bombers from high-altitude.|$|E

50|$|One {{can find}} reports of routine health {{outcomes}} measurement in many medical specialties {{and in many}} countries. However, {{the vast majority of}} these reports are by or about enthusiasts who have set up essentially local systems, with little connection with other similar systems elsewhere, even down the street. In order to realise the full benefits of an outcomes measurement system we need large-scale implementation using <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> with data from high proportions of suitable healthcare episodes being trapped. In order to analyse change in health status (health outcomes) we also need data on context, as recommended by Donabedian and others, and data on the interventions being used, all in a standardised manner. Such large-scale systems are only at present evident in the field of mental health services, and only well developed in two locations: Ohio and Australia, even though in both of these data on context and interventions are much less prominent than data on outcomes. The major challenge for health outcomes measurement is now the development of usable and discriminatory categories of interventions and treatments, especially in the field of mental health.|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} the present {{publication}} are (a) to identify <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools applied in clinical trials and cohort studies to assess key functional aspects in HNC, using the Brief ICF Core Set for head and neck cancer (ICF-HNC) as a reference and (b) to propose a set of sound <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools suitable to assess functional problems in HNC. This work contributed {{to the development of}} practical ICF-HNC based guidelines targeting the standardised measurement of functional outcomes in HNC follow-up and clinical research in Germany. A systematic review of randomised and clinical controlled trials, and observational studies in HNC were carried out to identify <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools. Suitable methods and tools were then selected based on pre-defined criteria. 210 assessment methods and tools were identified in 136 studies: 146 patients reported outcomes (PRO) and 64 tools rated by health professionals. Altogether 59 tools were considered suitable to be included in guidelines: four side effects classifications, two performance status scales, 31 PROs, 10 assessment criteria for clinical examinations, seven assessment methods and tools for the evaluation of technical, equipment-based procedures and five technical, equipment-based procedures. It was possible to identify and select sound and standardised assessment methods and tools for almost all functioning areas defined in the ICF-HNC. Since no tool sufficiently covers support provision by immediate family and by health professionals as well as economic self-sufficiency, we recommend a corresponding update of existing tools...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{prevalence}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{has been extensively}} studied, especially in Western Europe and North America. Few of these data are directly comparable because of differences between the surveys regarding composition of study populations, diagnostic criteria of the disease and definitions of the risk factors. Few community studies have examined phenotypes of COPD and included other ways of characterising the disease beyond that of spirometry. The objective of the present Task Force report is to present recommendations for the performance of general population studies in COPD in order to facilitate comparable and valid estimates on COPD prevalence by various risk factors. Diagnostic criteria in epidemiological settings, and <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> to examine the disease and its potential risk factors are discussed. The paper also offers practical advice for planning and performing an epidemiological study on COPD. The main message of the paper is that thorough planning is worth half the study. It is crucial to stick to <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and good quality control during sampling. We recommend collecting biological markers, depending on the specific objectives of the study. Finally, studies of COPD in the population at large should assess various phenotypes of the disease...|$|E
