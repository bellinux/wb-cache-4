5|$|Actinide <b>salts</b> {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these <b>salts</b> forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. <b>Salts</b> of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic <b>salts</b> with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide <b>salts.</b> So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} <b>salts</b> from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium <b>salts</b> typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium <b>salts</b> are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} <b>salts,</b> providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor <b>salts</b> with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of <b>salts,</b> except for unhindered formamidinium <b>salts,</b> where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

40|$|Cod <b>salting</b> is a {{long process}} on which mass transfer, {{basically}} <b>salt</b> and water, occurs by diffusion. This work analyses and compares cod <b>salting</b> kinetics by using different <b>salting</b> techniques: brine <b>salting,</b> with and without applying a vacuum pulse and dry <b>salting</b> with and without pressure. The results revealed that mass transfer kinetics during cod <b>salting</b> process seemed {{to be affected by}} the <b>salting</b> method applied. Osmotic mechanism and diffusion transport of <b>salt</b> can be enhanced during vacuum pulsed brine <b>salting,</b> also leading to a lower water loss and higher yield.

5|$|NHCs {{are often}} {{strongly}} basic (the pKa {{value of the}} conjugate acid of an imidazol-2-ylidene was measured at ca. 24) and react with oxygen. Clearly these reactions are performed using air-free techniques, avoiding compounds of even moderate acidity. Although imidazolium <b>salts</b> are stable to nucleophilic addition, other non-aromatic <b>salts</b> are not (i.e. formamidinium <b>salts).</b>|$|E

5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form <b>salts</b> of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. <b>Salts</b> with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex <b>salts</b> of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E

50|$|This led {{to three}} types of <b>salt</b> {{production}} all of which used {{a variation of the}} open-pan <b>salt</b> method: Coastal <b>salt</b> production.

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that a range of sulfate and halide (primarily chloride and fluoride) compounds are readily mobilised from fresh volcanic ash.; It is considered most likely that these <b>salts</b> are formed {{as a consequence of}} rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes, which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of sulfate and halide <b>salts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium <b>salts</b> with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy.
