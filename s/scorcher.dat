5|$|Ben Stiller as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action {{film star}} ever {{due to his}} <b>Scorcher</b> franchise, his career has stalled, and he now has a {{reputation}} for appearing in nothing but box office bombs. After a failed attempt at portraying a serious role in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. The first faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for <b>Scorcher</b> VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series.|$|E
25|$|The Sky <b>Scorcher</b> was a nuclear-armed {{air-to-air missile}} {{proposed}} to the United States Air Force in the 1950s. Intended {{for use as}} a weapon for the disruption of enemy bomber formations, it failed to find favor among Air Force planners and did not undergo development.|$|E
25|$|He {{was named}} the 2006 RPM Racing News driver of the year. That year he won The Dream ($100,000), Topless 100 ($45,000), <b>Scorcher</b> 100 ($20,000), Racefest ($20,000), Dixie Shootout ($15,000), and the Cedar Lake Nationals ($50,000). He also had nine wins in the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series.|$|E
25|$|In a rain-affected final against soon-becoming-rival Perth <b>Scorchers,</b> the <b>Scorchers</b> fell 6 runs {{short of}} the 54-run target set by <b>Scorchers</b> {{according}} to the Duckworth–Lewis method. The semi-finals loss saw them bow out of the tournament. The result means they did not qualify for the 2014 Champions League Twenty20 tournament.|$|R

25|$|The Sky <b>Scorcher</b> {{project was}} {{proposed}} by the Convair Division of General Dynamics to the United States Air Force in 1956. The missile {{was intended to be}} carried by an advanced, enlarged version of Convair's F-106 Delta Dart interceptor, which had, at the time, not yet entered flight testing even in its baseline form.|$|E
25|$|Despite Convair's {{sales pitch}} and the {{anticipated}} {{effectiveness of the}} weapon, the Air Force was unenthusiastic about the concept; aside from the expense of developing the aircraft and weapon, the Sky <b>Scorcher</b> missile also suffered {{from the fact that}} there would be significant effects on the ground below the location of an airburst of a multi-megaton nuclear warhead. As a result, the project was abandoned before any significant work was undertaken.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1980s {{there have been many}} fanzines aimed at West Ham fans.

25|$|Singapore co-hosted the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship with Thailand. They {{began their}} title defence with a goalless draw against Vietnam on 13 January. Two days later, striker Noh Alam Shah scored seven {{goals in a}} 11–0 {{national}} team record win over Laos. Singapore advanced to the semi-finals after topping their group following a 2–2 draw with Indonesia. They met Malaysia in the semi-finals, progressing on a penalty shootout after extra time following 1–1 stalemates in both legs. Singapore took on Thailand, a team they had not defeated in a competitive fixture for 30 years, in the finals. They beat Thailand 2–1 in the first leg on 31 January, in which the Lions converted a controversial penalty on 83 minutes and the Thai players staged a walk-out as a protest before returning 15 minutes later. Thailand were leading 1–0 in Bangkok before a Khairul Amri <b>scorcher</b> won the tie 3–2 on aggregate and gave Singapore back-to-back tournament wins. With the final win, Singapore established an unbeaten run of 15 matches under Avramović {{dating back to the}} 2004 tournament and a tournament record of 17 matches without a loss going back to 2002.|$|E
25|$|The return leg {{match at}} the Sree Kanteerava Stadium started with Bengaluru FC needing a 1–0 victory to {{guarantee}} {{a place in the}} semi finals. It was however, the visitors Aizawl who drew first blood from a Joel Sunday goal in the 26th minute. Bengaluru FC however were not too late to strike back. In the 28th minute, C.K. Vineeth found himself {{at the end of a}} Keegan Pereira pass and the Keralite did not make any mistake in finding the back of the net. In the 38th minute however, the agony for the hosts mounted as Joel Sunday scored a <b>scorcher</b> of a goal to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead with 2 away goals, 1 more than Bengaluru FC. After the restart, post the lemon break, the fate of the match was sealed by the Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana as he scored from a direct free-kick to give the visitors an almost unassailable 3–1 lead (5–2 on aggregate). Bengaluru FC pressed hard in the final half hour and did manage to pull one back through a penalty goal from Indian striker Sunil Chettri. However, that proved to be too little too late as the visitors booked their spot in the semi final with a 3–2 victory on the night and an aggregate scoreline of 5–3 in their favour.|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the <b>Scorcher</b> VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

50|$|Jason and the <b>Scorchers</b> have {{maintained}} a loyal {{core group of}} fans {{around the world for}} more than 30 years. Jason and the <b>Scorchers</b> released their latest album Halcyon Times in February 2010.|$|R
500|$|The album opener “Hi”, {{is a song}} where {{group member}} L-Boy insults each “dusty ass motherfucker” on the album, serving as a comical hip hop skit. [...] "Bitches" [...] is {{performed}} by Hodgy and Domo, with production by Left Brain. The track is a [...] "boastful" [...] <b>scorcher,</b> built from New Age synthesizers and hammering snare drums. The two rappers trade off-kilter verses at each other, with Hodgy delivering his verses with a melodic flow. Hodgy [...] "turns up the aggression" [...] on [...] "NY (Ned Flander)", a track similar to the aesthetic of Tyler's album Goblin. Critics noted the song's [...] "stark", [...] "unnerving" [...] and repetitive piano line {{that serves as the}} platform for Tyler and Hodgy's verses. Nathan Rabin wrote that all the songs up to [...] "NY (Ned Flander)" [...] are rap songs, but the one that follows, [...] "Ya Know", is not, as it is more reminiscent of the band N.E.R.D. with its sonic shifts and [...] "hazy" [...] atmosphere. The track is performed by Matt Martians and Syd the Kyd of psych-soul act The Internet, with jazz influences.|$|E
2500|$|Sky <b>Scorcher</b> was a {{very large}} missile, which was {{projected}} {{to be capable of}} carrying a thermonuclear warhead with a yield of two megatons. The oversized warhead would be used against attacking formations of supersonic bombers; it was anticipated that fourteen such initiations, at a distance of approximately [...] from the bombers' target, would be sufficient to disrupt an attack. A force of eighty of the advanced fighters were proposed for carrying the weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron {{recorded}} and released four albums during the 1980s: 1980 and Real Eyes (1980), Reflections (1981) and Moving Target (1982). In February 1982, Ron Holloway joined the ensemble to play tenor saxophone. He toured extensively with Scott-Heron {{and contributed to}} his next album, Moving Target the same year. His tenor accompaniment is a prominent feature of the songs [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and [...] "Black History/The World". Holloway continued with Scott-Heron until the summer of 1989, when he left to join Dizzy Gillespie. Several years later, Scott-Heron would make cameo appearances on two of Ron Holloway's CDs; <b>Scorcher</b> (1996) and Groove Update (1998), both on the Fantasy/Milestone label.|$|E

2500|$|The Living End's second album, Roll On, was {{recorded}} during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No.8 on the ARIA Albums Chart {{and reached the}} top40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had [...] "broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be {{as strong as the}} self-titled album; [...] " [...] an absolute <b>scorcher!</b> That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot".|$|E
