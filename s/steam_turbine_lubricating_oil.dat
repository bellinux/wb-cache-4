To investigate any improvement when using these fluids, {{the effects of}} the properties of nine different working fluids on the overall combined cycle efficiency have been considered. In this respect, the economic, environmental, and operating performances of an ORC depend on the properties of the working fluids as well as the design and operating characteristics of the cycle. A suitable fluid for an ORC must exhibit favorable physical, chemical, environmental, safety, and economic properties such as low specific volume, liquid specific heat, viscosity, toxicity, flammability, ozone depletion potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP), and cost, as well as favorable process characteristics such as high efficiency, latent heat, density, molecular weight, Mollier diagram close to isentropic, suitable thermal stability limits, compatible with <b>turbine</b> materials and <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil,</b> non-corrosive, non-inflammable, and moderate pressure in the heat exchangers[11, 12, 13]. The saturated vapor specific volume gives an indication of condenser size, which is related to the system's initial cost. A super-atmospheric (> 100 kPa) saturation pressure eliminates infiltration of gases, which is important for operational reasons, since gas infiltration reduces system efficiency. The working fluid having high latent heat and high density is preferred. To achieve the maximum output power of the combined cycle, Rankine cycle efficiency must be increased. For this reason, {{the effects of the}} properties of several working fluids on the Rankine cycle efficiency have been studied.|$|R
