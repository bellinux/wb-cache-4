5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E

Hershiser's 1984 streak, which was the longest scoreless inning streak of the year, was broken up on July 24 by a home run by two-time NL Most Valuable Player Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves. His streak included a blown save on July 8 against the St. Louis Cardinals and a nine-inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19.|$|E
5|$|Longest {{continuous}} {{streak of}} double-doubles: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilt Chamberlain holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967.

5|$|Since then, {{the volcano}} has been dormant, {{although}} some steam still rises from small vents in its summit {{and on its}} flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington).|$|E

5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{involved}} in a controversial loss to the Los Angeles Kings, when the Staples Center clock appeared to freeze at 1.8 seconds allowing the Kings time to score the tying goal, before winning in overtime.

5|$|The Baltimore Orioles began {{play in the}} AL in 1901. After two seasons, the Orioles were {{replaced}} by a club in New York City; {{it is unclear whether}} it was an expansion team or a relocated version of the Orioles. Frank Farrell and William S. Devery purchased the franchise, naming it the New York Highlanders. In 1913, the team changed its name to the Yankees. From 1921 to 1964, the Yankees were the most successful Major League franchise, winning 20 World Series titles and 29 AL pennants. This period included <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> four consecutive championships from 1936 to 1939 and five straight titles from 1949 to 1953.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{game in the}} 2004 {{season in}} which Favre and the Packers {{finished}} 10–6 was against the New York Giants. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had two significant touchdown <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on to throw a touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal {{that includes a}} club option for 2008. He picked up from where he left off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching {{in the first half}} of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, and lead the AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop out for the first out, then gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version—as they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E

25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture.

The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with <b>streaks</b> <b>of</b> Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet.
