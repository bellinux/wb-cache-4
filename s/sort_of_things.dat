Enraght of Portslade {{has given}} notice of his {{intentions}} {{to hold a}} “Retreat”-our readers will not have forgotten what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> these “retreats” are - at Lancing College in August next. The rev. gentleman’s name appears in the roll of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament for 1872, so that here we get another peep into the interior economy of those notorious “Woodard Schools”, of which Lancing College is the headquarters.|$|E
25|$|There {{have always}} been {{politicians}} or business people who have wanted to cut the BBC back or stop it saying the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> it says. There's always been trouble about the licence and if you dropped your guard you could bet our bottom dollar there'd be plenty of people who'd {{want to take it}} away. The licence fee is the basis on which the BBC is based and if you destroy it, broadcasting... becomes a wasteland.|$|E
25|$|Forsyth's novels {{typically}} {{show the}} ways in which spies, gangsters, assassins, mercenaries, diplomats, business leaders and politicians go about their business behind the scenes; the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that the average reader would not suspect while reading a simple headline. For example, the Jackal (The Day of the Jackal) does not simply attempt to shoot Charles de Gaulle. He prepares meticulously by researching his quarry at the British Museum library; he obtains papers for his various false identities; he travels around Paris to find a good location for a sniper's nest; he buys and tests his weapons; and so on.|$|E

500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because [...] "those are the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that can be incredibly touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{decades after}} her Grammy, Reddy {{discussed}} the song's iconic status: [...] "I think it came along {{at the right}} time. I'd gotten involved in the Women's Movement, {{and there were a}} lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't see myself as being dainty," [...] she said.|$|E

"But {{having gone}} down into Hades {{because of his}} wife and seeing what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> were there, he did not {{continue}} to worship Dionysus, because of whom he was famous, but he thought Helios to be the greatest of the gods, Helios whom he also addressed as Apollo. Rousing himself each night toward dawn and climbing the mountain called Pangaion, he would await the sun's rising, so that he might see it first. Therefore, Dionysus, being angry with him, sent the Bassarides, as Aeschylus the tragedian says; they tore him apart and scattered the limbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 2011, All Time Low {{exclusively}} {{unveiled the}} artwork for Dirty Work through Alternative Press. From late March to early May, the band {{went on the}} Dirty Work Tour with support from Yellowcard, Hey Monday, and the Summer Set. While on the tour, the band performed a new track titled [...] "Under the Paper Moon". On March 23, NME reported that the album would be released in May. Two days later, the band revealed the album's track listing. On April 1, AbsolutePunk reported that Dirty Work would be released in June. [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] was made available for streaming on April 4, before released as single a day later. In mid-April, a music video was filmed for [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". The video was later released on May 23, directed by Matt Stawski. Gaskarth explained the video was [...] "taking a stab at the music industry, how it works and the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and extents people go to become successful." [...] Dirty Work was released on June 7 through Interscope Records. [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] was released to mainstream radio on June 14. On June 17, the band appeared on Hoppus on Music, performing [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)" [...] and [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". In early July, the band appeared at the Sonisphere and Oxegen festivals in the UK. On July 12, a music video was released for [...] "Forget About It", directed by Jonathan Bregel. The video consists of behind-the-scenes footage of the band at backstage and radio appearances, among other things.|$|E
