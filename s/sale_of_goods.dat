Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E

Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

She studied law at Stockholm University and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the Law of <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (Studier i Köprätt). Her doctoral thesis dealt {{with some of the}} problems concerning the right to treat a contract as of <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> as discharged – the right of rescission – in various situations that may rise in the course of performance. Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the right of rescission which depended on how far performance had proceeded when the question of rescission came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E

25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities.

25|$|The tonnage of the {{returning}} ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the Company's {{revenues from the}} <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete {{on an equal footing}} with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins. Unfortunately, the business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. Unfortunately by this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political regent class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.|$|E
