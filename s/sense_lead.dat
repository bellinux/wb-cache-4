Those are only a few examples. I could give you a dozen more. For instance, on an island away there to the west, and only in one spot, there grows a little sort of lily, which is found I believe in Brittany, and on the Spanish and Portuguese heaths, and even in North-west Africa. And that Africa and Spain were joined not so very long ago at the Straits of Gibraltar there is no doubt at all.|$|E

The return <b>sense</b> <b>lead</b> and the superconducting chimney wire form a loop with area A {approx} 1. 7 m{sup 2 } (information from R. Ru. cinski).

In this study, carbon paste electrodes were fabricated with siphonous seaweed Acetabularia acetabulum as the modifiers to <b>sense</b> <b>lead</b> (II) and copper (II) by square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.

40|$|Background—Despite the {{positive}} effect on mortality in selected patients, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is also associated with potential malfunction of the implanted system. The present study provides the long-term lead failure rate in a large single-center cohort. Methods and Results—Since 1992, a total of 2068 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients with 2161 defibrillation leads were prospectively collected. Data of the implant procedure and all follow-up visits were recorded. All cases of lead removal or capping or placing of an additional pace or <b>sense</b> <b>lead</b> were noted and analyzed. Lead models were grouped by manufacturer and approximate lead diameter in French. During a mean follow-up of 36 months, 82 (3. 8 %) cases of lead failure were identified. Cumulative incidence of lead failure at 1 year was 0. 6 %; at 5 years, 6. 5 %; and at 10 years, 16. 4 %. The highest risk of lead failure was found in small-diameter leads. Adjusted hazard ratio was 6. 4 (95 % CI, 3. 2 to 12. 8) for Medtronic 7 F leads, when compared with all other leads. Conclusions—In this large single-center experience, the overall incidence of lead failure was 1. 3 (95 % CI, 1. 0 to 1. 6) per 100 lead-years. Comparison of different groups of leads shows major differences in event rates. Specific manufacturer’s small-diameter defibrillation leads may have {{a higher risk of}} early lead failure.
