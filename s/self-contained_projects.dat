The publication's projects range from growing strawberries in a hanging basket to keeping chickens or energy saving tips for home. BookPage called the book [...] "an earnest, friendly manual that'll entice you into the kitchen to make jam, even if you've never before successfully boiled water": its central aim was to illustrate [...] "that you can live anywhere and still make a contribution to the environment without actually making any sacrifices". After the book's publication, Goldsmith stated, [...] "there is a huge misconception that being green is more labour-intensive, more expensive and means giving up all your creature comforts." ...|$|E
40|$|When making requests, {{speakers}} need {{to select}} {{from a range}} of alternative forms available to them. In a corpus of naturally-occurring Italian interaction, the two most common formats chosen are imperatives and an interrogative construction that includes a turn-initial dative pronoun mi “to/for me”, which I refer to as the Mi X? format. In informal contexts, both forms are used to request low-cost actions for here-and-now purposes. Building on this premise, this paper argues for a functional distinction between them. The imperative format is selected to implement bilateral requests, that is, to request actions that are integral to an already established joint project between requester and recipient. On the other hand, the Mi X? format is a vehicle for unilateral requests, which means that it is used for enlisting help in new, <b>self-contained</b> <b>projects</b> that are launched {{in the interest of the}} speaker as an individual...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{organized}} in three <b>self-contained</b> <b>projects</b> which model predictability in both advanced and emerging stock markets {{and attempt to}} exploit it via construction of appropriate trading strategies. The objectives of this research are: 1) to model mean reversion in developed stock markets and re-assess the mixed empirical findings to date; 2) to characterize the returns generating process in emerging capital markets and examine the predictive ability and profitability of technical trading rules; 3) to develop and evaluate whether trading strategies involving dividend announcements in the UK are profitable and can be classified as statistical arbitrages, with consequent implications for the market efficiency hypothesis. We investigate the existence of mean reversion in the G- 7 economies using a two factor continuous time model for national stock index data. Whilst maintaining the same modeling philosophy of previous studies, we rather focus {{on the effects of}} the "intrinsic" continuous time mean reverting coefficient. Our method produces support for mean reversion, even at low frequencies, and relatively small samples. We also aim to characterize the stock return dynamics in four Latin American and four Asian emerging capital market economies and assess the profitability of popular trading rules in these markets. We find that dollar denominated returns exhibit statistically significant long memory effects in volatility but not in the mean. "wading' our findings via a number of moving average and trading range break rules, we "beat" the buy and hold benchmark strategy in all markets before transaction costs, and in Asian markets even after transaction costs. Bootstrap simulations further reinforce the choice of the modeling framework and the trading outcomes, particularly for Latin American markets. Finally, we investigate whether trading strategies designed to exploit "abnormal" price behavior following dividend initiation/resumption and omission announcements of UK firms pass the statistical arbitrage test of Hogan et al. (2004). To mitigate concerns regarding "risky" arbitrage, we also calculate the probability of making a loss for each strategy. We find that strategies involving portfolios of dividend initiating/resuming firms are profitable and converge to riskless arbitrages over time, while {{this is not the case}} for strategies with dividend omitting firms, contrary to what is suggested by US studies. In general, the robustness of our results casts doubt on the market efficiency hypothesis in both developed and emerging capital markets...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} microfluidic devices designed to facilitate research into mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs are a well-studied cell, largely due to their pluripotent nature, meaning {{they are able to}} differentiate into all cell types of the body and may self-renew indefinitely in appropriate culture conditions. ESCs, along with many other lines of biological enquiry, are increasingly studied with the use of micro uidic technology which enables fine tuning of physical and chemical environments unachievable on the macro scale. Two varieties of microfluidic technology are presented in this thesis, one for high- resolution mechanical phenotyping of ESCs and the second as a novel in-chip culturing platform to study cellular transitions. Chapter 1 presents a broad introduction to ESCs and biological enquiry with microfluidics, aimed to underpin the following Chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 present <b>self-contained</b> <b>projects,</b> thus each include a motivation and introduction section more specific than that presented in Chapter 1. These Chapters also contain their own methods, results and conclusion sections. Finally, Chapter 4 presents a summary of the work performed along with an outlook of upcoming investigations. In Chapter 2, I present a microfluidic device developed and utilised in collaboration with Christophe Verstreken (Department of Physics, University of Cambridge), which has been used to apply a mechanical stress to live cells enabling measurement of their nuclear deformability. The device facilitates detection of both nucleus and cytoplasm which can then be analysed with a custom-written MATLAB code. Quantitative measurements of nuclear sizes and strains of ESCs indicated a negative Poisson ratio for nuclei of cells cultured in specific medium conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the device can be used to physically phenotype at high-throughput by detecting changes in the nuclear response after treatment with actin depolymerising and chromatin decondensing agents. Finally, we show the device can be used for biologically relevant high-resolution confocal imaging of cells under compression. The work from this chapter is presented in Hodgson et al. [1]. In Chapter 3, I present a novel microfluidic platform developed in collaboration with Prof. Austin Smith and Dr Carla Mulas (Centre for Stem Cell Research, Cambridge). The developed platform enables individual ESCs to be cultured under continued observation as they exit their pluripotent stem cell state. Each cell within the device may be extracted from the chip at any time for further investigation without disturbing other cells. Assessing the transition from the stem cell state in individual cells is paramount if we are to understand the mechanisms of pluripotency. EPSR...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSafety {{remains a}} problem on U. S. roadways, with more than 32, 000 fatalities, 2. 2 million {{injuries}} and 6 million crashes each year. Travelers, shippers and the economy are exposed to increasing amounts of congestion, unreliability, delay, emissions and excess energy consumption, which impede the efficient movement of people and goods. The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) had embarked upon a major research program toward implementing connected vehicle safety technologies, applications and systems using dedicated, short-range wireless communications (DSRC). Previous research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) demonstrated that 80 % of unimpaired driver crash types could be addressed by the connected vehicle technology. Through the year-long Safety Pilot {{that took place in}} Michigan from 2012 to 2013, U. S. DOT tested the effectiveness of wireless connected vehicle technology in real-world, multimodal driving conditions; collecting data about how ordinary drivers adapt to the use of connected vehicle technology; and identifying the potential safety benefits of connected vehicle technology. This work was performed in recognition of a February 3, 2014 NHTSA agency decision for light vehicles and a similar decision expected soon for commercial vehicles that will likely launch regulatory processes to require or incentivize all new vehicles to be equipped with DSRC devices. Communication among and between vehicles and the infrastructure (including traffic signals, work zone equipment, or pavement sensors, and other infrastructure elements) would also have data and mobility benefits (including data-driven applications such as traveler information for freight and passengers, transit operations, network flow optimization, traffic signal systems and incident response, emergency staging, and evacuation as well as sustainability-related applications). This paper describes an ongoing effort to explore opportunities for the state of Oregon, USA, to participate in future funded pilot deployments of mobility and environmental related applications in the coming years—possibly including a set of regional pilots as well as smaller, more <b>self-contained</b> <b>projects</b> focused on priority applications. As connected vehicle research moves into deployment, state, local and transit agencies, Metropolitan Planning Organizations and the private sector will start experiencing the effects of vehicles, after-market devices, mobile devices, and infrastructure with DSRC and other wireless connectivity at their cores. Along with other states and regions, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) can benefit from preliminary scoping, evaluation, and assessment of the impact of connected vehicles and infrastructure and a wide range of potential cooperative system applications. With this in mind, ODOT can determine whether or not to pursue the next phases of federal connected vehicle application funding. It can also make an informed choice about taking a potential national leadership role in the connected vehicle arena, and assess opportunities to join projects with other partners. This paper provides a summary of an internal survey conducted within ODOT along with insights gained from the analysis of the survey results. Next steps in the process are also described...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} a lack of science and {{engineering}} opportunities for youth has been identified. While other programs and attempted solutions exist, a novel approach involving creating <b>self-contained</b> <b>project</b> classes, called modules, and trading them between institutions is proposed. This idea intends to make these lacking opportunities available while overcoming some of the current problems opposing this availability namely insufficient resources and staff. While limited time and resources prevents the complete testing of the idea, the development of a single module to the point before developing a trading system is implemented. The project chosen is the construction and operation of the Stirling Engine using a design borrowed from MIT course 2. 670. The module is tested with 15 4 th to 7 th grade home-schooled students in Los Angeles, Ca. Observations and participant feedback are gathered. Changes including the shortening of lectures, simplification of the project, and addition of testing are proposed. The information gathered from the test suggests that with a trading system in place, these modules can expose students to science and engineering and generate excitement for the fields. by Patrick R.

40|$|Resources (natural, {{economic}}, {{social, and}} cultural) that people rely on for support are sources {{of power for}} social and economic actors, including consumers, households, and firms. Resources are created in the interaction of two component parts: cultural knowledge and latent materials. Human actors need to apply appropriate cultural knowledge to latent material (objects, experiences, and potential relationships) {{in order for them}} to be converted into resources; cultural knowledge needs to be applied to latent materials to render them meaningful and useful. In this sense, agency and power, one's ability to act in the world, rest not only in resources but also in these underlying components. As such, there is ample motivation for marketers to study and understand not only resources, but also the role of cultural knowledge as an activator in contemporary society. The introductory chapter conceptually develops the thesis that cultural knowledge governs the successful activation and use of latent materials to generate resources. Since understanding cultural knowledge is so important, the introduction then motivates three separate empirical studies on the dynamic role of cultural knowledge in consumers' lives. Each focuses on either how cultural knowledge is (1) accumulated by individual consumers post socialization, (2) deployed by individual consumers, or (3) deployed through collective consumption. Each empirical study is a <b>self-contained</b> <b>project</b> with its own theoretical development and contribution to the marketing and sociology literature, yet each contributes to an overall theoretical understanding of cultural knowledge...|$|R

40|$|When making requests, {{speakers}} need {{to select}} a form {{from a range of}} alternatives available to them. In a corpus of video-recorded naturally-occurring Italian interaction, the two most common formats chosen are imperatives (e. g., Passami il piatto "Pass me the plate") and an interrogative construction that includes a turn-initial dative pronoun mi "to/for me", which I refer to as the Mi X? format (e. g. Mi passi il piatto? "You pass me a plate?"). In principle, these two forms appear to be used for requesting similar kinds of actions in similar circumstances. In everyday informal interaction between intimates, these are typically low-cost actions that are relevant to a here-and-now purpose or need (e. g., "taking", "putting", "holding"), or transfers of objects which are not owned by the recipient (free goods). The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that, although the kinds of actions requested are just as immediate and undemanding, and although the social relations involved are often analogous, the sequences in which imperatives and Mi X? interrogatives occur differ in important interactional aspects, and that this is reflected in the way in which the request is formatted. The core finding is the following. The imperative format is selected to request an action that is integral to an already established joint project between requester and recipient (such as a game, or the distribution of food at the start of a meal, or an offer sequence). On the other hand, the Mi X? format indicates that the requested course of action is a new, <b>self-contained</b> <b>project</b> originating from the wants of an individual. Moreover, the occurrence of these two forms of requesting in distinctive sequential and interactional environments is also reflected in other aspects of their design. Imperative and Mi X? requests generally differ in the degree of common ground assumed in their construction (pronominalization and ellipsis versus full noun phrases), and in the way the beneficiary of the requested action is encoded in the request turn or explicitly oriented to in the immediately subsequent talk. Finally, in the last part of this paper I examine the dimensions identified as relevant to the selection between imperative and Mi X? interrogative in relation to the linguistic properties of the forms themselves. That is, I discuss how these two resources of the Italian grammar fit with the interactional environments in which they are adopted: joint versus individual projects...|$|R
30|$|The UCG-CCS approach, if successful, {{could offer}} an {{integrated}} energy recovery and CO 2 storage system, which exploits a new sequestration resource created during operation. A significant challenge with CCS is its large energy requirement [47], {{of which a}} considerable portion is consumed during CO 2 capture and compression [48]. The pressure after compression is generally high enough {{to allow for a}} reduction in pressure during transport while allowing the fluid to be in a liquid state [9]. If CO 2 storage is accommodated in spent UCG reactors, CO 2 transport and compression requirements decline. CO 2 transport accounts for 5 % to 15 % of a conventional CCS financial budget, which can be lowered with a <b>self-contained</b> UCG-CCS <b>project,</b> through reduced piping and shipping requirements associated with long-distance transport [18]. A large portion of the budget for a CCS project is allotted for CO 2 storage, typically 10 % to 30 %, most of which is used for geological and geophysical studies and drilling injection wells [18, 48]. These tasks are commonly completed during UCG construction and would not need to be repeated for the implementation of CCS, thus reducing system cost relative to conventional storage methods [18].|$|R
40|$|This thesis details {{two years}} of {{research}} conducted with the guidance and support of three advisors: Dr. J. K. Whelan, Dr. J. S. Seewald and Dr. T. I. Eglinton. Each of the three chapters represents a different, <b>self-contained</b> research <b>project.</b> All of the projects {{are related to the}} organic geochemistry of marine sediments, however, this is a fairly encompassing area of study. Chapters 1 and 2 stem from the same experimental study [...] the use of hydrous-pyrolysis to investigate mechanisms leading to the production of petroleum-related products during kerogen maturation. Chapter 3, on the other hand, utilizes a recently developed technique of isolating and AMS- 14 C dating individual compounds from complex sedimentary organic mixtures. The samples used in each investigation came from all over the world. The first two chapters utilize ancient marine sediment samples obtained from an outcrop in California (Chpts. 1 and 2) and from a well in Alabama (Chpt. 2). In contrast, recent marine sediment samples were obtained from the Arabian and Black Seas for the third chapter. Several preparative and analytical methods are common to all three studies. Nevertheless, each employ techniques totally unique from one another and from previous investigations. In Chapter 1, for example, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) is used to determine the speciation of organic sulfur present in kerogen, bitumen, and bulk sediment samples. While Chapter 3 represents the first study in which the " 4 C ages of individual, known hydrocarbon biomarkers are determined after isolation by Preparative Capillary Gas Chromatography (PCGC). The insights gained by these investigations are discussed in detail in the following chapters. The common thread between the three chapters is that the source of organic matter, the rate at which it is delivered to marine sediments and the depositional environment, all set the stage for kerogen formation and eventual petroleum generation. by Bryan C.
