[...] Gold was discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866, and though [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were noticed alongside {{gold in the}} stream alluvium by 1878, {{it was not until}} 1894 that the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were recognized as sapphires. Sapphire mining began in 1895 after a local rancher named Jake Hoover sent a cigar box of gems he had collected to an assay office, which in turn sent them to Tiffany's in New York, where an appraiser pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States". Hoover then purchased the original mother lode from a sheepherder, later selling it to other investors. [...] This became the highly profitable [...] "English Mine", which flourished from 1899 until the 1920s. A second operation, the [...] "American Mine", was owned by a series of investors in the western section of the Yogo dike, but was less profitable and bought out by the syndicate that owned the English Mine.

5000|$|The 20th century, Tamil writers came up {{with various}} {{theories}} to explain the etymology of [...] "Kumari Kandam" [...] or [...] "Kumari Nadu". One <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> was centered on the purported gender egalitarianism in the prelapsarian Tamil homeland. For example, M. Arunachalam (1944) claimed that the land was ruled by female rulers (Kumaris). D. Savariroyan Pillai stated that {{the women of the}} land had the right to choose their husbands and owned all the property, because of which the land {{came to be known as}} [...] "Kumari Nadu" [...] ("the land of the maiden"). Yet another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> was centered on the Hindu goddess Kanya Kumari. Kandiah Pillai, in a book for children, fashioned a new history for the goddess, stating that the land was named after her. He claimed that the temple at Kanyakumari was established by those who survived the flood that submerged Kumari Kandam. According to cultural historian Sumathi Ramaswamy, the emphasis of the Tamil writers on the word [...] "Kumari" [...] (meaning virgin or maiden) symbolizes the purity of Tamil language and culture, before their contacts with the other ethnic groups such as the Indo-Aryans.|$|E
