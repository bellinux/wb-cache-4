25|$|An in {{the money}} (ITM) option has {{positive}} intrinsic value as well as time value. A call option is {{in the money}} when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is below the spot price. A put option is in the money when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is above the spot price.|$|E
25|$|An out of {{the money}} (OTM) option has no {{intrinsic}} value. A call option is {{out of the}} money when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is above the spot price of the underlying security. A put option is {{out of the money}} when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is below the spot price.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the above}} is a {{traditional}} way of calculating ITM, OTM and ATM, some new authors find the comparison of <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> with current market price meaningless and recommend the use of Forward Reference Rate instead of Current Market Price. For example, the option will be In The Money if <b>Strike</b> <b>Price</b> of Buy PUT on underlying {{is greater than the}} Forward Reference Rate.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of call options, the trader will buy some number of options having <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> X and write (sell) {{a larger number of}} options having <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> Y, where Y is greater than X. In {{the case of}} put options, the trader will buy some number of options having <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> A, but write (sell) a larger number of options having <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> B, where B is less than A.|$|R
5000|$|A long box-spread can {{be viewed}} as a long bull call spread at one pair of <b>strike</b> <b>prices,</b> [...] and , plus a long bear put spread at the same pair of <b>strike</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Maximum loss = {{difference}} in <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> - net credit.|$|R
25|$|In words, the {{standardized}} moneyness {{is the number}} of standard deviations the current forward price is above the <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> Thus the moneyness is zero when the forward price of the underlying equals the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> when the option is at-the-money-forward. Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money call option and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money call option (with signs reversed for a put option).|$|E
25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|An {{option is}} at the money (ATM) if the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> {{is the same as}} the current spot price of the {{underlying}} security. An at-the-money option has no intrinsic value, only time value.|$|E

25|$|Higher {{conversion}} price than a rights issue <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> Similarly, the {{conversion price}} a company fixes on a convertible can {{be higher than}} the level that the share price ever reached recently. Compare the equity dilution on a convertible issued on, say, a 20 or 30pct premium to the higher equity dilution on a rights issue, when the new shares are offered on, say, a 15 to 20pct discount to the prevailing share price.|$|E
25|$|Another {{very common}} {{strategy}} is the protective put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the underlying stock less the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of the put option and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock, being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of the {{financial}} crisis in September 2008, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained. The preferred stock yielded an annual interest rate of 10% earning Berkshire $500 million in interest income per year. Berkshire also received warrants to purchase 43.5 million shares with a <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of $115 per share, which were exercisable at any time for a five year term. Goldman maintained the right to purchase back the preferred stock and in March 2011 exercised this right paying $5.5 billion to Berkshire (the preferred stock could only be purchased back at a 10% premium). The warrants have been exercised and Berkshire holds 3% of the share capital of Goldman Sachs. Profit on the preferred stock was estimated at $1.8 billion and exercising the warrants has yielded a profit of more than $2 billion (Berkshire still owns shares in Goldman Sachs so the entire profit cannot be quantified).|$|E
25|$|From 2015, Hornby plc {{began to}} {{announce}} a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was two fold, with {{the decline in the}} number of (now aged, and hence older) collectable customers, and a lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the digitization and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range. In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016. The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest - and activist/protagonist shareholder - New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. This triggered under stock exchange rules a mandatory takeover offer of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million. As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.|$|E

EDF's chief executive stated EDF was [...] "in no hurry" [...] to agree the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> and was unconcerned if the negotiations failed. Commentators believed it would take several months to reach a conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the market}} crash of 1987, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that market implied volatility for options of lower <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> are typically higher than for higher <b>strike</b> <b>prices,</b> suggesting that volatility is stochastic, varying both for time and for the price level of the underlying security. Stochastic volatility models have been developed including one developed by S.L. Heston. One principal advantage of the Heston model is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other stochastic volatility models require complex numerical methods.|$|R
40|$|The Black-Scholes {{option pricing}} {{model has been}} highly {{influential}} in security trading and in analyses of risk-price relationships, {{despite the fact that}} it has been shown to have an apparent unexplainable mispricing bias. This study examines the mispricing exhibited by the Black-Scholes model and shows that it can be explained by the estimation procedures utilized and the measures of volatility. Specifically, a model is constructed to test for the systematic over- or underpricing of the Black-Scholes model. <b>Striking</b> <b>price</b> and time-to-maturity are included in the model. The model also includes an autoregressive error structure. Recognizing the autocorrelation in the errors improves estimation efficiency and predictability of future option prices. The method of entering implied volatility into the model has a great impact. When only one estimated implied volatility was used to explain the option data, the Black-Scholes model exhibited a bias that was a similar function of <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> for all of the securities studied. When separate estimated implied volatilities for different option positions were used, the bias as a function of <b>striking</b> <b>price</b> and time-to-maturity varied among securities. Predictions of market option prices based on the model containing <b>striking</b> <b>price,</b> time-to-maturity, and an autoregressive error structure were more accurate than those based on the Black-Scholes model...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we first show that call options, {{together}} with the market portfolio, are sufficient to obtain Pareto efficiency while put options are not. Next we investigate how investors' heterogeneous preferences and beliefs affect their investment strategies and who buys options from whom. We show that an investor buys options with <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> below a threshold from investors who have lower cautiousness/optimism while selling options with <b>strike</b> <b>prices</b> above the threshold to investors who have higher cautiousness/optimism. We also show that the investor's threshold increases with increases in his cautiousness and optimism...|$|R
2500|$|With an [...] "in the money" [...] call stock option, {{the current}} share price {{is greater than}} the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> so exercising the option will give the owner of that option a profit. That will be equal to the market price of the share, minus the option <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> times the number of shares granted by the option (minus any commission).|$|E
2500|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy the}} stock or instead sell, or [...] "write", a put. The trader selling a put {{has an obligation to}} buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price ("strike price"). If the stock price at expiration is above the <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> the seller of the put (put writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price at expiration is below the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> minus the premium.
