5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action.

40|$|AbstractThe National Diet Library in Japan {{maintains}} {{a database of}} reference service questions and the answers given to them (henceforth, reference <b>service</b> <b>records).</b> The questions are submitted to public and university libraries in Japan by users, and the answers are given by the libraries. To improve the findability of these records, we propose a method for automatically assigning Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC) codes to them. Although some {{studies have been conducted}} on classification of the reference <b>service</b> <b>records,</b> their precision is unsatisfactory. One {{reason for this is that}} these methods depend only on the texts of the reference <b>service</b> <b>records.</b> Many reference <b>service</b> <b>records</b> contain <b>book</b> titles that the reference librarians believe will be helpful to the questioners. The NDC codes of these books might be useful for classification. Based on this background, we propose to automatically (1) extract the book titles in the reference <b>service</b> <b>records,</b> (2) submit them to the NDL-OPAC, (3) obtain the NDC codes of the books, and (4) input them into a support vector machine (SVM) as features together with the texts of the reference <b>service</b> <b>records,</b> and then classify them. A total of 62, 884 records were used. For the first digits of the NDC codes, our method achieved a 53. 4 % precision. For the first and second digits of the NDC codes (i. e., classes and divisions), our method achieved a 46. 1 % precision. These figures are significantly higher than those of the preceding studies...|$|R

40|$|The Commission {{adopted in}} February 2016 a {{proposal}} for a Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation. The proposal sets a new competence based approach, which will allow the recognition of qualifications across the EU and provide for new career opportunities. The Commission proposal foresees the harmonisation of the format and procedure related to <b>Service</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Books</b> (SRBs) and logbooks (LBKs) at EU level and facilitates the electronic exchange of information through the setting up of registers and a central database. In doing so, it paves the way for the introduction of electronic tools, with a view to reduce the administrative burden whilst rendering the documents less prone to tampering. There is a need for a reliable tool for crew members' professional record facilitating the implementation of the future Directive on the recognitions of professional qualifications and, optionally, providing a platform for additional IWT electronic services. In this context, JRC provides to the Commission, through the eI 2 WT administrative arrangement specific assistance for the characterization of options for an architecture covering, as a minimum, electronic SRB and LBK. The final eIWT report (D. 3 – Requirements), issued on July 2106, concluded the eI 2 WT project. Following-up of the eIWT project, a workshop was held at the JRC Ispra premises, on September 6 2016, with the participation of most of the important stakeholders (member state authorities, professional associations and shipping industry). All participating stakeholders had the eIWT final report well ahead of the workshop and made concrete proposals regarding the future implementation of the electronic tools. This report, final deliverable of the eIDTS JRC institutional activity, based on the 3 rd and final deliverable of the eIWT study, has the purpose of outlining the functional requirements of the eIWT system, incorporating the comments and amendments proposed by the IWT stakeholders and discussed during the eIWT workshop.

It has the purpose of outlining the functional requirements of the eIWT system, as conceived and outlined already at the inception report (D. 1). The eIWT functional requirements are structured in nine (9) use- cases that describe in the best way all practical aspects and implications of eIWT. They have been the object of extensive consultation with the relevant stakeholders. A preliminary qualitative evaluation of the foreseen impact of the electronic tools when fully applied is provided. The concept and basic architecture of eIWT, which will aggregate and link information regarding the crew and the vessel, can indeed be one of the main implementation tools for DINA (Digital Inland Navigation Area), an initiative launched by the Commission with the aim of further integrating and rationalizing the digital services related to IWT.

An analysis of the acting legislation concerning peculiarities of legal {{regulation of the}} employer?s financial liability to the employee according to the labour legislation of Ukraine has been performed. Controversial problems of financial liability of labour contract parties have been investigated. For this purpose the author considered {{the essence of the}} institute of financial liability, analyzed financial liability of both the employee and the employer. The author made an attempt to characterize the financial liability of the employer. Some grounds for financial liability of the employer for the harm caused to the employee as well as peculiarities of the sanctions applied to the employer for violation of the acting legislation have been examined. In order to investigate the peculiarities of financial liability of the employer the author considers the essence of the financial liability institution, analyzes the existing legislation and addresses the judicial practice. In particular, some cases of financial liability of the employer to the employee in labour relations are singled out, for example emergence of financial liability: a) in case of illegal dismissal from work; b) in case of illegal transfer to a different job; c) in case of illegal suspending from a job; d) in case of delay in giving back a <b>service</b> <b>record</b> <b>book</b> at dismissal; e) in case of delay in settling accounts at dismissal and others.
