[...] As Pope Gregory ordered, based on Talleyrand's wishes, there were to be twenty students who were to be poor clerics; they were to be provided with four chaplains, and were to be served by seven domestics. Ten of the clerics were to study Civil Law, and ten were to study Canon Law. Ten of the students were to be chosen from the diocese of Périgueux, the other ten from elsewhere. [...] They were chosen by the Count of Périgueux, and if he did not fill a vacancy within three months, the choice was to be made by the Chancellor of the University of Toulouse. [...] Every candidate was subject to approval by the Chancellor and by a majority of the current students. The students could stay in the college from twelve to fifteen years, according to the statutes of the University of Toulouse for a doctorate in Law. [...] The chaplains were chosen by the students. More than 34,000 livres tournois were invested on behalf of the College by the Cardinal's executors.|$|E

5000|$|... "C’est cependant dans les {{situations}} coloniales que le poison de l’intégrisme du gène a trouvé plus durablement sa terre d’élection. Ainsi, dans l’Algérie française, jusque dans des années 1950, s’est développée l’école de la psychiatrie raciste dite « d’Alger ». Le véritable inspirateur en fut Antoine Porot, qui, soulignons-le au passage, écrivit en ce temps-là des œuvres croisées avec le Docteur Angelo Hesnard, parfois <b>salué</b> comme l’introducteur de la psychanalyse en France (il a eu un échange de courriers avec Freud dès 1912), et comme un tenant d’une psychanalyse biologique qui mérite encore le détour.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story had}} another retelling in a Neo-Latin poem by Gabriele Faerno which, in its single-lined moral, draws the {{parallel}} with a magistrate who is only honoured for his office. The story was eventually given a Catholic context in La Fontaine's Fables, {{where it was}} titled [...] "The ass carrying relics". However, the ending limits the lesson to secular office, as does Faerno: 'As with a stupid magistrate, it’s to the robe that you prostrate' (D’un magistrat ignorant/C’est la Robe qu’on <b>salue).</b> Since then, illustrators of his Fables have often combined the fable and its lesson in the same picture, or even confined themselves to its worldly lesson alone.|$|E
50|$|Godard's {{return to}} {{somewhat}} more traditional fiction was marked with Sauve qui peut (la vie) (1980), {{the first of}} a series of more mainstream films marked by autobiographical currents: for example Passion (1982), Lettre à Freddy Buache (1982), Prénom Carmen (1984), and Grandeur et décadence d'un petit commerce de cinéma (1986). There was, though, another flurry of controversy with Je vous <b>salue,</b> Marie (1985), which was condemned by the Catholic Church for alleged heresy, and also with King Lear (1987), an essay on William Shakespeare and language. Also completed in 1987 was a segment in the film ARIA which was based loosely from the plot of Armide; it is set in a gym and uses several arias by Jean-Baptiste Lully from his famous Armide.|$|E
50|$|The {{daughter}} of a railway worker and a market vendor, she was born Wanna Thappanon in Phitsanulok province. She was unable to complete her schooling because of her family's financial problems {{and went to work}} in Bangkok at the age of twelve. Between 1973 and 1976, she wrote a series of short stories about the lives of the poor and underprivileged in Thai society; her stories {{played an important role in}} the development of the Thai Wannakam Puea Chevit (Literature For Life) genre. In 1983, a collection of these stories was published as Kaew Yode Deow (A Drop of Glass). Later collections of stories by Sidaoruang are Matsi (1987) and Mae <b>Salue</b> (1993) which deal more with issues related to gender. Her work has been translated into English, French, German, Danish, Portuguese and Japanese.|$|E
50|$|While she {{was known}} to have touched many {{different}} artists, she also touched {{the lives of millions}} of her listeners and fans. As stated above, her performances outputted raw emotion and even political rhetoric. She was incredibly influential and spoke about politics through her music. An example of this is seen in her music performed after World War II. The themes at the surface were about love yet with deeper interpretation of the lyrics as seen in the song <b>Salue</b> Qalbi, it questions political motives in times of political tension. Umm Kulthum's political rhetoric in her music is still influential today, not only in Egypt, but in many other middle eastern countries and even globally. For example, at the Baalbak Music Festival in Lebanon, many listeners are able to relate to her music that speaks out about the hardships of war and injustices. All in all, Umm Kulthum's music is universally known, have you be 10 years old or 90 years old, people can relate to her music and feel the emotion of every word.|$|E

He built the international network of that agency. Together with Bernard Brochand, he made, in 1978, the winning campaign of Jacques Chirac and his gaullist party RPR [...] "Oui à la France qui gagne".

The same year, he published his book [...] "Je vous <b>salue</b> fiascos" [...] (Jean-Claude Lattes) about his own fiascos in advertising. In 1988, Jacques Chirac, then Prime Minister, asked him to manage his presidential campaign against François Mitterrand. In 1991, he became the president of Euro-RSCG International, covering the whole worldwide network outside France. In 1995, he managed again the presidential campaign of Jacques Chirac ("La France pour tous"), and, immediately after the election of Jacques Chirac as President of France, he left Euro-RSCG and France to live in New York City, for 10 years, as president of BBDO International.

It considers two cases of images that resist interpretation by means of written words. The first case is Je vous <b>salue,</b> Sarajevo, a short video from Jean-Luc Godard’s experimental cinema; the second is a brain scan coming from the biomedical field. What kind of theoretical and practical strategies can be put at work to recognize the capacity of these images to act as arguments, rather than taking them as inert objects to be looked at? The article engages with Godard’s “anti-montage” and morphology as two ways that visual studies scholars have at their disposal to challenge the relationship between images and theory...|$|E
