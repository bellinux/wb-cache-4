50|$|Some {{companies}} are now making saxophones from phosphor bronze (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content). Bell bronze is {{used to make the}} <b>tone</b> <b>rings</b> of many professional model banjos. The <b>tone</b> <b>ring</b> is a heavy (usually 3 lbs.) folded or arched metal ring attached to a thick wood rim, over which a skin, or most often, a plastic membrane (or head) is stretched - it is the bell bronze that gives the banjo a crisp powerful lower register and clear, bell-like treble register-especially in bluegrass music.|$|R

50|$|In {{telephone}} systems, these tones are in-band indicators to subscribers, {{as opposed}} to in-band and out-of-band switching Signaling (telecommunications) tones. Typical major signal tones are dial <b>tone,</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>tone,</b> busy tone, and number unavailable tone. A loud stutter warning signal tone is used to alert subscribers of an engaged telephone circuit, warning that the other party has disconnected as a reminder to indicate the handset is not properly hung up.|$|R

2500|$|Prior to 2005, most <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> {{were based}} on {{polyphonic}} or even cruder monophonic tones because that was what most cell phone handsets could play. [...] However, with snippets of existing songs and compositions generating more than $2 billion in annual worldwide revenues in 2005 as <b>ring</b> <b>tones,</b> cell phone handset manufacturers began producing handsets capable of replaying {{the upper and lower}} notes from a song's melody without tinny-sounding bleats. [...] In early 2005, retailer Best Buy turned music Shayman had written for one of its commercials into a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> and offered it on the Best Buy website. [...] From this, Shayman {{was one of the first}} to recognize the business potential in composing original <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> material exclusively for cell phones and collaborated in 2005 with music producer Eddie O'Loughlin, and singer/songwriter Dee Robert in the new mobile music art form to produce original <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> for Jamba!.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Custom <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> for {{cellular}} phones have become extremely popular {{over the past}} several years, allowing users to customize their mobile computing experience, expressing their personality or enjoying their favorite tune. In the <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> selection process, a user generally searches or browses for a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> by title in one of several <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> databases and then purchases his selection. Research into query-by-humming systems may eventually enable users to select a song by singing a segment of it. This project, Sing-a-Ring, extends the user <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> experience by allowing users to create their own <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> by singing. Unlike current options to record a sound file and set that as a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> directly, this application uses an autocorrelation algorithm to convert the recorded sample to a MIDI file and then provides customization options, such as instrument and tempo selectors. This application is implemented on the Java ™ 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J 2 ME), and has been tested on a Motorola RAZR V 3 i phone. For the current implementation, due to format conversion issues, recordings must be created on a computer and then transferred to the phone. Nevertheless, the current application is a proof of concept with great potential, especially if access to AMR decoding libraries and the digital signal processing chip is available...|$|R

5000|$|The dense, lustrous wood {{ranges from}} reddish to pure black. It is {{generally}} {{cut into small}} billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow white sapwood left on {{to assist in the}} slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality [...] "A" [...] grade African blackwood commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The tonal qualities of African blackwood are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally clarinets, oboes, transverse flutes, piccolos, Highland pipes, and Northumbrian pipes. The timber is used mainly because of its machinability and dimensional stability. Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood ("grenadilla") to construct the <b>tone</b> <b>ring</b> in its John Hartford model banjo. Deering indicates that this reduces weight versus brass/bronze <b>tone</b> <b>rings,</b> and that the wood [...] "plays in" [...] (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers {{from the time of the}} Egyptians have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies Wüsthof and J. A. Henckels sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood's moisture repellent qualities.|$|R

The flange itself takes only minutes to make. An old or previously torn head can be used. It is installed directly under the regular head, without any further modifications, and, so, can be removed with no harm done...|$|R

They were crudely {{made out of}} what {{was at the time}} cheap Australian timber using a <b>tone</b> <b>ring</b> rather than a tone well but their biggest problems were no neck reinforcement and a very different pressed (rather than spun) cone. This is often called a pillow cone due to the shapes pressed into the face to strengthen the cone. Many examples exist today and if the neck is straight and a good cone is used can give a reasonable sound. As of 2010, Don Morrison was producing highly regarded resonators under the Donmo brand name.|$|R
