5|$|Prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan {{was ruled}} by {{successive}} military shoguns. During this period, effective {{power of the}} government resided in the <b>Shogun,</b> who officially ruled {{the country in the}} name of the Emperor. The Shoguns were the hereditary military governors, with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo. Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the <b>Shogun,</b> his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the country.

Sir Doi Toshitsura, the Shogun's Justice, {{realizes that the}} situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku {{as a way of}} showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former <b>shogun,</b> and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu.

The successful generals, who were at the same time branch family heads who had cast in their lot with Takauji's rebellion, were the ones often rewarded with the post. The cost of not tying them to the regime was to lose their support, and to encourage their independence from the regime.|$|R
