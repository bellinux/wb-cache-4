The ECG signal is acquired using the ECG Amplifier circuit and then it is transmitted using the Angle Modulation.

The validation of faithful transmission is done using the parameter of ECG waveform i. e., amplitude and frequency.

A neo-marxist approach is used towards those objectives. The search for explanations is carried out through {{the analysis of the}} <b>scenario</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of the commuting programs: the role of Capital, the initiator of the programs, is examined in the light of its imperatives (accumulation, legitimation); State action is discussed with respect to its roles of integration, legitimation, support to accumulation, and that of a capitalist; the participation of the native people is seen from a perspective where their culture and social fabric have been altered, in spite of apparently strong idiosyncrasies. The consequences of participation in commuting, and of the revenues thereby brought to the communities, are consistent with already existing trends among northern native population: a decline of reciprocity; an assimilation to capitalist society (consumption and monetization); a local circulation of income which varies in importance from a place to another, but which everywhere favors exclusively the local bourgeoisie; the survival of subsistence economy; and the enhancement of dependence and economic vulnerability...|$|E

Therefore, as a single point of failure in fiber connection can cause multiple service deprivation, redundancy is very crucial. In this work, an automated planning model was used to test different <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation.</b> Cost estimation is presented in terms of digging and amount of fiber used.

40|$|The {{contribution}} illustrates {{an integrated}} assessment framework aimed at evaluating {{the relationships between}} multiple pressures and water body status {{for the purposes of}} river basin management. The framework includes the following steps. (1) Understanding how the different pressures affect the status of water bodies. This entails the characterization of biophysical state variables and the definition of a causal relationship between pressures and status. Therefore this step involves interaction between experts bearing ecological understanding and experts providing models to represent the effect of pressures. (2) Identifying the relevant pressures to be addressed through appropriate measures to improve the status of water bodies. (3) Evaluating reduction targets for the relevant pressures identified in a river basin, by weighting the effort associated to reducing individual pressures and the potential benefits in terms of water body status. (4) Designing management measures through a creative process and political discussion of alternative options, balancing costs, benefits and effectiveness based on engineering and economic analysis.

Although DG {{has the potential to}} supply {{a significant portion of the}} increased power demands in California and the rest of the United States, it may lead to increased levels of in-basin pollutants and adversely impact urban air quality. This study focuses on two main objectives: (1) the systematic characterization of DG installation in urban air basins, and (2) the simulation of potential air quality impacts using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional computational model. A general and systematic approach is devised to construct five realistic and 21 spanning <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> DG <b>implementation</b> in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) <b>of</b> California. Realistic <b>scenarios</b> reflect an anticipated level of DG deployment in the SoCAB by the year 2010. Spanning scenarios are developed to determine the potential impacts of unexpected outcomes.
