5|$|About 75% of {{the island}} chain lost power {{for a few hours}} during the storm. Damage {{occurred}} to downed trees and wooden homes. Between 13 and 17percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. <b>Several</b> <b>feet</b> of water flooded the international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|At Ballast Point, the {{pavilion}} and bathhouse {{were destroyed by}} the storm. Nearby, the Tampa Yacht and Country Club suffered severe damage. Many cars along the waterfront were severely damaged and nearly all flat railroad cars were submerged. The Malloy Line dock was also left under <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water. A number of waterfront warehouses were also damaged by floodwaters. After the Tampa Electrical Company power house experienced water damage, the electricity was shutoff. Additionally, the company's cable station was flooded under <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water. Winds downed hundreds of trees and sign across roadways and tore-up awnings. At least 50 awnings were ripped from a bank building on Franklin Street alone. Falling trees also damaged {{the post office and}} the YMCA. Almost 500 dwellings in the neighborhood of Ybor City were demolished. Five people were killed in the city, three from people coming into contact with a live wire and the other two from drowning. Only minor damage occurred in Plant City. Throughout Hillsborough County, many county roads were impassible due to downed telegraph poles and other debris, especially between Tampa and Plant City.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{minor in}} {{southeast}} North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in Bald Head Island, as well. In Chowan County, a business {{parking lot was}} under <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water due to flash flooding.

5|$|In all, Hurricane Mitch caused {{at least}} 3,800 {{fatalities}} in Nicaragua, of {{which more than}} 2,000 {{were killed in the}} towns of El Provenir and Rolando Rodriguez from the landslide at the Casita volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at around $1billion (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|The cyclone dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across Puerto Rico, peaking at 11.13inches (283mm) near Ponce. The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island, including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> above flood stage. Its passage left about 79,000people without power and 144,000 without water. In the northern {{portion of the}} island, the rainfall caused a mudslides that buried an automobile, which killed its driver.|$|E

5|$|Water brakes {{were first}} {{introduced}} on SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a splashdown element, in which {{a body of water}} surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> into the air behind it.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from {{the wreck of the}} RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several inches to <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees {{at the house of}} J. Leonard Replogle.|$|E

5|$|Local {{television}} stations ran all-night {{coverage of the}} deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown {{along the banks of}} Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} from Kyle in South Carolina {{peaked at}} 6.35inches (161mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> in depth in roads and buildings; there, {{a nursing home}} had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17mobile homes, forcing about 50people to move to shelters. Ten car accidents were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained {{on the ground for}} about 1.25miles (2km). At its peak strength, the tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car. The tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106buildings, 28severely. Eight people were injured by the tornado.|$|E
5|$|Strong waves caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped <b>several</b> <b>feet</b> {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E
