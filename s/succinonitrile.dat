Both conformers are found to coordinate to the copper surface through the pi system of one of the two (C-triple bond-N) groups. In the case of N-methyl-thioacetamide, the population of the cis isomer is greatly increased on Cu and Ag surfaces.

40|$|We {{study the}} temperature-dependent {{molecular}} dynamics, ion conduction, and phase behavior of plastic-crystal electrolytes {{based on the}} <b>succinonitrile</b> molecule. We employ calorimetry and dielectric spectroscopy to probe binary mixtures of <b>succinonitrile</b> with glutaronitrile or acetonitrile and also analyze the effect of dissolving lithium salts in these systems. The glutaronitrile-succinonitrile mixture has the highest conductivity, {{and it is the}} only plastic-crystal system that displays a perfect correlation between the ion drift and the on-site reorientational dynamics. Doping with lithium ions boosts the conductivity but breaks such perfect correlation. All of these features can be rationalized by assuming that conduction is due to the self-diffusion of a minority of ionized dinitrile molecules. Doping with lithium salts slows down the collective molecular dynamics while leaving the intramolecular relaxation motion unaffected. All samples exhibit a very broad melting transition and exist in a mixed liquid plus plastic state near room temperature. Some mixtures undergo phase segregation below 233 K, the transition temperature between the plastic and the fully ordered solid phase in pure <b>succinonitrile,</b> resulting in the appearance of a space-charge relaxation loss.

Solid State Ionics 2003, 161. 105 : Alarco et al. Nat. Mater. 2004, 3, 476). We report on the relaxational dynamics of the plastic phase near the two first-order phase transitions and {{on the effect of}} dissolving a salt in the plastic matrix by quasi-elastic neutron scattering. At 240 K, the three observed relaxations are localized and we can describe their dynamics (iota approximate to 1. 7, 17, and 140 ps) to a certain extent from a model using a single molecule that was proposed by Bee et al. allowing for all conformations in its unit cell (space group IM 3 M). The extent of the localized motion as observed is however larger than that predicted by the model and suggests that the isomerization of <b>succinonitrile</b> is correlated with a jump to the nearest neighbor site ill the unit cell. The salt containing system is known to be it good ionic conductor, and our results show that the effect of the ions on the <b>succinonitrile</b> matrix is homogeneous. Because the isomerizations and rotations are governed by intermolecular interactions, the dissolved ions have ail effect over ail extended range. Due to the addition of the salt, the dynamics of one of the components (iota approximate to 17 ps) shows more diffusive character at 300 K.
