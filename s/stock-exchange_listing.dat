40|$|This Essay tackles a {{pervasive}} misperception {{on the part}} of regulators that director independence significantly increases the efficacy of corporate boards. In this Essay, I assert that such “cosmetic independence” is not enough to remedy the corporate failures of recent years. Cosmetic independence is independence that takes into account only a corporate director’s relationship with the corporation and not the tools a director needs to achieve substantive independence. These tools include time, information, and knowledge, all of which have been recognized as critical to effective decision-making processes in organizational behavior literature. This Essay is critical of regulatory reforms intended to improve board monitoring. Regulators have consistently responded to each new wave of corporate failure by requiring greater board independence without much regard to the organizational process necessary for boards to function effectively. These regulations are designed to enhance board performance by changing the composition and structure of the board through increasing the number of directors that meet a superficial definition of independence and creating a more detailed and independent committee structure. The changes assume that stricter definitions of director independence necessarily lead to boards more effectively monitoring corporate management. There are numerous, well-known examples of this shift toward increasing director independence, which started in the 1970 s and has continued through major legislative overhauls such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Examples include changes in <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listing</b> standards post-Enron, the federal government’s involvement in corporate boards following the 2008 financial crisis, and most recently, several of the corporate governance provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. These reforms have implemented little more than a cosmetic independence, which is both static and decontextualized. Cosmetic independence does not provide the board with the substantive components that are necessary for successful, informed decision-making and form the foundation of the board’s monitoring role. I therefore challenge the conventional wisdom that increasing director independence, by itself, can meaningfully reduce agency costs or the likelihood of repeated corporate failure when a substantive approach to selecting directors is needed. I submit that we should be skeptical of cosmetic independence as the principal criteria for board membership. In order to reduce managerial influence in the boardroom, the basis on which directors are selected must be broadened to include time, information, and knowledge...|$|E
50|$|From {{the end of}} February 2009 {{through the}} end of October 2014, <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listed</b> Equity REITs have posted total returns of 312% (28.4% per year) and all <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listed</b> REITs have gained 295% (27.5% per year), outpacing the return of 217% (22.6% per year) in the broad stock market and 210% (22.1% per year) in large-cap stocks. Economic climates {{characterized}} by rising interest rates have a detrimental effect on REIT shares. Thedividends paid by REITs look less attractive when compared to bonds that haveincreasing coupon rates. Also, when investors shy away from REITs, it makes itdifficult for management to raise additional funds to acquire more property.|$|R
40|$|In our {{contribution}} we study how the ownership channel affects {{the stock price}} volatility of listed stock markets. In particular, we study how a linkage between a parent company and its affiliates may drive differences in stock price volatility, within and across countries. We exploit a worldwide dataset of <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listed</b> firms, controlling for several financial dimensions, to assess whether business groups matter to financial volatility. The answer is positive and {{does not depend on}} the definition of volatility used. Our results contribute to the corporate finance literature by defining the role of multinational corporate control in financial markets, and to the financial stability literature by assessing corporate control as an undiscovered channel of transmission for financial shocks...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we extend {{comparative}} value relevance research by examining {{patterns in the}} value relevance of accounting numbers {{as a function of}} the month in which market values are observed. We stimate the residual income model on a sample of <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listed</b> companies from Germany and France and find dramatically divergent patterns of fit. In France, accounting numbers have strong relevance for market valuation after publication of annual reports in February or March. In Germany, accounting numbers have stronger relevance during the fiscal year. We term the two effects forecast and coincident relevance, respectively. We argue that the divergence in patterns of fit may be a result of limited interim reporting in France before adoption of IFRS. value relevance, accounting earnings, equity valuation, methodology...|$|R
40|$|Master thesis in {{business}} administration, School of business administration, Linnaeus University, accounting, 4 FE 03 E, Spring 2011. Authors: Linda Åslund and Shirin Yousef. Supervisor: Professor Sven-Olof Yrjö Collin Examiner: Christopher von Koch Title: The Swedish code of good governance – Who finds it useful?  Background: Corporate governance has emerged {{to maintain the}} stockholders interests in corporations where the owners are separated from control {{in order to create}} confidence in the corporations. In 2005 the Swedish code of good governance emerged to prevent in part additional corporate scandals from happening {{and to make sure that}} the board is acting in the interest of the owners. The code is a complement to the Swedish Companies Act since it has a more strict demand in certain areas but it gives the companies a possibility to deviate by either complying or explaining their actions. Purpose: The purpose with this thesis is to examine who finds the Swedish code of good governance useful. Method: The research method of this survey is quantitative where the purpose is to investigate deviations in the companies’ corporate governance reports. The scientific approach is deductive where empirical data is generated from the theories. Secondary data is gathered from the companies’ corporate governance reports and annual reports.   Conclusions: Out of the different variables that we examined we find significant correlations between the boards ownership, Audit Bureau, female auditors, institutional and foreign owned corporations, the corporations profitability, type of business, <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>lists</b> and the number of deviations which the corporations does and on some of the recommendations in Swedish code of good governance. From these variables we make the conclusion on who finds the Code useful...|$|R
40|$|Using SFAS 123 disclosures, Botosan and Plumlee [Botosan, C., & Plumlee, M. (2001). Stock option expense: The {{sword of}} Damocles Revealed. Accounting Horizons, 15, 311 - 327] find that if stock-based {{compensation}} {{were to be}} expensed rather than not recognised {{on the face of}} financial statements, the impact on key measures used to assess the performance of the fastest growing US firms would be material. Street and Cereola [Street, D. L., & Cereola, S. (2004). Stock option compensation: impact of expense recognition on performance indicators of non-domestic companies listed in the U. S. Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 13, 21 - 37] subsequently also use SFAS 123 disclosures to determine that the average impact of expensing stock-based compensation on diluted EPS for non-US domiciled firms listed on US exchanges will be material and approximately 40 %. In this paper, we examine whether these findings apply across international borders to firms that are required from 2005 to adopt IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment to expense stock-based payments, and across a broad range of industries and firms' growth phases. Based on Australian Stock Exchange-listed firms' 2002 stock-based compensation disclosures of the value of options granted to directors and the top 5 executives, the expensing of options will have a significant negative effect on approximately 20 % of our sample firms' financial performance ratios. It appears that the materiality of the impact is neither industry specific nor restricted to high growth firms. As the IFRS 2 expensing requirement extends to stock-based compensation issued to all employees, our findings are conservative estimates of the impact. The findings suggest that a stock-based compensation accounting policy change will affect recognised financial numbers and could have consequential ramifications for contractual specifications and valuations of firms across a range of industries and growth phases. Our sample of Australian firms provides an interesting context for the study, since these firms have neither traditionally expensed nor necessarily disclosed stock-based payments but from 2005, all <b>stock-exchange</b> <b>listed</b> Australian firms will be at the forefront of IFRS 2 adoption...|$|R
