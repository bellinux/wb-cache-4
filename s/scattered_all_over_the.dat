Celestin, who shares a story credit on The Birth of a Nation, was convicted of sexual assault and {{received}} a six-month to one-year prison sentence in 2001, later raised to {{two to four years}} per state sentencing guidelines. Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges. Despite the accuser's willingness to testify at a second trial, prosecutors declined because other witnesses had <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50 {{the brigade}} started landing at DZ-N, {{just north of}} Ranville. Equipment and navigational {{failures}} by the RAF pilots and the division's pathfinders resulted in the brigade being <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> countryside. By 02:40 only around 40 per cent of the 7th Parachute Battalion had reached their assembly point. Unable to wait any longer, the battalion headed for the captured bridges, and established a defensive position in Benouville, the division's only position west of the Caen Canal. Most of the 12th Parachute Battalion landed on {{the eastern edge of}} the DZ, and only around 60 per cent of the battalion arrived at their assembly point. Their objective was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which was achieved by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion could also only muster around 60 per cent of its strength on the DZ. This battalion had two objectives; to secure Ranville and to clear the DZ of obstacles for the division's gliders which were to land next.|$|E

Measurements of 6 of them revealed 1,150 becquerels per kilogram, {{more than twice the}} governmental set safety level. Because the origins were <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> prefecture, Miyagi became the second prefecture with a ban on all beef-cattle shipments.

In Haifa, the Jews almost single-handedly defended the town against the Crusaders, holding out for a month, (June–July 1099). At this time there were Jewish communities <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. As Jews were not allowed to hold land during the Crusader period, they worked at trades and commerce in the coastal towns during times of quiescence.

25|$|Today {{the library}} is <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world. Codices were dismembered with {{individual}} folios ending up in different libraries or museums. At times, even an individual folio ended up in different libraries which were thousands of miles apart. Serious effort has been undertaken to artificially regroup these codices from their Diaspora with photographic means. Mgr. Louis Théophile Lefort, a coptologist of Louvain, made the first comprehensive attempt toward achieving this monumental goal. However his collection was a tragic victim of World War II. Currently this task has been taken up by Prof. Tito Orlandi and his associates in the Sapienza University of Rome. There, they formed the Corpus dei Manoscritti Copti Letterari. They {{were able to identify}} hundreds of separate codices with the aid of the prior works that Coptic scholars had previously done.|$|E

25|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} from mountain people, the Alpine provinces predominantly supplied infantry; only one Alpine cavalry ala is recorded. About 26 Alpine regiments were raised in the Julio-Claudian period, the great majority under Augustus or his successor Tiberius (i.e. before AD 37). Of these, 6 regiments disappeared, either destroyed in action or disbanded, by AD 68. A further 2 regiments were raised by Vespasian (ruled 69–96). These and the 20 surviving Julio-Claudian units are recorded {{at least until the}} mid 2nd century, but by that time only around a quarter were still based in the Alpine provinces or in neighbouring Germania Superior (Upper Rhine area). The rest were <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> empire and would probably have long since lost their ethnic Alpine identity through local recruitment.|$|E

25|$|The 11th Indian Infantry Division had {{suffered}} huge casualties, although some would eventually {{make their way}} back to join in the fight for Singapore, many more would still be in the jungle after the surrender. Large numbers of these survivors would be captured but a few, like Lt. Colonel Lindsay Robertson (who had strong views about surrendering) and his party of Argylls attempted to evade capture, but were unable to keep ahead of the rapid advance of the Japanese. Robertson was killed on 20 January 1942. The remaining survivors from the two brigades were <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Malayan Peninsula. Some of the Argylls were still at large by August 1945. A Gurkha NCO, Naik Nakam Gurung, was found during the Malayan Emergency in October 1949, he had been living in the jungle since 1942. The 12th Indian Brigade had practically ceased to exist and the 28th Brigade was but a shadow.|$|E

25|$|Naultinus {{species and}} indeed, New Zealand lizards in general, are very {{conservative}} in their evolutionary development of scales. Most have the standard gecko-type scales which {{are small and}} granular, giving the skin a dull, velvety appearance. The two exceptions to this rule are two South Island members of the genus; the rough gecko (N. rudis) and, to a lesser extent, the Marlborough green gecko (N. manukanus). The rough gecko has enlarged conical scales which are both significantly wider and which protrude much further from the body than ordinary scales. These enlarged scales are <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> body except for {{the underside of the}} animal. The Marlborough green gecko also has enlarged scales, but they are confined to the dorsal, pelvic area, and sometimes even in rows {{along the side of the}} animal.

25|$|An episode {{from the}} life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the {{garments}} of gopis when they were bathing in a pond near Vrindavan. Varuna, the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they were taking a bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that they come out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E
25|$|Sacred groves are <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country, and are {{referred}} to by different names {{in different parts of}} India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from scrub forests in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan maintained by the Bishnois, to rain forests in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Himachal Pradesh in the north and Kerala in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka alone maintained over 1000 sacred groves in their region. The Gurjar people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God Devnarayan.Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove. Similarly Mangar Bani, last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area. 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000.|$|E

25|$|At long last, on October 28, {{a killing}} frost struck. The city sent out word to Memphians <b>scattered</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country to come home. Though yellow fever cases were {{recorded}} {{in the pages of}} Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, the epidemic seemed quieted. The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end. On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve and die. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878–1893. Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in Memphis. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.|$|E
