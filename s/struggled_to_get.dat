Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road.

5|$|DuMont <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> its {{programs}} aired {{in many parts}} of the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by AT The service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually received a compromise.|$|E

Jim Craig fouled Cappellini in the box, and Mazzola converted to put Inter in front after only six minutes. Once they had taken the lead, Internazionale retreated back into their defensive style, which allowed Celtic to attack. However, they <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through Internazionale's defensive wall and were mainly restricted to long shots from outside the box. Bertie Auld hit the crossbar then a cross from Jimmy Johnstone was gathered up by Giuliano Sarti, who then tipped a header from the same player over the crossbar. Internazionale pulled nine men back, but Celtic kept attacking them. Tommy Gemmell's dangerous free-kick was saved by Sarti, he then speculatively attempted to lob the Inter 'keeper and hit the bar. Despite Celtic's inability to break through their opponents defence they were in complete control of the match and Internazionale {{were not able to}} attack. Inter had not had another chance since their goal, whilst Celtic found themselves foiled time and again by outstanding goalkeeping from Sarti.|$|E
