For analysis, OLS technique is used covering time series data for the years 1975 - 76 to 2006 - 07 that was made stationary by Durbin-Watson criterion. AR (1) is used to check autocorrelation. The results for CPI food, CPI general, WPI general, GDP deflator and SPI {{show that they are}} negatively related with M 1 <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> money. CPI food, CPI general, WPI general, GDP deflator, and SPI are also negatively related with M 2 <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> money.

5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> raw cotton.

The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry.

40|$|The lack of pricing data {{coupled by}} the {{presence}} of altruism creates challenges to estimating substitution patterns in the organs market. This paper proposes using variation in traffic safety laws an instrumental variable for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors. These instruments are then used to identify substitution patterns between living and cadaveric kidney donors. Using panel data from 1988 - 2008, we find that a 1 % decrease in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors per 100, 000 individuals increases the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> living donors per 100, 000 individuals between 0. 36 % to 0. 54 %. On average, a decrease of four to five cadaveric donations causes an increase of one living kidney donation. Disaggregate living donors into biological donors and non-biological donors, we find the strongest effect is among nonbiological donors known to the organ recipient. A 1 % increase in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors decrease the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> kidney donations from this group by 1. 54 %. Lastly, the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donations is found to have little or no effect on donations made by biological and anonymous donors...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} {{focuses on the}} impact of competitive forces on the provision of social or merit goods by non-profit hospitals. We specifically examine the behavior of altruistic non-profit hospitals in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> charity care. The effects of competitive pressures and past charity care provision on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> philanthropic donations to nonprofit hospitals are also examined. Empirical models <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> donations and charity care are specified and estimated using data on nonprofit hospitals in Florida for the years 1980 - 1984. The coefficient estimates imply strong income effects in the charity care supply equations. This raises the possibility that competitive pressures and limits on hospital payments, under public insurance programs, may reduce the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> indigent care. The results from the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> donations models suggest that philanthropic donations will alleviate the competitive pressures to a small degree. ...|$|R

Historic episodes of deflation have often been associated with the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> goods going up (due to increased productivity) without an increase in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> money, or (as with the Great Depression and possibly Japan in the early 1990s) the demand for goods going down combined with a decrease in the money <b>supply.</b> Studies <b>of</b> the Great Depression by Ben Bernanke have indicated that, in response to decreased demand, the Federal Reserve of the time decreased the money supply, hence contributing to deflation.|$|R
