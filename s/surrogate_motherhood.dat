The donor is paid {{approximately}} US$1200 {{by the government and}} also usually receives additional funds from either the recipient or local charities. The Economist and the Ayn Rand Institute approve and advocate a legal market elsewhere. They argued that if 0.06% of Americans between 19 and 65 were to sell one kidney, the national waiting list would disappear (which, the Economist wrote, happened in Iran). The Economist argued that donating kidneys is no more risky than <b>surrogate</b> <b>motherhood,</b> which can be done legally for pay in most countries.|$|E

The film's plot revolves around the struggle of McGregor's character to fit into the highly structured world he lives in, isolated in a compound, and the series of events that unfold when he questions how truthful that world is.

2500|$|Since the gonad tissue {{develops}} into testes {{rather than}} ovaries, they are thus unable to create ova {{but may be}} able to create sperm.

Thus, they would not [...] physically be able to carry a pregnancy in any event. Even with treatments such as <b>surrogate</b> <b>motherhood,</b> female infertility is caused by the lack of any ova to implant in a surrogate. Male fertility, however, can still be possible if viable sperm is present in the testes and is able to be extracted. In general, individuals with 5-ARD are capable of producing viable sperm.|$|E

2500|$|Marleau {{received}} {{a report on}} new reproductive technologies shortly after her appointment as Health Minister, and welcomed its primary thesis that conception and child-bearing should not become for-profit industries. [...] She reiterated this view in late 1994, when speaking {{about the need for}} legislation to prevent the sale of human sperm and eggs. [...] She called for a voluntary moratorium on commercial <b>surrogate</b> <b>motherhood</b> contracts the following year, as a first step toward greater regulation. [...] Some believed this approach fell short of the 1993 report's recommendations, and expressed concern that it would be ineffective. [...] Marleau later acknowledged that the voluntary approach was not successful, and indicated that legislation banning the sale of human eggs was forthcoming.
