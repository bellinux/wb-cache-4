5|$|Though Clark {{converted}} Du Tertre's tail measurement to 18 in (45.7cm), Lenoble {{pointed out}} that a 17th-century French foot unit was <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the English equivalent, and the measurement should rather be converted to 19.3 in (49cm), indicating a smaller size difference between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw.|$|E
5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China. This subspecies is wholly migratory, wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through South-East Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan; some even reach Africa. It is very similar to, but <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than,</b> the nominate subspecies.|$|E

5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E

5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a}} few {{kilometers}} difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|P. l. fossilis, P. fossilis or P. spelaea fossilis, {{known as}} the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been {{recovered}} from Germany and Italy.

5|$|S. t. pallidus is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} subspecies by its paler body color, stronger white markings and, in males, a larger black cap.

5|$|The 2010 {{census of}} Association of Religion Data Archives has also {{reported}} that 46.5% {{of the total population}} was Christian, <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the Muslim population of 45.5%, while 7.7% were members of other religions. However, these estimates should be taken with caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south, which are predominantly Christian.|$|E
5|$|Aries {{contains}} several {{stars with}} extrasolar planets. HIP 14810, a G5 type star, is orbited by three giant planets (those {{more than ten}} times the mass of Earth). HD 12661, like HIP 14810, is a G-type main sequence star, <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the Sun, with two orbiting planets. One planet is 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, {{and the other is}} 1.57 times the mass of Jupiter. HD 20367 is a G0 type star, approximately the size of the Sun, with one orbiting planet. The planet, discovered in 2002, has a mass 1.07 times that of Jupiter and orbits every 500 days.|$|E

The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E

5|$|Andean {{cocks-of-the-rock}} face <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> predators <b>than</b> smaller songbirds. Predators {{are attracted}} to leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males.

5|$|It is <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Pallas, though {{significantly}} more massive. Vesta {{is the last}} remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|T. m. propinquus breeds from {{southeast}} British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan {{south to}} southern California and northern Baja California. It winters {{throughout much of}} the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. It is the same size as or <b>slightly</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head.|$|E
