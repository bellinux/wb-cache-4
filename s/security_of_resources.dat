40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exploratory {{review of the}} extent to which the UK's retail industry is employing social media, specifically Facebook, to communicate their sustainability aspirations, commitments and achievements. The paper begins with an outline of the development and characteristics of social media and this is followed by a short discussion of the concept and contested meanings of sustainability. The paper draws its empirical material from the Facebook pages of the UK's top ten retail companies. The findings reveal that the individual retail businesses operated by the top ten retail companies all have Facebook pages but that these pages are dominated by marketing and sales promotion material with commentary on sustainability or attempts to develop engagement with members on sustainability being very limited. More critically the authors argue that if the wider concerns of climate change, the availability and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and waste disposal become increasingly perceived to be pressing issues then the UK's leading retailers may need to look to harness the powerful potential of social media in an attempt to encourage more sustainable shopping behaviour...|$|E

40|$|With {{the pervasiveness}} of smart phones and the advance of Mobile Internet, more and more Mobile Internet {{services}} migrated to the cloud service platform for better user experience. As {{one of the most}} indispensable components of the cloud computing infrastructure, virtualization technology has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of virtualization still faces many challenges in information security. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called multilevel and grouping security model for virtualization (V-MGSM), for the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in cloud computing platform. Specifically, to fulfill the balance between information sharing and privacy preservation, the virtual machines (VMs) are divided into diverse groups based on their corresponding entities, and each VM in the same group is assigned to different security level according to security requirements. Besides, the operation between VMs is based on mandatory access control mechanism. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed V-MGSM can provide a secure communication mechanism for VMs and implement the synchronous updates of the borrowed data. Ultimately, we implement V-MGSM in Xen for experiments, and the results demonstrate that V-MGSM can indeed achieve data security and privacy protection efficiently for Mobile Internet service...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If {{an access}} control policy {{promises}} that a resource is protected in a system, {{how do we know}} it is really protected? To give an answer we formalise in this paper the Role-Compatibility Model—a framework, introduced by Ott, in which access control policies can be expressed. We also give a dynamic model determining which security related events can happen while a system is running. We prove that if a policy in this framework ensures a resource is protected, then there is really no sequence of events that would compromise the security of this resource. We also prove the opposite: if a policy does not prevent a security com-promise of a resource, then there is a sequence of events that will compromise it. Consequently, a static policy check is sufficient (sound and complete) in order to guarantee or expose the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> before running the system. Our formal model and correctness proof are mechanised in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover using Paulson’s inductive method for reasoning about valid sequences of events. Our results apply to the Role-Compatibility Model, but can be readily adapted to other role-based access control models. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The concept „sustainable {{development}} ” {{has become}} important {{in connection with}} alternative energy resources, current problems of environmental protection and the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> People who are not directly involved believe that these issues do not concern them. With the purpose of raising awareness of the problem, {{it is important to}} integrate it in the education, particularly engineering education. The process of “saving the world ” should be started with looking at ourselves. People’s behavior and habits have caused extensive energy consumption. The main reasons are, firstly, the lack of the knowledge of effective energy saving measures, and, secondly, people are not willing to change their habits. The authors of the paper carried out the research regarding the Latvia University of Agriculture engineering students ’ basic knowledge of the renewable and non-renewable energy resources, effective energy use in the transport, industry and building, and energy saving measures. In order to encourage youngsters to change their habits regarding saving energy, it is advisable to involve students in various research projects on energy use at the university and at home, reflecting the findings in the term papers, research projects {{as well as in the}} presentations of “C ” part study courses...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural policy {{allows for}} {{governing}} bodies to better control the landscape, economy, and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> Because of this power, {{it is essential}} for policy and its effects to be thoroughly understood. This study examines the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTPP, “tobacco buyout”), in effect from 2005 to 2014, using a mixed methods approach. The TTPP lifted the existing geographic restrictions of tobacco production and deregulated market prices formerly controlled by the government. Kentucky’s economic, social, and agricultural landscapes changed significantly in the wake of this legislation. To explore these changes, this study employs semi-structured interviews and remote sensing analyses for a full understanding of the tobacco buyout in Kentucky. Remote sensing, and specifically multispectral imagery, offer an effective and economical way to classify crops, which is important in understanding what exists on the physical landscape. Using Landsat imagery from 2015, I employed a supervised classification of data to quantify the extent of tobacco production. I then integrate the classified landscape with survey and interview data regarding trends among tobacco farmers. This research will not only provide an extension of the existing narrative for the buyout, and further explore TTPP policy’s influence on the Kentucky agricultural landscape, but also exemplify remote sensing as a tool for policy assessment...|$|E

40|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Korea's population distribution {{is the fact}} that the number of its senior citizens is advancing faster than in any other country-even more so than in Japan, in fact, where the phenomenon has been most commonly remarked. Moreover, 2004 statistics indicate that the average number of children per woman of childbearing age in Korea is a mere 1. 16, the lowest birthrate in the world. Clearly, Korea's population distribution is undergoing significant changes. On the one hand, with the massive injection of public funds into the Korean economy as part of the process of reorganizing business and the banking system after the currency crisis of 1997, large-scale demands for expansion of the social security net emerged, and this spilled over into the already struggling economy. Additionally, government stimulus packages aimed at overcoming the recent slowdown in economic growth, worsening economic deficits caused by increases in labor and welfare needs, and the accumulating national debt, also threaten the overall stability of the economy. Amidst this situation, the rapidly increasing elderly population exerts considerable influence on the social welfare system, from the decrease in those of childbearing age to increased needs for preventive health care, medical treatment and welfare services, to say nothing of aggravated income tax distributions. Needless to say, the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> for the expansion and maintenance of public health, aid, and welfare services is a particularly crucial subject. In the present essay, I propose to consider how the aging of Korean society has affected our social welfare system. In Section One, I consider the pace at which the aging of society has progressed, and how future population distributions will look. I also analyze dropping birthrates and extended life expectancies as one result of the aging of society. In Section Two, I examine the economic conditions that accompany increases in the senior citizen population. Of particular interest {{is the fact that}}, as this aging trend has continued, Korea has committed large amounts of public funding for economic development, while the budget for public welfare has been cut. And while our national debt is not as severe as that in European countries and the United States, we still cannot avoid the reality that as our society ages, we will need to increase expenditures in social welfare. In Section Three, I consider whether the public retirement system plays a sufficient role, institutionally or economically, in the face of society's aging trend. The national retirement system will be in the red as of the year 2031, and by 2042 the reserve capital itself will be depleted. As the proportional burden on the public retirement system continually increases, it is vital that we map out a strategy for making that system more efficient, and for diversifying the uses of retirement resources...|$|E
