5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. <b>She</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|Time {{magazine}} also {{voted the}} dress as amongst the Worst Oscar dresses {{of all time}} saying, [...] "Our problem with the outfit Gardiner wore to accept her award isn't that her dress was made out of a bizarre, nontraditional material. Our {{problem is that the}} material of choice was the American Express gold card. It's tacky. And how did <b>she</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in that thing?" ...|$|R

After taking off her jacket, <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> {{on the couch in}} the living room. In another room, West is seen getting out of bed. Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} an {{announcement}} on television that nuclear activities has destroyed cities like London, Paris, New York City, and Los Angeles. It then cuts {{to a room}} where Madonna lies in her bed watching the news about the nuclear explosion. As the song starts, a visibly distressed Madonna walks to her dressing table. <b>She</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and kisses a framed photograph of her mother, while looking at herself. She drapes a cape around her, picks up a rod and a hat, and goes {{out of her house}} as the chorus of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] starts. Madonna is seen in {{what appears to be a}} post-apocalyptic destroyed city, where there are no signs of life and posters of the Rebel Heart album are shown burning. She looks around and walks carefully among the destruction, while twirling around the cape.|$|E

[...] The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to get Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while he looks around the station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells him that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. They are led to a room where <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> in a chair located {{in the center of}} a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. [...] He learns from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station.|$|E
6000|$|We {{should be}} careful {{to get out of}} an {{experience}} only the wisdom that is in it--and stop there; lest we be like the cat that <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> on a hot stove-lid. <b>She</b> will never <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on a hot stove-lid again--and that is well; but also <b>she</b> will never <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on a cold one any more.

Instead, she decides to share with them the song she helped finish. Before <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> to play, sunlight shines through the stained glass window. Ronnie smiles and says [...] "Hi, Daddy," [...] remembering what she overheard her father tell Jonah earlier in the movie; that whenever light shines through the window, it's him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{tradition}} and modern pressures {{in relation to}} marriage—and, by extension, within Japanese culture as a whole—is {{one of the major}} conflicts Ozu portrays in the film. Sorensen indicates by several examples that what foods a character eats or even how he or <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> (e.g., on tatami mats or Western-style chairs) reveals the relationship of that character to tradition. According to Peña, Noriko [...] "is the quintessential moga—modan gaaru, 'modern girl'—that populates Japanese fiction, and really the Japanese imagination, beginning in the 1920s onward." [...] Throughout most of the film, Noriko wears Western clothing rather than a kimono, and outwardly behaves in up-to-date ways. However, Bordwell asserts that [...] "Noriko is more old-fashioned than her father, insisting that he could not get along without her and resenting the idea that a widower might remarry… she clings to an outmoded notion of propriety." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Shinji Niwa, and features dramatic scenes with model [...] and actor Terunosuke Takezai, which are interspersed with scenes of Juju performing the song. The drama scenes begin with Kana's character receiving a phone call outside at night time from Takezai's character, telling her he is sorry. Kana's character walks through an underground train station, and sees many posters of her and her former boyfriend {{on one of the}} walls. She slowly walks past the photos that depict happier times in their relationship. Kana's character begins to run until she gets outside, where a screen is showing home videos of her together with her former lover. <b>She</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> and begins to cry. The scenes of Juju feature constant close-up shots of her against a darkened background, as she performs the song in winter clothing. As she does this, the lighting constantly changes and flares behind her.|$|E
