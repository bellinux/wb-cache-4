[...] "Maybe the term 'manifest disregard' was meant to name a new ground for review," [...] he speculated, echoing Posner in Bavarati, [...] "but maybe it merely {{referred}} to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them." [...] In the past, the Court had [...] "merely taken the Wilko language as we found it, without embellishment ... and now that its meaning is implicated, we <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> accord it the significance that Hall Street urges." ...|$|E
2500|$|The state {{defendants}} immediately filed {{a notice}} of appeal and applied for a stay in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 21, Circuit Judges Harris Hartz and David Ebel granted the state attorney general's application for a stay. In their order, they cited similar stays granted in Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Oklahoma upon filing of petitions for certiorari and wrote: [...] "n the interests of consistency, we <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> deviate from this approach in this case." [...] The judges also noted that one day earlier the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a stay in McQuigg v. Bostic. The Tenth Circuit suspended further proceedings in the case on September 18.|$|E

The head of the Air Ministry investigation said the removal of parts of the wreckage for souvenirs had not helped his work. The investigation had shown no evidence of faulty material or bad workmanship {{but it was clear}} that the port wing had folded or collapsed upwards where it joined the fuselage. The engine and tail plane had broken away and the passengers were thrown out of the aircraft. The coroner directed that as a government inquiry would be held then some of the technical details of the accident need not be heard. The coroner could <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> further delay the verdict until after the inquiry by the Aeronautical Research Committee. The jury returned a verdict [...] "that the victims met their death falling from an aeroplane, the cause of the accident being unknown".|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{the general}} {{election}} Pitt won a large majority. Fitzwilliam repudiated Lord Shelburne's attempt to get him the office of Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. As he wrote to Lady Fitzwilliam on 4 September: [...] "Having experienced very closely and very attentively his Lordship's conduct of late, and consequently having formed an opinion of his present principles, I can <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> expect that as an honest man I shall ever be able to give support to his administration, and therefore as a fair one I must decline receiving any favour at his hands". Fitzwilliam was now considered the Duke of Portland's deputy, and was a key figure in Whig councils and was frequently the first Whig speaker in parliamentary debates. On 18 July he attacked Pitt's trade policies with Ireland as [...] "a system that overturned the whole policy of the navigation and trade of Great Britain", satisfying neither Britain nor Ireland. He said he spoke [...] "as an Englishman" [...] when he criticised the opening up of British and colonial markets to Ireland as detrimental to Britain and [...] "as an Irishman" [...] when he criticised the considerable burdens Ireland would be placed under. Ireland's grievances were constitutional not economic, and he cited the government's plan to prevent public meetings. Fitzwilliam was chosen to open the debate on the address {{at the opening of the}} next session of Parliament in 1786, and said that [...] "The wisdom of Ireland had accomplished what the prudence of this country could not achieve". In 1787 Fitzwilliam spoke only once, in opposition to trade with Portugal as this would be detrimental to Yorkshire manufacturers.|$|E
2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward." [...] Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|E
