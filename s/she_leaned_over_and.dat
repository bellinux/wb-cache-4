60|$|Quest glanced towards Lenora. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{took his}} arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> looked down. He was {{apparently}} {{clinging to the}} side with his head barely reaching {{the top of the}} rail.|$|E
60|$|She {{was walking}} {{close to his}} side, so close that the hand which raised her skirt as they crossed the street touched his, and her soft breath as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> spoke fell upon his cheek.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} bright with triumph. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> {{kissed him on}} the lips. Then she sprang lightly to her feet.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him, <b>and</b> drew a long {{deep breath}} of relief. It was the reward of many weary {{days and nights}} of {{constant}} watching and careful nursing. His reason was saved.|$|R
60|$|The man sank {{forward from}} the hips, {{relaxing}} entirely, and with a groan dropped his head on her knee. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> pressed her lips softly and lingeringly to his hair.|$|R
60|$|Lady Hilda {{began to}} laugh, softly, but as if {{genuinely}} amused. John sat {{and watched her}} in ominous silence. Not the flicker of a smile parted his set lips. His visitor, however, was undisturbed. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> patted his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{want to come}} in for {{a little}} while, an' are willin' to pay you for it," [...] Joe repeated, and the old lady shook her head doubtfully as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed the princess {{squarely}} on the mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Father Brown {{took a small}} {{book out}} of his pocket and began to read steadily; he betrayed no {{consciousness}} of the fact that the red-haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him. At last <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> said in a low, strong voice: [...] "Why do you say that? How do you know it's false?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "You {{will think}} I am very stupid this morning. Won't you please {{write it down}} for me?" [...] The florist writes {{on a sheet of}} wrapping-paper, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> reads: [...] "Oh! Meteor! Well, it is very striking--a little too striking. I don't like such a vivid pink, and I don't like the name. Horrid to give such a name to a flower." [...] She puts both hands into her muff, and drifts a little way off, as if to get him in a better perspective. [...] "Can't you suggest something, Mr. Eichenlaub?" ...|$|R
60|$|The wise old colonel {{thought perhaps}} {{this might be}} the right time. He saw Helen's face as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> Jonathan, <b>and</b> that was enough for him. He would have taxed his {{ingenuity}} to the utmost to keep the others away from the young couple.|$|R
6000|$|... was declaimed {{with the}} painful {{precision}} of a schoolgirl {{who has been}} taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the balcony <b>and</b> came to those wonderful lines-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed him. The {{sun came}} bright-footed over the water, leaving a shining print on Siegmund's face. He lay, with half-closed eyes, sprawled loosely on the sand. Looking at his limbs, she {{imagined}} {{he must be}} heavy, like the bounders. She sat over him, with her fingers stroking his eyebrows, that were broad and rather arched. He lay perfectly still, in a half-dream.|$|E
6000|$|But {{of all the}} farewells, poor Billy's was {{the most}} pathetic, for the {{thought that she was}} really going became so {{unbearable}} that he cast himself down before her, hugging her little blue boots and blubbering despairingly, [...] "Don't go away! oh, don't!" [...] Goldilocks was so touched by this burst of feeling, that <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> lifting the poor lad's head, said, in her soft, little voice, ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that Louis himself, at any rate, {{believed}} what he was saying. I looked away from the young lady a little reluctantly. As though she understood Louis' warning, her lips parted {{for a moment in}} a faint, contemptuous smile. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> touched the man Bartot on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear. When I next looked in their direction I found his eyes fixed upon mine in a steady, malignant stare.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye lie!" [...] said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger. [...] "Me {{brother was}} worth tin dozen bog-trotting McCaskeys. After him would the bye be named." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the window-sill <b>and</b> {{looked down at}} the hurrying and bustle below.|$|R
60|$|A soft {{footfall}} sounded on the stairs. Lenore came. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> {{the starlight}} fell upon her face, sweet, luminous, beautiful. In {{the sense of}} her compelling presence, in the tender touch of her hands, in the whisper of woman's love, Dorn felt uplifted high above the dark pale of the present with its war and pain and clouded mind to wheat--to the fertile fields of a golden age to come.|$|R
6000|$|At last {{there came}} {{out into the}} quarter-gallery a very pretty lady, in deep black widow's weeds, and in her arms a baby. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the quarter-gallery, <b>and</b> looked back and back toward England far away; and as she looked she sang: ...|$|R
60|$|Douglas {{could not}} escape, {{for he had}} been recognised, and the house rang with his name. He bowed his {{acknowledgments}} time after time {{from the front of}} the box, and every one wondered at his late arrival and morning clothes, and at the woman in a long travelling coat, who sat by his side half hidden by the curtain. Only the Duchess, whose box was exactly opposite, and who had remarkably good eyesight, suddenly understood. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> waved her hand gaily.|$|E
60|$|They had a jolly {{time about}} that. Marcia {{was proud of}} her sacque; when she took it off {{and held it up}} by the loop in the neck, so as to realize its prettiness, she said she should make it last three winters at least; and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> gave Bartley a sweet kiss of {{gratitude}} and affection, and told him not to try {{to make up for it}} by extra work, but to help her scrimp for it.|$|E
60|$|The first {{bona fide}} buyer {{appeared}} in {{a little girl who}} could just get her chin on the counter, and who asked for an egg-beater. Erlcort had begun with only one assistant, the young lady who typed his letters and who said she guessed she could help him when she was not working. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> tried to understand the little girl, and then she called to Erlcort where he stood {{with his back to the}} fire and the morning paper open before his face.|$|E
60|$|His hand rested for {{a moment}} upon her shoulder. He drew her a little towards him. <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} laughed, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed him on both cheeks, and jumped up. The trim little parlourmaid was {{at the door with}} tea.|$|R
50|$|Mary {{is shown}} in grief and mourning, holding the body of her son on her lap, as <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> faces towards his crown of thorns. Christ body is emaciated, shrunken, decomposing and lacerated with the wounds of his crucifixion. Because of its small size and intimacy, the Piet√† was {{probably}} not intended for a main church altar, rather for either a side altar or home altar to be viewed by those in repentance.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} {{inclined}} for conversation. It was that gracious {{hour of the}} day when you have cleared lunch and haven't got to think of dinner yet, and have a bit of time to draw a breath or two. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the balcony <b>and</b> smiled pleasantly.|$|R
60|$|She responded {{a little}} ungraciously, but {{appeared}} {{a few minutes}} later, a filmy shawl of lace covering her bare shoulders. She walked by his side {{to the end of}} the terrace, along the curving walk through the plantation, and by the sea wall to the flagged space where some seats and a table had been fixed. Four hundred feet below, the sea was beating against jagged rocks. The moon was late and it was almost dark. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> he stood by her side.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the hostess}} of the place, having {{arranged}} her head-dress {{to her own}} satisfaction, came out behind the counter. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> looked for her drunken admirer. After all, he had money in his pocket, {{and he was not}} such a bad fellow. She would take him into her little room behind, and let him sleep for a while more comfortably. But--but where was he? He was not there. She turned the light higher and looked around. There was no one in the room at all. Two hopelessly drunken men and the stranger had left the place without making the slightest sound, or without calling for more drink. It was incredible. But it was true. The wine-shop keeper had never been so surprised in her life. Not only was she surprised, but she was frightened. The thing was beyond belief. The sweat broke out upon her forehead, and she crossed herself. The devil himself must have come and fetched them away, and, if so, why should he not fetch her. She was wicked enough. What a horrible thought.|$|E
6000|$|I told her, then, {{as well as}} I could, {{all that}} I had seen--the {{submarine}} shelling the open boats {{and all the rest}} of it. She thought it marvelous that we should have been spared in so providential a manner, and I had a pretty speech upon my tongue's end, but lacked the nerve to deliver it. Nobs had come over and nosed his muzzle into her lap, and she stroked his ugly face, and at last <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> put her cheek against his forehead. I have always admired Nobs; but this was the first time that it had ever occurred to me that I might wish to be Nobs. I wondered how he would take it, for he is as unused to women as I. But he took to it as a duck takes to water. What I lack of being a ladies' man, Nobs certainly makes up for as a ladies' dog. The old scalawag just closed his eyes and put on one of the softest [...] "sugar-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth" [...] expressions you ever saw and stood there taking it and asking for more. It made me jealous.|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[With a hard laugh.] Decent? Who {{told you}} I was? [CHRIS is sitting with bowed shoulders, {{his head in}} his hands. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> in {{exasperation}} <b>and</b> shakes him violently by the shoulder.] Don't go to sleep, Old Man! Listen here, I'm talking to you now! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ef you like." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bed <b>and</b> put {{her lips}} to his forehead, still damp with the dews of sleep, and then to his long-lashed lids. [...] "Mind Nip!"--the squirrel--he {{practically}} suggested. For an instant their blond curls mingled on the pillow. [...] "Now go to sleep," [...] she said curtly.|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness {{looked at}} the family, who held their heads down, and then at my lord, but this time without any dislike. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to him <b>and</b> said rapidly in German, [...] "I had unright when I said the Colonel was the only man of the family. Thou canst, if thou willest, Eugene." [...] To which remark my lord only bowed.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Makely bustled up to {{the bedside}} with her energetic, patronizing cheerfulness. [...] "Ah, Mrs. Camp, I am {{glad to see you}} looking so well this morning. I've been meaning to run over for several days past, but I couldn't find a moment till this morning, and I knew you didn't object to Sunday visits." [...] She took the invalid's hand in hers, and, with the air of showing how little she felt any {{inequality}} between them, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed her, where Mrs. Camp sat propped against her pillows. She had a large, nobly moulded face of rather masculine contour, {{and at the same time}} the most motherly look in the world. Mrs. Makely bubbled and babbled on, and every one waited patiently till she had done, and turned and said, toward the Altrurian: [...] "I have ventured to bring my friend, Mr. Homos, with me. He is from Altruria." [...] Then she turned to me and said: [...] "Mr. Twelvemough you know already through his delightful books"; but, although she paid me this perfunctory compliment it was perfectly apparent to me that in the esteem of this disingenuous woman the distinguished stranger was a far more important person than the distinguished author. Whether Mrs. Camp read my perception of this fact in my face or not I cannot say, but she was evidently determined that I should not feel a difference in her. She held out her hand to me first, and said that I never could know how many heavy hours I had helped to lighten for her, and then she turned to the Altrurian and took his hand. [...] "Oh!" [...] she said, with a long, deep-drawn sigh, as if that were the supreme moment of her life. [...] "And are you really from Altruria? It seems too good to be true!" [...] Her devout look and her earnest tone gave the commonplace words a quality that did not inhere in them, but Mrs. Makely took them on their surface.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old wooden}} {{clock in the}} kitchen began to strike, and she rose briskly {{to her feet and}} went and laid the books she had been holding in her lap on the table beside Mrs. Camp's bed. [...] "We must really be going," [...] she said, as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> kissed the invalid. [...] "It is your dinner-time, and we shall barely get back for lunch if we go by the Loop road; and I want very much to have Mr. Homos see the Witch's Falls on the way. I have got two or three of the books here that Mr. Makely brought me last night--I sha'n't have time to read them at once--and I'm {{smuggling}} in one of Mr. Twelvemough's, that he's too modest to present for himself." [...] She turned a gay glance upon me, and Mrs. Camp thanked me, and a number of civilities followed from all sides. In the process of their exchange, Mrs. Makely's spirits perceptibly rose, and she came away in high good-humor with the whole Camp family. [...] "Well, now, I am sure," [...] she said to the Altrurian, as we began the long ascent of the Loop road, [...] "you must allow that you have seen some very original characters. But how warped people get living alone so much! That is the great drawback of the country. Mrs. Camp thinks the savings-bank did her a real injury in taking a mortgage on her place, and Reuben seems to have seen just enough of the outside world to get it all wrong. But they are the best-hearted creatures in the world, and I know you won't misunderstand them. That unsparing country bluntness--don't you think it's perfectly delightful? I do like to stir poor Reuben up, and get him talking. He is a good boy, if he is so wrong-headed, and he's the most devoted son and brother in the world. Very few young fellows would waste their lives on an old farm like that; I suppose, when his mother dies, he will marry and strike out for himself in some growing place." ...|$|E
5000|$|American {{recording}} artist Reba McEntire wore a sheer red dress to the 1993 Country Music Association Awards ceremony on September 29, 1993. The sheer fabric {{was covered with}} sequins, and cut with a low neckline. The garment was designed by stylist Sandy Spika, and McEntire wore it during a duet performance of [...] "Does He Love You" [...] with Linda Davis. McEntire later said, [...] "I got more press off that dress than if I'd won entertainer of the year." [...] According to McEntire, when her little sister, Susie, saw her on stage <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Oh Mama!" [...] But all Mama said was, [...] "You need a few more sequins". The dress had a lasting influence and was even worn by men to her future shows in fancy dress. The dress was showcased for some time at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.|$|E
60|$|Berenice did not faint! She did {{not even}} lose {{consciousness}} for a moment. Moaning softly to herself, but dry-eyed, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>and</b> read the words which he had written to her, of which, indeed, the ink was scarcely dry. When she had finished, she took up the wine-glass in her own fingers, holding it so steadily that not a drop was spilt.|$|R
60|$|They {{went back}} to have tea at the Metropole. Mildred liked the crowd and the band. Philip was tired of talking, and he watched {{her face as she}} looked with keen eyes at the dresses of the women who came in. She had a {{peculiar}} sharpness for reckoning up what things cost, and now <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to him <b>and</b> whispered the result of her meditations.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he was not}} there. On the contrary, {{the place}} was looking forlorn and deserted. The shelter had been razed to the ground--she felt that she hated Stephen Hurd as she {{contemplated}} its ruin--the hedge was broken down by the inrush of people a few days ago. In {{the absence of any}} sunshine, the country around seemed bleak <b>and</b> colourless. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the gate <b>and</b> half closed her eyes. Memory came more easily like that! ...|$|R
