He praised the [...] "stunningly bonkers" [...] plot noting that [...] "every potential dramatic and comedic moment that stemmed from Gwen's unconventional 'bun in the oven' scenario was fully maximised".

5000|$|The {{history of}} The Effigies {{develops}} in three discernible periods, each {{marked by a}} different lead guitarist. The Effigies' original lineup consisted of John Kezdy (vocals), Earl [...] "Oil" [...] Letiecq (guitar), Paul Zamost (bass) and Steve Economou (drums). By 1984 Letiecq’s distractions had estranged him from the group, and {{in the words of}} Zamost, “we had problems with our guitar player. We had to switch guitar players....” Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar made inquiries about joining the band. Robert O’Connor replaced Letiecq as lead guitarist and this second lineup released two LPs, Fly on a Wire, and Ink. These albums were engineered and co-produced with the band by Iain Burgess, and were distinguished from the recordings of the first lineup by their sublimated aggression and comparatively muted rhythms. They also hinted at another growing division in the band. As Burgess put it, [...] "they got a lot of heat for the change in musical direction to some degree on the latter two albums that I worked on, Ink and Fly on a Wire. I think both of which have <b>some</b> <b>really</b> f*****g <b>good</b> songs on them, and some are, well, in my opinion, just not all that marvelous. I think John (Kezdy) would say the same thing. I’m sure he likes all the songs, but some of it we could have done better." [...] It was at this stage the band began getting tagged with the ill-fitting post-punk and post-hardcore labels.|$|R

[...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive.

[...] Chris Moran of Punknews.org complemented the range of Travis' vocals and the musicianship as [...] "extremely tight", but felt that the songs went in too many musical directions to give the band a firm identity: [...] "This record is just all over the map. One minute we've got some Goth Bay hardcore, the next we've got Morrissey ... Nightmerica has <b>some</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> songs.
