5|$|During a {{ministry}} of over half-a-century, Luang Pu Sodh taught Dhammakaya meditation continuously, guiding meditation every Thursday and preaching on Buddhism on <b>Sundays</b> <b>and</b> Uposatha days. Luang Pu Sodh would distribute an introductory book about meditation to practitioners. At first, the Dhammakaya meditation method drew {{criticism from the}} Thai Sangha authorities, {{because it was a}} new method. Discussion within the Sangha led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but it was concluded that Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015, the station's {{opening hours}} were {{extended}} to 0500–0100 Monday to Sunday (prior to this, the station {{had been closed}} on <b>Sundays</b> <b>and</b> during the evenings), and several services which previously terminated at Charing Cross were diverted to Cannon Street {{as a result of}} Thameslink Programme works.

5|$|Polyptychs were {{produced}} by the more accomplished masters.

It can also be displayed on days where official ceremonies or other solemn public sessions are held; in this case, the flag is hoisted on-site. The flag can be hoisted in other days if it is considered appropriate by the central government, or by other regional or local governing bodies, or by heads of private institutions. It must follow the official design standard and be preserved in good condition.|$|E
5|$|The Fens were {{increasingly}} cultivated after the Napoleonic Wars, prompting migrant Catholic Irish farm-workers {{to move to}} the area. By 1879 a Roman Catholic missionary, Father Hermann Sabela, was conducting services in the town. A Catholic school and chapel were built in 1881 on land in Jermyn Street and in 1888, Our Lady of Good Counsel Roman Catholic Church, opened beside it. The incumbent priest is Father Michael John Bell, who was appointed in 2001. Mass is held on <b>Sundays</b> <b>and</b> throughout the week.|$|E
5|$|The Underground station {{underwent}} major reconstruction at {{the same}} time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on <b>Sundays</b> <b>and</b> no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours. However, with the main line station's opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E

5|$|The rector of this Church of England parish as of 2011 is the Rev Neil Batcock. The {{benefice}} rotates {{its services}} among its five constituent churches, with typically five services in total on <b>Sundays,</b> <b>and</b> two mid-week Holy Communions. As with most Anglican churches in England, the congregation is mainly elderly, {{although there are}} monthly family services focussed on children. There is also a monthly laying on of hands for healing, and sometimes other variants from the standard format involving music or Taizé-influenced worship. The parish accepts the diocese's guidance on permitting baptism and marriage in church after a divorce, and claims {{to work closely with}} its Catholic and Methodist neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on <b>Sundays</b> <b>and</b> special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on <b>Sundays,</b> <b>and</b> in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
