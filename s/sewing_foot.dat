50|$|Industrial sewing {{machines}} are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task. Industrial machines, unlike domestic machines, perform a single dedicated task and {{are capable of}} long hours of usage and as such have larger moving parts and comparatively much larger motors. Industrial machines are also more generic; a motor for almost any type of machine can work on any brand. <b>Sewing</b> <b>feet</b> and bobbins between brands are interchangeable. However, with domestic machines the motor, {{and to a lesser}} extent bobbins and <b>sewing</b> <b>feet,</b> are brand specific.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} identified {{any kind}} of work condition and craftsman 2 ̆ 7 s posture that trigger the pain and discomfort for craftsman of doormat in Pringapus, Semarang. Observation of the work condition is conducted including work facilities and their posture during sewing process. To identify their pain and discomfort, Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) is used as reference. The result is used as an input for rapid upper limb assessment worksheet (RULA) to determine {{the level of the}} risk. RULA 2 ̆ 7 s final score is indicated the conditions need further investigation and change may be needed. Based on the analysis using fishbone diagram, to overcome pain/discomfort {{in the area of the}} neck and the shoulder, high adjustment of table and seat is suggested, because the evidence shows they trigger the craftsmen 2 ̆ 7 s bad posture. For pain/discomfort of back and waist, the seat should have good back support. Whereas for the hip, the craftsman suggested to use the seat with thick and wider sleeper, so they can sit comfortably. For foot problems, to relieve the pain for their free feet, it is suggested to use a bench that functions as foot rest; and for the <b>sewing</b> <b>feet,</b> it is suggested to give heels support so the sewers 2 ̆ 7 heels can be free from strain while sewing...|$|R

50|$|Some {{machines}} (such as {{a sewing}} machine motor) require partial or variable power. In the past, control (such as in a <b>sewing</b> machine's <b>foot</b> pedal) was implemented by use of a rheostat connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor. It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat {{was one of several}} methods of controlling power (see autotransformers and Variac for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was needed. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and robotic servos, and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers. PWM emerged as a solution for this complex problem.|$|R

I made it to an island, but it was full of Tojos! They were spitting on the U.S. flag! So I rushed 'em, but it was a trap. They opened fire and blew my shins off. Last thing I remember, I beat 'em all to death with a big piece of Fatty. I woke up in a field hospital, and they were <b>sewing</b> my <b>feet</b> to my knees."

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study of {{problems}} associated with fabric sewing, such as seam pucker and sewing damage, in commercial garment manufacture. Part 1 continues previous work by the author on seam pucker in structurally jammed fabrics; in particular {{it has been shown that}} initial Young's modulus of a fabric is a measure of the ability of the fabric to accommodate compressive forces during sewing. This result provides an additional means of predicting the tendency of a fabric to exhibit seam pucker. The static mechanism of seam pucker proposed previously, based upon the relative magnitudes of bending stiffness of thread and fabric, has been revised by establishing that sewing machine dynamics and pucker are closely related. It has been shown that presser foot bouncing in particular induces pucker and that the sewing thread needs to be positively controlled during stitch formation. These results were verified by simple experimental methods, suggesting that modifications to the sewing machine are needed. Such modifications are beyond the scope of this work. Following the earlier static mechanism of seam pucker, it has been shown that seam pucker in fabrics is reduced significantly when the bending stiffness and extensibility of the sewing thread is reduced. In addition seam pucker can be eliminated by improving fabric stiffness locally along the seam area, by incorporating a stiffening material in the seam; this is based upon the technique of pucker elimination found in the author's previous work. In this study this technique is implemented with considerable success in other types of seams and commercially available stiffening materials have been selected. Part 2 investigates sewing damage to fabrics due to sewing needle penetration. Preliminary studies suggested the need for a reliable testing facility. This was made by instrumenting an industrial overlock sewing machine. The instrumentation was based on measuring the force which is exerted by the sewing needle when penetrating the fabric. The testing facility consists of the sewing machine with a strain gauged sewing needle and plate, and a shaft encoder for stitch marking, which with proper signal amplification and conditioning could be fed to a transient recorder and osciloscope for signal capturing and plotting. Investigations with fabrics revealed that the magnitude of the peak force of each stitch cycle can be related to the degree of sewing damage in the fabric. Based on these results the most important variables in sewing damage were fabric softening and its effective application during finishing, and sewing needle size. Studies of sewing damage under dynamic conditions have shown that sewing damage is a frictional problem between yarns in the fabric and between yarns and the metal of the <b>sewing</b> needle, <b>foot,</b> plate and feed dog. The size of the needle plate of the sewing machine seems to affect the degree of damage and fabric "flagging" during sewing damage has been experienced. Finally in the latter section of this study a prototype routine sewing damage tester has been developed and each stage of its development is described. This tester is based on an instrumented overlock sewing machine, which is interfaced with an IBM PC for computerised data capture and analysis in real time. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{assemble}} the ZMC-2 a skin-riveting machine {{was developed by}} the Aviation Tool Co., a division of the Detroit Aircraft Corporation. The device was invented by Edward J. Hill, who had come to work on the ZMC-2 after leaving the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The machine consisted of an aluminum casting, weighing about 100 pounds, and was supported on springs from a framework that ran on concentric circular rails set into the floor of the hangar. There were two sets of circular rails, one {{at each end of the}} building. Three riveting machines were made, one for each set of tracks, and one for reserve when repairs might be needed. The reason for two sets of tracks was that the hull was built in two sections, front and rear. Each end started from a circular plate suspended from the hangar roof by a cable and free to rotate as each 18 inch wide strip Alclad was added. In this manner, each end of the ship slowly grew as succeeding rows were added, looking like a bulls eye at first and later like a huge inverted teacup. Both sections were under construction continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the hull was started. The riveting machine fed three small aluminum wires from large spools to make a seam about a quarter inch wide composed of three rivets, one above the other in a staggered pattern. In theory the machine could <b>sew</b> about 50 <b>feet</b> of seam in an hour, but in practice about 10 or more feet was the average. The sheets of Alclad used were eight to nine thousandths of an inch thick. As the each section of the hull grew internal annular rings were added at appropriate distances to give stiffness and reinforcement to the hull skin. In addition, lightweight longitudinal channels were added between the circular rings, giving the internal structure the appearance of a huge bird cage. The helium gas was contained by the hull only, no fabric was used to contain the helium. Inside the hull were two large airbag cells, called ballonets, made of rubberized fabric and containing air. These cells could be expanded or contracted to control pressure as the helium expanded or contracted with the heating or cooling of the atmosphere or to adapt to changes of atmospheric pressure with altitude, and to control fore and aft trim. In operation the ZMC-2 was susceptible to heating and cooling effects of the sun causing it to pop and buckle in the evenings if pressure from blowers was not applied. During its service life the ZMC-2 was found to have a gas diffusion rate much lower than that of fabric-hulled blimps, meaning that a much longer time would pass before additional helium needed to be added.|$|R
