500|$|... "Broke" [...] {{was written}} by Charlie Grandy and {{directed}} by Steve Carell, who made his directorial debut with the episode. It {{was the last of}} a six-episode story arc involving Idris Elba's character Charles Miner, although Elba has indicated the character would return in future episodes: [...] "Mr. Charles doesn't leave the picture. [...] My storyline has come to an end, but there is a good indication that the writers see my character coming back." [...] Elba made an appearance in [...] "Company Picnic", the fifth season finale. Elba said he did not watch [...] "Broke" [...] after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Holliday's {{favorite}} player {{growing up}} was Cal Ripken, Jr. [...] He {{has stated that}} if he had a dream car it would be a Bentley Continental GT, rather than a sports car, because he is [...] "too big for small sports cars." [...] He is a Christian and is part of a Bible study group with fellow Christian teammates. [...] He has spoken about his faith saying, [...] "I play for God. [...] It says in the Bible that we are to do all things for Him. ... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do the best that I can for Him. [...] This is my job, not who I am."

500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to help them out." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Lavigne {{launched}} the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It {{is produced by}} Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed {{out that she was}} not merely licensing her name to the collection. [...] "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> everything on and approve it all." [...] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, [...] "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E
500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. I watch it and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shortly after I came," [...] said Mr. Waters, [...] "one of {{the masks}} {{asked me to}} dance. I was really sorry that my age and traditions forbade my doing <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to explain, but I'm afraid I didn't make myself quite clear." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure {{said there was a}} great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to move in that direction to demonstrate Pam was trying to figure out what she wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Team" [...] {{was written}} by B. J. Novak and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. It originally aired on April 9, 2009, {{the same day as}} the episode [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company"; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes. It marks the first appearance of Novak as Ryan since [...] "Frame Toby" [...] in November 2008, when Novak briefly left the show to film his role in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Mindy Kaling, an Office writer who also stars as Kelly Kapoor, thought of the idea of Ryan dying his hair blond. Novak wore a baseball cap in public between the times his hair was dyed and when the episode aired, {{in order to make the}} reveal a surprise, and even kept the cap on when he and the rest of the cast and crew did a public forum and Q session. [...] "Dream Team" [...] was the third of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from the television series The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode when it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Richie Egan is the {{principal}} songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band. Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week." [...] "I listen to a lot of different styles of music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to keep my finger in as many pies as possible. It keeps me interested," [...] he laughs." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer and {{directed}} by Gene Stupnitsky. It originally aired April 9, 2009, {{the same day as}} the episode [...] "Dream Team"; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes. [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] was the fourth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." [...] According to the Season 5 DVD episode commentary, B. J. Novak came up with the story idea involving Jim and the [...] "run-down" [...] and worked it into Spitzer's final script. The episode included a new title sequence with footage of the series characters in the new Michael Scott Paper Company office setting, rather than the Dunder Mifflin setting from the previous episodes. Rainn Wilson and Ed Helms practiced the guitar competition in Ed Helms' trailer during lunch the day of the filming; Helms, a proficient bluegrass banjo player, coached Wilson, who is proficient at guitar and drums. Wilson said he proposed doing a full studio cover of the song, with Creed Bratton providing backup guitar and vocals, and selling it on iTunes for charity. Helms said he was happy {{to have the opportunity to}} play banjo on screen, but did not feel the instrument made much sense for his character; Helms said, [...] "It's so fun and weird, but he's a Connecticut preppy guy. How did he pick up a banjo? It's one of Andy's many mysteries, not all of which I even understand." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Boss" [...] {{was written}} by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. [...] "New Boss" [...] {{was the first of}} six episodes Idris Elba was set to guest star in as Charles, Michael's new Dunder Mifflin superior. It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, [...] "The creators of the show called me, said they wanted to put me in as this new character, that I’d be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I’m still playing the straight guy, but he’s kind of got a bit of a quirk to him." [...] The writing staff for The Office are fans of The Wire, and have referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said [...] "New Boss" [...] was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to torture myself." [...] Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him [...] "a really interesting and great foil for Michael". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be [...] "incredibly nice and incredibly funny".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} her artistry Shakira stated, [...] "my music, I think, is a fusion of many {{different}} elements. And I'm always experimenting. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> not to limit myself, or put myself in a category, or... be the architect of my own jail." [...] Shakira has frequently stated she is inspired by oriental music and Indian music, which influenced many of her earlier works. She has also been influenced by her Arabian heritage, which was a major inspiration for her breakthrough world hit [...] "Ojos Así". She told Portuguese TV, [...] "Many of my movements belong to Arab culture." [...] She also cites her parents as having been major contributors to her musical style. She is also strongly influenced by Andean music and South American folk music, using her native instrumentation for her Latin dance-pop songs.|$|E
