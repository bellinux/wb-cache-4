Shortly before the race he had been bought for an {{undisclosed}} sum by Sultan Mohammed al Kabeer. He was made the 4.7/1 third choice in the betting behind the leading North American turf performers Star of Cozzene (Arlington Million) and Fraise (Breeders' Cup Turf). Smith settled <b>Apple</b> <b>Tree</b> in fourth place as Solar Splendour set a slow pace from Fraise and <b>Star</b> of Cozzene. <b>Apple</b> <b>Tree</b> moved up on the outside on the final turn, overtook Solar Slendour well inside the final furlong and won by two and a quarter lengths. Four weeks later, the colt was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park. With Smith again in the saddle he started at odds of 11/1 but started slowly and never looked likely to win, finishing ninth of the fourteen runners behind Kotashaan.|$|R

Combining fruit tree growth theory with mathematics model and software development is an effective way in agricultural research.

Boron was applied in a form of boric acid solution. It was found that leaf B application resulted in movement of B to leaves, flowers and apple fiuits untreated with B. These results clearly showed that B was retranslocated within <b>apple</b> <b>tree.</b> The retranslocation of B within <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> took place when leaf B applications were done both in summer and autumn. Additionally, it was observed that B from leaf application had paiticularly high ability of movement within plant at insufficient B content (0, 2 μM) in solution. Generally, these data indicated that B within <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> was transported in phloem, however mechanism of this phenomenon has not been well known yet. Thus, leaf B application of <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> can be more successful treatment in reduction of B deficiency in plants compared to soil B application...|$|R
