The brightness of the display is also reduced.

Two different color dyes are employed to visualize the complex vortex formation mechanism behind the bluff bodies. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the potential of cylinder with parallel slit as an improved vortex generator for various practical applications. Wake parameters, such as Strouhal Number, wake width, and vortex formation length, are calculated from the recorded images. Three different <b>slit</b> <b>widths</b> with non-dimensional separation ratio of 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 are chosen to study the effect on the vortex formation mechanism and the corresponding wake parameters. The Reynolds number range covered in this study is Re-D = 200 - 2300. Symmetric vortex formation from the outer surface is observed for lower <b>slit</b> <b>widths,</b> whereas for high <b>slit</b> <b>widths,</b> both in-phase and anti-phase shedding are observed. A separation bubble from each of the inner surface is formed which detaches from the bluff body to form a vortex at higher Reynolds numbers. The separation bubble is found to be both bi-stable and symmetric for lower <b>slit</b> <b>widths.</b> The interaction of the separation bubble with the outer vortices is seen to affect the strength of the primary/outer vortex. The <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> is seen to be an important parameter in determining the strength of the vortices.

Critical density under confinement shows an oscillatory behavior as <b>slit</b> <b>width,</b> H, reduced from 12 to 1.

A popular strategy of providing blood supply is to embed cells within a functionalized hydrogel implanted within the host to stimulate neovascularization. However, hydrogel systems are not always amenable for removal post-transplantation; thus, it may be advantageous to implant a device that contains cells while also providing access to the circulation so retrieval is possible. Here we investigate one instance of providing access to a vessel network, a thin sheet with through-cut slits, and determine {{if it can be}} vascularized from autologous materials.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if body and fin form affected the maneuverability of teleostean fishes as measured by their ability to negotiate simple obstacles. Obstacles were vertical and horizontal rectangular <b>slits</b> of different <b>widths,</b> for which width was defined as the minimum dimension of a slit irrespective of slit orientation. Performance was measured as the smallest <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> traversed. Three species with different body and fin patterns were induced to swim through slits. Species tested were; goldfish Carassius auratus with a fusiform body, anterio-ventral pectoral fins and posterio-ventral pelvic fins; silver dollars Metynnis hypsauchen with the same fin configurations but a gibbose body; angelfish Pterophyllum scalare with a gibbose body and anterio-lateral pectoral fins. Minimum <b>slit</b> <b>widths</b> negotiated were normalized with the length of various body dimensions: total length, maximum width, span at the pectoral fins, and volume 1 / 3 (numerically equal to mass 1 / 3). Goldfish had the poorest performance, requiring the largest <b>slit</b> <b>widths</b> relative to these body dimensions. No consistent patterns in performance were found for silver dollars vs. angelfish. There were no differences among species in the ratio of minimum vertical <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> negotiated to that for horizontal slits, indicating fish were equally able to control posture while swimming on their sides. There were also no consistent patterns in the times taken to transit slits. Although the deep-bodied fish were able to maneuver through smaller slits, the most striking result is the similarity of minimum <b>slit</b> <b>widths</b> traversed in spite of the large variation in body form. Body form and fin plan may be more important for maneuvering and posture control during sub-maximum routine activities...|$|R

30|$|In the {{gratings}} {{with small}} relief depth, surface plasmons are propagating, i.e., neighboring grooves of the grating are coupled by the plasmonic wave traveling along the metal-dielectric interface. However, if the grating {{has a large}} depth of relief or consists of nanowires, increasing the <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> between nanowires eventually results in LP excitations in isolated nanostripes. Many studies have been devoted to the coupling between isolated plasmonic nanoobjects [10 – 12], including investigation of the transition between the regimes of LP and SPP in gold gratings with a fixed period and a variable filling factor [13, 14]. In the previous work [13], we have demonstrated experimentally that after thermal treatment of one-dimensional (gratings) and two-dimensional (arrays) periodic (period 500  nm) Au structures, nanowires and nanoislands became more compact structures due to “shrinkage”. As the result, the <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> between the edges of nanowires or nanodots rises up, {{and the intensity of}} SPP decreases, but LP intensity increases significantly. In another paper [14], authors can identify different plasmon excitation regimes depending on the <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> in thin gold nanoslit gratings with a fixed period of 750 [*]±[*] 35  nm. Only localized plasmons are observed for the gratings with slits between the nanowires wider than approximately 0.7 resonant wavelengths. The localized plasmons begin to couple, and weak SPP excitation becomes possible as the <b>slit</b> <b>width</b> is reduced (transition regime). For more narrow slits, the transmittance spectra show features associated with pure SPP excitation.|$|R
