The technique requires a small f/stop—f/16 or smaller—for great depth of field, plus a lens capable of close-focus; you always focus on the subject below the water line. You also have to balance the light. I look for a light bottom—white sand is best—or a light underwater subject. I'll put the strobes down below and light the bottom and then expose for the top. If you shoot at, say, ISO 400, you'll have plenty of exposure for the top, and the strobes will take care of the bottom. Of course, you need subjects that suit the technique." ...|$|E

50|$|In November and December 1941, the United States National Defense Research Committee {{conducted}} extensive tests {{between the}} Bausch and Lomb M1 stereoscopic rangefinder and the Barr and Stroud FQ 25 and UB 7 coincidence rangefinders:COINCIDENCE AND STEREOSCOPIC RANGE FINDERSThe {{first of these}} reports {{is concerned with the}} comparative test of coincidence and stereoscopic range finders. (353) In these tests the American stereoscopic Height Finder Ml was operated against the British coincidence type Range Finders FQ 25 and UB 7, in ranging on fixed ground targets, moving naval targets and moving aerial targets. The coincidence and stereoscopic methods utilize the same basic principles of geometrical optics for the determination of the distance to a target. The two methods differ radically, however, {{in the nature of the}} criterion presented for human judgement. These British instruments were of the <b>split</b> <b>field</b> coincident type. American crews were being trained at Fort Monroe to operate the coincidence instruments but this plan was dropped when six British seamen, who were experienced range takers, were made available for the tests. Until recently the British Services had tended strongly to the coincidence type of instrument while the American Services had adopted the stereoscopic principle for long-base instruments at least. The decisions of both the British and American Services apparently grow out of different interpretations of the experience of the Battle of Jutland in World War I and are of no concern in this place. Tests were run in November and December 1941 using the British seamen on the British instrument and experienced American observers on the Standard M1. Bad weather conditions and various experimental difficulties and mishaps made it impossible to obtain a really satisfactory quantity of data before the tests hall to be terminated. Fixed target reading were made on targets from 2,700 to 14,500 yards. Only five aerial courses could be recorded and these were all level flight courses, at altitudes of 3,000 to 4000 yards and slant range between 4,000 and 12,000 yards Continuous contact was used. Nine courses were obtained on slow moving naval targets at ranges from 4,000 to 12,000 yards. In these latter courses continuous and broken contact were used at different times.It was found, throughout the tests, that the performances of the various instruments were more nearly alike when measured in external units (Reciprocal range) than when measured in terms of error at the observer's eye, in spite of marked differences in physical dimensions of the instruments. The American MI has a base length of 4.5 yards and used 12 power; FQ 25 with a 6 yard base used 28 power and UB 7, a portable instrument, has 25 power and 3-yard base. The coincidence instruments did not use internal adjusters but were calibrated on targets of known range. In other words. the net performance of the different instruments were essentially comparable although the instruments exhibited varying degrees of efficiency in performance relative to the size. On aerial courses precision errors of the four instruments were about alike when measured in reciprocal-range units. In UOE, the FQ 25 had comparatively poor precision, while the UB 7, for three of the five aerial courses, had very small precision errors. The number of aerial courses was too small to yield much information about consistency of observations from one course to the next.For the naval target courses, one American instrument was not operating. Precision errors of the other three instruments were similar to those on aerial height courses. In reciprocal range units the three instruments had comparable precision. In UOE the FQ 25 was worse and the UB 7 was better than the American M1. Consistency error of the UB 7 was smaller than that of the M1, even when measured in reciprocal range units, while the FQ 25 was similar in consistency to the Ml, again in reciprocals units. On ground targets the same general situation holds. Consistency errors of the four instruments over the 9-day period were the same when measured in reciprocal-range units. Again the UB 7 was better than the stereoscopic instruments in UOE and the FQ 25 was worse. Consistency over the 9 days was not perceptibly worse than daily consistency for any of the instruments. In other words, the readings over the 9 days did not scatter in total more than did readings for a typical day.An analysis or these results leads to the following conclusions. (1) Performance of the coincidence and stereoscopic instruments was about the same when range errors were measured in yards (2) The UB 7 however, with a virtual base length smaller than that of the American stereoscopic instruments was more efficient than the stereoscopic height finders in terms of performance for its size, while the large coincidence instrument, the FQ 25. was less efficient in this sense. This situation held for all types of targets— fixed ground, naval, and aerial. (3) The UB 7 is somewhat better than the American instrument in consistency on naval targets, even when measured in external units. This report is attached, as supporting data, to a Report to the Services issued by the Fire Control Division of NDRC (20). This points out that the tests indicate no important difference in the precision obtainable from the two types of instrument— coincidence and stereoscopic They do indicate, however, that the difference in performance between large and small instruments is by no means as great as would be anticipated from simple geometrical optics. The report concludes with the belief that stereoscopic and coincidence acuities are about equal. Under favourable conditions existing instruments of the two types perform about equally well, and the choice between them for any given purpose must be based on matters of convenience related to the particular conditions under which they are to be used.|$|E

Materials and Methods : Dosimetric data from 10 patients of carcinoma nasopharynx, undergoing IMRT, were evaluated in this prospective study. The carotid vessels were contoured from sternoclavicular joints upto {{the base of}} skull. IMRT plans were generated for all patients with extended field and <b>split</b> <b>field</b> IMRT techniques using nine coplanar beams with 6 MV photons. A dose of 70 Gy to planning target volume (PTV) 70 Gy, 59. 4 Gy to PTV 59. 4 Gy and 54 Gy to PTV 54 Gy was delivered in 33 fractions. The dose constraints were similar for both the techniques. The integral dose to the carotid arteries was calculated as the mean dose times the volume (mean dose &# 935; volume) in units of liter-gray. Results : The mean dose to the carotid vessels in the extended field IMRT was 63. 88 &# 177; 0. 97 Gy (mean dose &# 177; SD) and it was 64. 43 &# 177; 0. 73 Gy for the <b>split</b> <b>field</b> technique.

Red–green flicker sensitivity was ∼ 3 -fold greater for a uniform field than for a ‘split’ field with the two sides flickering out-of-phase. Just the opposite effects were observed for luminance flicker — the <b>split</b> <b>field</b> yielded a 7 -fold advantage over the uniform field at 2 or 4 Hz and a 3 -fold advantage at 12 Hz. Contrary to Kelly, {{we find that the}} <b>split</b> <b>field</b> offers only a very small advantage of 40 % for luminance flicker at 2 Hz and virtually no advantage at 4 Hz and above. Kelly’s chromatic results are surprising since one might expect that the larger color difference (or step) across the central edge would aid chromatic discrimination rather than strongly suppressing sensitivity. We show that the central chromatic edge only weakly impairs detection. Further results show that {{the two sides of the}} chromatic <b>split</b> <b>field</b> are detected essentially independently by red or green ‘blob’ detectors, which do not take advantage of the color difference across the edge.
