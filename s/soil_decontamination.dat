Secondly, we derive a complete mathematical model which contains the equations of conservation of the electrical current and the nonlinear conditions at interfaces.

Ultrasonic machine and HPLC was applied for extraction and analysis of phenanthrene from contaminated soil samples. Microbial analyses were carried out using confirmative series tests, analytical profile index (API) kit tests and PCR. Results for phenanthrene biotreatment in solid phase revealed a significance relationship between concentration of phenanthrene and type of microbial consortium and type of soil with the removal efficiency over time of bioremediation (P value< 0. 001). According to the microbial analysis using complete amplified PCR and DNA extraction, among of Pseudomonas fluorescence, Serratia liquefaciens, Bacillus and Micrococcus strains that were as dominant bacterial consortiums in the contaminated soil samples, Pseudomonas fluorescence (pudita) was responsible to higher degree degradation of phenanthrene.

The litter, soil and vegetation samples were colected from the same permanent sample plots between the years 2006 - 2009, as between the years 1985 - 1989, using the same methods, in order to be compared and analyzed. Therefore, returning to investigations in these permanent sample plots, were found the following conclusions: i) between the period 1985 - 1989, in all examined cases were revealed high pollutants concentrations, even exceeding the maximum allowable limit (MAL) consisting of suphur compounds in synergistic action with heavy metals(Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, Mn, etc.), in vegetation and litter, which was directly correlatedwith noxious concentrations in the air, and concentrations below MAL in soil samples; ii) contrary, regarding the new pollution activity, it has been revealed low noxious concentration, in vegetation, litter and soil samples collected during the period between the years 2006 - 2008, which are directly related to their low concentrationlevel in the air. Due to pollutants accumulation phenomenon over the years, high pollutants concentrations, ten times higher than MAL, were found in the superior soil layer.

40|$|Globally, {{contamination}} {{of soil and}} groundwater by toxic metals (Pb, As, Cr, Ni, Zn, etc.) are becoming increasingly problematic for both ecosystems and human health. Currently, phytoextraction and phytoaccumulation are studied for the de{{contamination of}} metals because they offer a treatment option at low cost. From a biomimetic approach, the general objective of this work is to propose, at a conceptual level, a new technology based on physical-chemical mechanisms of transport of contaminants by plants. In order to fulfill these objectives, an experimental arrangement was constructed in the laboratory to test some materials and operating factors. The seven metals studied and analyzed by ICP-MS were aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, lead and zinc. A cellulosic fibre (M 1) and a polyester-polyamide (M 2) were used as capillary means of transport {{due to the fact}} that they have a diameter similar to that of xylem vessels on the transport system of vascular plants. On the basis of a negative pressure gradient of 0. 02 MPa⋅m- 1, reported for vascular plants, the studied pressures were 0. 011, 0. 022, 0. 045, 0. 090 and 0. 18 MPa⋅m- 1, while the pH solutions were studied at 4 and 8. The results show that the highest metal ion transport was obtained at pH 4, in ascending order: Cr <Pb = Al <As <Ni <Zn <Cd to M 1 and Cr <Pb = Al = As <Ni = Zn = Cd to M 2. Differences on ion transport between M 1 and M 2, expressed as the percentage of transported ion, are attributed to the chemical composition of the materials, due to unequal amount of active sites on the surface of each material, as well as to the effect of pH on the ions in solution. Under negative pressure, the materials showed similar behaviour to that of membranes, thus, the solution rate of flow (mL⋅h- 1) increases with the pressure while the concentration of metal ions (mg⋅L- 1) exhibited no significant variation. In addition, a transport coefficient (TCHM), in function of the metal and the material, was obtained. A value of TCHM= 1 means that there are no interactions between the metal ion and the material and, at the same time, this value will place the material at the level of a plant species identified as hyperaccumulator; the indicator is useful to assess indirectly the concentration of metal in the soil. By integrating the laboratory results in a simplified conceptual model, the principles of the artificial phytoremediation technology were highlighted. This technology should be the basis for the development of a new family of technologies that can help reduce some negative impacts caused by the traditional methods of <b>soils</b> <b>decontamination...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} permits radionuclides, heavy metals, and organics to {{be extracted}} from solution by scavenging {{them with an}} amorphous gel. In the preferred embodiment, a contaminated solution (e. g. from <b>soil</b> washing, <b>decontamination,</b> or groundwater pumping) is transferred to a reaction vessel. The contaminated solution is contacted by the sequestering reagent which might contain for example, aluminate and EDTA anions in a 2. 5 M NaOH solution. The pH of the reagent bearing solution is lowered on contact with the contaminated solution, or for example by bubbling carbon dioxide through it, causing an aluminum hydroxide gel to precipitate as the solution drops below the range of 1. 8 to 2. 5 molar NaOH (less than pH 14). This precipitating gel scavenges waste contaminants as it settles through solution leaving a clean supernatant which is then separated from the gel residue by physical means such as centrifugation, or simple settling. The gel residue containing concentrated contaminants is then redissolved releasing contaminants for separations and processing. This is a critical point: the stabilized gel used in this invention is readily re-dissolved by merely increasing the pH above the gels phase transition to aqueous anions. Thus, concentrated contaminants trapped in the gel can be released for convenient separation from the sequestering reagent, and said reagent can then be recycled...|$|R

Cost-effective technologies are needed for on-site treatment that meet clean-up goals and restore soil function. Remediation is particularly challenging when a mixture of pesticides is present. β-Cyclodextrins (BCD) solutions are employed to enhance the aqueous solubility of a hydrophobic organic compound. The interaction of norflurazon (NFL) with BCD yielded the formation of inclusion complexes at a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio in solution. The change of the sorption parameter Kd as affected by the time, and desorption studies of NFL previously adsorbed on four different soils with different characteristics have been performed {{in the presence of}} 0. 01 M BCD or 0. 01 M Ca(NO 3) 2 acting as extractant solutions. NFL sorption increased with the residence time in soil, making it more resistant to be desorbed.

The results showed that removal efficiencies of the different flushing systems were significantly influenced by their affinity and selectivity for the contaminants in the soil matrix as well as BCD adsorption on soils, since this could act like a bridge between pesticide molecule and soil particles increasing the stay of NFL in soil.
