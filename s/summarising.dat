5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot began to feel {{compelled}} to finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series, <b>summarising</b> Eliot's views expressed in this series of poems.|$|E
5|$|The Transitional Programme was {{the central}} {{programmatic}} statement of the congress, <b>summarising</b> its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up {{as a result of}} the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.|$|E
5|$|The {{main task}} of the Ministry was to develop {{proposals}} on issues linked to the judicial system; the election of judges, elect the judiciary, organising the judiciary, studying and <b>summarising</b> of the jurisprudence in coordination with the Supreme Court, and to organise work {{for the maintenance of}} judicial statistics. According to Soviet law, the Ministry could propose various measures to improve the Soviet court system. According to Article 1 of the People's Commissariat for Justice, the commissariat's main task was to supervise the legal activities of the Soviet central agencies and the people's procurator.|$|E

This {{is followed by a}} list of accepted records in taxonomic sequence. Records for each taxon are listed by county, followed by comments about its occurrence during the year. Late-accepted records and decisions to reject a previously identified record are included. This section of the report contains painted illustrations and photographs of some of the birds. The report lists records that have not been accepted, often noting the most significant that remain under consideration.|$|E
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. The {{conspiracy}} was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper <b>summarising</b> the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E
5|$|Odense Municipality is the {{administrative}} unit which covers {{not only the}} city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, {{is a member of}} the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red–Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats. The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) <b>summarising</b> a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017. Boye and his administration have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner for a show which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.|$|E

50|$|It can {{be argued}} that almost all methods require some kind of {{definition}} of the matching criteria. The difference is only whether you <b>summarise</b> over a local image region first and then compare the summarisation (such as feature based methods), or you compare each pixel first (such as squaring the difference) and then <b>summarise</b> over a local image region (block base motion and filter based motion). An emerging type of matching criteria <b>summarises</b> a local image region first for every pixel location (through some feature transform such as Laplacian transform), compares each <b>summarised</b> pixel and <b>summarises</b> over a local image region again. Some matching criteria has the ability to exclude points that does not actually correspond to each other albeit producing a good matching score, others does not have this ability, but they are still matching criteria.|$|R
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase <b>summarising</b> {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s French sociologists, {{particularly}} {{those interested in}} critical theory, re-examined this historical legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on {{the operation of the}} police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes. Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent. This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille. The Bibliothèque nationale de France held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume <b>summarising</b> the current academic perspectives on the fortress.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract <b>summarising</b> his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E
