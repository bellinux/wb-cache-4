25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{employed}} as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant FabI gene (mFabI) as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> can grow in presence of high dose of triclosan in growth media.|$|E
25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial genetic selection, in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|E
25|$|When {{bacterial}} {{cells are}} used as host organisms, the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> is usually a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic that would otherwise kill the cells, typically ampicillin. Cells harboring the plasmid will survive when exposed to the antibiotic, while those that have failed to take up plasmid sequences will die. When mammalian cells (e.g. human or mouse cells) are used, a similar strategy is used, except that the marker gene (in this case typically encoded {{as part of the}} kanMX cassette) confers resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin.|$|E
50|$|Positive <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that confer {{selective}} {{advantage to the}} host organism. An example would be antibiotic resistance, which allows the host organism to survive antibiotic selection.|$|R
50|$|Negative <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that {{eliminate}} or inhibit {{growth of}} the host organism upon selection. An example would be thymidine kinase, which makes the host sensitive to ganciclovir selection.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> (which eliminate certain genotypes from the population) and screenable markers (which cause certain genotypes to be readily identifiable, {{at which point the}} experimenter must [...] "score" [...] or evaluate the population and act to retain the preferred genotypes). Most MAS uses screenable <b>markers</b> rather than <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The λ-red {{system has}} also been {{optimized}} for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of mutagenesis. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E
25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker,</b> such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E
25|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during {{the development of the}} construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA into plants from its Ti plasmid, and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through Southern blotting. The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of gene targeting, <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are usually {{permanently}} introduced into the mammalian genome. Multiple gene targeting events in the same cell line can therefore exhaust the pool of markers available and limit subsequent manipulations or genetic analysis. In this study, we describe the combined use of homologous and CRE-loxP-mediated recombination to generate mouse embryonic stem cell lines carrying up to four targeted mutations and devoid of exogenous <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> A cassette that contains {{both positive and negative}} <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> flanked by loxP sites, rendering it excisable by the CRE protein, was constructed. Homologous recombination and positive selection were used to disrupt the Rep- 3 locus, a gene homologous to members of the mutS family of DNA mismatch repair genes. CRE-loxP-mediated recombination and negative selection were then used to recover clones in which the cassette had been excised. The remaining allele of Rep- 3 was then subjected to a second round of targeting and excision with the same construct to generate homozygous, marker-free cell lines. Subsequently, both alleles of mMsh 2, another mutS homolog, were disrupted in the same fashion to obtain cell lines homozygous for targeted mutations at both the Rep- 3 and mMsh 2 loci and devoid of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> Thus, embryonic stem cell lines obtained in this fashion are suitable for further manipulation and analysis involving the use of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Positive or {{selection}} <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that confer {{selective advantage}} to the host organism. An example would be antibiotic resistance, which allows the host organism to survive antibiotic selection.|$|R
50|$|Negative or counterselectable <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that {{eliminate}} or inhibit {{growth of}} the host organism upon selection. An example would be thymidine kinase, which makes the host sensitive to ganciclovir selection.|$|R
2500|$|In {{molecular}} cloning, a vector is a DNA molecule used as {{a vehicle}} to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed (e.g.- plasmid, cosmid, Lambda phages). A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. [...] Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. [...] Common to all engineered vectors are an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because {{transformation}} usually {{produces a}} mixture of relatively few transformed cells and an abundance of non-transformed cells, a method is necessary to select for the cells that have acquired the plasmid. The plasmid therefore requires a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> such that those cells without the plasmid may be killed or have their growth arrested. [...] Antibiotic resistance is {{the most commonly used}} marker for prokaryotes. [...] The transforming plasmid contains a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic that the bacteria are otherwise sensitive to. [...] The mixture of treated cells is cultured on media that contain the antibiotic so that only transformed cells are able to grow. [...] Another method of selection is the use of certain auxotrophic markers that can compensate for an inability to metabolise certain amino acids, nucleotides, or sugars. [...] This method requires the use of suitably mutated strains that are deficient in the synthesis or utility of a particular biomolecule, and the transformed cells are cultured in a medium that allows only cells containing the plasmid to grow.|$|E
50|$|The T-DNA {{portion of}} the binary plasmid is flanked by left and right border {{sequences}} and consists of a transgene {{as well as a}} plant <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> (PSM). Outside of the T-DNA, the binary plasmid also contains a bacterial <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> (BSM) and an origin of replication (ori) for bacteria.|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) switches templates frequently during DNA synthesis; the acceptor template can be {{the same}} RNA (intramolecular) or the copackaged RNA (intermolecular). Previous results indicated that intramolecular template switching occurred far more frequently than intermolecular template switching. We hypothesized that intermolecular template-switching events (recombination) occurred at a lower efficiency be-cause the copackaged RNA was not accessible to the RT. To test our hypothesis, the murine leukemia virus (MLV) extended packaging signal (C 1) containing a dimer linkage structure (DLS) was relocated from the 5 * untranslated region (UTR) to between <b>selectable</b> <b>markers,</b> allowing the two viral RNAs to interact closely in this region. It {{was found that the}} overall maximum recombination rates of vectors with C 1 in the 5 * UTR or C 1 between <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> were not drastically different. However, vectors with C 1 located between <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> reached a plateau of recombination rate at a shorter distance. This suggested a limited enhancement of recombination by C 1. The locations of the recombination events were also examined by usin...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{insertional mutagenesis}} {{system has been}} developed for Schizosaccharomyces pombe based on linear PCR-generated cassettes containing <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> It depends upon illegitimate recombination for integration into the genome. Various <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> of different sizes {{can be used to}} obtain sufficiently high transformation and integration frequencies. Based on Southern blotting, a single insertion is found in each strain and integration sites are broadly distributed in the genome. Sequence analysis of the insert junctions frequently reveals small regions of homology (4 – 10 bp) between the ends of the integrated cassette and the disrupted gene. The system has been used for simple genetic screens of various types and as a promoter trap for in-frame GFP fusions...|$|R
50|$|The {{method is}} useful only for {{applications}} where <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are not necessary. For example, mutagenized yeast strains {{cannot be used}} for further genetic analysis such as tetrad analysis. Markers {{would have to be}} inserted into the appropriate locus in a separate process.|$|R
50|$|An E. coli <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene, often {{some kind}} of {{antibiotic}} resistance.|$|E
50|$|The gene must {{generally}} {{be combined with}} a promoter and terminator region {{as well as a}} <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene.|$|E
50|$|Select {{plasmids}} for the E. coli <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene. Only successful inserts of plasmids {{with the}} plasmid 'housekeeping' sequences will express this gene.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{advantage}} of this technique {{is its ability to}} eliminate any foreign DNA from the genome after the mutagenesis process. This ensures there are no <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> or exogenous sequences used for targeting left in the genome that may cause unforeseen effects.|$|R
5000|$|Several minimal {{derivatives}} of RK2 {{have been}} prepared. In these plasmids {{most of the}} genes have been removed, leaving only genes essential for replication and one or more <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> One such [...] "mini-replicon" [...] is the plasmid PFF1, which is 5873 basepairs long.|$|R
40|$|Embryonic stem (ES) cell {{differentiation}} {{can serve as}} a model to investigate early stages of development. Nishikawa and colleagues, {{in a recent issue of}} Stem Cells (Era et al., 2007), have used <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> to detect lineage-specific gene expression and dissect the induction of mesoderm subsets in ES cell cultures...|$|R
50|$|Along {{with higher}} {{transformation}} efficiency, pGREEN has been engineered to ensure transformation integrity. Both pBIN19 and pGREEN usually {{use the same}} <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> nptII, but pBIN19 has the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> next to the right border, while pGREEN has it close to the left border. Due to a polarity difference in {{the left and right}} borders, the right border of the T-DNA enters the host plant first. If the selectable maker is near the right border (as is the case with pBIN19) and the transformation process is interrupted, the resulting plant may have expression of a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> but contain no T-DNA giving a false positive. The pGREEN plasmid has the selecable marker entering the host last (due to its location next to the left border) so any expression of the marker will result in full transgene integration.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common types of shuttle vectors is the yeast shuttle vector http://dbb.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/Sherman_f/yeast/9.html. Almost all {{commonly}} used S. cerevisiae vectors are shuttle vectors. Yeast shuttle vectors have components that allow for replication and selection in both E. coli cells and yeast cells. The E. coli component of a yeast shuttle vector includes an origin of replication and a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker,</b> e.g. antibiotic resistance, beta lactamase, beta glastosidase. The yeast component of a yeast shuttle vector includes an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a yeast centromere (CEN), and a yeast <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> (e.g. URA3, a gene that encodes an enzyme for uracil synthesis, Lodish et al. 2007).|$|E
50|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{employed}} as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant FabI gene (mFabI) as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> can grow in presence of high dose of triclosan in growth media.|$|E
40|$|We {{replaced}} the Escherichia coli lexA gene by {{a segment of}} DNA coding for resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin. The use of this segment expands the range of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> usable for allele replacement.

40|$|Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) {{have been}} used to {{complement}} a metabolic defect and to transfer a drug resistance marker into mammalian cells by electroporation. The <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are stable and the recipient cells have BAC DNA integrated into the chromosomes as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization, PCR and Southern hybridization...|$|R
40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen {{that causes}} meningitis in ∼ 10 % {{of patients with}} AIDS. New <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> which confer resistance to G 418 or phleomycin when transformed into C. neoformans were made. A hygromycin-selectable marker was modified to allow selection with a single copy of the marker...|$|R
50|$|Ampicillin {{resistance}} {{is a term}} that refers to bacterial resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. Many strains of bacteria are resistant {{to a variety of}} antibiotics, however the resistance that is most commonly used in research and industry is ampicillin resistance. It is used as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> in bacterial transformation. A <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> is a feature that allows for the scientist to select only for the bacterial cells that contain the gene that allows the bacterium to be resistant. This selection is done by growing the bacteria on or in a medium that contains ampicillin. All the cells that lack the amp resistance gene will be killed off, leaving only those with resistance.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} can {{be introduced}} artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes {{used as a}} <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.|$|E
50|$|Gene {{targeting}} {{methods are}} established for several model organisms and may {{vary depending on}} the species used. In general, atargeting construct made out of DNA is generated in bacteria. It typically contains part of the gene to be targeted, a reporter gene, and a (dominant) <b>selectable</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|E
40|$|Since most archaea are extremophilic and {{difficult}} to cultivate, our current knowledge of their biology is confined largely to comparative genomics and biochemistry. Haloferax volcanii offers great promise as a model organism for archaeal genetics, but until now {{there has been a}} lack {{of a wide variety of}} <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for this organism. We describe here isolation of H. volcanii leuB and trpA genes encoding 3 -isopropylmalate dehydrogenase and tryptophan synthase, respectively, and development of these genes as a positive selection system. ΔleuB and ΔtrpA mutants were constructed in a variety of genetic backgrounds and were shown to be auxotrophic for leucine and tryptophan, respectively. We constructed both integrative and replicative plasmids carrying the leuB or trpA gene under control of a constitutive promoter. The use of these <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> in deletion of the lhr gene of H. volcanii is described...|$|R
