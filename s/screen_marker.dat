40|$|Objective: Most of {{phenylketonuria}} (PKU) develops {{bone turnover}} impairment and low bone mineral density (BMD). Measurements of BMD reflect only bone mineral status {{but not the}} dynamics of bone turnover. Bone markers are a noninvasive tool useful {{for the assessment of}} bone formation and bone resorption processes. Our study was to assess the levels of bone markers in PKU in order to select a <b>screen</b> <b>marker</b> and detect the most specific marker which can be combined with BMD for appropriate follow up. Methods: Thirty three classic PKU patients were studied. BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured. Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (CICP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand (RANKL) and Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were measured. Findings: Nineteen (57. 6 %) male and fourteen (42. 4 %) female PKU patients were involved in the current study. Their mean age was 8. 4 ± 4. 6 yrs and the age range 3 - 19 yrs. The control group consisted of twenty two (52. 4 %) males and twenty (47. 6 %) females. Their mean age was 8. 5 ± 3. 3 yrs and th age range 2 - 17 yrs.

40|$|We {{are happy}} to release v 0. 8 of the Pupil platform! Jump to Downloads Introduction of the IPC Backbone To allow realtime {{interaction}} with other actors on the same machine and across machine boundaries we have completely rewritten the way Pupil exchanges data internally. From now on all exchanged data (pupil data, control messages, log messages) flow through a message bus we call the IPC Backbone. All messaging has been unified and is now sent using the ZMQ PUBSUB pattern. One of the greatest features of the IPC backbone {{is that it can}} be accessed from outside Pupil Capture and across the network. As an outside actor you can write to the IPC Backbone and subscribe to (parts of) the message stream. Message Format Messages are defined as multi-frame zmq messages. Some message topics we are using as of now are logging, pupil, gaze, notify, delayed_notify. More info can be found here: Pupil-Interprocess-and-Network-Communication Tapping into the IPC from outside Any external actor (on the same box or remote) can now tap into the IPC Backbone and subscribe to all (or parts) of the message stream. It can also send messages that will be received by all subscribers in the app. Deprecation of Pupil Server Since this IPC Backbone is basically Pupil Server on steroids we have no need for it any more in Pupil Capture and it has been removed from the app. This also means that the Pupil Server data format is deprecated. The IPC Backbone will give you the similar data. The only difference is that gaze, surface, and pupil data are no longer grouped. All pupil helper scripts have been updated accordingly. Gaze Mapping All gaze mappers have been restructured to handle temporal correlation of pupil data explicitly. Two base classes for mono and binocular mappers have been added. Plugin API changes Plugins will continue working as before. There are no plugin API changes except delayed notifications. See plugin. py for details. Plugin notifications are now published on the IPC Backbone. Note, that all notification subjects have changed! More structure to Notification names Notification subjects are grouped by categories category. command_or_statement. Example: recording. should_stop. New Dependencies We use msg_pack for message serialization pip install msgpack-python New App: Pupil Service We have added a third app to the Pupil project: Pupil Service. It is like Pupil Capture except it does not have a world video feed or GUI. It is intended for AR and VR eye tracking setups. Pupil Service is meant to run in the background and controlled via network commands only. The service process has no GUI.

Our set contains three biomarkers that are currently widely used in either first- or second-trimester screening (AFP, PAPP-A and fbeta-hCG), as well as ten other proteins that are or have been examined as prenatal serum markers. This supports the effectiveness of our strategy and indicates the set contains other markers potentially applicable for screening.

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) {{is among}} the leading causes of new onset blindness in adults. Effective treatment may delay the onset and progression of this disease provided it is diagnosed early. At present retinopathy can only be diagnosed via formal examination of the eye by a trained specialist, which limits the population that can be effectively screened. An easily accessible, reliable screening biomarker of diabetic retinopathy would be of tremendous benefit in detecting the population in need of further assessment and treatment. This review highlights specific biomarkers that show promise as <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> to detect early diabetic retinopathy or even to detect patients at increased risk of DR {{at the time of}} diagnosis of diabetes. The pathobiology of DR is complex and multifactorial giving rise to a wide array of potential biomarkers. This review provides an overview of these pathways and looks at older markers such as advanced glycation end products(AGEs), inflammatory markers, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as other newer proteins with a role in the pathogenesis of DR including neuroprotective factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF); SA 100 A 12, pentraxin 3, brain natriuretic peptide, apelin 3 and chemerin as well as various metabolites such as lipoprotein A, folate and homocysteine. We also consider the possible role of proteins identified through proteomics work whose levels are altered in the sera of patients with DR as <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> though their role in pathophysiology remains to be characterized.

Increased levels of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma have been correlated with increased HCG levels. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} cffDNA levels are elevated in IVF pregnancies compared with natural pregnancies. METHODS: Sixteen archived second-trimester serum samples from IVF pregnancies were matched with five control samples from naturally conceived pregnancies per case, all car-rying a singleton male fetus. cffDNA concentrations were measured by real-time PCR amplification of a Y chromosome sequence and compared with four standard second trimester serum <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> (-fetoprotein, estriol, HCG and inhibin A). RESULTS: Mean cffDNA levels for cases and controls were 57. 9 and 57. 1 genome equivalents/ml, respectively (P = 0. 95). Mean observed rank (from 1 to 6) of cffDNA was 3. 625 in the IVF conceived group, compared with an expected value of 3. 5 (P = 0. 53). No significant correlations were observed between cffDNA and serum markers. CONCLUSIONS: IVF does not affect levels of cffDNA, which appears to be independent of traditional <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> (e. g. HCG). Therefore, cffDNA can be used as an additional serum marker (e. g. Down syndrome screening) without adjustment for IVF pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common chromosomal abnormality, with an incidence of approximately 1 per 500 to 800 live births. The first-trimester combined test is mostly used for the prenatal prediction of carrying a child with DS. The test is composed of the maternal serum parameters pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and the free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (f?-hCG), and an ultrasound measurement of the foetal nuchal translucency (NT), combined with maternal age. The detection rate (DR) of DS screening in the Netherlands is currently 70 - 75 %, which is rather low as compared to other countries. The aim of this research was to investigate ways to improve the performance of the current DS screening programme. The extra chromosome in DS not only leads to anomalies of the foetus, but also of the placenta. The inability of placental cells to develop properly is associated with a decrease of trophoblastic products. If this differential expression is traceable in maternal blood these products could have potential as new <b>screening</b> <b>markers.</b> Several markers have been investigated and found to be potentially useful as predictors of DS. One of those markers is placental protein 13 (PP 13) which was found to be decreased in DS pregnancies. Moreover, serum concentrations of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM 12) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are decreased, while total hCG (thCG) is increased in first-trimester DS pregnancies. However, the addition of these markers to the current first-trimester combined test only slightly increases the DR. Therefore, a dedicated search for more markers was set up. An extensive review of the literature was carried out to study normal placental development and function during early pregnancy. Furthermore, a bioinformatics approach was developed using data from the literature on genes and protein expression. This way, a list of potential DS <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> was generated. The list included three biomarkers that are already used for DS screening and several others, among which PP 13 and PlGF. A more experimental approach was carried out by analyzing 90 different proteins from a pre-existing immunoassay. By comparing the protein concentrations in a small cohort of DS and control sera, seven potential <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> were identified. To confirm the predictive value of these seven markers a subsequent validation study was carried out. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EN-RAGE were confirmed to be potential <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> for DS and improved the DR of the current first-trimester combined test with approximately 6 %. In addition, Cancer Antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9), was found to be strongly predictive for DS and even further increased the DR. It turned out that the predictive power of serum markers differs within the first trimester. Therefore, {{it would be useful to}} draw two separate blood samples and analyze several markers to increase the DR of first-trimester screening to almost 90 %. If such a screening test is to be developed, simultaneous assessment of markers is crucial and demands innovation of the test, i. e. by using Antibody microarrays...|$|R

The potential role of endothelin- 1 in vasospasm pathogenesis may provide therapeutic opportunities. A recent meta-analysis however, {{did not support}} the use of endothelin antagonists. Apart from clinical assessment, transcranial Doppler and interval angiography, there are no sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> for evolving vasospasm. We investigate the ability of serial measurement of endothelin- 1 to predict the development of vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS Endothelin- 1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood were measured daily in 20 patients admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage from days 1 to 10 following the inception bleed. In addition to clinical assessment, patients had daily transcranial Doppler. Digital subtraction angiography was performed on the suspicion of vasospasm based upon clinical or transcranial Doppler assessment. Neuron-specific enolase and SB 100 were measured in blood as comparative biomarkers of neurological injury. RESULTS Mean plasma endothelin- 1 on day 5, was 4. 2 mcg/L (CI 3. 1 - 5. 8) in patients with vasospasm compared to 2. 5 mcg/L (CI 1. 5 - 4. 0) in those without vasospasm (P = 0. 047). There were no time-related differences in cerebrospinal fluid endothelin- 1, plasma NSE, or SB 100 for patients with and without vasospasm.

40|$|The {{completion}} {{of the human genome}} project and the bur-geoning use of genomic, transcriptional profiling, and proteomic technologies to investigate DNA, RNA, and protein levels in tumors, serum, plasma, and urine offer the exciting potential of identifying novel and effective cancer-specific screening mark-ers. If the markers are secreted or released from tumor cells and migrate to serum, plasma, urine, or other accessible sites, they may be useful as <b>screening</b> <b>markers</b> either alone or in combina-tion with currently identified tumor <b>markers</b> or <b>screening</b> ap-proaches. Thus, these technologies potentially provide for a rapid advance in the identification of novel tumor markers com-parable to that initiated by the introduction of monoclonal anti-body technology. In this issue of the Journal, Mok et al. (1), using transcrip-tional profiling of ovarian cancer cell lines, found that messen...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a {{major cause}} of acute and chronic hepatitis. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has {{estimated}} that 12, 000 health care workers whose jobs entail exposure to blood become infected with HBV each year. 1 Although HBV transmission is primarily from patient to hospital personnel, approximately 1 - 2 % of health care workers are HBsAg positive 2 which suggests that these workers are at risk for transmitting HBV infections to patients. At the Philippine Heart Center (PHC), beginning on February, 1988, high risk medical workers (doctors, nurses, nursing aides, medical technologists, perfusionists, respiratory and dialysis therapists) were <b>screened</b> for HBV <b>markers</b> preparatory to giving susceptible personnel the immunization against hepatitis B. As of November, 1989, 666 personnel were screened. Forty one (41) were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and 202 were anti-HBs positive for prevalence rates of 6. 15 % and 30. 33 %. 3 These were below the national average of 12. 9 % and 40. 6 % for anti-HBs. 4 In August, 1990, Hepatitis B screening was incorporated into the pre-employment requirements of medical health care personnel applying to the PHC. A single <b>screening</b> <b>marker</b> was used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Elevated serum {{alkaline}} phosphatase (ALP) is a <b>screening</b> <b>marker</b> for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, which may fail to be diagnosed if serum ALP is not elevated. Here, we describe a case of vitamin D deficiency without elevation of serum ALP. A 1 -year-old Japanese girl was referred to our hospital {{for the evaluation of}} genu varum. Her serum intact PTH level was elevated, while her serum ALP level was normal. Furthermore, her serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level was reduced, and her urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA) level was mildly elevated. ALPL gene analysis revealed she was a heterozygous carrier of hypophosphatasia (c. 1559 delT). Serum intact PTH and urine PEA evaluations were helpful for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency and hypophosphatasia carrier status, respectively. Therefore, the possibility of vitamin D deficiency without elevation of serum ALP should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A high {{concentration}} of glucose in the medium could greatly inhibit the expression of cellulase in filamentous fungi. The aspartic protease from fungus Hypocrea orientalis EU 7 - 22 could efficiently express under both induction condition and glucose repression condition. Based on the sequence of structure gene of aspartic protease, the upstream sequence harboring the putative promoter proA for driving the expression of aspartic protease was obtained by genome walking. The upstream sequence contained the typical promoter motifs “TATA ” and “CAAT”. The β-glucosidase gene (Bgl 1) from H. orientalis was cloned and recombined with promoter proA and terminator trpC. The expression cassette was ligated to the binary vector to form pUR 5750 -Bgl 1, and then transferred into the host strain EU 7 - 22 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT), using hygromycin B resistance gene as the <b>screening</b> <b>marker...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Youden {{index is}} a widely used measure in the {{framework}} of medical diagnostic, where the effectiveness of a biomarker (<b>screening</b> <b>marker</b> or predictor) for classifying a disease status is studied. When the biomarker is continuous, it is important to determine the threshold or cut-off point to be used in practice for the discrimination between diseased and healthy populations. We introduce a new method based on adjusted empirical likelihood for quantiles aimed to estimate the Youden index and its associated threshold. We also include bootstrap based confidence intervals for both of them. In the simulation study, we compare this method with a recent approach based on the delta method under the bigamma scenario. Finally, a real example of prostatic cancer, well known in the literature, is analyzed to provide the reader with {{a better understanding of the}} new metho...|$|R
