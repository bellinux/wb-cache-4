25|$|From 1999 to 2003, a {{definitive}} set depicting Maltese flowers was issued in {{four sets of}} 6. Later in 2003 the local and foreign rates (7c, 16c) were re-issued as smaller, <b>self-adhesive</b> booklet stamps. These are the only <b>self-adhesive</b> stamps ever issued by Malta. Reprints of the 7c and 16c values were made in 2005, as personalised stamps, and in 2006 the 1c was reissued with a different inscription at the foot and with a watermark (The original 1999–2003 stamps had no watermark).

25|$|Seven stamps, {{designed}} by the botanical artist Susan Sex, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland came on sale on 9 September 2004. They were; 4c dog violet, 5c dandelion, 48c primrose, 60c hawthorn, 65c bluebell, €2 lords and ladies and €5 dog rose. ISSP were the printers and as previously, the low-values were printed in sheets of 100, while the high-values (€2 and €5) appeared in sheets of 50. With another design, the 48c daisy, only available in booklets, <b>self-adhesive</b> booklets or <b>self-adhesive</b> rolls.|$|E

25|$|South African National Standard 10019:2008 {{specifies}} {{the colour}} of all scuba cylinders as Golden yellow with French gray shoulder. This {{applies to all}} underwater breathing gases except medical oxygen, which must be carried in cylinders that are Black with a White shoulder. Nitrox cylinders must be identified by a transparent, <b>self-adhesive</b> label with green lettering, fitted below the shoulder. In effect this is green lettering on a yellow cylinder, with a gray shoulder. The composition of the gas must also be specified on the label. In practice this is done by a small additional <b>self-adhesive</b> label with the oxygen fraction, which is changed when a new mix is filled.|$|E
25|$|The label was a wet {{application}} type soaked {{in cold water}} which was then applied to the glass, then squeegeed with a clean sponge to remove remaining gum on the label. It was time consuming. In 1992, it changed to <b>self-adhesive</b> printed on registration certificates and continues for heavy vehicles after the abolition of labels for light vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Fire {{extinguisher}} identification {{signs are}} small signs {{designed to be}} mounted near a fire extinguisher, in order {{to draw attention to}} the extinguisher's location (e.g., if the extinguisher is on a large pole, the sign would generally be at the top of the pole so it can be seen from a distance). Such signs may be manufactured from a variety of materials, commonly <b>self-adhesive</b> vinyl, rigid PVC, and aluminum.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with <b>self-adhesive</b> tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
25|$|Limonene {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} for {{cleaning}} purposes, such as the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It {{is used as a}} paint stripper and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. All-natural commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing limonene are used by philatelists to remove <b>self-adhesive</b> postage stamps from envelope paper.|$|E
25|$|A {{postage stamp}} {{is a small}} piece of paper that is {{purchased}} and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are <b>self-adhesive.</b> Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.|$|E
25|$|Diving masks can {{be fitted}} with lenses for divers needing optical {{correction}} to improve vision. Corrective lenses are ground flat {{on one side}} and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and {{below the surface of the}} water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard corrective lenses are available which can be fitted. Plastic <b>self-adhesive</b> lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask floods.|$|E

McClintock was also featured in a 1989 four-stamp issue from Sweden which illustrated the work of eight Nobel Prize-winning geneticists.

Herrman. The main building for the Computing Division at Fermilab is named the [...] "Feynman Computing Center" [...] in his honor. A photograph of Richard Feynman giving a lecture was part of the 1988 poster series commissioned by Apple Inc. for their [...] "Think Different" [...] advertising campaign. The Sheldon Cooper character in The Big Bang Theory is a Feynman fan who emulates him by playing the bongo drums. On January 27, 2016, Bill Gates wrote an article [...] "The Best Teacher I Never Had" [...] describing Feynman's talents as a teacher which inspired Gates to create Project Tuva to place the filmed Feynman Messenger Lectures The Character of Physical Law videos on a website for public viewing. In 2015 Gates made a video on why he thought Feynman was special. The video was made for the 50th anniversary of Feynman's 1965 Nobel Prize, in response to Caltech's request for thoughts on Feynman.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2009, {{security}} features were increased on [...] "Machin" [...] <b>self-adhesive</b> stamps {{to avoid the}} reuse of uncancelled used stamps retrieved on mail. Both the effigy and the background were printed with continuous [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] iridescent printing. Two ellipsoidal shear panels were added to each stamp, and the water-soluble layer between the stamp and the adhesive was abandoned. These two later features were intended to render the stamps difficult to take off mail and to store for reuse (but in effect are easily overcome by the careful use of a sharp knife edge). Collectors are advised not to attempt to soak such stamps off, but to save them on pieces cut from the envelope.|$|E
2500|$|Adhesive lift: [...] in this method, a {{sheet of}} fixing film is used to {{preserve}} the developed indentations. [...] The fixing film is usually a relatively rigid sheet of <b>self-adhesive,</b> transparent polymer film. [...] It is applied by removing the backing material and carefully laying the fixing film directly onto the charging film, thus trapping and fixing the toner in place between the films. [...] Pressure is then carefully applied {{to the top of}} the fixing film by hand or with a small roller. [...] The resulting sandwich is referred to simply as a [...] "lift", or EDD lift. [...] Interpretation of the developed indentations is generally done using the lift after removal from the document because this permits the examiner to see the developed indentations on their own without interference from any visible markings on the document.|$|E

2500|$|Apart from Big Three products, {{the company}} also made a few promotionals for {{independent}} companies, like the 1952–1953 bathtub Nash Ambassador. One interesting aspect of these Nashes was that the 'windows' were a molded {{part of the body}} and not clear - the windows came covered with a <b>self-adhesive</b> silver foil that didn't hold up well through time (Doty 1996, pp. 88-89). PMC also made a couple of Trailways buses, including a GMC model 4102 or 4103 marketed by Ideal and issued in about 1952. It had an opening passenger door and changeable destination sign. Later, a larger Trailways Thru-Liner bus with opening side panels and removable luggage was also produced (Timm 2010 'Miscellaneous' page and PC Literature page 5). In addition were Oscar Mayer Weinermobiles in 1954, 1992, and 1996 variations. The 1990s versions were far beyond the time that PMC usually made wheeled promotionals, and were the last vehicles PMC made (Timm 2010, Photo Gallery Weinermobiles).|$|E
