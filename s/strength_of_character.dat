5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E

Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>character.</b> Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg.

Statistical analysis reflected Alonso's good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.|$|E

5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>character.</b> In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Stress is a {{widespread}} problem and in Sweden many of the long-term sick are due to stress related causes. Discussions about how to reduce stress are present. Positive psychology offers one potential way to reduce stress.

Coaching psychologists stands on the platform of positive psychology and may {{play a key role}} in guiding healthy people preventive through reduced risk for stress related health adversatives. The aim of this essay is to investigate impact <b>of</b> <b>strengths</b> on perceived stress and well-being. Method: A test battery containing questionnaires about psychological well-being, subjective well-being, <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>character,</b> <b>strengths</b> use and stress were put together and administered via internet to the participants. Results: A total of 21 participants answered the questionnaire (10 male). The main finding includes that stress were positively correlated with satisfaction with life, psychological well-being and negatively correlated with negative affect. Strengths use was positively correlated with psychological well-being and positive affect. A multiple regression analysis showed that only negative affect and strengths use was strong predictor of perceived stress. Conclusion: As strengths use are related to stress in two ways, both by predicting presence of stress and by increasing well-being, which in turn are related to lower perceived stress...|$|R

25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches.

A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
40|$|One major area {{of study}} in the burgeoning field of {{positive}} psychology is virtues, the <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> human <b>character</b> that engender excellence. However, the empirical assessment <b>of</b> these <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> requires further clarification, development, and validation. The present research study sought to develop and refine a virtues scale—the Comprehensive Inventory of Virtuous Instantiations <b>of</b> <b>Character</b> (CIVIC) scale—and establish evidence for its construct validity. In Study 1, virtue items were generated using the integrative classification system (Peterson 2 ̆ 6 Seligman, 2004). In Study 2, the measure was further refined and the factor structure examined. Results revealed eight broad virtue dimensions: appreciation, wisdom, fortitude, interpersonal consideration, sincerity, temperance, transcendence, and empathy. In Study 3, character traits’ convergence with extant individual differences measures and personality measures as well as discriminability from social desirability and moral cognitive development were examined. Study 4 contrasted virtues’ and personality’s differential associations with morally-salient constructs showing that virtues were more strongly related to evaluative constructs. In Study 5, virtues were shown to predict performance and psychological well-being outcomes above and beyond personality. The implications of our findings for the assessment and taxonomy for virtues are discussed. ...|$|R
