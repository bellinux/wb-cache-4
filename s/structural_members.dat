5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{architectural}} works within cathedrals {{which have the}} curvilinear tracery. These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum screen at Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not spring {{from the wall and}} so are not major <b>structural</b> <b>members.</b> The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which can also be seen at York.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} use of glass and iron as building materials also impacted {{the development of the}} glasshouse. The decades following the debut of the Crystal Palace saw a decline in the use of wood <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> for the construction of large European greenhouses or conservatories. Many manufacturers had found that the humid heat necessary to successfully propagate numerous plant varieties often destroyed wood <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> in short periods of time.|$|E

40|$|In two-sided {{structural}} cold plates, typically {{there is}} a <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> such as a honeycomb panel, that provides the structural strength for the cold plates that cool equipment. The cold plates are located {{on either side of}} the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> and thus need to have the cooling fluid supplied to them. One method of accomplishing this is to route the inlet and outlet tubing to both sides of the <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> Another method might be to supply the inlet to one side and the outlet to the other. With the latter method, an external feature such as a hose, tube, or manifold must be incorporated to pass the fluid from one side of the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> to the other. Although this is a more compact design than the first option, since it eliminates the need for a dedicated supply and return line to each side of the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> it still poses problems, as these external features can be easily damaged and are now new areas for potential fluid leakage. This invention eliminates the need for an external feature and instead incorporates the feature internally to the <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> This is accomplished by utilizing a threaded insert that not only connects the cold plate to the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> but also allows the cooling fluid to flow through it into the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> and then to the cold plate on the opposite side. The insert also employs a cap that acts as a cover to seal the open area needed to install the insert. There are multiple options for location of o-ring style seals, as well as the option to use adhesive for redundant sealing. Another option is to weld the cap to the cold plate after its installation, thus making it an integral part of the <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> This new configuration allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features...|$|R

A pair of lever arms are pivotally mounted to the support body for removably securing the support body within the casing.

It is shown that the vibration test by using mutilayer piezoelectric actuator is effective to damage detection of steel <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> After releasing bolt supports of a steel <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> the vibration test is carried out, and the validity of damage detection is examined. The analytical software system using genetic algorithm (GA) to evaluate the location and level of released bolts as a model of damage, is examined.

25|$|A covered {{bridge is}} a timber-truss bridge with a roof and siding which, in most covered bridges, create an almost {{complete}} enclosure.

25|$|The general {{impression}} given by Romanesque architecture, in both ecclesiastical and secular buildings, {{is one of}} massive solidity and strength. In contrast with both the preceding Roman and later Gothic architecture, in which the load-bearing <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> are, or appear to be, columns, pilasters and arches, Romanesque architecture, in common with Byzantine architecture, relies upon its walls, or sections of walls called piers.|$|E

40|$|A {{tailored}} <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> that {{is designed}} to generate a yield-type response, with applicability to the arrest of a moving body. The <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> comprises a primary load path connected in parallel to a longer secondary load path at a pair of common nodes. The primary load path is designed to fail at a lower load than that required to fail the secondary load path when subjected to a tensile force. As a result of the load redistribution achieved through the use of the redundant paths provided by the primary and secondary load paths, the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> dissipates more kinetic energy from the moving body within a given set of displacement and deceleration force constraints than is possible using a conventional, uniform cross-section member.

25|$|The {{height of}} the railway, at about 120 feet above high water, was {{determined}} by the level of the Brandling Junction line in Gateshead. A double-deck configuration was selected because of road levels on the approaches, and to avoid the excess width of foundations which a side-by-side arrangement would require. The deck width {{was determined by the}} useful roadway width plus the width of <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> which gave the railway deck the width for three tracks.|$|E

25|$|During the Depression, the Conservatory of Flowers, due to {{apparent}} lack of maintenance, was in poor condition. The Park commissioners {{instructed the}} superintendent of Parks to close the Conservatory of Flowers in 1933 and construct proper barricades to prevent possible injury to citizens.

25|$|Ribbed vaults {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs {{spanning}} the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a ribbed vault, it is the ribs that are the <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, the {{southern}} {{half of the}} structure was taking shape. However, preliminary calculations made early {{in the planning stages}} were never properly checked when the design was finalized, and the actual weight of the bridge was far in excess of its carrying capacity.

All went well until the bridge was nearing completion in the summer of 1907, when the QBRC site engineering team under Norman McLure began noticing increasing distortions of key <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> already in place.|$|E

25|$|It {{is hoped}} that {{developments}} in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using biomimetic principles. However, Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and <b>structural</b> <b>members)</b> that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.
