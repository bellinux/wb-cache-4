50|$|Southern Ocean sediments {{are a major}} sink for {{biogenic}} silica (50-75% of the oceanic {{total of}} 4.5 × 1014 g SiO2 yr−1; DeMaster, 1981), but only a minor sink for organic carbon (<1% of the oceanic 2 × 1014 g of organic C yr−1). These relatively high rates of biogenic silica accumulation in the Southern Ocean sediments (predominantly beneath the Polar Front) relative to organic carbon (60:1 on a weight basis) results from the preferential preservation of biogenic silica in the Antarctic water column. In contrast to what was previously thought, these high rates of biogenic silica accumulation are not the result from high rates of primary production. Biological production in the Southern Ocean is strongly limited due to the low levels of irradiance coupled with deep mixed layers and/or by limited amounts of micronutrients, such as iron. This preferential preservation of biogenic silica relative to organic carbon {{is evident in the}} steadily increasing ratio of silica/organic C as function of depth in the water column. About, thirty-five percent of the biogenic silica produced in the euphotic zone survives dissolution within the surface layer; whereas only 4% of the organic carbon escapes microbial degradation in these near-surface waters. Consequently, considerable decoupling of organic C and silica occurs during settling through the water column. The accumulation of biogenic silica in the seabed represents 12% of the <b>surface</b> <b>production,</b> whereas the seabed organic-carbon accumulation rate accounts for solely <0.5% of the <b>surface</b> <b>production.</b> As a result, polar sediments account for most of the ocean’s biogenic silica accumulation, but only a small amount of the sedimentary organic-carbon flux.|$|E

5000|$|The field {{takes its}} name from the Wayside Honor Rancho, a former minimum-security prison founded in 1938, where inmates were rehabilitated in an outdoor, ranch and farming environment. [...] Honor Rancho was a small oil field found after most of the large oil fields in the {{vicinity}} had already been developed. Southeast of Honor Rancho, across Interstate 5, is the Newhall Oil Field, site of the first commercially successful oil well in the western United States, Pico No. 4. But fields such as Honor Rancho were harder to find because the oil traps had no surface expression, like the prominent anticline of the Santa Susana Mountains in which the county's earliest oil wells were drilled. Texaco spudded the Honor Rancho discovery well in August 1950, finding oil at 6,000 feet below ground <b>surface.</b> <b>Production</b> grew for the next several years, with oil output peaking in 1957, and gas in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Annual dinoflagellate {{distribution}} {{is defined by}} an extended bloom period in subsurface waters during the late spring and summer. In November, subsurface plankton production is combined with <b>surface</b> <b>production,</b> due to vertical mixing of water masses and nutrients such as nitrite. [...] The major bloom-forming dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea is Gymnodinium sp. Estimates of dinoflagellate diversity in the Black Sea range from 193 [...] to 267 species. [...] This level of species richness is relatively low {{in comparison to the}} Mediterranean Sea, which is attributable to the brackish conditions, low water transparency and presence of anoxic bottom waters. It is also possible that the low winter temperatures below [...] of the Black Sea prevent thermophilous species from becoming established. The relatively high organic matter content of Black Sea surface water favour the development of heterotrophic (an organism which uses organic carbon for growth) and mixotrophic dinoflagellates species (able to exploit different trophic pathways), relative to autotrophs. Despite its unique hydrographic setting, there are no confirmed endemic dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>surface</b> <b>production</b> and benthic standing stock {{is fundamental to}} understanding biogeography in the deep sea. While much has been learned about the complex oceanographic processes involved in energy transfer to the benthos on local scales, the correspondence of overhead production to benthic community structure on regional scales remains poorly characterized. We compiled a database on the biomass and abundance of deep-sea macrobenthos in the western North Atlantic collected from 1961 to 1985. Using SeaWiFS satellite color imagery, we calculated POC from surface chlorophyll a concentrations (from 1997 to 2001), and estimated POC flux to the seafloor by using the empirically derived Pace et al. [1987. Primary production, new production and vertical flux in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Nature 325, 803 ¿ 804] algorithm. The standing stock and <b>surface</b> <b>production</b> data are not concurrent, but their basic geographic trends at these very large spatial scales appear to be relatively stable over the time scales of measurement. Estimated POC flux at depth accounts for 62 ¿ 67 % of the variance (P< 0. 0001) in benthic standing stock, suggesting that macroecological studies of the {{relationship between}} satellite-derived <b>surface</b> <b>production</b> and deep-sea community structure may be possible.

A {{study on the}} choice {{cropping}} pattern by farmers as compared to their location to the city, following the cotton crisis of 1998, has been conducted in Central African Republic. After having chosen 92 producer groups around two cities distributed in 4 concentric circles, a collection of statistics and surveys have been realised during three agricultural campaigns. Regressions of <b>surfaces</b> and <b>production</b> to distances of farms to the city have been calculated. Results show the dependence between cultivated <b>surfaces,</b> <b>production</b> and distance to the city. The more a farm {{is far from the}} city, the more its cotton <b>surface</b> and its <b>production</b> increase while the share of food crops surface decreases.

Farms located far from the city choose a cotton strategy while those located close to the city choose to develop a "food crops" strategy.
