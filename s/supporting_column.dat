25|$|On {{entering}} this small and unassuming building, the unexpected {{glory of the}} interior for the visitor is the scissor-truss roof, which {{after more than a}} century retains rare stencil paintings by Powell Bros of Leeds on the chancel beams. Beneath the paint on the plastered north and south walls of the nave are hidden stencil paintings and possibly spirit frescoes by the same artists, revealed in a pre–1914 photograph in the church archives. Although this building is too simple to permit a gallery of columns and bays, Barber has still managed to include a few small columns by recessing the three-light nave windows into the wall, and fitting a single slender <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> into each recess.|$|E
25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> and due to more usage of steel.|$|E

6000|$|Passing {{the screen}} of shrubs, a scene lay before them almost fit for the gardens of Seville. Three sides of an {{extensive}} square were enclosed by the semi-gothic buildings, floridly decorated with stone carving; one consisted of the main edifice, the lower windows tented with striped projecting blinds; a second of the wing containing the reception rooms, fronted by the imitative cloister, which was continued and faced with glass on the third side--each <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> covered with climbing plants, the passion-flower, the tropaeolum, the trumpet honeysuckle, or even the pomegranate, opening their gay blooms on every side. The close-shaven turf was broken by small patches of gorgeously-tinted flower-beds, diversified by vases filled with trailing plants, and lines of orange trees and fuchsias, with {{here and there a}} deep-belled datura, all converging towards the central marble fountain, where the water played high, and tinkled coolly in sparkling jets. Between it and the house, there were placed in the shade some brightly-tinted cushions and draperies, lounging chairs, and a low table, bearing an oriental-looking service of tiny cups, of all kinds of bright and fantastic hues, no two alike. Near it reclined on her cushions a figure in perfect keeping with the scene, her jetty hair contrasting with her gold and coral net, her scarlet gold-embroidered slipper peeping out from her pale buff-coloured dress, deeply edged with rich purple, and partly concealed by a mantle of the unapproachable pink which suggests Persia, all as gorgeous in apparel as the blue and yellow macaw on his pole, and the green and scarlet lories in their cage. Owen made a motion of smoking with Honor's parasol, whispering, 'Fair Fatima! what more is wanting?' ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{take another}} instance. No subject {{has been more}} {{frequently}} or exquisitely treated by the religious painters {{than that of the}} Annunciation, though as usual, the most perfect type of its pure ideal has been given by Angelico, and by him with the most radiant consummation (so far as I know) in a small reliquary in the sacristy of St^a. Maria Novella. The background there, however, is altogether decorative; but in the fresco of the corridor of St. Mark's, the concomitant circumstances are of exceeding loveliness. The Virgin sits in an open loggia, resembling that of the Florentine church of L'Annunziata. Before her is a meadow of rich herbage, covered with daisies. Behind her is seen through the door {{at the end of the}} loggia, her chamber with its single grated window, through which a star-like beam of light falls into the silence. All is exquisite in feeling, but not inventive nor imaginative. Severe would be the shock and painful the contrast, if we could pass in an instant from that pure vision to the wild thought of Tintoret. For not in meek reception of the adoring messenger, but startled by the rush of his horizontal and rattling wings, the virgin sits, not in the quiet loggia, not by the green pasture of the restored soul, but houseless, under the shelter of a palace vestibule ruined and abandoned, with the noise of the axe and the hammer in her ears, and the tumult of a city round about her desolation. The spectator turns away at first, revolted, from the central object of the picture, forced painfully and coarsely forward, a mass of shattered brickwork, with the plaster mildewed away from it, and the mortar mouldering from its seams; and if he look again, either at this or at the carpenter's tools beneath it, will perhaps see in the one and the other, nothing more than such a study of scene as Tintoret could but too easily obtain among the ruins of his own Venice, chosen to give a coarse explanation of the calling and the condition of the husband of Mary. But there is more meant than this. When he looks at the composition of the picture, he will find the whole symmetry of it depending on a narrow line of light, the edge of a carpenter's square, which connects these unused tools with an object at the top of the brickwork, a white stone, four square, the corner-stone of the old edifice, the base of its <b>supporting</b> <b>column.</b> This, I think, sufficiently explains the typical character of the whole. The ruined house is the Jewish dispensation, that obscurely arising in the dawning of the sky is the Christian; but the corner-stone of the old building remains, though the builder's tools lie idle beside it, and the stone which the builders refused is become the Headstone of the corner.|$|E

5000|$|On June 29, 1995, the 5 story Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea {{collapse}}d. The collapse {{was due to}} {{the removal}} of several <b>support</b> <b>columns</b> on the lower floors in order to make room for escalators. This lack of structural support was worsened years later by the addition of several heavy air conditioners on the roof above the area where <b>support</b> <b>columns</b> had been removed. This caused the <b>support</b> <b>column</b> that was closest to the air conditioners to fail and pass its load onto nearby columns, which led to complete failure and collapse within 24 hours of major cracks appearing around the failed column. [...] 501 people were killed and 937 others were injured. The complex was a steel-reinforced concrete design.|$|R
50|$|A triple variant was custom {{designed}} for the Marriott Corporation, each ride had three main components: the wheels with their passenger cars; a set of supporting arms; and a single central <b>supporting</b> <b>column.</b> Each wheel rotated {{about the end of}} its own supporting arm. The arms in turn would either pivot or rotate together as a single unit about the top of the <b>supporting</b> <b>column.</b> The axis about which the rotating arms turned was offset from vertical, so that as the arms rotated, each arm and its corresponding wheel was raised and lowered. This allowed one wheel to be horizontal at ground level, and brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and unloading of all its passenger cars, while the other wheel(s) continued to rotate vertically at considerable height.|$|E
5000|$|The spacing of the triglyphs caused {{problems}} which {{took some time}} to resolve.

5000|$|The {{pilaster}} is an [...] {{in classical}} architecture {{used to give}} the appearance of a <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> and to articulate an extent of wall, with only an ornamental function. It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface, usually treated {{as though it were a}} column, with a capital at the top, plinth (base) at the bottom, and the various other elements. In contrast to a pilaster, an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above.|$|E
5000|$|The Broadgate Phase 11 - Exchange House in London was Iyengar's most {{innovative}} structural engineering work. The building is {{directly over the}} top of Liverpool Street Station, a high traffic railroad station. But the rail station could not be touched so no <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> could touch the ground. To solve this problem three different structural systems were used to support the 10 story tall building over the 78 meter clear span. These were an X-braced truss system, a 10 story catenary suspension system, and a parabolic arch system. It is basically a building-bridge hybrid.|$|E
