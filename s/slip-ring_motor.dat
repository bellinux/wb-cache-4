40|$|Abstract—A novel sensorless {{scheme for}} direct torque and fre-quency {{control of a}} double-inverter-fed {{slip-ring}} induction motor is presented. The analysis of a double-inverter-fed induction motor is given to derive the proposed controller. Various frequency profiles are analyzed for a direct frequency controller. A novel frequency profile is suggested to make the sensorless drive operation reliable and machine parameter independent at any rotor speed. Simula-tion and experimental results are presented from a 50 -hp drive, demonstrating that the drive can deliver full torque from 0 to 2 -p. u. speed in either direction. Thus, double the rated power can be ex-tracted from the motor without overloading it. Index Terms—Double inverter, sensorless control, <b>slip-ring</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} linearization methods of the non-linear state equation. The linearization is developed {{from the point of}} view of the application in the theoretical electrotechnics. Some aspects of these considerations can be used in the control theory. In particular the main emphasis is laid on three methods of linearization, i. e. : Taylor’s series expansion, optimal linearization method and global linearization method. The theoretical investigations are illustrated using the non-linear circuit composed of a solar generator and a DC motor. Finally, the global linearization method is presented using several examples, i. e. the asynchronous <b>slip-ring</b> <b>motor</b> and non-linear diode. Furthermore the principal theorem concerning the BIBS stability (bounded-input bounded state) is introduced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Belt {{conveyors}} are {{a dominant}} mean of transport in modern open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are usually driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> <b>motors</b> of a nominal voltage of 6 kV and nominal power from 200 to 1000 kW. Efficiency of the transport {{system is the}} crucial parameter {{of the level of}} economical exploitation of an open-pit mine as a whole. The main problem which prevent optimal transport-system efficiency is insufficient synchronization between the production and transport capacities. Since the conveyors in the open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mainly driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> <b>motors,</b> the most appropriate solution to control the conveyor speed (the speed of the drive motors) is to use a subsynchronous constant torque cascade with a static voltage and frequency converter. The basic elements of the subsynchronous cascade are a diode bridge rectifier and a thyristor inverter bridge, as well as a power transformer whose nominal power depends on the control range and which sends electricity back to the power grid. The paper describes a mathematical model to calculate the subsynchronous cascade parameters used in controlling the speed of electric-motor drives for belt conveyors...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of operating the three phase <b>slip-ring</b> induction <b>motor</b> {{as a series}} connected motor is explored. The merits and drawbacks of this mode of operation are discussed. For this purpose the necessary mathematical models along with the corresponding computer simulation are developed and experimental verification of the theoretical results is also carried out. It {{has been found in}} general that operation of <b>slip-ring</b> induction <b>motors</b> as series connected motors is possible providing that the rotor winding is connected in a sequence opposite to that of the stator winding. This adds flexibility to the modes of operation of these motors. Moreover synchronous operation is also possible, providing that the series connected motor is driven initially at twice its synchronous speed and then connected to the supply. © 1997 IEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wound rotor {{induction}} motors {{have been}} popular for {{decades in the}} cement and mining industry for starting and driving large grinding mill. A wound rotor induction motor is large ac motor that controlled starting characteristics and adjustable speed capability. Slip power recovery wound rotor induction motor drives are used in high power, limited speed range applications where control of slip power provides the variable speed drive system. Traditional method of speed control of slip ring induction motor is variable resistance method but losses occurs are more.

40|$|To {{determine}} the motor power required for providing the specified machine acceleration {{there is a}} need to know the relative start time. The known formulas are obtained by numerical integration of the starting characteristics of motors provided that the acceleration process ends when the motor accelerates to nominal speed. In real terms the acceleration process ends when the rotor speed corresponds to the static moment of friction forces. This paper provides numerical integration of the starting characteristics of asynchronous motors with the cage and wound rotor and presents curves of calculated relative start time, taking into account the static load. When calculating the required power of the motor, which runs in the mode of frequent starts and stops in the mechanisms that have high inertia loads and small moments of static resistance it is possible to use the motors of lower power and lower the dynamic loads at start-up a by virtue of a small increase in start-up time calculated by the above formulas. It is shown that the three-stage rheostat start-up of <b>slip-ring</b> <b>motors</b> is more preferable than the two-stage startup. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{details of}} a novel and simple {{triggering}} circuit for the firing angle control of 3 -phi thyristor converters operating under variable frequency supply is explained. The firing angle remains almost constant for a given control voltage and {{for a wide range}} of supply frequency variations. The circuit uses only 1 -phi sensing, to generate the triggering pulses necessary for 3 -phi converters working under variable frequency supply and the firing pulses are spaced equidistantly. The circuit is inherently immune to noise and transients, due to the use of CMOS integrated circuits and optocouplers. The circuit can be used for applications such as rotor control of <b>slip-ring</b> induction <b>motors.</b> The experimental results obtained for the triggering circuit are presented. 13...|$|R
40|$|The series {{connected}} {{represents a}} peculiar {{mode of operation}} of three phase <b>slip-ring</b> induction <b>motors.</b> When the rotor is connected in series with the stator with opposite phase sequence, the motor can start and reach a speed close to synchronous speed.

The torsional dynamic elyects become serious when one of the torsional modes of the motor-shaft assembly resonates with one of the pulsating torque components of the overall electromagnetic torque.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method of}} controlling a <b>slip-ring</b> induction <b>motor</b> so as to provide characteristics suitable for hoist drive applications. The primary of the machine was supplied from a three-phase voltage regulator which in addition to producing a motoring torque can also provide plug braking by phase reversal and dynamic braking by d. c. injection. The hoist drive characteristics are of a constant torque nature and these were obtained by the control of a variable duty cycle forced commutated thyristor chopper in the secondary circuit of the motor. The operation of the voltage regulator has been examined for a load consisting of a delta wound induction motor. A simple model of the regulator has been developed from which speed-torque characteristics have been determined. Analysis of {{the operation of the}} motor and thyristor chopper was used to determine the appropriate relationship between duty cycle and speed necessary to produce a constant torque characteristic. This relationship was realized by a function generator which was used to control the thyristor chopper. Closed loop control of motor speed by the voltage regulator combined with open loop operation of the thyristor chopper as a function of speed gave the required constant torque characteristic. Logic circuits were incorporated in the design to allow automatic selection of the motoring and braking modes. The four-quadrant controller has been designed and successfully operated throughout the required speed range. The operation of the controller has been considered from both steady state and dynamic aspects...|$|R
