Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.|$|E

Krantz {{reports that}} in 1969, John Green (who owned a first-generation {{copy of the}} original Patterson film) interviewed Disney executive Ken Peterson, who, after viewing the Patterson film, asserted [...] "that their technicians {{would not be able}} to duplicate the film". Krantz argues that if Disney personnel were unable to duplicate the film, there is little likelihood that Patterson could have done so. Greg Long writes, [...] "Byrne cited his trip to Walt Disney studios in 1972, where Disney's chief of animation and four assistants viewed Patterson's footage and praised it as a beautiful piece of work although, they said, it must have been shot in a studio. When Byrne told them it had been shot in the woods of Northern California, 'They <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and walked away.'" ...|$|E

"Soon, {{with the}} {{composition}} of the musical illustrations for Pictures from an Exhibition by the architect Hartmann, he reached the acme of that musical radicalism, to whose 'new shores' and to whose 'unfathomed depths' the admirers of his 'Peepshows' and 'Savishnas' had pushed him so diligently. In music for these illustrations, as Mussorgsky called them, he represented , children, Baba Yaga in her wooden house on chicken legs, catacombs, gates, and even rattling carts. All this was not done jokingly, but 'seriously'.""There was no end to the enthusiasm shown by his devotees; but many of Mussorgsky's friends, on the other hand, and especially the comrade composers, were seriously puzzled and, listening to the 'novelty,' <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in bewilderment. Naturally, Mussorgsky noticed their bewilderment and seemed to feel that he 'had gone too far.' He set the illustrations aside without even trying to publish them. Mussorgsky devoted himself exclusively to Khovanshchina." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Sitting in the Midday Sun" [...] was {{released}} {{during a period}} of turmoil for The Kinks—bandleader Ray Davies' marital problems with his wife Rasa came to a head nine days before the song's UK release when she left him, taking their children with her. Ray went into a state of depression; Doug Hinman wrote about his condition: [...] "a week following his wife's departure, an emotionally distraught Ray [...] admitted to hospital for suspected barbiturate poisoning. He [...] treated and released." [...] Shortly after the incident, on 15 July, The Kinks made an infamous appearance at the White City Stadium. According to a Melody Maker review of the concert, [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'.... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Mick [...] just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummed on through 'Waterloo Sunset. At the show's conclusion, as pretaped music played on the sound system, Ray declared that he was quitting. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was rushed to hospital.

2500|$|By {{then other}} {{men who had}} known about the duel were {{arriving}} at the scene, including Decatur's friend and mentor, the senior officer John Rodgers. In excruciating pain, Decatur was carefully lifted by the surgeons and placed in Rodgers' carriage and was carried {{back to his home}} on Lafayette Square. Before they departed Decatur called out to Barron that he should also be taken along, but Rodgers and the surgeons calmly <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in disapproval. Barron cried back [...] "God bless you, Decatur" [...] – and with a weak voice Decatur called back [...] "Farewell, farewell, Barron." [...] Upon arrival at his home Decatur was taken in to the front room just left of the front entrance, still conscious. Before allowing himself to be carried in he insisted that his wife and nieces be taken upstairs, sparing them the sight of his grave condition. A Dr. Thomas Simms arrived from his home nearby to give his assistance to the naval physicians. However, for reasons not entirely clear to historians, Decatur refused to have the ball extracted from his wound. [...] At this point Decatur requested that his will be brought forward so as to receive his signature, granting his wife all his worldly possessions, with directives as to who would be the executors of his will. Decatur died at approximately 10:30pm that night. While wounded, he is said to have cried out, [...] "I did not know that any man could suffer such pain!" ...|$|E
