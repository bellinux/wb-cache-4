25|$|Strabo {{does not}} <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Suebi {{east of the}} Elbe, saying that this region was still unknown to Romans, but {{mentions}} that {{a part of the}} Suebi live there, naming only specifically the Hermunduri and the Langobardi. But he mentions these are there because of recent defeats at Roman hands which had forced them over the river. (Tacitus, mentions that the Hermunduri were later welcomed on to the Roman border at the Danube.) In any case he says that the area near the Elbe itself is held by the Suebi.|$|E
25|$|In {{a special}} queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage questioned {{the relevance of}} pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, {{as well as being}} a constant reminder of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.|$|E
25|$|There are ten {{cervical}} vertebrae in {{the neck}} of Xingxiulong. The proatlas, an atrophied vertebra positioned {{in front of the}} atlas, is bounded in front by top sides of the foramen magnum. While it is difficult to <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the atlas itself due to damage, the immediately following axis has a relatively short centrum, which is slightly compressed on its sides and bottom. Overall, the remainder of the cervical vertebrae are relatively short, being only 2.5 to 3 times {{as long as they are}} tall; they become increasingly shorter towards the back of the neck, like Lufengosaurus. Other basal sauropodomorphs, including Jingshanosaurus, have cervical vertebrae that are generally 3 to 4 times as long as they are tall. On the bottom of the centra of cervical vertebrae 4-9, there is a prominent keel as in Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, and other basal sauropodomorphs. Near the back of the neck, the neural spines become somewhat table-like.|$|E

In Paleobiology—the flagship journal of his own speciality—only Charles Darwin and George Gaylord Simpson have been cited more often. Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science.

500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The integer {{factorization}} {{problem is}} the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it {{is the problem of}} deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time [...] to factor an integer n. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, the Soviet Union sent {{four more}} probes to Mars: the Mars 4 and Mars 5 orbiters and the Mars 6 and Mars 7 fly-by/lander combinations.

Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200km returning one swath of pictures and radio occultation data, which constituted the first detection of the nightside ionosphere on Mars. Mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems (attitude control or retro-rockets) and missed the planet by [...]|$|E
2500|$|On February 2, 2007, Timbaland {{responded to}} the {{plagiarism}} accusations in an interview by the radio show Elliot in the Morning. In this interview, Timbaland admits {{to what he calls}} [...] "sampling", but he also claims that sampling is [...] "not stealing", because [...] "everybody samples from everybody every day". Timbaland also says that the sample is [...] "from a video game" [...] and mentions the Commodore 64. He also says that he has no time for research and that it is sometimes impossible to [...] "know what's public domain and what's not". Timbaland also calls the issue [...] "ridiculous" [...] but mentions that he is [...] "in legal discussions" [...] and therefore was not able to <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. He did, however, call Janne Suni an [...] "idiot" [...] and a [...] "freakin' jerk" [...] on the show. He consistently talked about the incident as sampling, failing to address the claims with regards to the melody.|$|E
50|$|Strabo {{mentions}} the Sarmatians {{in a number}} of places, but never <b>says</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them. He uses both the terms of Sarmatai and Sauromatai, but never together, and never suggesting that they are different peoples. He often pairs Sarmatians and Scythians in reference to a series of ethnic names, never stating which is which, as though Sarmatian or Scythian could apply equally to them all.|$|R

McLuhan has <b>much</b> to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> perception and thought but little to say <b>about</b> institutions; Innis <b>says</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|R
2500|$|In the Observer interview, Hewlett {{said that}} there is [...] "a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which is even bigger and more {{difficult}} than , and it isn't going to fit anywhere and no one's going to like it, ha ha ha! We've started work— I've {{done a lot of}} visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still just a really good idea." [...] Carousel was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The proto-historic Alleghenies can be exampled by the {{earliest}} journals of the colonists. According to Batts and Fallows' September, 1671 Expedition, they found Mehetan Indians of Mountain [...] "Cherokee-Iroquois" [...] mix on the New River tributaries. This journal does {{not identify the}} [...] "Salt Village", but, that the [...] "Mehetan" [...] were associated with these and today thought to be [...] "Monetons", Siouans. However, this journal does not identify the [...] "Salt Village" [...] below the Kanawha Falls, but, that simply the [...] "Mehetan" [...] were associated with these. He explained, below the [...] "Salt Villages", a mass of hostile Indians had, implied, arrived and some believe these to be [...] "Shanwans" [...] of Vielles Expedition of 1692~94, ancient Shawnee. In 1669, John Lederer of Maryland for the Virginia Colony and the Tennessee Cherokee had visited {{the mouth of the}} Kanawha and reported no hostilities on the lower streams of the Alleghenies. The Mohetan representative through a Siouan translator explained to Mr Batts and Mr Fallon, Colonel Abraham Woods exploriers 1671-2, that he (Moheton Native American) could not <b>say</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the people below the [...] "Salt Village" [...] because they (Mountain Cherokee) were not associated with them. The Mohetan was armed by this time of 1671 for the Mohetan Representative was given several pouches of ammunition for his and the other's weapons as a token of friendship. Somebody had already been trading within the central Alleghenies before the Virginians historical record begins in the Allegheny Mountains. Some earlier scholars found evidence these Proto-historics were either Cistercians of Spanish Ajacan Occuquan outpost on the Potomac River or Jesuits and their Kahnawake Praying Indians (Mohawk) on the Riviere de la Ronceverte. The [...] "Kanawha Madonna" [...] may date from this period or earlier.
