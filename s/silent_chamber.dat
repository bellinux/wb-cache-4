60|$|From the monkey-house and its {{perpetual}} infinitely varied pantomime {{they were}} conducted into a secret <b>silent</b> <b>chamber,</b> where an interesting event had recently occurred, and Mrs. Monkey, {{who was very}} aristocratic and exclusive, received only a few privileged guests. They found her {{sitting up in bed}} and nursing an infant that looked exceedingly ancient, although the keeper solemnly assured Fan that it was only three days old. Mrs. Monkey gravely shook hands with her visitors, and condescendingly accepted a bon-bon, which she ate with great dignity, and an assumption of not caring much about it.|$|E
6000|$|In {{that dark}} time of December, {{the sale of}} the {{household}} furniture lasted beyond the middle of the second day. Mr. Tulliver, who had begun, in his intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability which often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic rigidity and insensibility, had lain in this living death throughout the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his chamber. Mr. Turnbull had decided {{that it would be a}} less risk to let him remain where he was than to remove him to Luke's cottage,--a plan which the good Luke had proposed to Mrs. Tulliver, thinking it would be very bad if the master were [...] "to waken up" [...] at the noise of the sale; and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the <b>silent</b> <b>chamber,</b> watching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and trembling lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell on their own ears with such obstinate, painful repetition.|$|E
6000|$|Of course I am {{perfectly}} {{aware that}} the above statement is exaggerated, {{in the attempt to}} make it adequate. Professed philanthropists have gone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far as this. Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit. The paragraph may remain, however, both for its truth and its exaggeration, as strongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in Hollingsworth, and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode of observation was calculated to lead me. The issue was, that in solitude I often shuddered at my friend. In my recollection of his dark and impressive countenance, the features grew more sternly prominent than the reality, duskier in their depth and shadow, and more lurid in their light; the frown, that had merely flitted across his brow, seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle. On meeting him again, I was often filled with remorse, when his deep eyes beamed kindly upon me, as with the glow of a household fire that was burning in a cave. [...] "He is a man after all," [...] thought I; [...] "his Maker's own truest image, a philanthropic man!--not that steel engine of the Devil's contrivance, a philanthropist!" [...] But in my wood-walks, and in my <b>silent</b> <b>chamber,</b> the dark face frowned at me again.|$|E

60|$|What I saw outside amazed me. The {{hall was}} empty. The stairs were bare, and yellow with dust. There were three doors opening into spacious rooms, and each was uncarpeted and undraped, {{save for the}} grey webs which drooped from the cornice, and rosettes of lichen which had formed upon the walls. My feet reverberated in those empty and <b>silent</b> <b>chambers.</b> Then I wandered on down the passage, {{with the idea that}} the kitchens, at least, might be tenanted. Some {{caretaker}} might lurk in some secluded room. No, they were all equally desolate. Despairing of finding any help, I ran down another corridor, and came on something which surprised me more than ever.|$|R
60|$|It is {{well known}} that Cicero's works are divided into four main parts. There are the Rhetoric, the Orations, the Epistles, and the Philosophy. There is a fifth part, indeed--the Poetry; but of that there is not much, and of the little we have but little is esteemed. There are not many, I fear, who think that Cicero has {{deserved}} well of his country by his poetry. His prose works have been divided as I have stated them. Of these, two portions have been dealt with already--as far as I am able to deal with them. Of the Orations and Epistles I have spoken as I have gone on with my task, because the matter there treated has been available for the purposes of biography: the other two, the Rhetoric and the Philosophy, have been distinct from the author's life.[239] They might have been good or bad, and his life would have been still the same; therefore it is necessary to divide them from his life, and to speak of them separately. They are the work of his <b>silent</b> <b>chamber,</b> as the others were the enthusiastic outpourings of his daily spirit, or the elaborated arguments of his public career. Who has left behind him so widely spread a breadth of literature? Who has made so many efforts, and has so well succeeded in them all? I do not know that it has ever been given to any one man to run up and down the strings of knowledge, and touch them all as though each had been his peculiar study, as Cicero has done.|$|E
60|$|To Dorothea, {{still in}} that time of youth when the eyes with their long full lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied as a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning's parting with Will Ladislaw {{seemed to be the}} close of their {{personal}} relations. He was going away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back he would be another man. The actual state of his mind--his proud resolve to give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the needy adventurer seeking a rich woman--lay quite out of her imagination, and she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her supposition that Mr. Casaubon's codicil seemed to him, as it did to her, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them. Their young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one else would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of the past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check. That unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed <b>silent</b> <b>chamber</b> she might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at. For the first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it before her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged with the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one who has rejoiced in woman's tenderness think it a reproach to her that she took the little oval picture in her palm and made a bed for it there, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the creatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then that it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before awaking, with the hues of morning on his wings--that it was Love to whom she was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless rigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the fulfilment of their own visions.|$|E
5000|$|According to June McDaniel, his {{writings}} have influenced Western interest in kundalini yoga. [...] He wrote many books and travelled {{all over the}} world giving lectures. He came to feel the kundalini experience underlies all (or most) religions that started with a personal revelation. He could see kundalini iconography in cultures worldwide, from ancient Egypt to Quetzalcoatl to the caduceus of Mercury, and believed there was a common basis, and that he had been granted entry to this vision. Gopi Krishna theorised that the brain {{was in a state of}} organic evolution, and that the rising of Kundalini into the brain would open a normally <b>silent</b> <b>chamber</b> called brahma-randra in the yogic tradition. Krishna worked tirelessly to promote the scientific investigation of kundalini in the human frame, hypothesizing that this energy was leading humankind towards the goal of Higher Consciousness.|$|E

5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 54% of 13 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10. [...] When {{the film was}} first released, film critic Bosley Crowther, gave the film a mixed review, writing, [...] "If {{you want to be}} tough about it—okay, it's a pretty silly yarn and it is played in a manner no less fatuous by the sundry members of the cast. But Mr. Lang is still a director who knows how to turn the obvious, such as locked doors and <b>silent</b> <b>chambers</b> and roving spotlights, into strangely tingling stuff. And that's why, for all its psycho-nonsense, this film has some mildly creepy spots and some occasional faint resemblance to Rebecca which it was obviously aimed to imitate." [...] Variety called it arty and almost surrealistic. The motivations of the characters were described as occasionally murky. [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called the film's murkiness a strength.|$|R
6000|$|... [47] We {{go about}} {{the world in the}} day time, and are absorbed in earthly schemes; the world is as bright as a rainbow, and it bears for us no marks or {{predictions}} of the judgment, or of our sins; and conscience is retired, as it were, within a far inner circle of the soul. But when it comes night, and the pall of sleep is drawn over the senses, then conscience comes out solemnly, and walks about in the <b>silent</b> <b>chambers</b> of the soul, and makes her survey and her comments, and sometimes sits down and sternly reads the record of a life that the waking man would never look into, and the catalogue of crimes that are gathering for the judgment. Imagination walks tremblingly behind her, and they pass through the open gate of the Scriptures into the eternal world-for thither all things in man's being naturally and irresistibly tend-and there, imagination draws the judgment, the soul is presented at the bar of God, and the eye of the Judge is on it, and a hand of fire writes, [...] "Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting!" [...] Our dreams sometimes reveal our character, our sins, our destinies, more clearly than our waking thoughts; for by day the energies of our being are turned into artificial channels, by night our thoughts follow the bent that is most natural to them; and as man is both an immortal and a sinful being, the consequences both of his immortality and his sinfulness will sometimes be made to stand out in overpowering light, when the busy pursuits of day are not able to turn the soul from wandering towards eternity-(Cheever). Bunyan profited much by dreams and visions. [...] "Even in my childhood the Lord did scare and affright me with fearful dreams, and did terrify me with dreadful visions." [...] That is a striking vision of church fellowship in the Grace Abounding, (Nos. 53-56); and an awful dream is narrated in the Greatness of the Soul-"Once I dreamed that I saw two persons, whom I knew, in hell; and methought I saw a continual dropping from Heaven, as of great drops of fire lighting upon them, to their sore distress" [...] (vol. 1, p. 148)-(ED).|$|R
40|$|The article {{does not}} {{aspire to be}} an {{academic}} overview of museological issues but is rather a contemplation based on previous experiences. In museum work, the popular truth that everything complicated will be eventually sorted out {{does not seem to}} apply. The more you are involved in the work, the clearer it becomes that there are no simple truths. In reality, the main activities tend to stand in conflict and thus emerges the question of the essential nature of museum, which may at first seem existentialistic – is it a <b>silent</b> treasure <b>chamber</b> or living cultural heritage? The treasure chamber justifies itself if, and only if, it also functions as the living cultural heritage. An archival item has significance only within the general cultural context. The prerequisite of a cultural heritage is a message. Is a reproduction a cultural heritage? No, it is rather a tool for passing on the message, while the message itself is authentic. The solution should be the increasingly careful selection of items in museum collections, and their message must be as dignified both now and a hundred years later. At the same time, larger and more versatile auxiliary collections which are used in reconstructing the cultural heritage have to be formed, brought to life and thus made understandable by all. The activity of museum workers is decisive in what people of the future will know about the past. The decision is made on two planes: by compiling the collections and displaying these...|$|R
