50|$|In 1931, the US Army Air Corps and General Electric {{tested a}} <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> for aircraft, which was {{considered}} more reliable and accurate {{than one that}} relied on air pressure, when heavy fog or rain was present. The new altimeter used a series of high-pitched sounds like those made by a bat to measure {{the distance from the}} aircraft to the surface, which on return to the aircraft was converted to feet shown on a gauge inside the aircraft cockpit.|$|E
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} results already {{achieved}} with sonic altimeters {{in light of}} the theoretical possibilities of such instruments. From the information gained in this investigation, a procedure is outlined {{to determine whether or not}} a further development program is justified by the value of the <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> as an aircraft instrument. The information available in the literature is reviewed and condensed into a summary of <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> developments. Various methods of receiving the echo and timing the interval between the signal and the echo are considered. A theoretical discussion is given of <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> errors due to uncertainties in timing, variations in sound velocity, aircraft speed, location of the sending and receiving units, and inclinations of the flight path with respect to the ground surface. Plots are included which summarize the results in each case. An analysis is given of the effect of an inclined flight path on the frequency of the echo. A brief study of the acoustical phases of the <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> problem is carried through. The results of this analysis are used to predict approximately the maximum operating altitudes of a reasonably designed <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> under very good and very bad conditions. A final comparison is made between the estimated and experimental maximum operating altitudes which shows good agreement where quantitative information is available...|$|E
40|$|In this note, {{instruments}} for measuring altitude {{and rate of}} change of altitude in blind flying and landing of aircraft and their performance are discussed. Of those indicating the altitude above ground level, the <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> is the most promising. Its present bulk, intermittent operation, and more or less unsatisfactory means of indication are serious drawbacks to its use. The sensitive type aneroid altimeter is also discussed and errors in flying at a pressure level and in landing are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the physics of}} sediment transport by waves and currents and to use that understanding to predict the evolution of nearshore bathymetry given the nearshore fluid-velocity field. A secondary goal is to interpret the environment of deposition and the offshore wave climate from the sedimentary record. SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES Objectives are to generate maps of bed roughness for the entire surf zone from sidescan sonar images and sonic-altimeter-derived bathymetry acquired at Duck, North Carolina during the SandyDuck â€˜ 97 experiment; to theoretically describe and numerically model the substantial effects of fluid acceleration on sheet flow bedload transport in the surf zone; and to generate computer simulation models for evolution of nearshore morphology and other grain-scale sedimentary processes. APPROACH Side-scan sonar observations acquired in the surf zone during the SandyDuck 97 experiment complement <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> profiles of bathymetry acquired by NPS collaborators E. Gallagher and E. Thornton. Side-scan sonar imagery offers complete areal coverage of the bed geometry and certain aspects of bed sedimentology but lacks quantitative measures of bed elevation.

40|$|Small-scale beach {{morphology}} (scales < 5 m) height variations {{were measured}} {{by combining the}} CRAB survey with bed elevation acquired from a 1 MHZ <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> mounted on the CRAB during the October phase of the DUCK 94 experiment. Bedform types were observed using a 500 kHZ side-scan sonar also mounted on the CRAB. Corollary waves and currents were measured. Three cases were examined in detail: mild waves and weak longshore currents resulting in wave ripples everywhere; storm waves with strong longshore currents resulting in lunate and straight crested megaripples in the trough of the barred beach; and narrow banded, normally incident waves with a strong rip current resulting in a relatively planar bed everywhere except in the throat of the rip where magaripples were measured. The predictive wave ripple height and length equations of Nielsen (1981) worked reasonably well for mild wave conditions, but did not predict ripples during moderate wave conditions. The wavenumber spectra were generally broad, indicating that newly formed ripples coexisted with residual ripples from the past to form complex, multi-scaled ripple patterns. (MM) U. S. Navy (U. S.

The Naval Postgraduate School {{has developed a}} successful Rapid Flight Test Prototyping System (RFTPS) {{for the development of}} software for remote computer control of fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This thesis reviews the work accomplished to mount sensors on a small remote controlled helicopter with instrumentation compatible with the RFTPS: an inertial measurement unit, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an altitude sensor and associated power supply and telemetry equipment. A helicopter with sufficient lift capability was selected and a lightweight aluminum structure was built to serve as both an avionics platform for the necessary equipment and also as a landing skid. Since the altitude sensors used for fixed wing UAV's, such as barometric sensors and GPS, do not provide sufficient accuracy for low altitude hover control, a lightweight, precision altimeter was developed using ultrasound technology. Circuitry was developed to drive a Polaroid 6500 Series Ranging Module and process the output data in a form compatible with the RFTPS avionics architecture. Flight testing revealed severe vibrations throughout the helicopter. An alternative avionics package of reduced size was constructed to house the <b>sonic</b> <b>altimeter</b> and a three-axis accelerometer.
