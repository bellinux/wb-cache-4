40|$|High quality speech-to-lips conversion, {{investigated}} in this work, renders realistic lips movement (video) consistent with input speech (audio) without knowing its linguistic content. Instead of memoryless framebased conversion, we adopt maximum likelihood {{estimation of the}} visual parameter trajectories using an audio-visual joint Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We propose a minimum converted trajectory error approach (MCTE) to further refine the converted visual parameters. First, we reduce the conversion error by training the joint audio-visual GMM with weighted audio and visual likelihood. Then MCTE uses the generalized probabilistic descent algorithm to minimize a conversion error of the visual parameter trajectories defined on the optimal Gaussian kernel sequence according to the input speech.

40|$|Electromechanical {{properties}} such as d 33 {{and strain}} are significantly enhanced at morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) between {{two or more}} different crystal structures. Many actuators, sensors and MEMS devices are therefore systems with MPBs, usually between polar phases in lead (Pb) -based ferroelectric ceramics. In the search for Pb-free alternatives, systems with MPBs between polar and non-polar phases have recently been theorized as having great promise. While such an MPB was identified in rare-earth (RE) modified bismuth ferrite (BFO) thin films, <b>synthesis</b> <b>challenges</b> have prevented its realization in ceramics. Overcoming these, we demonstrate a comparable electromechanical response to Pb-based materials at the polar-to-non-polar MPB in Sm modified BFO. This arises from ‘dual’ strain mechanisms: ferroelectric/ferroelastic switching and a previously unreported electric-field induced transition of an anti-polar intermediate phase.

Sample and {{statistically}} based singing synthesizers typically {{require a}} large amount of data for automatically generating expressive synthetic performances. In this paper we present a singing synthesizer that using two rather small databases is able to generate expressive synthesis from an input consisting of notes and lyrics. The system is based on unit selection and uses the Wide-Band Harmonic Sinusoidal Model for transforming samples. The first database focuses on expression and consists of less than 2 minutes of free expressive singing using solely vowels. The second one is the timbre database which for the English case consists of roughly 35 minutes of monotonic singing of a set of sentences, one syllable per beat. The synthesis is divided in two steps. First, an expressive vowel singing performance of the target song is generated using the expression database. Next, this performance is used as input control of the synthesis using the timbre database and the target lyrics. A selection of synthetic performances have been submitted to the Interspeech Singing <b>Synthesis</b> <b>Challenge</b> 2016, in which they are compared to other competing systems...|$|E
40|$|Supramolecular {{polymers}} {{have shown}} to be powerful scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Supramolecular biomaterials functionalized with ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) moieties, which dimerize via quadruple hydrogen-bond formation, are eminently suitable for this purpose. The conjugation of the UPy moiety to biologically active peptides ensures adequate integration into the supramolecular UPy polymer matrix. The structural complexity of UPy–peptide conjugates makes their <b>synthesis</b> <b>challenging</b> and until recently low yielding, thus restricted the access to structurally diverse derivatives. Here we report optimization studies of a convergent solid-phase based synthesis of UPy-modified peptides. The peptide moiety is synthesized using standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis and the UPy fragment is introduced on the solid-phase simplifying the synthesis and purification of the final UPy–peptide conjugate. The convergent nature of the synthesis reduces the number of synthetic steps in the longest linear sequence compared to other synthetic approaches. We demonstrate {{the utility of the}} optimized route by synthesizing a diverse range of biologically active UPy–peptide bioconjugates in multimilligram scale for diverse biomaterial applications...|$|R
