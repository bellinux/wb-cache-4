50|$|Pressureless {{sintering}} {{is another}} method for processing and densifying UHTCs. Pressureless sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold {{in order to}} promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial die compaction, and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. Exaggerated grain growth that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic sinterability and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB2 by pressureless sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2150 °C for 9 h (Figure 3). Efforts to control grain size and improve densification have focused on adding third phases to the UHTCs, some examples of these phases include the addition of boron and iridium. Addition of Ir in particular has shown an increase in the toughness of HfB2/20vol.% SiC by 25%. <b>Sintered</b> <b>density</b> has also been shown to increase with the addition of Fe (up to 10% w/w) and Ni (up to 50% w/w) to achieve densifications of up to 88% at 1600 °C. More advances in pressureless sintering must be made before it can be considered a viable method for UHTC processing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} thermocompression pressure, shear deformation of green laminates, and postsinter HIPing on the microstructural homogeneity of cast tapes and laminates prepared from fine Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 powders. Green density increases with increasing thermocompression pressure. <b>Sintered</b> <b>densities,</b> however, depend more on the macroscopic uniformity in the green tapes. When density gradients develop within the individual green tapes (because of improper drying), sintering is constrained in two dimensions and densities remain low. Postsinter HIPing does not significantly increase the <b>sintered</b> <b>densities</b> because of the retention of open porosity within the individual tape-cast layers. The use of a revised thermocompression process involving shear deformation results in higher <b>sintered</b> <b>densities</b> and complete densification after HIPing. <b>Sintered</b> <b>densities</b> increase with the degree of shear strain during green-state deformation processing. Thus, green-state deformation can improve homogeneity in laminates.

This study explores {{the impact of}} further decreasing the bulk density of a fairly typical ore blend. This was done by introducing small amounts of a very porous ore into the blend. Measured decreases in bulk density were up to 3 %. All the sinter quality parameters could be maintained or improved without the need to increase coke rate. Changes in <b>sinter</b> <b>density</b> results were not significant, indicating that the changes in bed bulk density {{did not have a}} significant effect on sinter porosity. The study was then extended to include a comparable blend and two hematite blends of higher bulk density. Decreasing green bed bulk density, bed shrinkage and <b>sinter</b> <b>density</b> did not have a detrimental effect on sinter tumble strength. The associated increase in porosity with the measured changes in <b>sinter</b> <b>density</b> is estimated to be up to 10 %. Results showed that <b>sinter</b> <b>density</b> values obtained for the low bulk density mixes at increased coke addition were still lower than equivalent values for the hematite mixes.

The strength distributions of hollow glass microspheres were determined independently by mercury porosimetry, and then used to calibrate the sound field; breaking pressures from 1 to 76 MPa could be obtained by varying the energy input to the ultrasonic transducer;Agglomerate strength distributions were measured for a variety of yttria and yttria-stabilized zirconia powders, which were prepared by solution precipitation methods. Different preparation methods were used in order to obtain powders containing agglomerates with different characteristics. Special yttria powders containing agglomerates of 0. 1 [mu] m, spherical, monosize spheres were also prepared. BET surface area, tap density, pressed density, compaction curves, and mercury intrusion curves were also obtained. The powders were pressed and sintered, and the <b>sintered</b> <b>density</b> measured for each pellet;Smooth curves could be drawn when agglomerate strength was plotted against sintered density; the <b>sintered</b> <b>density</b> of the powders also could be ranked directly according to the strength of the agglomerates in each powder.

For comparison, both vacuum and nitrogen sintering were carried out on as received (gas atomised) and degassed powder compacts pressed at 340 and 510 MPa. Vacuum degassing of the prealloyed powder provided better compressibility and thus higher green densities than those for the as received powder. Highest <b>sintered</b> <b>densities</b> of ~ 98 - 99 % of theoretical were obtained for the prealloyed (and degassed) Al compacts by sintering under pure nitrogen with an addition of 0 · 6 wt-% paraffin wax as solid lubricant or 1 · 33 vol. -% liquid paraffin, or with a 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant. It was found that additions of solid lubricants such as lithium stearate and acrawax to both the premixed (elemental) and prealloyed powders provided reasonable green densities of ~ 94 · 5 - 95 · 5 % TD, but had deleterious effect on <b>sintered</b> <b>densities</b> and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering. Other lubricants such as zinc stearate, stearic acid and liquid paraffin provided similar green <b>densities,</b> but higher <b>sintered</b> <b>densities</b> and less porous microstructures, particularly by sintering under pure nitrogen.

The {{addition of}} LaB 6 led to scavenging of both oxygen (O) and chlorine (Cl) from the titanium powder during sintering, {{evidenced by the}} formation of La 2 O 3 and LaClxOy. The pinning effect of La 2 O 3, LaClxOy and TiB inhibited prior-β grain growth and resulted in subsequent smaller α-laths. The formation of nearly equiaxed α-Ti phase is partially attributed to the nucleation effect of α-Ti on TiB.

In this study, preliminary forms of graphite-coated B 4 C nanopowders {{on the order}} of 20 - 40 nm with various additives were sintered and analyzed. Methanol washing was performed on the powders to remove most of the B 2 O 3 impurity usually present.

A dilatometer furnace was used to track the dimensional changes during <b>sintering,</b> and <b>densities</b> of <b>sintered</b> samples were compared to green compact densities. The onset of sintering occurred at various temperatures depending on the dopant and its amount, most often occurring at higher temperatures than expected.

The accuracy of the degree of mixing of aluminium powder’s blends obtained at the optimum blending time of 10 minutes is determined by the powder properties and this significantly influenced the powder’s bed density. By increasing the mixing time above 10 minutes, particulate agglomeration which inhibit good packing of powdered particles occurs, thus, <b>sintered</b> <b>density</b> decreases and porosity increases. Therefore, high porosity in the powder bed hinders effective thermal conductivity between aluminium particles, thereby, leading to deterioration of the <b>sintered</b> <b>density</b> and microstructure of the SLS processed samples...|$|E
40|$|Mn-Zn ferrite {{ceramics}} {{were prepared}} through usual ceramic method using different iron oxide raw materials. The micro-structure parameters, {{such as the}} <b>sintering</b> <b>density</b> and the ferrite grain size, depended on both the sintering temperature {{and the kinds of}} iron oxide raw materials. The differences in the microstructure parameters were responsible for variations in magnetization, permeability, electrical resistivity and power loss. Additionally, it was clarified that the relationship between micro-structural and electromagnetic properties were uniquely explained using the non-magnetic and insulating grain boundary model, irrespective of the kinds of iron oxide raw materials...|$|R

Two secondary phases (LaSrGaO 4 and LaSrGa 3 O 7) of powders {{were identified by}} X-ray diffraction analysis. The relative amount of these secondary phases depended on the calcination conditions (temperature and time) and Zn content. The <b>sintering</b> <b>density</b> of LSGMZ was enhanced by increasing the Zn content and calcination temperature at the low sintering temperatures (1250 - 1300 o C).
