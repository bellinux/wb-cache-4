5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled {{at the very end}} of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{signed by}} Congress and {{enshrined in the}} National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P. Boyd argued that the Declaration, like Magna Carta, is not a <b>single</b> <b>document.</b> Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.|$|E

25|$|However, the Chronicle {{is not a}} <b>single</b> <b>document</b> but the {{end result}} of {{combining}} several sources over a period of time. The annals for the 5th century in the Chronicle were put into their current form during the 9th century, probably during the reign of Alfred the Great. The sources are obscure for the fifth century annals; however, an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that they were derived from an oral tradition such as sagas in the form of epic poems.|$|E
25|$|With the {{prospect}} of further enlargement, {{and a desire to}} increase areas of co-operation, the Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on the 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and the Hague respectively.

25|$|After {{the auditor}} determines which federal {{programs}} to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes {{operations of the}} program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program {{to see if they}} complied or not. The examination does not require observing every <b>single</b> <b>document</b> and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|The book {{attracted}} {{hardly any}} attention.

The three girls always worked in secret, unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p. m. with Don't stay up late, Girls!, then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the program}} began {{as a way to}} {{preserve}} and promote documentary heritage, which can be a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> a collection, a holding or an archival fonds that is deemed to be of such significance as to transcend the boundaries of time and culture. This recorded memory reflects the diversity of languages, people, and cultures. UNESCO, the world agency responsible {{for the protection of the}} world's cultural and natural heritage, realized the need to protect such fragile yet important component of cultural heritage. To this end, the Memory of the World Programme was established with the aim of preserving and digitizing humanity's documentary heritage.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, in a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> {{the goals of}} {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E
25|$|Following the invasion, in April and May 1940 the NKVD {{secret police}} perpetrated {{the single most}} notorious wartime atrocity against any prisoners of war held by the Soviet Union. In the Katyn {{massacre}} nearly twenty-two thousand Polish nationals were killed in mass executions simultaneously. They included army officers, political leaders, civil servants, government officials, intellectuals, policemen, landowners, and scores of ordinary soldiers. The Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia, was the primary execution site where 4,443 officers (the entire Polish military echelon {{in the custody of}} the Soviets), were murdered by the Soviet secret police. The name Katyn is now associated with the systematic execution of up to 21,768 Polish citizens in several locations ordered through a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> including at the Kozelsk prisoner-of-war camp as well as the Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps.|$|E

25|$|The same {{argument}} for unification {{could be made}} for Latin and Cyrillic -- the American English encoding system known as ASCII never encoded the Cyrillic А (U+0410) differently from the Latin A (U+0041) -- {{but we know that}} ASCII was never intended to display both Latin and Cyrillic in the same document. Similarly, Korean encoding standards never had the aim of displaying Korean and Japanese and Chinese and Cyrillic and Ethiopian all within a <b>single</b> <b>document.</b> Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique codepoints owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently. While most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with codepoints in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique codepoints.|$|E
25|$|There is an unsolved {{issue about}} his final rank. Sources like the {{promotion}} recommendations from Generals Hardee and Johnston speak for a promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1864. There are several authors who {{speak of a}} promotion either from Major to Colonel or from Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel - what gives those voices credibility {{is the most common}} date when the promotion was dated, February 20, 1864. His microfilmed muster roll also lists his highest rank as Colonel. In the Official Records on most occasions everyone (Lt. Col. or Col.) is simply addressed as Col., including Smith in the later war years. However, there is a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> in which Smith and other artillery officers are strictly differed into Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. This document refers to Smith as (full) Colonel. It is authorized by Major General Arnold Elzey, commanding the artillery of the Army of Tennessee; and written by Captain Charles Swett, Elzey's Inspector General, on December 21, 1864.|$|E
500|$|In her 2008 PhD dissertation, Rebecca Schwartz {{argued that}} Smyth's {{academic}} {{background and the}} Smyth Report's security-driven focus on physics {{at the expense of}} chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance promoted a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily the achievement of physics and physicists. According to Schwartz, postwar histories and popular writing tended to follow the Smyth report in this regard, creating a lasting historiographical legacy. [...] "Ever since", wrote Jon Agar, [...] "the atomic bomb has been seen as an achievement of physics." [...] In particular, the prominence given to Einstein's mass–energy equivalence equation indelibly associated it with the Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report, wrote Robert P.

500|$|Spanish colonial {{documents}} {{refer to}} the inhabitants of a broad swathe of territory as Chols or Cholans; this territory extended from the Laguna de Términos through the Lacandon Jungle across {{the foothills of the}} Sierra de los Cuchumatanes eastwards to southern Belize. A number of distinct Chol- or Cholan-speaking groups inhabited this area; the Manche Ch'ol were just one of these groups and spoke the now extinct Ch'olti' language. Ch'olti' was descended from the Classic Maya language used in hieroglyphic texts. Ch'olti' was very closely related to the Ch'ol, Cholan and Ch'orti' languages. The Ch'olti' language is evidenced from a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> written in the late 17th century in the Manche Ch'ol territory; it has been held in the library of the American Philosophical Society since the 19th century. The document is the Arte y vocabulario de la lengua Cholti, 1695 by Spanish friar Francisco Morán, with the catalogue number Mss.497.4.M79. It was compiled in the Manche village San Lucas Tzalac. The term manche, is derived from the elements men, meaning [...] "artisan", and che, meaning either [...] "tribe" [...] or [...] "tree"; it was the name of a large Manche Ch'ol settlement.|$|E
