5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this {{made it easy for}} him to get into character. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over 57 days in New York and Paris between October and December 2005. The film's budget was $41 million. It was originally lower, which caused problems with some locations—the crew could not get permission to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> the Museum of Modern Art or Bryant Park.|$|E
5|$|Saran later {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that during the <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Coorg, the team's day began at 4:30 AM everyday. She visited coffee plantation and black pepper farms to observe the farmers' work for her part. For a few particular scenes, where Saran teaches Nagarjuna some farm chores, the team made a few takes, as Nagajuna, being a quick learner, completed the tasks better than Saran.|$|E

50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the first}} motion {{pictures}} to be shot in 24p HD digital video, which <b>shoots</b> <b>at</b> 24 frames-per-second like film, as opposed to regular digital video which <b>shoots</b> <b>at</b> 30 frames-per-second.|$|R
5000|$|In 1945 U-boat Commander Heinz-Wilhelm Eck of [...] was {{executed}} {{with two of}} his crewmen for <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> survivors; likewise [...] was also involved in <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> sunken ship survivors-although they were not tried as they were lost at sea.|$|R
5|$|The Fire Control Switchboard {{configured}} the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix {{and match}} the three turrets to the two GFCSs. He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> two targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team returned briefly to the UK to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> the Faslane submarine base before setting off to Spain, Portugal and the Bay of Biscay where the supertanker exteriors were filmed. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery plotting rooms were down below the waterline {{and inside the}} armor belt. They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax correctors, a switchboard, and crew to operate it all.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first day}} of {{shooting}} of an Appleseed focuses on <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> a known fixed distance, only. The second day adds lecture details on <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> varying distances, and shooting in wind, although <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> varying distances is not always practiced. Some Appleseeds, however, are shot at real distances on day two, or at both 25 meters and 100 meters on day two, depending on specific shooting range facility limitations. For these Appleseeds, the typical progression is <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> 25 meters only on day 1 with a [...]22, then <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> varying distances on day two with a [...]30-caliber or other center-fire service-type rifle (5.56mm, etc.), or <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> 25 meters and then at 100 meters with a [...]22 for part of day two for those students demonstrating an ability to maintain 4 MOA accuracy. Oral history stories regarding individuals involved at {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War, such as Paul Revere, as well as the [...] "Three Strikes" [...] that were needed to start the American Revolutionary War, are discussed during breaks in the shooting activities. Stories regarding the role of marksmanship during the retreat on April 19, 1775, are also told.|$|R

5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E
5|$|At night, the green-skinned Billy {{takes his}} revenge {{out on the}} two police deputies for {{interrogating}} him about Dr. Mellon's death and kills both of them at a gas station. The next day, Kathy puts the pendant on Billy's chest while they are laying together outside. Billy immediately wakes up with green skin and deformed teeth and attacks Kathy, but she escapes. Law enforcement officials <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Billy from an aircraft, but Billy destroys the aircraft with the cannon, and later kills Chuck and Froggy by blowing up their car.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties {{at the hands of}} a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{improved}} {{after the}} break, but Manchester City {{had a key}} opportunity in the 56th minute when a counter-attack led by Carlos Tevez, who drifted out to the right flank, allowed David Silva to find space outside the Stoke City penalty area as the Stoke defence vanished. Tevez managed to pass to Silva, but Silva was guilty of over-elaboration instead of shooting first-time, and the Stoke City defence managed to regroup, dispossessing Silva before he could adjust himself to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> goal.|$|E
5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E

5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to <b>shoot</b> <b>at,</b> or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Hayley Atwell, {{who played}} Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger, {{said that she}} would not appear in the sequel. However Stanley Tucci, who played Dr. Abraham Erskine in the {{previous}} film, later said that Atwell would reappear in a flashback scene. Also in January, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D, and Anthony Mackie said filming would begin on April 1, 2013. Later that month, Toby Jones, who portrayed Arnim Zola in the first film, said that he would reprise the role in the sequel. By the end of the month, stages were being built for a <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Raleigh Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
