500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
2500|$|I {{want to read}} {{something}} you said four years ago at this very setting: [...] "Freedom means freedom for everybody." [...] You <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> recently when you were asked about legalizing same-sex unions. And you used your family's experience as a context for your remarks. Can you describe then your administration's support for a constitutional ban on same-sex unions? ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 18, 2008, {{speech at}} Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Palin said, [...] "Our opponents, {{they have some}} strange ideas about raising taxes. To them, raising taxes– and Joe Biden <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> today– raising taxes is about patriotism. To the rest of America, that's not patriotism. Raising taxes is about killing jobs and hurting small {{businesses}} and making things worse. This isn't about anyone's patriotism– it's about Barack Obama's poor judgement." ...|$|E
60|$|When he, with racked and {{whirling}} brain, Feebly implored her to explain, She simply <b>said</b> <b>it</b> all <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|David only <b>said</b> <b>it</b> over <b>again</b> in {{the same}} words, {{and put his hand}} down on her letter in his earnestness.|$|R
60|$|This {{was indeed}} the acme of daring. I couldn't believe I had {{actually}} <b>said</b> <b>it.</b> But <b>again</b> I received no rebuke; instead came a remark that set me palpitating, that I treasured for many weeks to come.|$|R
60|$|Amyas <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{and then}} went on; faltering, he hinted at the manner of her death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorothy," [...] I cried; [...] "Dorothy, I stayed because I love you. There, I have <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{what has}} not passed my lips {{since we were}} children. What has been in my heart ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{may well}} say Dear me!' rejoined Mrs Wilfer, {{in a deep}} tone. Upon which {{encouragement}} he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> though scarcely with the success he had expected; for the scornful lady then remarked, with extreme bitterness: 'You said that before.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{were wrong}} when {{you let him}} go,” he <b>said.</b> “If <b>it</b> happens <b>again</b> I should suggest the pistol. One gains nothing by showing those gentlemen toleration.” ...|$|R
50|$|If it's {{already been}} written, why write <b>it</b> <b>again?</b> If <b>it's</b> already been <b>said,</b> why say <b>it</b> <b>again?</b> I {{mean there are}} some {{remarkable}} quotes that I love. But I didn't say them. And you don't want to pass them off as your own work.|$|R
6000|$|Some of {{the jokes}} got well worn {{in the course}} of two or three months, from {{repeated}} use; for every time Cauchon started a new trial the folk said [...] "The sow has littered (2) again"; and every time the trial failed they <b>said</b> <b>it</b> over <b>again,</b> with its other meaning, [...] "The hog has made a mess of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grizel, I {{have come}} back." [...] He {{said it to}} the night, and bowed his head. He said it with head accompaniment to Grizel's lighted window. He said it {{to himself as he}} reached the door. He never <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what you said once, Richard," [...] she answered, her voice {{dropping}} very low. [...] "I was sitting by the window there, and the dawn was coming. And suddenly I heard you cry: 'Patty, when I return will you be my wife?' I got up and came to your side, and you <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> twice." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this Gavinia jumped with joy, {{and then}} cried, [...] "Up wi' her!" [...] words whose bearing the school-mistress {{fortunately}} did not understand. All save Tommy looked at Miss Ailie, {{and she put}} her arm on Mr. McLean's, and, yes, it was obvious, Miss Ailie was a lover at the Cuttle Well at last, like so many others. She had often said that the Den parade was vulgar, but she never <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... ‘None at all, Mr. Jasper.’ Still, {{not quite}} so frankly or so freely; or, be <b>it</b> <b>said</b> once <b>again,</b> {{not quite so}} {{carelessly}} perhaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "'All right, then,' he <b>said.</b> 'Don't do <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and I'll {{stand for}} the drinks. But I may as well confess that you fellows had me going south for a moment. Look at the way I've been sweating.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2017, a male {{reporter}} {{who belonged to}} NHK was arrested over an alleged sexual attack against a woman, and in March a fresh arrest warrant that was related to a similar crime was issued. In response to this, NHK <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> apologised <b>again</b> to the victims and its customers.|$|R
60|$|So I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, and then he did, and then I did, and then he did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|E
6000|$|As we kept {{close and}} quiet, he said {{something}} to his men which I didn't understand, {{and when he had}} said it, the one-eyed English rascal with the patch (who had stepped out when he began), <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> in English. It was only this. [...] "Boys of the black flag, this is to be quickly done. Take all the prisoners you can. If they don't yield, kill the children to make them. Forward!" [...] Then, they all came on at the gate, and in another half-minute were smashing and splitting it in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Davie," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "I've been thinking"; then he paused, and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "There's a wee bit siller that I half promised ye before ye were born," [...] he continued; [...] "promised it to your father. O, naething legal, ye understand; just gentlemen daffing {{at their}} wine. Well, I keepit that bit money separate--it was a great expense, but a promise is a promise--and it has grown by now to be a maitter of just precisely--just exactly"--and here he paused and stumbled--"of just exactly forty pounds!" [...] This last he rapped out with a sidelong glance over his shoulder; and the next moment added, almost with a scream, [...] "Scots!" ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the sixth}} and final one, the caller, one more time with a high-pitched voice, said he was Manolo's anus. Manolo insulted him, telling the caller he didn't have a mother. The caller <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> was <b>again</b> a joke from El Vacilón, and Manolo insulted the caller's mother, and then he hung up.|$|R
5000|$|Connolly said Caine [...] "taught me so much, {{about how}} to be generous to other actors. We were {{climbing}} up a hill and we were being filmed from the top. Suddenly he went, oh! My leg! And he spoiled a whole take. So they <b>said</b> we're doing <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and he whispered to me 'next time, move further to the right, they can't see you'. He was lovely." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{people need}} to hear <b>it</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again that God is with them and that 'the hope of the poor is never brought to nothing'" [...] (...) [...] Also, while the oppressors must be called to repentance, [...] "they must also be given {{something}} to hope for. At present they have false hopes ... Can the Christian message of hope not help them in this matter"? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was glad}} to get his {{petition}} into a formula, and he repeated it later in the dining-room during the short pause which the Vicar always made after prayers, before he rose from his knees. He <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> {{in the evening and}} again, shivering in his nightshirt, before he got into bed. And he believed. For once he looked forward with eagerness {{to the end of the}} holidays. He laughed to himself as he thought of his uncle's astonishment when he ran down the stairs three at a time; and after breakfast he and Aunt Louisa would have to hurry out and buy a new pair of boots. At school they would be astounded.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{heart had}} been surprised, she hardly knew how; but at his kiss a novel {{tenderness}} had leaped {{to life in}} it. She suffered him to put her hand upon his arm, and then {{she began to feel}} a strange pride in his being tall and handsome, and hers. But she kept thinking as they walked, [...] "I hope he'll never he sorry," [...] and she <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> half in jest. He pressed her hand against his heart, and met her look with one of protest and reassurance, that presently melted into something sweeter yet. He said, [...] "What beautiful eyes you have! I noticed the long lashes when I saw you on the Saguenay boat, and I couldn't get away from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} would, sir. You are right, sir. Exactly my own views, Mr Boffin.' Here Wegg rose, and {{balancing}} {{himself on his}} wooden leg, fluttered over his prey with extended hand. 'Mr Boffin, consider it done. Say no more, sir, not a word more. My stall and I are for ever parted. The collection of ballads will in future be reserved for private study, with the object of making poetry tributary'--Wegg {{was so proud of}} having found this word, that he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> with a capital letter--'Tributary, to friendship. Mr Boffin, don't allow yourself to be made uncomfortable by the pang it gives me to part from my stock and stall. Similar emotion was undergone by my own father when promoted for his merits from his occupation as a waterman to a situation under Government. His Christian name was Thomas. His words at the time (I was then an infant, but so deep was their impression on me, that I committed them to memory) were: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Dirty Harry {{quotation}} [...] "Do {{you feel}} lucky, punk?" [...] is a rewording {{of the original}} dialogue: [...] "You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" [...] Humphrey Bogart's character Rick in Casablanca never <b>said</b> [...] "Play <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> Sam." [...] The actual expression is [...] "Play it, Sam." [...] Mae West did not say [...] "Why don't you come up sometime and see me?" [...] in She Done Him Wrong, but rather [...] "Why don't you come up and see me sometime?" ...|$|R
60|$|And the gazelle said to him, 'Get up, my master, and {{bathe in}} the stream!' {{and when the}} man had bathed <b>it</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> 'Now rub {{yourself}} well with earth, and rub your teeth well with sand to make them bright and shining.' And when this was done <b>it</b> <b>said,</b> 'The sun has gone down behind the hills; {{it is time for}} us to go': so it went and brought the clothes {{from the back of the}} horse, and the man put them on and was well pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} all along that he meant to meet his brother at Fiume, and {{yesterday}} he <b>said</b> something about <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> So you see, my pretty one, {{that we can have}} a comfortable little supper this evening without fear of interruption. We'll have it at ten o'clock, when the supper-party is going on at the barn, eh? We shan't be interrupted then. So give me that duplicate key, will you, and I can slip in quietly through the back door without raising a bit of gossip or scandal. Hurry up now! I shall have to be going." ...|$|R
6000|$|He took {{occasion}} {{from the}} first fraction of a break not quite {{to know what he}} knew about Mrs. Folliott--though perhaps he could imagine a little; and it was probably at this minute that, having definitely settled to a position, and precisely in his very own tapestry bergère, the one with the delicious little spectral [...] "subjects" [...] on the back and seat, he partly exhaled, and yet managed partly to keep to himself, the deep resigned sigh of a general comprehension. He knew what he was [...] "in" [...] for, he heard her go on--she <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and again, seemed constantly to be saying it while she smiled at him with her peculiar fine charm, her positive gaiety of sensibility, scarce dimmed: [...] "I'm just selfishly glad, just selfishly glad!" [...] Well, {{she was going to have}} reason to be; she was going to put the whole case to him, all her troubles and plans, and each act of the tragi-comedy of her recent existence, as to the dearest and safest sympathiser in all the world. There would be no chance for his case, though it was so much for his case he had come; yet there took place within him but a mild, dumb convulsion, the momentary strain of his substituting, by the turn of a hand, one prospect of interest for another.|$|E
6000|$|She had, {{with her}} hand still on the knob, {{her back against the}} door, so that her retreat, under his {{approach}} must be less than a step, and yet she couldn't for her life, with the other hand, have pushed him away. He was so near now that she could touch him, taste him, smell him, kiss him, hold him; he almost pressed upon her, and the warmth of his face--frowning, smiling, she mightn't know which; only beautiful and strange--was bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams. She closed her eyes to it, and so, the next instant, against her purpose, she had put out her hand, which had met his own and which he held. Then it was that, from behind her closed eyes, the right word came. [...] "Wait!" [...] It was the word of his own distress and entreaty, the word for both of them, all they had left, their plank now on the great sea. Their hands were locked, and thus she <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Wait. Wait." [...] She kept her eyes shut, but her hand, she knew, helped her meaning--which after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed. He let her go--he turned away with this message, and when she saw him again his back was presented, as he had left her, and his face staring out of the window. She had saved herself and she got off.|$|E
60|$|The {{boat had}} been advertised {{to leave at}} seven o'clock, and it was now half past. A party of English people were pacing {{somewhat}} impatiently up and down before Kitty, for it had been made known among the passengers (by that subtle process through which matters of public interest transpire in such places) that breakfast would not be served till the boat started, and these English people had the appetites which go before the admirable digestions of their nation. But they had also the good temper which does not so certainly accompany the insular good appetite. The man in his dashing Glengarry cap and his somewhat shabby gray suit took on one arm the plain, jolly woman {{who seemed to be}} his wife, and on the other, the amiable, handsome young girl who looked enough like him to be his sister, and strode rapidly back and forth, saying that they must get up an appetite for breakfast. This made the women laugh, and so he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> which made them laugh so much that the elder lost her balance, and in regaining it twisted off her high shoe-heel, which she briskly tossed into the river. But she sat down after that, and the three were presently intent upon the Liverpool steamer which was just arrived and was now gliding up to her dock, with her population of passengers thronging her quarter-deck.|$|E
6000|$|And {{now since}} {{cleaving}} to Christ by vow and covenant, {{will not do}} without baptism, after personal confession of faith; what a state are all those poor saints of Jesus in, that have avowed themselves to be his a thousand times without THIS baptism? Yea, and what a case is Jesus Christ in too, by your argument, to hold that communion with them, that belongeth only unto them that are married to him by this solemnity! Brother, God give him repentance. I wot that through ignorance and a preposterous zeal he <b>said</b> it: unsay <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with tears, and by a public renunciation of so wicked and horrible words; but I thus sparingly pass you by.[5] ...|$|R
50|$|Emily {{returned}} to Oakdale months later with Chris Hughes. They had a steamy relationship, but she wasn't {{in love with}} Chris she {{was only trying to}} get back at Dusty. Dusty and Chris butted heads from the moment he returns and on New Year's Eve, Emily couldn't deny her true feelings and had sex with Dusty in his car. She <b>said</b> <b>it</b> couldn't happen <b>again</b> and tried to keep the secret from Chris. Lily, who {{was having an affair with}} Dusty at the time, learned of Emily's prostitution soon after Dusty's death and outed Emily in an anonymous note left for Chris. He couldn't believe she had lied to him and ended their relationship.|$|R
50|$|Meant <b>it,</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{stand by}} it. I'd say <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> For every vote I {{may have lost}} because of it. I {{probably}} picked up one or two.|$|R
