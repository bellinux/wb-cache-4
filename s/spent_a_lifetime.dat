5|$|Leonardo's The Battle of Anghiara was a fresco {{commissioned}} in 1505 for the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Its central scene depicted {{four men}} riding raging war horses {{engaged in a}} battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his David, was assigned the opposite wall. All that remains of Leonardo's work is a copy by Rubens, but Maurizio Seracini is convinced it can still be found and has <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the Salone dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.|$|E

Thomas graduated from West Point {{in the class}} of 1942, received the Silver Star Medal and the Distinguished Service Cross, and reached the rank of captain before being killed at Anzio on 25 February 1944. An Army port repair ship, the Thomas F. Farrell Jr., was named in his honor. Peter graduated from West Point {{in the class of}} 1950. He served with the Army in the Vietnam War, where he commanded the 6th Battalion, 56th Air Defense Artillery during the Tet Offensive. He retired from the Army in 1978 with the rank of colonel. Farrell's daughter, Barbara Vucanovich, was the first woman from Nevada to be elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1983 to 1997. His granddaughter, Patricia Dillon Cafferata, served as Nevada State Treasurer from 1983 to 1987. Farrell died at Saint Mary's Hospital in Reno, Nevada, on 11 April 1967. His wife Ynez had died the year before. Ironically, the man who had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> building things was principally remembered for the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

500|$|Andersen {{referred}} to [...] "The Snowman" [...] {{as a simple}} fairy tale, but the story {{may be viewed as}} a metaphor for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a common bond with Hamletboth grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alsion Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century calls his work an [...] "Aesop of 19th-century homosexuality". and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference. [...] "The Snowman" [...] is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong typewith the stove representing the danger in this [...] "wrong" [...] relationship. Andersen <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love. His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to masturbation as a sexual outlet, and one critic notes that [...] " [...] so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets." ...|$|E

Leiber describes him as [...] "slender and silver-haired", with a [...] "mocking sardonic note which has caused some to call him 'unpleasantly' rather than simply 'very' erudite."

5000|$|For anyone {{interested}} in wildlife or the natural resources of India this is an enthralling and informative book. For the animals themselves it may {{make all the difference}} between extermination and survival. Some of the noblest and most beautiful animals in the world {{are to be found in}} India.

He has sat in the open within ten feet of a lion, has fallen in front of a charging rhinoceros and he has a strange tale to tell of a bird mystery in Assam; but although it is full of good stories this is not a book of daring deeds. It is a unique panorama of the wildlife resources of India, her sanctuaries, the animals which inhabit them and the men who have done most to preserve them.|$|R

50|$|In 1961 Fredericks {{began to}} teach Greek, Italian, and Japanese {{literature}} at Bennington College, {{famous for the}} non-traditional, even radical, liberal-arts education it offered its students.

To him the books he taught from were living things which he had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lifetime</b> reading, studying, and thinking aboutâhe only taught works he lovedâand he brought that love, heavy with the weight of his own personal grappling with the texts, to bear in every class he taught over the course of more than thirty years. Fredericks also taught tutorials, to one or to several students, usually held in his second-floor corner office in the Commons Building at Bennington. In these tutorialsâin Greek, mostly, but in thesis tutorials as wellâ {{he would be able to}} cover in more detail, to concentrate more deeply, on a particular text, to answer a studentâs questions more thoroughly, and to guide his or her study more completely than when he was making a presentation to a large class. To generations of students, and to many of his own colleagues, Claude Fredericks seemed to exemplify all that Bennington stood for. He left Bennington in 1993.|$|R

60|$|So {{much for}} {{the facts and the}} possibilities. As for {{specific}} instances, years ago I found a deer just killed in the snow and beside him the fresh tracks of a big wolf, which had probably been frightened away at my approach. The deer was bitten just behind and beneath the left shoulder, and one long fang had entered the heart. There was not another scratch on the body, so far as I could discover. I thought this very exceptional at the time; but years afterwards my Indian guide in the interior of Newfoundland assured me that it was a common habit of killing caribou among the big white wolves with which he was familiar. To show that the peculiar habit is not confined to any one section, I quote here from the sworn statements of three other eyewitnesses.
