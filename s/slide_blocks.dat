5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to the two conventional theories described above, Ketner proposed that (1) left-lateral strike-slip faulting along the western margin of the North American continent, rather than plate convergence, was the engine of Paleozoic tectonics in the region; (2) the Roberts Mountains allochthon, as such, does not exist, and the Ordovician to Devonian western facies assemblage was deposited essentially in situ; and (3) blocks of shelf carbonate rocks earlier thought to be exposures of the shelf in windows of the Roberts Mountains allochthon are <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> from the carbonate shelf.

40|$|The {{relative}} positions {{between the}} four <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> {{vary with the}} movement of the table due to the geometric errors of the guide rail. Consequently, the additional load on the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> is increased. A new method of error measurement and identification by using a self-designed stress test plate was presented. BP neural network model was used to establish the mapping between the stress of key measurement points on the test plate and the displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks.</b> By measuring the stress, the relative displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were obtained, from which the geometric errors of the guide rails were converted. Firstly, the finite element model was built to find the key measurement points of the test plate. Then the BP neural network was trained by using the samples extracted from the finite element model. The stress at the key measurement points were taken as the input and the relative displacements of the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were taken as the output. Finally, the geometric errors of the two guide rails were obtained according to the measured stress. The results show that the maximum difference between the measured geometric errors and the output of BP neural network was 5 μm.

40|$|Rooted {{detachment}} faults and detachments beneath rootless <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> exhibit many similar structural characteristics. However, while rooted detachments {{are thought}} to penetrate into the midcrust and to accommodate significant crustal extension, rootless detachments break to the surface downdip and are not directly involved in such extension. Distinguishing between these two mechanically different kinds of structure {{is central to the}} assessment of extension magnitude. Here we examine deformation along the Mormon Peak detachment, a feature that has been cited as an example of both a rooted and a rootless structure. Located in the Mormon Mountains of southeastern Nevada, this detachment has been interpreted as one of three low‐angle normal faults of regional scale that together {{are thought to}} have accommodated more than 50 km of Basin and Range extension. For the most part, however, the Mormon Peak detachment is expressed as a series of isolated exposures where Paleozoic rocks are in brittle fault contact with nonmylonitized underlying rocks. Individual blocks contain high‐angle normal faults that terminate downward at their respective detachment surfaces, yielding a geometry common to both modes of emplacement. In order to test between these competing interpretations, we studied deformational characteristics close to the detachment surface, reasoning that a seismogenic fault ought to differ fundamentally from a surficial slide block, particularly if the slide block was emplaced in a single event rather than by protracted or episodic creep. An examination of the contact mapped as the Mormon Peak detachment reveals that the character of deformation is indistinguishable from that of known gravity‐driven <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> and is fundamentally different from that associated with seismically cycled faults. Moreover, the orientation of kinematic indicators observed at detachment surfaces is consistently close to the downdip direction, which in many places diverges strongly from the expected direction of movement in the rooted detachment model. We conclude that outcrops of the inferred upper plate of the Mormon Peak detachment represent an assemblage of individual rootless gravity‐driven <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> and not the erosional remnants of a formerly contiguous extensional allochthon. If similar misidentifications have been made elsewhere in the Basin and Range Province, total Cenozoic extension may have been significantly overestimated. Implications for the interpretation of extensional geology in general are far‐reaching...|$|E
40|$|The three {{dimensional}} {{surface movements}} of the retrogressive landslides at Beaver Creek were monitored from May, 1978 to August, 1979 using precise surveying techniques. A comprehensive, parametric, least squares adjustment computer program was developed {{to assist in the}} determination of the limit of accuracy, selection of the most desirable configuration and field procedure given the equipment available at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The computer program was also used in the subsequent· analysis of the field results, calculation of statistical accuracies and checking the reliability of the data. The study indicated that the rate of horizontal surface movement of the landslides increased from the scarp to the toe, with as much as 100 mm of surface movement occurring from May, 1978 to August, 1979. This observed movement agrees with the current retrogressive slide model. Vertical surface movement was as much as 30 mm downward in the same time period. <b>Slide</b> <b>blocks</b> near the scarp exhibited predominantly rotational movement whereas <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> near the toe exhibited predominantly translational movement. This observed behavior also agreed with the current retrogressive slide model. A seasonal trend in the rates of movement was also apparent suggesting a correlation between slide movement and environmental effects such as freeze-thaw, rainfall or river level. Surveying accuracies expressed in the form of 95 percent error elliptical cylinders were in the order of 7 mm horizontally and 2 mm vertically at distances of 150 metres. This accuracy was more than adequate considering the relatively large amount of slide movement. The techniques and procedures set forth in this study should be used as guidelines when employing surveying techniques in future geotechnical field investigations...|$|E
40|$|We report here mass transport-related {{disruption}} {{processes and}} their artifacts within sedimentary m??langes. The case studies include the early Oligocene wedge-top mass transport deposits {{in the northern}} Apennines (Italy) and the Eocene foredeep carbonate megabreccias from the south-central Pyrenees (Spain). These "chaotic" units commonly share a block-in-matrix fabric expressed by variously deformed <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> of different size, lithology, age and shape, embedded in a fine-grained matrix. Geophysical studies of modern continental margins have characterized many of these deposits, which, however, remain still relatively poorly described in term of meso-scale characteristics. The prominent feature of the analyzed mass transport deposits is the occurrence of an unsorted, strongly mixed, relatively fine-grained clastic matrix, infilling space between large clasts and blocks. This matrix shows either fluidal structures related to simple shear, or a structureless, homogeneous fabric, both probably related to liquefaction/fluidization processes and thus, to the internal strength of the mixed lithologies. We interpreted this phase as a liquefied mixture of water and sediment, characterized by high mobility due to overpressured conditions, as evidenced by both lateral and vertical injections. On a much larger scale this kind of matrix could represent the acoustically "transparent" facies separating <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> of many seismic examples. The inferred generating mechanism {{is that of a}} progressive soft sediment deformation, linked to different phases of submarine landslide evolution (i. e. failure, translation, accumulation and post-depositional stages), leading to an almost complete stratal disruption of involved bedded sequences, either within the slide mass and in the underlying substrate. In this framework the down-slope movement is favored by the development of ductile, overpressured shear zones, both internally and along the basal sliding horizon. Therefore, this matrix signature represents a possible discriminating factor to separate sedimentary and tectonic m??langes within accretionary systems and, moreover, to distinguish fast- from slow-rated generating processes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Seep-carbonates (13 C-depleted) {{are present}} at {{different}} levels within the Miocene terrigenous succession of Deruta (Marnoso-arenacea Formation, central Italy). They are associated with pebbly sandstones and conglomerates in a tectonically active fan-delta slope depositional system. Most of them are included in slide/slump horizons as scattered blocks. The occurrence of seep-carbonates is clear evidence of flow of methane-rich fluids pervading the sediments. Fluids, probably of biogenic origin, may have reached the sea-bottom through thrust faults and selectively infiltrated the more permeable coarse-grained horizons deposited along the slope. Different stages of fluid emissions are documented: slow flux stage, corresponding {{to the development of}} large carbonate bodies and dense chemosynthetic communities, and fast fluid flow associated with intense carbonate brecciation, pipes and veins. Large amounts of authigenic carbonates are reworked by slope failures triggered by tectonics and fluids reducing sediment strength; in situ cementation of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> may also have occurred due to remobilization of methane-rich fluids by mass-wasting processes...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring and {{analysis}} of hydrological parameters are crucial to understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of a landslide. This paper analyses hydrological parameters of an existing creeping landslide site in western Japan known as Nuta-Yone Landslide. The landslide site has been active since the last several decades. Attempts to retard the rate of landslide have been partially successful but several very expensive underground horizontal drains proved to be less effective or ineffective due to poor locations. Groundwater flow and resulting fluctuation of pore water pressures at the slip layer of a <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> of the landslide site were simulated by constructing a MODFLOW based three-dimensional groundwater flow model. The distributions of different parameters in the calibrated model were used to explain the reasons of ineffective drains and categorize locations for the drains that have higher potential of being effective. Local variations in pore water pressure fluctuations were used to pin-point the areas that needed dewatering. The groundwater flow model results were integrated with a two-dimensional slope stability analysis method to find local distribution of two-dimensional factor of safety within the <b>sliding</b> <b>block.</b> Fluctuation in quasi-three-dimensional factor of safety of the entire <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> was simulated by using various methods.

40|$|Metamorphic {{country rocks}} of the {{southern}} Sierra Nevada occur as isolated roof pendants and as the western wall of the batholith. Metasedimentary rocks are primarily Triassic to early Jurassic in age as shown by fossil dates in conjunction with field and petrographic data. The lower Mesozoic strata were deposited across a complex paleo-basement consisting of two contrasting terranes. The western terrane is exposed along the foothills and consists of the Kings-Kaweah ophiolite belt, a latest Paleozoic to possibly earliest Mesozoic remnant of disrupted oceanic lithosphere. This belt appears to represent an oceanic fracture zone complex that was transported northward into the region by large-scale wrench faulting. The eastern terrane {{which can only be}} inferred from petrochemical studies on the batholith, was sialic in character. It may also have been displaced by wrench faulting, but to a lesser degree. The zone of joining between the eastern continental terrane and the western oceanic terrane is termed the foothill suture. Lower Mesozoic strata deposited on the oceanic terrane consist of: (1) chert-argillite olistostromes containing exotic blocks of upper Permian limestone and occasional blocks of quartzitic sandstone; (2) quartzitic to sub-arkosic flysch; (3) olistostromes derived from ophiolite basement rocks; and (4) basalt-andesite volcanic rocks. Strata deposited on the continental terrane consist of: (1) Quartzose to sub-arkosic flysch; (2) Quartzlte-arglllite olistostromes with large <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> of shallow water limestone; (3) massive quartzitic to sub-arkosic sandstones, limestone and calcareous sandstones; and (4) silicic tuffs and ash flows. The flysch sequences of each terrane are apparently correlative. The eastern sequence contains a more proximal facies and the western sequence contains a more distal facies. The western facies flysch was partly reworked with chert-argillite into olistostromes. The early Mesozoic paleogeography of the region was apparently controlled by a complex plate juncture that involved both large-scale wrench movements and oblique subduction. The Triassic was characterized primarily by tectonic truncation of the continental margin by wrench faulting. North-northeast structural and stratigraphic trends typical of the Paleozoic were overprinted by northwest trends. The major wrench zone had a dextral sense of motion and extended through the truncated margin and into the oceanic domain. The southern extension of this zone was a large fracture zone which extended to the equatorial and possibly southern proto-Pacific. During northward transport of the fracture zone complex, <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> of shallow water limestone were acquired from an equatorial oceanic faunal belt. As the fracture zone complex moved into the proximity of the truncated margin, slices of the continental margin were differentially transported northward. Some fragments were displaced as far as southeastern Alaska. During Late Triassic to Early Jurassic time a submarine fan complex was shed off the truncated continental shelf and dispersed across the fracture zone complex. The sands of this fan complex are believed to be in part an extension of the Navajo- Aztec sands which accumulated on the ancient shelf. At about the same time a change in relative plate motions resulted in a convergent component along the complex plate juncture. The fracture zone complex was accreted as the hanging wall of an oblique subduction zone. Eruption of oceanic arc-type rocks along the western terrane and ignimbrites along the eastern terrane indicate the onset of subduction related magmatism. Both volcanic assemblages were interstratified with Navajo-Aztec affinity sands. During arc volcanism both terranes {{of the southern}} Sierra underwent differential northward transport by intra-arc wrench faulting which dissipated the strike-slip component of oblique subduction. Volcanic centers and the submarine fan complex were dismembered as they were built. <b>Slide</b> <b>blocks</b> of shallow water limestone and sandstone were shed off the shelf edge and reworked as olistostromes. Basement uplifts in the western terrane shed ophiolite assemblage olistostromes and triggered reworking of the chert-argillite olistostrome complex along with flysch...|$|E
40|$|In Etolia (Central Greece), {{west of the}} Parnassus/Vardoussia units, the Pindos {{succession}} crops out, {{with its}} higher formation: the Pindos Flysch. In its upper portion levels of debris flow deposits and <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> (olistostromes and olistoliths) contain ophiolitic material with fragments derived from the Parnassus/Vardussia formations. This ophiolitic material consists of serpentinites, basalts of WPB, E- and N-MOR affinity, and radiolarian cherts of Middle-Late Triassic and Middle-Late Jurassic age. Petrologic and biostratigraphic analyses confirm that the mélange has the same features of the sub-ophiolitic mélanges present {{at the base of}} the ophiolitic masses in Greece. Linked to the flysch, with contacts of unclear nature, a rhyolites body of Middle Triassic age indicates the continental nature of the Pindos Basin. In fact, here, as all over the Albanian-Greek section of the Dinarides, no record of an oceanic area in the central portion of the Dinarides exists: the Parnassus and Vardoussia units were directly thrust onto the Pindos Basin. The intercalations of ophiolitic and continent-derived material in the flysch, are interpreted as the forerunners of the Ophiolitie Nappe which, coming from the Vardar Ocean located to the east, reached during the Eocene the Pindos Basin...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{exploration}} methods, {{involving a}} combination of two-dimensional seismic profiles with cores and/or swath bathymetry/side-scan sonar, do not adequately sample all three spatial dimensions for true morphological mapping of submarine mass movement deposits. It is only with the acquisition of three-dimensional (3 D) seismic volumes that the complex 3 D nature of these features can be correctly imaged. Over the last 5 - 10 years, the interpretation of industry-scale 3 D seismic volumes from numerous continental shelf locations has allowed effective mapping of the deposit morphology. Features such as head scarps, side walls, extensional/compressional ridges, striations on the basal surface, translated blocks, and preservation/deformation of internal reflectors {{have been shown to}} constrain the direction and method of material transport. Here we demonstrate the application of these techniques to the shallow-water environment using decimeter-resolution 3 D seismic volumes, with case studies from Trondheimsfjorden (Norway) and Lake Windermere (UK Lake District). Through the mapping of top/base reflector morphologies, internal structure, translated blocks, and head scarps/side walls we demonstrate the same techniques can be used to differentiate flow mechanics (coherent <b>slide</b> <b>blocks,</b> slumped material, debris flows, and a mass flow) and quantify direction of motion at this radically different scale...|$|E

30|$|Mass {{transport}} deposits (MTDs) are {{the major}} components of depositional systems in deep-sea environments. For instance, when a large trench-type earthquake occurs in a subduction zone, {{it has the potential}} to initiate a large submarine mass transport process, which can in turn generate a hazardous tsunami (e.g., Gennesseaux et al. 1980; Ward 2001; Harbitz et al. 2006; Ogata et al. 2012; Festa et al. 2016). Understanding the development of MTDs is therefore an important goal for landslide hazard mitigation (e.g., Morgan et al. 2009). The concept of mass transport deposits contains a broad spectrum of depositional facies, including undeformed <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> facies, slump facies composed of folded and boudinaged successions, and debris flow facies characterized by block-in-matrix structures. Among these MTD facies, this study aims to understand the formative processes of the debris-flow type facies, focusing on a role of excess pore pressure in the flow. Various field observations of modern examples and outcrops have suggested that fluid overpressure represents the most significant mechanism to account for the long run-out and the high velocity of mass transport events (e.g., Canals et al. 2004). Here, we try to measure the extent of this excess pore pressure from outcrops by quantitative textural analysis.|$|E

Sliding events a d related tsunamis are one of the major hazards of this kind of volcanic activity, in an intraplate oceanic context. The submarine flank of Piton de la Fournaise has been extensively studied using Seabeam bathymetry and high resolution side-scan sonar images. The eastern submarine flank is entirely covered by 550 km 3 of landslide deposits, which are mainly subaerially erupted basaltic lavas, transported and fractured in large-scale mass wasting. Volumetric considerations imply recurrent partial destruction of the edifice, by landsliding, during its construction.

Troctolites, olivine gabbronorites and anorthosites were also recovered. Relics of primary textures as well as mineral and bulk-rock compositional variations indicate a comagmatic intrusive origin for the protoliths of the mafic granulites. This intrusive mafic complex underwent a subsolidus reequilibration under granulite facies conditions, at 0. 6 - 0. 9 GPa and 810 - 920 °C, and was derived from crystallization at intermediate levels of tholeiite-derived liquids, possibly affected by crustal contamination.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Liquefaction-induced lateral {{spreading}} deformations can pose significant risks to bridge pile foundations, underground utilities, and shallow foundation systems, particularly at sites in seismically active areas near embankments and levees, {{in close proximity}} to natural or man-made free faces. Current approaches for {{lateral spreading}} predictions, consisting primarily of empirical models and strain potential methods, largely neglect complex and critical factors that influence such deformations, such as nonlinear dynamic site response, dilation pulses, void redistribution, and water film formation, as well as complex two- or three-dimensional topographic effects. It has also been proposed by several researchers that lateral spreading predictions can be potentially approximated using Newmark-type rigid block analyses, with an appropriate reduction in the yield acceleration to account for soil liquefaction. The appropriateness of the Newmark-type framework in lateral spread characterization was assessed in this study. Particular focus was placed on characterizing any potential structural biases inherent to the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> framework, including those related to the assumption of strain concentration along a discrete failure plane and rigid dynamic behavior, as well as practical issues related to the uncertainty in <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> displacement predictions, and how the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> method compares to other approaches currently in use for predicting lateral spreading displacements. When evaluating solely the effects of the assumption of a discrete failure surface, <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> analyses predicted displacements on the order of 30 to 70 % lower than displacements predicted using simple dynamic analyses of a soil continuum. Further analyses showed that, when compared to both finite-element methods used for liquefaction modeling and established lateral spreading empirical models, <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> methods largely failed to predict substantial deformations over a broad range of lateral spreading conditions, and have the potential to be highly un-conservative in characterizing lateral spreading hazards in general...|$|R
