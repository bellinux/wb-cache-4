The completed {{test facility}} consisted of two systems: 1) the feed-air system, which simulated the inlet-air conditions and performed the feed-air dehumidification and <b>sensible</b> <b>cooling</b> and 2) the vacuum system, which enabled the feed-air dehumidification by evacuating the membrane permeate side. The feed-air system as constructed was able to supply membrane-inlet flow rates up to 10 scfm over a range of temperature and relative humidity conditions, including 90 ?F and 90 %RH, which was specified by the project sponsor. In addition, the feed-air system components included a membrane module installation site for dehumidification as well as a <b>sensible</b> <b>cooling</b> system to cool the membrane-outlet air to the 55 ?F and 50 %RH conditions again specified by the sponsor. Measurement stations were placed at the membrane-inlet, membrane-outlet, and the <b>sensible</b> <b>cooler</b> outlet to measure the temperature and relative humidity at these critical locations. The vacuum system as built used a Pfeiffer DUO 10 Vacuum Pump with a 7 cfm pumping capacity, which was preceded by a 60 plate heat exchanger with an effective area of 2. 05 m^(2) and an Oerlikon-Leybold WA 250 roots blower. The air leakage in the vacuum system was calculated to be less than 1 % of the theoretical air permeation through the membrane module. Finally, the apparatus was constructed with the capability of measuring the power consumption of the equipment used for the dehumidification and <b>sensible</b> <b>cooling</b> process. The functionality of the test facility was demonstrated through preliminary testing of the membrane module and the operation of the complete cooling system.

Materials and methods: Multipolar RFA with three bipolar RFA applicators was performed ex vivo in porcine liver (applicator distance 20 [*]mm, energy input 40 [*]kJ). A saline-perfused glass tube (‘vessel’) was placed parallel to the applicators in order to simulate a natural liver vessel. Five applicator-to-vessel geometries were tested. A liquid-filled glass tube without perfusion was used as a dry run. Ablations were orthogonally cut to the applicators at a defined height. <b>Cooling</b> <b>effects</b> were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively along these cross sectional areas. Results: Thirty-six ablations were performed. A <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> could be seen in all ablations with perfused vessels compared to the dry run.

When such cooling water is generated at low approach conditions (2 – 5 K), at the higher temperatures required in these systems (14 – 18 °C), very high levels of availability result. In many north western European locations the levels of availability are such that the prospect of supplanting rather than simply supplementing the refrigeration system, for <b>sensible</b> <b>cooling</b> purposes, arises.
