60|$|Our {{readers will}} perhaps already have {{gathered}} from the foregoing portrait of the German peasant that Riehl {{is not a man}} who looks at objects through the spectacles either of the doctrinaire or the dreamer; and they will be ready to believe what he tells us in his Preface, namely, that years ago he began his wanderings over the hills and plains of Germany for the sake of obtaining, in immediate intercourse with the people, that completion of his historical, political, and economical studies which he was unable to find in books. He began his investigations with no party prepossessions, and his present views were evolved entirely from his own gradually amassed observations. He was, first of all, a pedestrian, and only in the second place a political author. The views at which he has arrived by this inductive process, he sums up in the term—social-political-conservatism; but his conservatism is, we conceive, of a thoroughly philosophical kind. He sees in European society incarnate history, and any attempt to disengage it from its historical elements must, he believes, be simply destructive of social vitality. {164} What has grown up historically can only die out historically, by the gradual operation of necessary laws. The external conditions which society has inherited from the past are but the manifestation of inherited internal conditions in the human beings who compose it; the internal conditions and the external are related to each other as the organism and its medium, and development can take place only by the gradual consentaneous development of both. Take the familiar example of attempts to abolish titles, which have been about as effective as the process of cutting off poppy-heads in a cornfield. Jedem Menschem, says Riehl, ist sein Zopf angeboren, warum soll denn der sociale Sprachgebrauch nicht auch sein Zopf haben?—which we may render—“As long as snobism runs in the blood, why should it not run in our speech?” As a necessary preliminary to a purely rational society, you must obtain purely rational men, free from the sweet and bitter prejudices of hereditary affection and antipathy; which is as easy as to get running streams without springs, or the leafy shade of the forest without the <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> of trunk and branch.|$|E

In our recent publications, we showed that requesting the gauge invariance in the local observable universe to the initial state guarantees the infrared (IR) regularity of loop corrections in a general single clock inflation.

40|$|Evolution {{of stellar}} bars in disk galaxies is {{accompanied}} by dynamical instabilities and secular changes. Following the vertical buckling instability, the bars are known to weaken dramatically and develop a pronounced boxy/peanut shape when observed edge-on. Using high-resolution N-body simulations of stellar disks embedded in live axisymmetric dark matter halos, we have investigated the long-term changes in the bar morphology, specifically {{the evolution of the}} bar size, its vertical structure and exchange of angular momentum. We find that following the initial buckling, the bar resumes its growth from deep inside the corotation radius and follows the Ultra-Harmonic resonance thereafter. We also find that this <b>secular</b> bar <b>growth</b> triggers a spectacular secondary vertical buckling instability which leads to the appearance of characteristic boxy/peanut/X-shaped bulges. The <b>secular</b> bar <b>growth</b> is crucial for the recurrent buckling to develop. Furthermore, the secondary buckling is milder, persists over a substantial period of time, ~ 3 Gyr, and can have observational counterparts. Overall, the stellar bars show recurrent behavior in their properties and evolve by increasing their linear and vertical extents, both dynamically and secularly. We also demonstrate explicitly that the prolonged growth of the bar is mediated by continuous angular momentum transfer from the disk to the surrounding halo, and that this angular momentum redistribution is resonant in nature [...] a large number of lower resonances trap disk and halo particles and this trapping is robust, in a broad agreement with the earlier results in the literature.

40|$|Abstract: Roger Garrison (2001) {{provides}} a welcome diagrammatic exposition of Austrian, capital-based macroeconomics. The exposition attempts to account {{not only for}} Austrian Business Cycles (ABCs), but also for long-run, <b>secular</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>Secular</b> <b>growth</b> is a focus of mainstream growth theory that has arguably been neglected by Austrian analysis. However, Salerno (2001) argues {{that the type of}} <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> described by Garrison (2001, p. 54) is implausible. He argues that, in the absence of technological or institutional change, time preferences must be falling over time for net capital accumulation to be sustainable. This paper outlines a capital-based theory of <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> based on the consideration of intangible capital. The nonrivalrous nature of intangible capital goods allows for external effects. The technology becomes available to firms and individuals that (a) are not forced to wait through the innovative stages of production and (b) do not compensate those firms and individuals that do. Furthermore, (c) innovative stages of production may be viewed not only as aimed towards the production of consumption goods, but also towards further innovation—“standing on the shoulders of giants. ” The theory presented here reconciles Garrison's exposition to the Salerno critique. It also {{provides a}} bridge between many insights of mainstream,endogenous growth theory and Austrian, capital-based macroeconomics. Andrew Youn...|$|E

Rothbard (2009, p. 11) Andrew Young (2009) suggests a capital-based theory for <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> that is consistent with Austrian capital theory. He argues that investment in intangible capital can create <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> through a combination of external effects (because intangible capital is nonrivalrous), and opening paths for further innovation (“standing on the shoulders of giants”). In reality, all that is required for <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> is that some form of nondepreciating capital is produced. So, the central insight from Young (p. 49) —that “technological change [is] the output of intangible investments and, therefore, a capital-based engine of sustainable secular growth”—is stronger and simpler than Young suggests. To demonstrate this, I will present two examples styled after Salerno (2001). Suppose Robinson Crusoe has 24 hours a day in which to fish. With his current state of knowledge and with items that are freely available on his island, he can catch 1 fish per hour—giving a total income of 24 fish per day. He chooses to spend part of this income on various leisure activities (like sleep), so he doesn’t necessarily catch 24 fish per day. Also, his time preference implies that he saves 12. 5 percent of his income, and this “saving ” is in the form of spending time working on some sort of investment. Consider two different investments: one in depreciating capital (a net), and one in nondepreciating capital (an idea for a more efficient fishing method).

The current study assessed the <b>secular</b> change in <b>growth</b> in Japanese children and adolescents aged between 6 and 17 years {{using data from the}} School Health Statistics Survey conducted between 1900 and 2000 with consideration of key social changes during the 20 th Century.

Because the self-force is small, one can often approximate the motion as geodesic.

It is less well known that this failure at large times translates to a failure at large distances as well. At second perturbative order, two large-distance pathologies arise: spurious <b>secular</b> <b>growth</b> and infrared-divergent retarded integrals.

40|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{naturally occurring}} pressure anisotropies facilitate in- stabilities {{that are expected}} to modify the transport properties of the system. In this thesis we examine two such instabilities and, where appropriate, their effects on transport. First we consider the collisional (fluid) magnetized magnetorotational instability (MRI) {{in the presence of the}} Braginskii viscosity. We conduct a global linear analysis of the instability in a galactic rotation profile for three magnetic field configurations: purely azimuthal, purely vertical and slightly pitched. Our analysis, numerical and asymptotic, shows that the first two represent singular configurations where the Braginskii viscosity’s primary role is dissipative and the maximum growth rate is proportional to the Reynolds number when this is small. For a weak pitched field, the Braginskii viscosity is destabilising and when its effects dominate over the Lorentz force, the growth rate of the MRI can be up to 2 √ 2 times faster than the inviscid limit. If the field is strong, an over-stability develops and both the real and imaginary parts of the frequency increase with the coefficient of the viscosity. Second, in the context of the ICM of galaxy clusters, we consider the pressure-anisotropy-driven firehose instability. The linear instability is fast (∼ ion cyclotron period) and small-scale (ion Larmor radius ρi) and so fluid theory is inapplicable. We determine its nonlinear evolution in an ab initio kinetic calculation (for parallel gradients only). We use a particular physical asymptotic ordering to derive a closed nonlinear equation for the firehose turbulence, which we solve. We find <b>secular</b> (∝ t) <b>growth</b> of magnetic fluctuations and a k−∥ 3 spectrum, starting at scales >~ ρi. When a parallel ion heat flux is present, the parallel firehose instability mutates into the new gyrothermal instability. Its nonlinear evolution also involves <b>secular</b> magnetic energy <b>growth,</b> but its spectrum is eventually dominated by modes with a maximal scale ∼ρilT/λmfp,(lT is the parallel temperature gradient scale).

Motivated by these results, I present theoretical rates and physical properties of binary stars that can produce accretion-induced collapse. The rates are presented for various types of host galaxies (e. g. old ellipticals versus spirals) and are differentiated by the donor star type (e. g. large giant star versus compact helium-rich donor). Results presented in this thesis may help to guide near-future electromagnetic transient search campaigns to find likely candidates for accretion-induced collapse events. My predictions are based on binary evolution calculations that include the most recent updates on mass accretion and <b>secular</b> mass <b>growth</b> of white dwarfs. I find that the most likely systems that undergo accretion-induced collapse consist of an ONeMg white dwarf with a Hertzsprung gap star or a red giant companion.

By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we find that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first rule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant source for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we explore variations in star formation history to explain the colour gradients. As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early <b>secular</b> evolution (<b>growth)</b> phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out quenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer regions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour gradients in NUV-u and u-i colours. We further distinguish them using an additional constraint provided by the u-i colour gradient distribution, under the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which the inner region has a shorter e-folding time scale in the growth phase than the outer region.
