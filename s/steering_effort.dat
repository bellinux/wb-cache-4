25|$|Power {{steering}} is {{a system}} for reducing the <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> on vehicles by using an external power source to assist in turning the roadwheels. In 1926, Francis W. Davis of Waltham, Massachusetts invented power steering.|$|E
2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E
2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} of {{real-time}} surveys is in directional drilling. For the directional driller {{to steer the}} well towards a target zone, he must know where the well is going, and what the effects of his <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> are.|$|R
5000|$|Violent {{clashes between}} Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims followed. Prime Minister Nehru and deputy prime {{minister}} Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel invited Mountbatten to continue as Governor General of India. He was replaced in June 1948 by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. Patel took on the responsibility of bringing into the Indian Union 565 princely states, <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> by his [...] "iron fist in a velvet glove" [...] policies, exemplified {{by the use of}} military force to integrate Junagadh and Hyderabad State into India (Operation Polo).

40|$|Abstract — We {{have built}} a fuzzy {{autonomous}} car control system for navigating bends as smoothly as possible. To get the optimal parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy control system, we {{have built a}} genetic algorithm application that runs our simulator thousands of times, minimizing the <b>effort</b> made on <b>steering,</b> and maintaining an acceptable path error. We have used a high mutant rate genetic algorithm (that we call radioactive environment evolution) with a fitness function having two objectives. The results are impressive: the <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> when the vehicle is entering the bend are drastically reduced and the <b>steering</b> correction <b>efforts</b> inside the bends have disappeared. Although we have achieved such good results, {{it is important to}} remember that they are simulator based. We are now testing this control on real autonomous cars with relatively good results. However, we hope to achieve better real results as we improve our simulation program. I...|$|R
50|$|Power {{steering}} helps drivers steer by augmenting the driver's <b>steering</b> <b>effort.</b> Power steering {{has used}} hydraulics to reduce a driver's <b>steering</b> <b>effort.</b> However, hydraulic steering is {{being replaced by}} electric power steering, because it eliminates the hydraulic pump, and increases fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|In automobiles, power {{steering}} (also power-assisted steering (PAS) or steering assist system) helps drivers steer by augmenting <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> {{of the steering}} wheel.|$|E
50|$|When <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> {{is applied}} {{at the wheel}} it is {{transmitted}} to the rotor, which transmits the effort to the hour glass cam {{by means of the}} torsion bar. The rotor is normally centred in its sleeve by the torsion bar but manual <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> twists the torsion bar, permitting the rotor to turn within its sleeve, opening the way for hydraulic fluid pressure to be applied to one or other side of the servo piston, thus assisting in turning the front wheels.|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} distribution of Physalia physalis (L.) (the Portuguese man-of-war), a wind-propelled jellyfish-like animal on sea-surface waters, {{is a much}} discussed but poorly understood phenomenon. The radically different courses sailed by the two mirror-image forms of this organism appear to result from simply their need for maximum dispersion by the winds on the earth's warmer seas. Study reveals, however, that the two forms of P. physalis sail different mirror-image courses and gain separate access to upwelling, diverging sea-surface waters that probably contain their major food. These courses are sailed without obvious <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> by the animals. Thus the wind-induced pattern of motion of the waters appears to have markedly influenced the animal's form and sailing courses. Their behavior apparently results from their natural involuntary use of steering effects of two wind induced surface-water motions...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} known about <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> by {{university}} leaders {{with regard to}} teaching and learning. In this conceptual paper the focus lies on Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETLs) {{as an instrument of}} governance to steer teaching and learning activities in universities. The question how CETLs can be best understood as an instrument of governance in universities will be investigated. After having presented some ‘managerialist’ technologies of governing teaching and learning I will present two national initiatives that funded CETLs. The paper will draw on empirical examples of Germany and England in order to illustrate the governance instruments of CETLs. The paper concludes that on the conceptual level, managerialism can be one perspective to understand CETLs as a governing technology. It can be argued that CETLs inherit several features of managerialism, and therefore can be best understood as a managerialist technology in governing teaching and learning at universitie...|$|R
40|$|The article {{assesses the}} {{empirical}} veracity of the frequently heard thesis that strict embryo research laws can hinder innovation in embryo and stem cell research, and thereby impede the innovative {{ability of the}} medical biotech sector. Based on a comparative study of the OECD countries, and case-study material, the article argues that this thesis can only partly be confirmed. Strict embryo research laws {{are associated with a}} lower innovation quota in stem cell research. But this correlation mostly reflects stable structural differences between national innovation systems rather than dynamics triggered by policy measures. Permissive embryo research laws are not automatically associated with an innovative biotechnology sector, and the innovativeness sometimes is a partly unintended consequence, rather than the result of an active political strategy. The results of the analysis caution against undue simplified theses on the impact regulation can have on the innovative ability of national economies. If there are impacts of embryo research laws on the innovative ability of the biotech sector, they will be visible only in the long term. Shortterm political <b>steering</b> <b>efforts</b> have to be judged very sceptically...|$|R

50|$|Most new {{vehicles}} now have power steering, {{owing to the}} trends toward front wheel drive, greater vehicle mass, and wider tires, which all increase the required <b>steering</b> <b>effort.</b> Heavier vehicles, as are common in some countries, would be extremely difficult to maneuver at low speeds, while vehicles of lighter weight may not need power assisted steering at all.|$|E
40|$|The tiny {{brains of}} insects presumably impose {{significant}} computational limitations on algorithms controlling their behavior. Nevertheless, they perform fast and sophisticated visual maneuvers. This includes tracking features composed of second order motion, {{in which the}} feature is defined by higher-order image statistics, but not simple correlations in luminance. Flies can track the true direction of even theta motions, in which the first-order (luminance) motion is directed opposite the second order moving feature. We exploited this paradoxical feature tracking response to dissect the particular image properties that flies use to track moving objects. We find that theta motion detection {{is not simply a}} result of steering towards any spatially restricted flicker. Rather, our results show that fly high-order feature tracking responses can be broken down into positional and velocity components [...] -in other words, the responses can be modeled as a superposition of two independent <b>steering</b> <b>efforts.</b> We isolate these elements to show that each has differing influence on phase and amplitude of steering responses, and together they explain the time course of second order motion tracking responses during flight. These observations are relevant to natural scenes, where moving features can be much more complex...|$|R

The car also features Ford's new Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise <b>steering,</b> increased <b>effort</b> on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers.

50|$|Hydraulic power {{steering}} systems for cars augment <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> via an actuator, a hydraulic cylinder {{that is part}} of a servo system. These systems have a direct mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the linkage that steers the wheels. This means that power-steering system failure (to augment effort) still permits the vehicle to be steered using manual effort alone.|$|E
50|$|The {{major benefit}} of the Hydrosteer system is {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> required of the driver, particularly at low road speeds or when a lot of turning is involved. Also, the Hydrosteer system was fully integrated into the steering box with no external jacks, giving it an advantage over earlier systems with external jacks, which needed more space and were heavier.|$|E
50|$|Off-road {{vehicles}} such as agricultural tractors generally use positive camber.

40|$|This project aims at {{studying}} the designing {{of the steering}} system of an ATV (All Terrain Vehicle). The steering system is the most vital element in any automobile. It helps the driver in obtaining complete control on the manoeuvring of the vehicle. Since the steering system is directly operated by the driver {{it is essential to}} take human comfort into consideration while designing the <b>steering.</b> The <b>effort</b> required by the driver in handling the steering is an important factor. The steering system is in direct contact with the tyres hence it is subjected to extensive forces. Hence it is imperative that the design is tested for failure under such conditions. In this project we have modified the steering system implemented in Maruti Suzuki Esteem to meet our design requirements. We have successfully tested our steering mechanism in the ATV (All Terrain Vehicle) fabricated in the workshop by obtaining values from the various calculations we performed. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Champ, {{unlike most}} American pickups of the 1960s, was never offered with power steering, {{although}} {{such a system}} was offered on Studebaker's heavier-duty Studebaker Transtar and Diesels. The final [...] "8E" [...] (1963-64) models had an improved steering system that reduced friction and, thus, <b>steering</b> <b>effort,</b> {{but not to the}} degree that power steering would have.

5000|$|An {{analysis}} of the onboard camera video was submitted by Cineca, which tracked {{the movement of the}} steering wheel during the race. Having rotated in a fixed arc during the previous laps, during the final seconds a yellow button on the wheel moved several centimetres away from its normal trajectory, with the steering wheel tilting in its own plane, indicating a breaking steering column. Williams introduced its own video to prove the movement was normal in which David Coulthard manhandled an FW16B <b>steering</b> wheel, the <b>effort</b> required to deflect the wheel termed as [...] "quite considerable".

5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the <b>steering</b> centering <b>effort</b> rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|R

50|$|A {{steering}} quickener is used {{to modify}} the steering ratio of factory-installed steering system, which in turn modifies the response time and overall handling of vehicle. When a steering quickener is employed in an automobile, {{the driver of the}} automobile can turn the steering wheel a smaller degree compared to a factory-installed steering system without a steering quickener, to turn the vehicle through same distance. On the other hand, the <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> needed will greatly increase. If the automobile is equipped with power steering, overloading the power steering pump can also be a concern.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{scrub radius}} {{decreases}} torque steer and improves {{stability in the}} event of brake failure. SLA suspensions usually have a positive scrub radius. With this suspension, the scrub radius is not adjustable. The greater the scrub radius (positive or negative), the greater the <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> and the more road shock and pivot binding that takes place. When the vehicle has been modified with offset wheels, larger tires, height adjustments and side to side camber differences, the scrub radius will be changed and the handling and stability of the vehicle will be affected.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to analyze whether TLC might enlarge our understanding of the relation between vehicle handling characteristics and a driver's look-ing and lateral control strategy in a straight-lane-keeping task. Earlier results indicated that in the case of a normally understeering car, drivers accept occlusion periods that correlate highly with TLC. The present study shows that drivers are well able to maintain this strategy with a more heavily understeering vehicle. However, the adaptation to the characteristics of an oversteering vehicle is far less accurate. Although drivers devote considerable <b>steering</b> and looking <b>effort</b> to control such a vehicle, it appears that this compensation process is insuffi-cient and results in very low TLC levels at high speeds...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{nanoscale}} {{processing and}} simulation {{have led to}} the capability to directly control the mechanical properties of a material through change of its structural makeup at the nanoscale. A novel class of mechanomutable materials in which mechanical properties can be both tunable and reversible via in situ modifications of a material’s nanostructure through stimuli such as pH, light, or electrical fields provides a promising strategy to develop stimuli-responsive polymer-composites. Here we report atomistic-level molecular dynamics (MD) studies, used to investigate the tunable adhesion properties of a polyelectrolyte complex consisting of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) to elucidate the complexation and electrostatic cross-linking behavior of the constituent polymers of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) systems. To accommodate a link between experimental and simulation results, a rate dependence investigation of the adhesion strength is undertaken to reconcile the time-scale limitations of atomistic simulations. A comparison with Atomic Force Microscopy experiments is provided, showing good agreement with simulation results. To investigate potential mutability of the system, we perform a systematic variation of the percent ionization of each constituent polymer. The ultimate strength of adhesion for the aligned polymers is shown to range from approximately 15 nN to 40 nN for an equivalent pH range of pH 2. 5 to pH 10. Theoretical regimes of ionization extend the adhesion strength range from 8 nN to 45 nN, displaying the potential application of tunable, mechanomutable PAA/PAH systems.

40|$|Haptic {{guidance}} {{systems support}} the operator in task execution using additional {{forces on the}} input device. Scaling of the guidance forces determines the control authority of the support system. As task complexity may vary, one level of the guidance scaling may be insufficient, and adaptation of the control authority may be helpful. The available literature mostly proposed to adapt the authority based on external cues (e. g. actual performance or safety) and the user had no direct way to modulate the desired level of support. In this paper we investigated a variable authority guidance scheme based on the user grip force. During a user study (with 8 subjects) we explored two opposite approaches to trade the control authority (i. e. increasing or decreasing guidance force magnitude with increased user grip). To simulate increased task difficulty and imperfections of the haptic guidance system, at random times either an unpredictable force disturbance was added or subjects were presented with incorrect guidance. While the performance differences between the fixed- and the variable-authority schemes were not significant, the "decreasing guidance with increased user grip" scheme allowed to substantially reduce the user control <b>effort</b> (<b>steering</b> force), especially when the guidance system was incorrect. The presented method essentially provides additional control over the guidance system without reducing the performance...|$|R
