5|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994. They are mostly <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences isolated {{from a large}} pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which {{have been used to}} detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in living cells.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses — a {{group that}} {{includes}} the circoviruses, the geminiviruses, the parvoviruses and others — and also the many phages and plasmids that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) {{or one of the}} DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a tyrosine residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand.|$|E
25|$|A {{restriction}} enzyme is an enzyme that cuts double-stranded or <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> at specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites. Such enzymes, found in bacteria and archaea, {{are thought to}} have evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the {{restriction enzyme}}s selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction; host DNA is methylated by a modification enzyme to protect it from the restriction enzyme's activity. The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded, in 1978, to Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber, and Hamilton O. Smith for the discovery of restriction endonucleases.|$|E
50|$|During mitosis, tiny {{fragments}} of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> naturally occur inside the cell. Enzymes find {{and destroy the}} “scrap” DNA. The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> “scrap” <b>DNA.</b> A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> {{to be less than}} completely effective. The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> to build up in the cell. The buildup of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal.|$|R

Previously a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> ele-ment of the mouse opioid receptor gene (Oprm 1) proxi-mal promoter {{was found to be}} important for regulating Oprm 1 in neuronal cells. To identify proteins binding to the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> element as potential regulators for Oprm 1, affinity column chromatography with the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> element was performed using neuroblastoma NS 20 Y cells followed by two-dimensional gel electrophore-sis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We identified five poly(C) -binding proteins: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucle-oprotein (hnRNP) K, -complex proteins (CP) CP 1, CP 2, CP 2 -KL, and CP 3.

30|$|These agents impair proper DNA repair by {{inhibiting}} PARP (Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) {{that has}} {{a key role in}} “base excision repair (BER), through which <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> damage is repaired. DNA poly adenosil ribosilation (PAR) is a key pathway where gathering all the machinery needed for reparation where <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> is damaged (Marchetti et al. 2015; Lord and Ashworth 2012; Li and Yu 2015; Mukhopadhyay et al. 2011, Chionh et al. 2011; Schreiber et al. 2006).|$|R
25|$|Eukaryotic DNA {{replication}} requires precise {{coordination of}} all DNA polymerases and associated proteins {{to replicate the}} entire genome each time a cell divides. This process is achieved {{through a series of}} steps of protein assemblies at origins of replication, mainly focusing the regulation of DNA replication on the association of the MCM helicase with the DNA. These origins of replication direct the number of protein complexes that will form to initiate replication. In prokaryotic DNA replication regulation focuses on the binding of the DnaA initiator protein to the DNA, with initiation of replication occurring multiple times during one cell cycle. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA use ATP binding and hydrolysis to direct helicase loading and in both cases the helicase is loaded in the inactive form. However, eukaryotic helicases are double hexamers that are loaded onto double stranded DNA whereas prokaryotic helicases are single hexamers loaded onto <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{dimerized}} λ gam binds to {{the host}} RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases, inhibiting all of their known activities, which prevents degradation of the linear foreign DNA. λ exo binds to double stranded linear transformed DNA and processively degrades it in a 5’ to 3’ direction. Exo is a globular, trimeric protein that forms a ring shape with a hollow center that positions the linear DNA for cleavage. One side of the ring {{is large enough to}} admit double stranded DNA, but the other end can only accommodate <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA,</b> therefore providing details into the exo mechanism of action. This process results in single stranded 3’ overhangs on the linear DNA. Subsequently, λ beta, a member of a recombinase family, binds to the 3’ overhangs and mediates annealing to the complementary E. coli DNA. This process occurs through invasion of the single stranded 3’ overhang into the complementary target DNA on the lagging strand during DNA synthesis, allowing beta-facilitated annealing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} pathway, only the {{nuclease}} FEN1 is involved. FEN1 cleaves the short [...] "flaps" [...] (or short sections of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> that [...] "hang off" [...] because their nucleotide bases are prevented from binding to their complementary base pair—despite any base pairing downstream) immediately when they form. While this pathway can process basically all flaps, {{an issue with}} this pathway is that some flaps may escape cleavage and thus become long. These flaps then bind to replication protein A (RPA) which inhibits FEN1 cleavage.|$|E

2500|$|He {{then turned}} to {{sequencing}} DNA, which would require an entirely different approach. He looked at different ways of using DNA polymerase I from E. coli to copy <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> In 1975, together with Alan Coulson, he published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the [...] "Plus and Minus" [...] technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, his group were able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174. This was the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. To their surprise they discovered that the coding regions {{of some of the}} genes overlapped with one another.|$|E

This method begins with the preparation of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments. This process is repeated until full length <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> is obtained.|$|E

The partial amino acid compositions for P 16 and the DNA-binding fragment were obtained by conventional methods. Analysis of subcellular fractions revealed that {{nearly all of the}} cellular P 16 was located in the mitochondria and that only trace amounts of protein of comparable electrophoretic mobility could be isolated from the nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions. The labeling of P 16 with [35 S]methionine in primary rat hepatocyte cultures was inhibited by more than 90 % by the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor cycloheximide, but unaffected by the mitochondrial-specific agent chloramphenicol. These results indicate that P 16 is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported into the mitochondria. The addition of purified P 16 to deproteinized mitochondrial DNA resulted in the complete protection of the labeled nascent strands of displacement loops against branch migrational loss during cleavage of parental DNA with SstI, thus providing strong evidence that P 16 is the single entity required for this in vitro function.
