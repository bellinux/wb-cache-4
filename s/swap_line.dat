40|$|After 2007, {{financial}} market turmoil began and shortage of dollar funding liquidity disrupted {{not only the}} US dollar funding market but also overseas. To address the shortage of dollar liquidity, the FED introduced <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> with systematic important central banks, including emerging markets. The paper discusses the main feature of the FED’s <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the context of}} the funding pressures on the FX swap market. The main objective of the paper is to reveal technical aspects and effectiveness of the <b>swap</b> <b>lines.</b> The paper explains connectivity between un/secured money markets and the FX swap market during the financial and debt crises. The FX swap market was hit significantly. During the liquidity crisis of 2007 – 2010, the main driver of the deviation from covered interest parity was a shortage of dollar liquidity jointly with counterparty risk. During the debt crisis, the main driver was counterparty risk of the euro zone banks and sovereigns. The FED <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> were used as a liquidity backstop. The paper concludes that the <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> were an effective tool of cooperation between central banks and significantly alleviated the pressure on the FX swap market. In addition, the <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> were flexible, supported financial stability, no losses were recorded, the problem of adverse selection was avoided and exit was successful. Finally, the <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> have become a permanent tool for solving temporary shortages of foreign currency liquidity in national banking systems...|$|R

Subsequently, the FOMC authorized liquidity <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> with additional central banks.

50|$|When {{a foreign}} central bank draws on its <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> to fund its dollar tender operations, it pays {{interest}} to the Federal Reserve in an amount equal to the interest the foreign central bank earns on its tender operations. The Federal Reserve holds the foreign currency that it acquires in the swap transaction at the foreign central bank (rather than lending it or investing it in private markets) and does not pay interest.

50|$|Like {{many other}} countries, Russia's economy {{suffered}} during the Great Recession. Following the Crimean Crisis, several countries (including most of NATO) imposed sanctions on Russia, hurting the Russian economy by cutting off access to capital. At the same time, the global {{price of oil}} declined. The combination of Western sanctions and the falling crude price in 2014 and thereafter, which was widely seen in Russia as a US-Saudi plot against it, resulted in the ongoing 2014-15 Russian financial crisis.

50|$|These swaps involve two transactions. When {{a foreign}} central bank draws on its <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> with the Federal Reserve, the foreign central bank sells a {{specified}} amount of its currency to the Federal Reserve {{in exchange for}} dollars at the prevailing market exchange rate. The Federal Reserve holds the foreign currency in an account at the foreign central bank. The dollars that the Federal Reserve provides are deposited in an account that the foreign central bank maintains at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the same time, the Federal Reserve and the foreign central bank enter into a binding agreement for a second transaction that obligates the foreign central bank to buy back its currency on a specified future date at the same exchange rate. The second transaction unwinds the first. At {{the conclusion of the}} second transaction, the foreign central bank pays interest, at a market-based rate, to the Federal Reserve.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{focuses on}} the U. S. Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s {{controversial}} practice of loaning U. S. dollars to foreign central banks, which the foreign central banks {{then turn around and}} loan to institutions in their jurisdictions. The Federal Reserve does not know the identity of these recipient institutions. Nevertheless, these loans-termed 2 ̆ 2 swap lines 2 ̆ 2 -provide foreign financial institutions the type of financial stability that the U. S. Federal Reserve was created to provide for U. S. banks during times of crises. During the financial crisis, the U. S. Federal Reserve arranged swap lines with 14 foreign central banks for a total amount of 583 billion, making it the de facto international lender of last resort. In December 2012, the U. S. Federal Reserve once again extended the duration of its <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> function. In this Article, I argue that because of U. S. dollar dependencies and stability risks in global financial markets, and because of the global financial markets 2 ̆ 7 dependency on the U. S. dollar, an international dollar lender of last resort is needed. The U. S. Federal Reserve is currently the institution best positioned to fill this role. Yet, I also argue that because of the potential problems, risks, and costs of this role, the U. S. Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> function must be rethought. The U. S. Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> authority relies upon an interpretation of statutory provisions in the Federal Reserve Act dating back to its origins in 1913. The institutional structure of today 2 ̆ 7 s global, interconnected financial markets bears little resemblance to that existing in 1913. This has left the <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> function open to undue problems and risks and allows for the possibility of problematic future overseas expansions. Accordingly, my Article proposes a new, distinct framework for the U. S. Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s swap lines. The first prong of this framework provides for a new market stability role for the U. S. Federal Reserve and provides for significant flexibility in its emergency lending operations. The second prong of this framework provides boundaries for this new flexibility, including limiting future extensions of the swap lines and bolstering democratic accountability in their use. Rethinking the U. S Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> function is an urgent task. Central bank swap lines are set to become key structural and competitive features of global financial markets. The recent establishment of a bilateral <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> between the People 2 ̆ 7 s Bank of China and the Bank of England and discussion of a <b>swap</b> <b>line</b> between the People 2 ̆ 7 s Bank of China and the Bank of France to promote London and Paris as offshore renminbi trading centers attest to this fact. In sum, this Article argues that the use of swap lines can be a significant aid in enabling the Federal Reserve to act as the international dollar lender of last resort-and, thereby, foster domestic and international financial market stability-but that this public objective cannot be reached unless the swap lines themselves are grounded in a thoughtful, practical, and forward-looking legalframework...|$|E

40|$|We provide robust {{evidence}} of a deviation in the covered interest rate parity (CIP) relation since {{the onset of the}} financial crisis in August 2007. The CIP deviation exists with respect to several different dollar-denominated interest rates and exchange rate pairings of the dollar vis-a-vis other currencies. The results show that our proxies for margin conditions and for the cost of capital are significant determinants of the CIP deviations, especially during the crisis period. The supply of dollars by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks via reciprocal currency arrangements (<b>swap</b> <b>lines)</b> reduced CIP deviations at this time. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, uncertainty about counterparty risk became a significant determinant of CIP deviations, and the <b>swap</b> <b>lines</b> program no longer affected the CIP deviations significantly. These results indicate a breakdown of arbitrage transactions in the international capital markets that owes partly to lack of capital and partly to heightened counterparty credit risk.

This paper studies the build-up of stresses on banks' balance sheets {{that led to this}} coordinated policy response. Using the BIS international banking statistics, we reconstruct the worldwide consolidated balance sheets of the major national banking systems. This allows us to investigate the structure of banks' global operations across their offices in various countries, shedding light on how their international asset positions are funded across currencies and counterparties. The analysis first highlights why a country's "national balance sheet", a residency-based measure, can be a misleading guide to where the vulnerabilities faced by that country's national banking system (or residents) lie. It then focuses on banking systems' consolidated balance sheets, and shows how the growth (since 2000) in European and Japanese banks' US dollar assets produced structural US dollar funding requirements, setting the stage for the dollar shortage when interbank and swap markets became impaired. international banking, financial crises, funding risk, US dollar shortage, central bank <b>swap</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
