40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that re-creating performing arts for tourism {{programs can be}} a means of generating sustainability for cultural heritage. When performed, arts represent the essence of intangible heritage in new format and manifestation. To revive meanings performing artists incorporate elements of various source – nature, legend, music, dance, and costume – and forge them into a cohesive unit for performance. In doing so, they use principles in conventional heritage and develop meaningful values not only for audiences in sourrouding areas but also for domestic and international tourists who aspire to new cultural heritage. Artists preserve the ‘spirit’ of the local heritage and express it to covey new content in a suitable artistis mode. As {{an example of this}} project that focuses on Indonesia, this paper examines how performing artists transform heritage values in traditional performing arts to become new interests in art <b>for</b> tourists who <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> and cultural attractions.

40|$|Prosocial {{behaviors}} are occasionally observed {{in daily life}} when people have {{the best interests of}} others at heart and in the study of prosocial behaviors, there is a notion called “helping behavior” which indicates a voluntary action responding to those who are asking for help. The definition of helping behavior, however, is namely to react to verbal or non-verbal appeals of people who require assistance, so the idea naturally cannot be applied to a touristic situation in the hospitality industry where customers do not need help but simply <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure.</b> This research aims to clarify the characteristics of individual attending service provided in the hospitality industry, utilizing the knowledge of sociopsychology and the fields of product development and business administration. In so doing, the author creates the term “considerate behavior” which is also a prosocial and voluntary behavior, which connotes not assisting people in trouble but rather providing them with a positive feeling to better enjoy their leisure time. The term implies no thought of receiving extrinsic rewards even if it may incur extra work or financial cost {{on the part of the}} service provider...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{application}} of Freud’s psychoanalysis theory to Abagnale’s Catch Me If You Can. It is aimed at analyzing the psychological problem of Frank related to his criminal conducts {{for the sake of}} pleasure. This research is a qualitative research and a content analysis method is used to analyze the data. The object of this study is Abagnale’s novel entitled Catch Me If You Can. The data of this study are expressions in words, phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs taken from the novel. The writer collected the data by reading the data comprehensively and taking simple notes of the important words, phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs related to the topic. The data analysis was observed by using Freud’s psychoanalysis theory, focused on the system of personality, especially in the domination of the id. In order to obtain the trustworthiness of the data, the researcher used peer- debriefing method. The findings of the study show that Frank’s imbalanced system of personality is caused by the domination of his id. The divorce of his parents, which is filled with conflicts, stimulates Frank’s id to <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> through delinquency and crimes, such as engaging in sexual activity with women when Frank is still underage, doing forgeries and conning people for his own advantage. Frank’s id imposes its demands <b>for</b> <b>pleasure</b> of love to his ego and causes his ego to neglect the superego’s command to search what is demanded by the id in a lawful way. As a result, the domination of the id causes Frank to become a criminal in four continents. There is no guilty feeling at all during committing crimes because Frank’s id has fully dominated his system of personality. The term that is widely known for someone who has id- dominated personality is called as psychopath. Frank manifests several malicious characteristics which are boundless egoism, strong destructive urge, impulse control problems and increased pleasureseeking drives...|$|R

Relationships between values and religiosity are examined within an integrative framework of Schwartz's value theory. Findings suggest that religion plays a critical role in shaping individuals values and their entrepreneurial behaviours. Practicing Muslim entrepreneurs have more respect for, commitment to and acceptance of the religious and traditional customs and ideas compared with those non-practicing Muslim entrepreneurs. On the other hand, non-practicing Muslim entrepreneurs have more independent thoughts and actions when it comes to choosing, creating and exploring compared with those practicing Muslim entrepreneurs. Furthermore, non-practicing Muslim entrepreneurs are more likely to <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> worldly <b>pleasures</b> and sensuous gratification compared with those practicing Muslim entrepreneurs...|$|R

This study is a qualitative research. Content analysis method was employed to analyze the data. The object of this study was a hybrid novel which contains both of words and graphic illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner entitled The Diary of a Teenage Girl. The forms of the data of this study were expressions in words and pictures related to imbalance personality of Minnie which taken from the novel. The data collection was conducted by comprehensively reading the data and taking some notes of the important words and pictures expression related to the topic. The data were observed by using psychoanalysis theory from Sigmund Freud, focusing on the organization of personality, mainly in the domination of the id within the system of personality. In order to come to the trustworthiness of the data, the researcher applied proof-reading methods. 	The findings of the research show that Minnie’s imbalance system of personality is caused by the domination of the id.

Consequently, rhetoric remains associated with its political origins. However, even the original instructors of Western speech—the Sophists—disputed this limited view of rhetoric. According to the Sophists, such as Gorgias, a successful rhetorician could speak convincingly on any topic, regardless of his experience in that field. This method suggested rhetoric could be a means of communicating any expertise, not just politics.

All of these terms are used when a male engages in women's work, clothes, speech tones, and nonverbal gestures.

60|$|You may {{separate}} {{these two}} groups of artists more distinctly in your mind as those who <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> the <b>pleasure</b> of art, in the relations of its colours and lines, without caring to convey any truth with it; and those who <b>seek</b> <b>for</b> the truth first, and then go down from the truth to the pleasure of colour and line. Marking those two bodies distinctly as separate, and thinking over them, you may come to some rather notable conclusions respecting the mental dispositions which are involved in each mode of study. You will find that large masses {{of the art of}} the world fall definitely under {{one or the other of}} these heads. Observe, pleasure first and truth afterwards, (or not at all,) as with the Arabians and Indians; or, truth first and pleasure afterwards, as with Angelico and all other great European painters. You will find that the art whose end is pleasure only is pre-eminently the gift of cruel and savage nations, cruel in temper, savage in habits and conception; but that the art which is especially dedicated to natural fact always indicates a peculiar gentleness and tenderness of mind, and that all great and successful work of that kind will assuredly be the production of thoughtful, sensitive, earnest, kind men, large in their views of life, and full of various intellectual power. And farther, when you examine the men in whom the gifts of art are variously mingled, or universally mingled, you will discern that the ornamental, or pleasurable power, though it may be possessed by good men, is not in itself an indication of their goodness, but is rather, unless balanced by other faculties, indicative of violence of temper, inclining to cruelty and to irreligion. On the other hand, so sure as you find any man endowed with a keen and separate faculty of representing natural fact, so surely you will find that man gentle and upright, full of nobleness and breadth of thought. I will give you two instances, the first peculiarly English, and another peculiarly interesting because it occurs among a nation not generally very kind or gentle.|$|R
