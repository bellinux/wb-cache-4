50|$|In {{a direct}} coupled stub, {{the length of}} <b>stub</b> <b>cable</b> should not exceed 1 foot, but again this may be {{exceeded}} if installation requirements dictate. The isolation resistors R {{have to have a}} fixed value of 55 ohms ± 2.0 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Batam Singapore Cable System (BSCS), a {{submarine}} cable system connecting Batam Centre station (Batam) to Telin station in Singapore. The total system length is around 98 km, connecting the landing sites through six fiber pair cables, with <b>stub</b> <b>cable</b> is provided for future {{extension of the}} system.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{transformer}} coupled stub, {{the length of}} the <b>stub</b> <b>cable</b> should not exceed 20 ft, but this may be exceeded [...] "if installation requirements dictate." [...] The coupling transformer has to have a turns ratio of 1:1.41 ± 3.0 percent. The resistors R both have to have a value of 0.75 Zo ± 2.0 percent, where Zo is the characteristic impedance of the bus at 1 MHz.|$|E
50|$|With the 40-wire cable, it {{was very}} common to {{implement}} cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device {{at the end of}} the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused <b>stub</b> of <b>cable,</b> which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes signal reflections, particularly at higher transfer rates.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{maintained}} under Philips Lighting, {{the network}} runs on a 4-twisted-pair cable of 100Ω 100 MHz CAT5E [...] or a flat cable with RS485 serial port, usually with a RJ-12 connector. A daisy-chain serial network topology is strongly recommended with no <b>stubs.</b> The recommended <b>cable</b> colour-coding is ...|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 80-wire cable defined {{for use in}} ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes {{at the end of}} the 18 in cable—the black {{connector}}—and the slave device goes on the middle connector—the gray one—and the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no <b>cable</b> <b>stub</b> to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here a 1. 52 m (5 ft.) diameter Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) {{for use in}} a high-voltage {{radar system}} that uses a single antenna and a directional coupler. This antenna, designated the IRA- 6, was designed to operate at 30 kV. To accommodate the higher voltage, we introduced a number of new features, including a larger-diameter 100 -ohm <b>cable,</b> <b>cable</b> <b>stubs</b> at the feed point, and gaps in the splitter balun. These features led to somewhat higher reflections in the TDR and somewhat reduced gain. However, the realized gain was satisfactory as high as 4 GHz, which covered the frequencies of interest. We tested the antenna at low, medium and high voltages, for which we provide results. The peak gain on boresight is 20 dBi at 3. 1 GHz and the effective height is approximately 0. 187 m. 2 I...|$|R
