25|$|Psychological factors, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events, life transitions, and {{environment}} {{as well as}} often thinking {{in a way that}} exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed {{to play a role in}} the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain medications. People who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder than the general population.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists have {{examined}} coping {{skills in the}} elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an {{internal locus of control}} have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Other factors that may link to well-being and quality of life in the elderly include social relationships (possibly relationships with pets as well as humans), and health.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} IBS are not clear. Theories include {{combinations}} of gut–brain axis problems, gut motility disorders, pain sensitivity, infections including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, neurotransmitters, genetic factors, and food sensitivity. Onset may {{be triggered by}} an intestinal infection, or <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> event. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms {{in the absence of}} worrisome features. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption, and colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think {{the way they do}} because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E

25|$|It is {{reported}} that treatment in childhood and in adulthood, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, {{domestic violence and}} bullying, {{has been linked to}} the development of mental disorders, through a complex interaction of societal, family, psychological and biological factors. Negative or <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events more generally have been implicated {{in the development of a}} range of disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. The main risks appear to be from a cumulative combination of such experiences over time, although exposure to a single major trauma can sometimes lead to psychopathology, including PTSD. Resilience to such experiences varies, and a person may be resistant to some forms of experience but susceptible to others. Features associated with variations in resilience include genetic vulnerability, temperamental characteristics, cognitive set, coping patterns, and other experiences.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{detailing}} {{the connection between}} religion and physical health was done in Israel as a prospective cohort case study. In a study done of almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious kibbutzim) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that “belonging to a religious collective {{was associated with a}} strong protective effect". Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.|$|E

40|$|Exposure {{to early}} <b>stressful</b> adverse <b>life</b> {{events such as}} {{maternal}} and social separation plays {{an essential role in}} the development of the nervous system.

Biologically, the number of astrocytes was significantly increased in the prefrontal cortex of MSS adolescent rats. The hyperactive and anxiolytic phenotype and biological alteration produced by this MSS protocol may provide a useful animal model for investigating the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders of childhood-onset diseases, such as attention deficient hyperactive disorder...|$|R

2500|$|The supersensitivity theory {{proposes that}} certain {{individuals}} who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental life events. [...] These interact with <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance abuse may increase it, causing the individual to {{be more likely to}} experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances. [...] These individuals, therefore, are [...] "supersensitive" [...] to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{psychologist}} Robert Kegan {{developed a}} theoretical framework that posited five levels of meaning-making; each level described a more advanced way of understanding experiences that persons may come to master as they develop psychologically. Similarly, according to the transformative learning theory of sociologist and educator Jack Mezirow, adults interpret the meaning of their experiences through a lens of deeply held assumptions. When they experience something that contradicts or challenges their way of negotiating the world {{they have to go}} through the transformative process of evaluating their assumptions and processes of making meaning. Experiences that force individuals to engage in this critical self-reflection, or what Mezirow called [...] "disorienting dilemmas", can be events such as loss, trauma, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> transitions or other interruptions.|$|E

These issues last for about six weeks, perhaps longer, especially, if the deployment doesn't go well or there are reports of bad news to the family. The best way to get family and spouses over this period, is for the deployed personnel to contact their family as soon as they arrive at their destinations as soon as military authority permits.

2500|$|When {{individuals}} with a divinity worldview make meaning through spirituality and religiosity, those [...] "individuals perceive the divine {{to be involved in}} a major <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> event" [...] and use the divine to develop a meaning for the loss. There are three main ways in which a theistic individual may create meaning through religion: benevolent religious reappraisals, punishing God reappraisals, and reappraisals of God's power. Benevolent religious reappraisals cast God in a positive light and grievers may see the death as a part of God's plan. Punishing God reappraisals cast God in a dark light and grievers may blame God for the loss or feel punished by God. Reappraisals of God's power questions God's ability to intervene on the situation. All of these appraisals contribute to how the griever may create meaning of their loss.|$|E
50|$|A third {{example of}} a {{mediating}} variable is an increase of externalizing symptoms. King and Chassin (2008) conducted research examining the relationship between <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events and drug dependence in young adulthood. Their findings identified problematic externalizing behavior on subsequent substance dependency. In other words, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events are associated with externalizing symptoms, such as aggression or hostility, {{which can lead to}} peer alienation or acceptance by socially deviant peers, which could lead to increased drug use. The relationship between <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> events and subsequent drug dependence however exists via the presence of the mediation effects of externalizing behaviors.|$|E

5000|$|Bullying {{may also}} {{result from a}} genetic {{predisposition}} or a brain abnormality in the bully. While parents can help a toddler develop emotional regulation and control to restrict aggressive behavior, some children fail to develop these skills due to insecure attachment with their families, ineffective discipline, and environmental factors such as a <b>stressful</b> home <b>life</b> and hostile siblings. Moreover, according to some researchers, bullies may be inclined toward negativity and perform poorly academically. Dr. Cook says that [...] "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers".|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2011. Major: Child Psychology. Advisor: Ann S. Masten. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 138 pages, appendices A-G. Homelessness represents {{a context of}} risk for child development. Yet, many homeless children show good develop outcomes, nonetheless. The processes of risk and resilience that contribute to this variability involve adaptive systems impacted by factors across levels of analysis, such as cortisol and physiology, executive functions (EF) {{and other aspects of}} psychological functioning, and parenting behavior and the family context. This study employs a resilience framework that is grounded in developmental-ecological theory and recognizes factors at multiple levels of analysis. The goal is to elucidate explanatory models of the processes of risk and resilience by incorporating relationships with cortisol, a component of physiological adaptive systems related to the stress response, self-regulation, and other functions. Families in this study were all staying in an emergency homeless shelter and contained a child entering kindergarten or first grade. Children were separated from caregivers and completed a session of cognitive tasks that assessed executive functions and other abilities, followed by a session of parent-child interaction tasks. Saliva samples were collected throughout both sessions and assayed for cortisol concentrations. Parents reported on risk factors and <b>stressful</b> negative <b>life</b> events for each child. Initial levels of child cortisol were negatively related to EF, affirming a proposed inverted-U relationship between cortisol and cognition among this sample of high-risk children. Higher rates of <b>stressful,</b> negative <b>life</b> events were not related to cortisol, nor was positive parenting behavior. However, harsh, hostile, and insensitive parenting behaviors were related to higher levels of child cortisol, but only during the session when parent and child were together. There were no differences based on variables of interested when it came to changes in cortisol over either session. Results are discussed with respect to proposed mechanisms of the interface between cortisol, parenting and EF at different levels of analysis in the context of high developmental risk...|$|R
40|$|Early <b>life</b> <b>stressful</b> events induce {{long lasting}} {{alterations}} of intestinal homeostasis associated with susceptibility to develop gastrointestinal disorders at adulthood. Neonatal period {{is characterized by}} immature intestinal mucosa. Among others, Paneth cells appear only 2 weeks after birth. Our aim was to analyze the consequences of maternal separation (MS) in mice on enteric antimicrobial activity and its consequences on intestinal microbiota, systemic immune response toward microbiota and visceral sensitivity. In 50 -days old mice, MS induced a decrease of enteric antimicrobial activity associated with intestinal E. coli overgrowth and an increase of anti-E. coli IgG and IgA in plasma. Furthermore, MS increased IFNγ and TNFα in ileum and induced visceral hypersensitivity in response to colorectal distension. In order to decipher whether or not those alterations were a consequence of E. coli overgrowth, adult mice were force fed daily with 109 commensal E. coli for 15 days. E. coli gavage reproduced intestinal E. coli overgrowth as well as anti-E. coli IgG and IgA increase and visceral hypersensitivity without modification of enteric antimicrobial defense. Altogether our results highlighted that early <b>life</b> <b>stressful</b> events impair the development of antimicrobial defenses and promote commensal bacterial overgrowth leading to abnormal response toward microbiota and visceral hypersensitivity...|$|R
