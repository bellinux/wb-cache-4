Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term “penal clause” under former article 2117 of the Civil Code. Stipulated damages create a <b>secondary</b> <b>obligation</b> for the purpose of enforcing the principal obligation. The aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay. Stipulated damages may not be modified by the court (and will therefore be enforced) [...] "unless they are so manifestly unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy".|$|E

Firstly, it creates new obligations for the breaching state, principally, duties of cessation and non-repetition (Article 30), and a duty to make full reparation (Article 31).

40|$|The ideal {{worlds of}} a {{possible}} worlds semantics may satisfy both a primary obligation and an associated <b>secondary</b> <b>obligation,</b> for example the obligation to keep a promise and the obligation to apologise for not keeping it. This {{is known as the}} pragmatic oddity introduced by Prakken and Sergot. We argue that an adequate treatment of the pragmatic oddity within a norm-based semantics can be obtained, by not allowing primary and secondary obligations to aggregate, because they are obligations of a di erent kind. On the basis of this conceptual analysis, we introduce two logics, depending on the stance taken on the representation of normative con icts, and we present sound and complete proof systems for these logics. We then give a formal analysis, discuss extensions, and highlight various topics for further research...|$|E
40|$|In {{the law of}} {{contracts}} therd {{is a great deal}} of misunderstanding or lack of understanding in regard to certain topics connected with the subject of discharge. Some of this 2 ̆ 7 is due to the fact that few men use such terms as condition and warranty in the same 2 ̆ 7 sense. The rest is due to faulty reasoning concerning matters that are admittedly difficult. This article will not attemptto discuss the subject of discharge in all of its details, but will try to delimit the. field and will discuss at some length a few of the problems arising therein. In particular, the relations existing between the subject of fulfilment of conditions and the subject of discharge, and between breach of contract and discharge, will be discussed. It is believed that great assistance will be obtained from a clear understanding and a complete separation of primaryand secondary obligations.

40|$|States are reticent {{to support}} the idea that they have human rights {{obligations}} to people other than their own. However decades of United Nations consideration and human rights standard-setting in the area of international cooperation have advanced interpretations of the obligation whereby economic and other policies should be designed {{in such a way as}} to avoid causing injury to the interests of developing States and to the rights of their people, and, moreover, should actively seek to address existing deprivations. This latter obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights elsewhere gives rise to a host of important legal issues that provide the focus for this article. Should we understand the obligations to be those of individual States or can we speak of collective legal obligations in this area? Is the extraterritorial obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights limited to the transfer of financial resources, and if not what else might it entail? Are they best framed as <b>secondary</b> <b>obligations</b> triggered only if the rights-holder’s own State is unable or unwilling to fulfil them or as simultaneous obligations? If, as per the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its monitoring Committee we recognise capacity as a basis to assist, how might the obligations among all those States with capacity be divided? In complying with these positive obligations of international assistance and cooperation what would constitute an unreasonable cost on the part of a State acting extraterritorially? In exploring these questions, this paper offers insights from the author’s membership in the Drafting Committee of the 2011 Maastricht Principles on the Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and presents the current state of legal play...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} legal and factual {{consequences}} {{of the distinction between}} lawful and unlawful expropriation of a foreign investment by the host state. The author analyses the impact which the legality of expropriation has on the amount of compensation owed by the host state, an issue of whether the indirect expropriation can ever be lawful and the consequences which illegal expropriation has on recognition of such an act in territories of other countries. It is well established in contemporary arbitral practice that the illegal expropriation entails an obligation of the host state to pay the investor not only the amount equal to the market value of the investment at the time of expropriation, but also the sum which would include the increase of the investment's value from the moment of taking to the date on which the arbitral award is issued. Although the arbitration practice and legal doctrine generally accept that an indirect expropriation is automatically unlawful, {{due to the fact that}} the host state does not offer any compensation to the aggrieved investor, such view is logically unsound and irreconcilable with the duty of states to regulate in general interest. The conclusion of an arbitral tribunal that the state has conducted an indirect expropriation should be seen as a precondition which triggers the <b>secondary</b> <b>obligation</b> of the state - to pay an adequate compensation for the property taken provided for in the BIT. Actions of the host state should be regarded as a breach of international obligation and could activate the application of the stricter standard of compensation only if the host state ignores the duty to compensate the investor. The negative consequences of illegal expropriation may be reflected in the non-recognition of its effects on the territory of other states. However, these effects are highly dependent on the willingness of national courts to engage in a review of the legality of conducts of another state...|$|E
40|$|From the {{analytical}} viewpoint a norm can formally {{be regarded as}} a right-duty (or claim-obligation) relation (1) that regulates behaviour (action/inaction) (2) among subjects (3) in definite space (4) and time (5). Consequently, a legal order can be defined as a system of right-duty (or claim-obligation) relations that regulate behaviour (action/inaction) among subjects in definite space and are procedurally organised in the vertical and horizontal sense according to time. An iconic representation of these minimum necessary concepts allows switching from natural language to a purely formal representation of the legal system(s) (deontic network). Within this ‘geometrical’ frame, general principles (the ‘basis’) of (international) law can be conceived of as general obligations, i. e. obligations erga omnes (towards everyone). Obligations erga omnes (ties), indivisible or divisible because of their content, link a subject (node) to every other subject of international law, endowed with a correlative claim (s – s), so that the whole obligations erga omnes are matched by the whole claims erga omnes of all the subjects of international law. Indivisible obligations erga omnes are unavailable from the viewpoint of the power, so cogentes, breaches violate necessarily all the correlative claims, possibly enabling every subject to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as indivisible obligations erga omnes, the violation of which allows universal enforcement. Nevertheless, specifically by reason of the gravity of the breach, it is possible to split primary and secondary norms, conceiving of the sanction as a bilateral relation allowing solely reciprocal enforcement {{in the case of an}} infringement. Divisible obligations erga omnes are available from the viewpoint of the power, so dispositivae, breaches must be seen as relative, enabling only the subject(s) injured to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as bilateral obligations, the infringement of which gives rise to reciprocal enforcement. Nevertheless, it is possible to figure out that specifically the gravity of the breach ‘unifies’ the primary divisible obligation, allowing universal invocation of the responsibility, so that the <b>secondary</b> <b>obligation</b> could be either bilateral or a general indivisible one, respectively permitting relative or absolute enforcement in the case of a breach...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the legal}} issues arising when a fully exploited or overexploited international fishery cannot, because {{a significant part of}} the fishing takes place on the high seas where there is a customary and conventional right of all States for their national to fish on the high seas, readily be closed to new entrants. If the complete collapse of the fishery predicted by the economics literature (and in many instances borne out by real-world examples) is not to ensue, some way must be found of circumventing this problem of open access. Drawing largely on the documented history of the interactions among the States (and Taiwan) involved in the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery, supplemented where relevant by reports of meetings of treaty-based commissions managing other international fisheries, the thesis traces, and attempts to explain, the development of a property-rights mentality among existing participants in the fisheries implicit in the arguments they employ to minimise newcomers’ catch or keep them out altogether. Though at odds with the formal rule, to which they nonetheless continue to appear attached, some accommodation of the property concept will be needed if the recovery of the stocks to the biomass that generates the maximum sustainable yield is ever to take place. At present the participants in the SBT and other depleted international fisheries have insufficient incentive to insist on the catch reductions necessary to permit this recovery and thereby, it is argued, are collectively in breach of their obligations to all other States that are potential new entrants. Among the possible solutions explored are the development of trading in fishery commission quotas – these, as shown by an analysis from first principles, are negative obligations (for catch not to exceed given limits) and thus lack the positive characteristics of truly tradable assets, but, as also demonstrated, they can even so be made to fulfil asset-like functions if the commission as a whole is willing. The well developed system of accounting for catch that any worthwhile trading mechanism would require in turn gives rise to the conclusion that this, in the form of State responsibility – in terms of both attribution of fishing activities on the high seas to the flag State and the <b>secondary</b> <b>obligation</b> to wipe out the consequences of breach of a primary obligation that occurs when limits are exceeded – has hitherto been a neglected area of international fisheries law that invites further research. Meanwhile, the paradoxical result is that the freedom to fish is not just the source of the overfishing problem but potentially also a necessary part of its solution, in that a small number of new entrants may be the only ones with a sufficient economic interest to enforce the obligation to permit the stocks’ recovery...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{responsibility}} associated with the provision of health care, specifically it {{deals with the}} problem of causal link in medical disputes, its peculiarities, its obstacles related to its proving and possible ways of burden-of-proof- easement in relation to causation, including in particular the loss of chance concept. Second section of the thesis is dedicated to the brief introduction to the issue of liability, as a specific phenomenon necessary for the functioning of the human community, which is in the provision of health care represented not only by civil liability, but also by ethical disciplinary or labour liability. Legal liability is however clearly the dominant and most efficient instrument to regulate the conduct of the legal norm addressees. Legal liability, defined as <b>secondary</b> legal <b>obligation,</b> arising {{as a result of a}} breach of the primary legal obligation, is described in the third section of this thesis according to its basic structural elements. These basic structural elements are: infringement, emergence of damage, fault and finally causal link between the unlawful conduct and the damage. Crucial attention is paid to the causal link, to the specification of the causal link concept, to the requirement for level of proof in the Czech legal system and also in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Data from a large, four-language web-based questionnaire, {{supplemented}} {{with data from}} the General Social Survey, allow us to explore possible sources of Atheism, notably the hypothesis that lack of social obligations encourages disbelief in God. The analysis {{is rooted in the}} compensator theory of religion, first proposed twenty-five years ago, but it incorporates a recent addition: the distinction between primary and <b>secondary</b> compensation. Social <b>obligations</b> make <b>secondary</b> compensation important, because it substitutes a compensator for a reward that a person is obligated to provide to another person.

50|$|The primary {{rights and}} {{obligations}} flowing from a particular contract are those the parties expressly or tacitly agreed upon, and also those the law implies. This contrasts with <b>secondary</b> rights and <b>obligations</b> (such as the duty to pay damages and the duty to restore performances received prior to termination), which arise after a breach of contract. It is not necessary for the parties to agree upon any special rights or obligations other than those essential to their particular contracts (essentialia); all obligations concerning the manner, time or place of performance are regulated and are implied by law {{as soon as the}} parties have made their contract (naturalia). For example, if Sa Roj has agreed to sell her motor car to Bosie for R100,000, all the {{rights and obligations}} of both of them are regulated by the law.

40|$|Crises on {{external}} sovereign debt are typically defined as defaults. Such a definition accurately captures debt-servicing {{difficulties in the}} 1980 s, a period of numerous defaults on bank loans. However, defining defaults as debt crises is problematic for the 1990 s, when sovereign bond markets emerged. In contrast to the 1980 s, the 1990 s are characterized by significant foreign debt-servicing difficulties but fewer sovereign defaults. In order to capture this evolution of debt markets, we define debt crises as events occurring when either a country defaults or its bond spreads are above a critical threshold. We find that our definition outperforms the default-based definition in capturing debt-servicing difficulties and, consequently, in fitting the post- 1994 period. In particular, liquidity indicators are significant in explaining our definition of debt crises, while they do not play any role in explaining defaults after 1994.
