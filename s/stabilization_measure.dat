25|$|A {{new series}} of {{economic}} changes followed: the National Bank of Romania was passed into full public ownership (December 1946), and, in order to combat the Romanian leu's devaluation, a surprise monetary reform was imposed as a <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure</b> in August 1947 (severely limiting the amount convertible by people without an actual job, primarily members of the aristocracy). The Marshall Plan was being overtly condemned, while nationalization and a planned economy were enforced beginning 11 June 1948. The first five-year plan, conceived by Miron Constantinescu's Soviet-Romanian committee, was adopted in 1950. Of newly enforced measures, the arguably most far-reaching was collectivization—by 1962, when the process was considered complete, 96% of the total arable land had been enclosed in collective farming, while around 80,000 peasants faced trial for resisting and 17,000 others were uprooted or deported for being chiaburi (the Romanian equivalent of kulaks). In 1950, the party, which viewed itself as {{the vanguard of the}} working class, reported that people of proletarian origin held 64% of party offices and 40% of higher government posts, while results of the recruitment efforts remained below official expectations.|$|E
40|$|For decades {{past the}} IMF {{has been a}} byword for {{economic}} orthodoxy, which included disapproval of policy limits on cross-border capital flows. But in 2012 it announced a new "institutional view" giving more scope for capital flow management and in effect restricting the rights of capital owners. The Fund's program in Iceland after the October 2008 crash helped to pave the way; {{it was the first}} time the Fund had endorsed capital controls in a developed country. The essay describes Iceland's boom and bust, and how the government and IMF tried to manage the crisis. With IMF support, the government implemented capital outflow controls, initially as an emergency response and then as a longer-term <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure.</b> The control regime evolved in a complicated "game", sometimes referred to in public debate as "the battle of Iceland", between the central bank implementing a professionally-led capital account liberalization strategy versus political parties seeking to turn the controls to their advantage. From this political economy perspective we explain why the "temporary" capital controls remain in place more than five years on. At the end we draw some broad lessons from the Iceland case for the financial booms and busts to come...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{one of the}} {{measures}} for slope fast reinforcement, micropiles are always designed as a group. In this paper, an analytic model for the ultimate resistance of micropile is proposed, based on a beam–column equation and an existing p–y curve method. As such, an iterative process to find the bending moment and shear capacity of the micropile section has been developed. The formulation for calculating the inner force and deflection of the micropile using the finite difference method is derived. Special attention is given to determine the spacing of micropiles {{with the aim of}} achieving the ultimate shear capacity of the micropile group. Thus, a new design method for micropiles for earth slope stabilization is proposed that includes details about choosing a location for the micropiles within the existing slope, selecting micropile cross section, estimating the length of the micropile, evaluating the shear capacity of the micropiles group, calculating the spacing required to provide force to stabilize the slope and the design of the concrete cap beam. The application of the method to an embankment landslide in Qinghai province, China, is described, and monitoring data indicated that slope movement had effectively ceased {{as a result of the}} slope <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure,</b> which verified the effectiveness of the design method...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose two smooth {{optimization}} methods, one that can stabilize a system, and the other that can perform a stabilization as well as solve the optimal $H_ 2 $-norm design problem. For both methods, we {{make use of the}} smoothed spectral abscissa, a <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure</b> which originates from the inversion of an $H_ 2 $-norm type function, and that behaves as a smooth approximation of the spectral abscissa. In this way, we can set up an optimization framework in which a stabilizing point can efficiently be found. Taking advantage of its computation via Lyapunov equations, we derive computationally attractive formulae for the first-order and second-order derivatives of this smooth objective, which allows for the use of standard gradient- or Hessian-based optimization techniques. A second optimization framework, also involving the smoothed spectral abscissa, can be designed to deal with the $H_ 2 $-norm synthesis. This method has the advantage that {{it is not necessary to}} find a stable point for the system on beforehand, as the stabilization is done simultaneously with the actual minimization of the $H_ 2 $-norm. We apply the discussed methods to the class of systems with low-order, or fixed-order, feedback laws, where the number of controller parameters is smaller than the dimension of the plant. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Landslide 1 {{is located}} on the right bank of the {{downstream}} side of the dam for Hongjiadu Hydropower Station in Guizhou Province, China. In view of its close proximity to important workings, the stability of the slide is of great concern. Ground investigation showed that the slide is potentially unstable and has two sliding directions. Reinforcement mainly by piles was proposed as the <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure,</b> but two key questions were raised during the design of the piles. (1) How could the stability of the slope be evaluated, as there are two major sliding directions? (2) How could the shear strength parameters of the slip band be determined, as it contains a significant proportion of coarse particles? In this paper, we demonstrate how these issues can be addressed by the strength-reduction technique. First, the strength parameters of the slip band are back-analyzed by assuming a factor of safety of unity. Second, the major sliding directions are determined by carrying out finite difference analyses. Third, two proposed stabilization schemes are evaluated and compared to demonstrate the versatility of the technique. The present study has demonstrated that the strength-reduction technique is a powerful tool for analyzing such problems. © 2007 NRC Canada. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Portugal {{has been}} demonstrating {{over the years}} a high {{dependence}} of imported fossil fuels, {{especially with regard to}} the transportation and electricity production sectors. The urgent need to balance supply and demand as well as the growing concern about environmental issues and reduction of external energy dependency justified an increasing interest in the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES) looking for more efficient strategies in terms of economic and social or environmental dimensions. The electricity sector represented a clear example of this RES trend with European and Portuguese policies focused on strategies promoting renewable resources and energy efficiency. Following different studies already conducted in other countries, this paper presents an approach to a possible 100 % renewable electricity scenario in Portugal, supported by the application of the model EnergyPLAN. The importance of the interconnection as <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure</b> for a system highly dependent on renewable energy sources of variable output is put in evidence. The results also established that the cost structure of each scenario is mainly driven by the low marginal cost of renewable technologies along with their high investment costs.

40|$|The {{coal mining}} {{activities}} in Northern Vietnam require {{the construction of}} large waste rock dumps for deposal of overburden. These waste rock dumps are the cause of many environmental problems and partially {{pose a threat to}} the population. The aim of this work is the development of tools for the design and assessment of stabilization measures for these waste rock dumps. Initially, a utility analysis is carried out to find the most appropriate stabilization measures, considering the local conditions and circumstances. The required material properties and shear strength parameters for the evaluation of slope stability are obtained from field and laboratory tests. It is found, that a linear approximation of standard shear test results overestimates the shear strength at low normal stresses. Thus, further shear tests are carried out at low normal stresses with a newly developed mobile shear testing device. A new approach is being developed to describe the nonlinear shear strength envelope at low normal stresses and improve the approximation of the shear test results. Based on this new nonlinear approach, several design charts are created and can be used for the evaluation of slope stability, depending on the slope geometry and the material properties. The evaluation of erosion is carried out using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The required parameters for the material of the investigated Vietnamese waste rock dumps are determined and calculation results are matched with results from an on-site monitoring of erosion using a terrestrial 3 D-laserscanner. Based on RUSLE calculations with these parameters, a design chart for the evaluation of erosion of the waste rock dump slopes is being created. As a possible application for the developed methods and design charts is presented, using the example of a realized dump <b>stabilization</b> <b>measure.</b> The evaluation approaches for the evaluation of slope stability and erosion are implemented in a cost comparison model to identify the most economical stabilization concept. As further application, the implementation of the developed approaches in a Geographic Information System (GIS) is outlined in an outlook.
