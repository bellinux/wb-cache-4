Likewise, soft sediment deformation features (clastic dikes, tight drag folds, and intense monoclines) in 14, 000 feet of Cambrian to Cretaceous strata on the Ute Pass Fault in Colorado argue that even the Cambrian strata were not lithified when the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains was uplifted in the late Cretaceous Laramide event.

40|$|In the Spanish Pyrenees, the Sant Corneli-Bóixols thrust-related {{anticline}} displays an outstandingly preserved growth <b>strata</b> <b>sequence.</b> These strata lie {{on top of}} a major unconformity exposed at the anticline's forelimb {{that divides}} and decouples a lower pre-folding unit from an upper syn-folding one. The former consists of steeply dipping to overturned strata with widespread bedding-parallel slip indicative of folding by flexural slip, whereas the syn-folding strata above define a 200  m amplitude fold. In the inner and outer sectors of the forelimb, both pre- and syn-folding strata are near vertical to overturned and the unconformity angle ranges from 10 to 30 °. In the central portion of the forelimb, syn-folding layers are gently dipping, whereas the angular unconformity is about 90 ° and the unconformity surface displays strong S–C shear structures, which provide a top-to-foreland slip sense. This sheared unconformity is offset by steeply dipping faults, which are at low angles to the underlying layers of the pre-folding unit. Strong shearing along the unconformity surface also occurred in the inner sector of the forelimb, with S–C structures providing an opposite, top-to-hinterland slip sense. Cross-cutting relationships and slip senses along the pre-folding bedding surfaces and the unconformity indicate that regardless of its orientation, layering in the pre- and syn-folding sequences of the Sant Corneli-Bóixols anticline were continuously slipped.

This wedge has been {{divided into three}} {{formations}} that reflect long-term progradation: 1) pro-delta shales of the Akata Formation (Paleocene to Recent), 2) deltaic and paralic facies of the Agbada Formation (Eocene to Recent) and 3) fluviatile facies of the Benin Formation (Oligocene-Recent). This study combines a three-dimensional seismic image with well log data from Delta field to describe lithic variations of the Agbada Formation and develop a sequence stratigraphic framework. The 5000 -feet thick Agbada Formation in Delta field is divided by five major sequence boundaries, each observed in seismic cross sections to significantly truncate underlying <b>strata.</b> <b>Sequence</b> boundaries developed as mass flows eroded slopes steepened by the structural collapse of the Niger Delta clastic wedge. Basal deposits directly overlying areas of deepest incision along sequence boundaries formed by the migration of large, sinuous turbidite channels. Upward-coarsening sets of inclined beds, hundreds of feet thick, record progradation of deltas into turbidite-carved canyons and onto down faulted blocks. Thinner, more continuous seismic reflections higher within sequences are associated with blocky and upward-fining well-log patterns interpreted to reflect deposition in shoreline, paralic, and fluvial environments. Episodes of structural collapse of the Niger Delta clastic wedge appear {{to be associated with}} progradation of Agbada Formation sediments and the loading of underlying Akata Formation shales. Progradation may have been more rapid during third order eustatic sea level falls. Effects of syn-sedimentary deformation on patterns of sediment transport and deposition are more pronounced in lower sequences within the Agbada Formation, and include: 1) incision into foot walls of listric normal faults, 2) abrupt reorientation of channelized flow pathways across faults, and 3) thinning of deposits across crests of rollover anticlines on down thrown fault blocks. Structural controls on deposition are less pronounced within younger sequences and canyon incisions along sequence boundaries are more pronounced, suggesting that the locus of sediment accumulation and structural collapse of the clastic wedge moved farther basinward as accommodation was filled in the area of Delta field...|$|E

This framework defines four unconformity-bounded depositional sequences (A–D), based on sequence stratigraphic methodology, well-log patterns, and facies analysis. In ascending order, sequence A records {{the transition from}} the underlying marine facies of the Puskwaskau Formation into the Wapiti fluvial facies, and consists of strongly progradational and aggradational stacking patterns. Sequences B and C show a similar pattern of basal amalgamated channel-fill deposits that grade upwards into floodplain-dominated <b>strata.</b> Finally, <b>sequence</b> D is dominated by channelized sediments and extensive overbank facies. An aggradational stacking pattern suggests deposition under high-accommodation conditions. Maximum flooding surfaces are interpreted within fine-grained deposits in the upper portions of sequences C and D.

This study provides new evidence that major coal seams may represent the extension of marine maximum flooding surfaces into the downstream-controlled fluvial realm.

40|$|Field {{data and}} recent {{experimental}} studies independently question long-held paradigms regarding {{the origin and}} time significance of fluvially carved sequence boundaries as well as genetic relationships between these surfaces and the strata they bind. These field data derive from an updip to downdip transect through the Cretaceous Dakota Group of the U. S. southern High Plains. The experimental data derive from repeated basin-scale runs of sequence development during relative sea-level change simulated in the Jurassic Tank at the University of Minnesota, St Anthony Falls. Both experimental and field data show that fluvial sand above sequence boundaries are deposited coexistent with the carving of the underlying sequence boundary. The field data do this by inference from mapped crosscutting relationships within observed stratigraphy and the experimental data through scaled reproduction of the processes inferred and products observed from the field. Both sources converge to reinforce assertions regarding sequence boundaries that require readjustment of some commonly held views. Namely, surfaces commonly mapped as sequence-bounding unconformities were not necessarily synchronously exposed, record no common age, and may not consistently separate older from younger strata. Also, fluvial <b>strata</b> above <b>sequence</b> boundaries {{do not necessarily reflect}} passive burial of these surfaces during subsequent transgression.

Updated radioisotopic constraints and astrochronologic testing provide support for the inference of an ~ 1 million year long sea-level oscillation associated with this 3 rd-order cycle, which likely reflects a long-period obliquity (1. 2 Myr) control on eustasy and stratigraphic sequence development, linked to the global carbon cycle.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the geologic evolution of the Himalaya remains incomplete, particularly in regard to structural and geochronologic details of the Proterozoic-Paleozoic Lesser Himalayan Sequence. We conducted an integrated field mapping, geochronological study, and geochemical analysis of the Lesser Himalayan <b>Sequence</b> <b>strata</b> in the Kumaun and Garwhal Himalaya of NW India (78 ° 00 ′- 80 ° 30 ′E). Structural observations reveal a systematic change in deformation styles from lower to higher structural levels in the Main Central Thrust footwall. In the south, and at lower structural levels, the Main Central Thrust footwall is characterized by parallel folding and sparse development of axial cleavage. Quartz microstructures indicate that deformation occurred at temperatures below 350 °C. In contrast, {{in the north and}} at higher structural levels close to the Main Central Thrust, deformation is characterized by replacement of original bedding, the development of penetrative cleavage, and schistosity locally. Folds are tight, in places isoclinal and overturned. The corresponding quartz microstructures indicate that deformation occurred above 350 °C. Dating of detrital zircons from Lesser Himalayan Sequence metasedimentary units, and igneous zircons from schistose gneisses throughout the Lesser Himalayan Sequence allow refinements to the stratigraphic framework. First, unlike what has been observed in western Nepal immediately west of our study area, U-Pb zircon dating suggests the absence of Paleoproterozoic strata in the Ramgarh Thrust hanging wall. This suggests that the thrust cuts upsection laterally along strike. Second, U-Pb detrital zircon dating suggests that metasedimentary strata in the Ramgarh Thrust hanging wall are correlative with basal units of the Outer Lesser Himalayan Sequence, removing the necessity that the Ramgarh Thrust hanging wall was allochthonous with respect to its footwall Lesser Himalayan Sequence units. Schistose gneisses with U-Pb ages of ca. 1850 Ma are older than Lesser Himalayan Sequence units in the area, suggesting that they are Lesser Himalayan Sequence basement. We conclude that the Ramgarh Thrust is an out-of-sequence thrust postdating a folding event in its footwall. The earlier proposal that Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Lesser Himalayan <b>Sequence</b> <b>strata</b> are the southern extension of the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence requires that the Tons Thrust, which separates the distal and proximal facies of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence, be a major, south-directed structure with a slip magnitude of > 50 - 100 km. © 2009 Geological Society of America.

These facies associations are: (1) Tidal bar, (2) Sand flat, (3) Tidal-fluvial channel, (4) Fluvial channel, (5) Shoreface to foreshore, and (6) Offshore. Correlation of the facies associations and their bounding time-significant surfaces {{has led to the}} interpretation that Clearwater Formation strata are marine and tidally-influenced coastal embayment deposits that comprise four unconformity-bounded depositional sequences (1 to 4). Each sequence is made up of one or more incised valley-fill deposits within a backstepping parasequence set, indicating deposition in the transgressive system tract. The incised valley-fill deposits of each sequence, however, are interpreted a basinward shift of deltaic facies within a larger-scale marine transgression. Together, the four depositional sequences of the Clearwater Formation therefore compose a progradational sequence set. The Clearwater Formation is the primary reservoir unit at the Cold Lake heavy oil sands area with reserves estimated at 11, 050 × 106 m 3 of heavy crude bitumen. The distribution of hydrocarbons is related primarily to the distribution of reservoir quality strata and positive structure. Strata of facies associations 2 (sand flat) and 4 (fluvial channel) are observed to have the best reservoir quality.

The Cambrian rocks of the Welsh basin form {{the greater part of}} the Dyfed Supergroup of Woodcock (1990), the base of which overlies a widespread early Cambrian unconformity and the top of which extends to the late Tremadocian (Ordovician). The Dyfed Supergroup extends onto the Midland microcraton in attenuated form, with substantial gaps in the successions locally. The correlation of the basal parts of the Dyfed Supergroup is uncertain {{because of the lack of}} suitable evidence, but Woodcock was able to interpret the supergroup as a megasequence composed of five sequences, labelled in ascending order Ia to Ie, each separated by eustatic, tectonic or volcanic events, or a combination of these (Woodcock 1990, fig. 6). <b>Sequence</b> Ib includes <b>strata</b> assigned to the later Terreneuvian and all of Series 2; the <b>strata</b> of <b>Sequence</b> Ic are those of Stage 5 and the Drumian. The bases of sequences Id and Ie are particularly strongly marked, mainly by eustatic regressions, the former in the Guzhangian and the latter near the top of the Furongian, so that Ie is essentially composed of Tremadocian strata. Based principally on his extensive work in the eastern North American sector of Avalonia, Landing (1996) divided the Cambrian to Tremadocian successions in Avalonia into ten epeirogenic sequences (Landing 1996, figs. 2, 5). He recognized equivalents of some of these sequences in selected Welsh and English successions (Landing 1996, p. 51, fig. 7), for example the base of his Sequence 6 (which corresponds to Woodcock’s Ic) and Sequence 9 (part of Woodcock’s Id). Although some correlations are doubtful, the presence in Britain of a hiatus at the level of his Sequence 5, as suggested by Landing’s analysis (1996, fig. 7), is a possibility that merits further investigation.

40|$|Sequence {{stratigraphy}} {{and sequence}} boundary interpretations for Mississippian Madison stratigraphic {{units in the}} greater Williston basin area illustrate some of the challenges for sequence stratigraphy in cratonic carbonate-evaporite depositional systems. Some {{of the most significant}} interpretation differences occur in middle Madison strata that correlate with the upper Tournaisian Frobisher-Alida interval in North Dakota which, in the present paper, is considered to represent a third-order (2 – 3 million-year) sequence. Widely published surface studies in Wyoming place a third-order sequence boundary near the base of a regional solution breccia bed that corresponds with the Frobisher-Alida evaporite. In the subsurface, it can be demonstrated that most of the evaporite formed during regressive deposition and a stratal surface near the base of the evaporite is not a viable choice for a third-order sequence boundary. The Frobisher-Alida third-order maximum regressive surface separates underlying regressive deposits from overlying transgressive deposits and it broadly corresponds with conventional sequence boundary placement. This is a subtle surface that may lie either within or on top of the Frobisher-Alida evaporite or solution breccia equivalent. The third-order maximum flooding surface is placed on a widely mappable submarine unconformity that occurs as a sharp contact on an eroded Thalassinoides-burrowed firmground or a breccia-conglomerate lag deposit.

Basin analysis indicates that the decrease in elevation was accomplished by two low-angle detachment faults which root beneath the Zhada basin and exhume mid-crustal rocks. This exhumation results from ongoing arc-parallel extension and provides accommodation for Zhada basin fill. Sequence stratigraphy shows that the basin evolved from an overfilled to an underfilled basin but that further evolution was truncated by an abrupt return to overfilled, incising conditions. This evolution is linked to progressive damming of the paleo-Sutlej River. During the underfilled portion of basin evolution, depositional environments were strongly influenced by Milancovitch cyclicity: particularly at the precession and eccentricity frequencies...|$|R
30|$|The Paleogene {{sequence}} {{begins with}} 50 -m-thick coarsegrained clastics deposited unconformably on the metamorphic rocks of the Strandja Massif. The clastic sequence passes upwards into the Upper Eocene (Özcan et al., 2010) limestone of the Soğucak formation. To the east, the lowermost sedimentary unit within the Paleogene sedimentary succession is the Gaziköy Formation (Sümengen and Terlemez, 1991) consisting of shales, siltstones, sandstones, {{and it also}} contains acidic tuff levels. The unit is bounded by the Ganos Fault to the south. The Soğucak Formation in the west, and the Gaziköy Formation in the east, are conformably overlain by the Upper Eocene (Sümengen et al., 1987; Yildiz et al., 1997) turbiditic deposits of the Keşan Formation. These deposits interfinger with the andesitic-dacitic lavas and pyroclastics forming a magmatic complex {{in the north of}} the Gulf of Saros (Fig. 1 (b)) reaching up to 800 -m thickness. Radiometric data indicate a 35 ± 0 : 9 Ma (K/Ar, Sümengen et al., 1987) age for this complex. The turbiditic deposits pass gradually upwards and northwards into marginal marine and continental sandstones-shales (the Mezardere, Osmancik and Danişment formations and the Yenimucahir Group (Ünal, 1967)). The ages of these sediments, which form the uppermost <b>strata</b> of the <b>sequence</b> of the Thrace Paleogene Basin, extend from Oligocene to Early Miocene (Siyako, 2006). In all previous studies, the contact between the Paleogene and Neogene sequences was interpreted as an angular unconformity throughout the basin. However, Elmas et al. (2008) suggested that the contact between the Paleogene and Neogene series is tectonic in many places in the area between the Ergene River and Saros Bay.|$|R
40|$|Growth strata {{analysis}} and detrital-zircon geochronology are useful applications of stratigraphy to tectonic problems. Whereas both tools {{can contribute to}} kinematic analyses of supracrustal rock bodies, growth strata are also useful for analyzing the influence of tectonics on stratigraphic architecture. This study reports: (1) a conceptual model for growth strata development; (2) stratigraphic and kinematic analyses of growth strata architectures from growth structures in southeastern Utah, the Gulf of Mexico, and northeastern Spain; and (3) the detrital-zircon geochronology of the Salinian block of central coastal California. Kinematic sequence stratigraphy subdivides growth <b>strata</b> into kinematic <b>sequences</b> that are separated by kinematic sequence boundaries. Kinematic sequences can be further partitioned into kinematic domains based on the termination patterns of strata within a kinematic sequence. Salt-related fluvial growth strata from the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Utah contain stratigraphic architectures that are unique to different kinematic domains. Offlap kinematic domains contain fluvial strata indicative of high slopes, low accommodation rates, and strong structural influence on paleocurrent direction. Onlap kinematic domains contain fluvial strata indicative of moderate slopes, high accommodation rates, and decreased structural influence on paleocurrent direction. The stratigraphic architecture of alluvial-fan thrust-belt growth strata in northeastern Spain does not display a marked correlation with kinematic domain, and is most easily interpreted using existing models for autocyclic alluvial-fan evolution. Detrital-zircon (U-Pb) geochronologic data from basement and cover rocks of Salinia suggest that Salinia originated along the southwestern margin of North America, likely {{in the vicinity of}} the Mojave Desert. The presence of Neoproterozoic and Late Archean detrital zircons in Salinian basement rocks also suggest that Salinian sediments were recycled from miogeoclinal sediments of the western margin of North America...|$|R
40|$|In {{the central}} part of the axial zone of the Pyrenees five {{distinct}} phases of folding have been distinguished from the study of minor structures. Traces of a very early phase have been found only in the northern and southern part of the region, which appear on the map as oblique fold structures, and are most prominent from the divergency of lineations and fold axes in these parts of the region. The present aspect of the mountain chain is primarily due to the effects of the main phase in which strong compression produced tight but non isoclinal folds with axial plane slaty cleavage. In the Garonne Dome the slaty cleavage was initially flatlying, in general parallel to the bedding, but occasional folds with crosscutting cleavage have been found. Steep slaty cleavage folds of the Devonian overlying the flatlying slaty cleavage folds of the Cambro-Ordovician of this dome form a beautiful example of disharmonie folding. The main phase slaty cleavage has been found to be folded in the greater part of the area investigated, generally by small minor accordion folds. In several areas two phases of refolding have been distinguished, one with a trend diagonal to the orogene, one parallel, E—W. The intensity of the refolding is strongest in the oldest <b>strata</b> of the <b>sequence.</b> The succession of phases is evident from the folding of the planes of reference and twisting of the lineations. The patterns of the stereographic plots of data do not always show clear evidence of the succession. Knick zones accompanied the end of the Hercynian history of the mountain chain which mainly consisted of arching of the orogene, together with faulting and blockwise tilt. This period of deformation shows several characteristics of tensional stress...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{study on the}} geological characteristics of a multi-coalbed reservoir using coal cores collected from well drilling tests in Bide-Santang Basin, China. The study focuses on {{the investigation of the}} coalbed methane (CBM) -bearing property, porosity and permeability, sealability of capping rocks, and groundwater characteristics in coal seams, providing the experimental information on the control function of <b>sequence</b> <b>strata</b> for the coalbed methane. This reservoir is comprised {{of a large number of}} coalbeds and exhibits many distinctive geological characteristics of a CBM reservoir, such as high CBM content, complex vertical volatility of CBM content, vertical discontinuous distribution of porosity and permeability, strong sealing capping property and many vertical water-bearing systems, etc. The investigation shows that the unattached multiple superposed CBM-bearing system (UMSCS), which formed the unique multi-coalbed CBM reservoir, can be identified in the study area. Depending on the development scale of vertically unattached CBM-bearing coal seams, the CBM reservoir in the study area can be classified as simple UMSCS and complex UMSCS. The former, typically appearing in Zhuzang syncline and Agong syncline, exhibits the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics in terms of less coal seams, much weaker sealability of capping rocks, higher CBM content, and many vertical water-bearing systems. The latter, typically represented by Shuigonghe syncline and Santang syncline, shows the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics with a large number of coal seams, strong sealing capping property, and reasonably high CBM content. For simple UMSCS reservoirs, a sublevel exploitation method should be adopted for CBM exploitation in order to minimize the effect caused by larger variation of the reservoir energy in different systems. For complex UMSCS reservoirs, one effective way for CBM exploitation is to fracture virtual reservoir (mainly key sandstone member) to depressurize it uniformly and thus achieve large-scale discharging and mining in several adjacent CBM-bearing subsystems...|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} {{collects}} {{a number of}} papers mainly reflecting discussions during the ‘tectonics, sedimentation and surface processes’ sessions (TSSP) organized at recent EGU conferences (2012, 2013, 2014), as well as related studies that have appeared in Earth Surface Processes and Landforms over the last two years. The sedimentary record has long been used to invert for deformation at all scales and in all tectonics settings. Growth <b>strata,</b> sediment provenance, <b>sequence</b> stratigraphy and changing depositional environments have all provided first-order constraints on quantifying deformation at a range of spatial and temporal scales. At the same time, these studies have motivated much work on the influence of tectonics on both sedimentation patterns and basin fill successions. However, relatively few studies have considered the whole integrated system of catchment erosion, fluvial transport and sediment deposition together, often concentrating on either the basin or the catchment separately. Recently however, methodological progress in quantifying rates of surface processes in the upstream erosion and transfer zones, as well as revived interest in the couplings between surface processes, tectonics and climate, have made it possible to renew our understanding of the interactions between sedimentation and tectonics {{within the framework of the}} whole integrated sediment routing system. Although the studies within this special issue are only a fraction of the work presented over the last five years of the TSSP sessions, the manuscripts presented here reflect a selection of the broad content and diversity of studies that integrate both sedimentation and surface processes to understand deformation in the context of sedimentary systems. They highlight and are organized into three active challenges of the field: (1) tectonics and climate into landscapes; (2) signal propagation within sediment routing systems; and (3) modeling of tectonic and surface processes.

40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of a}} conference paper published in Landslides and engineered slopes: protecting society through improved understanding: [URL] Passo della Morte in the Italian Eastern Alps a geomorphological survey has identified potential instability of the valley side slope {{that could result in}} a debris/rock avalanche, which would threaten the Tagliamento River. A nationally important road passes through a tunnel 130 m long behind the potentially unstable slope. The <b>stratum</b> comprises a <b>sequence</b> of Limestone layers, dipping in the slope direction towards the river. Although currently there is no clear evidence of movement, the geological setting indicates a predisposition to instability that could involve a large landslide and extremely fast deformations can be foreseen. To appraise the physical characteristics of the rock mass and to provide an early warning of instability, monitoring instrumentation has been installed and monitored since late 2010. Extensometers, MEMS, TDR cables, a ver-tical inclinometer, a seismic station to monitor Limestone rock mass deformation generated micro-tremors and an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system have been installed. The instruments are connected to real-time recording and transmitting units. The paper describes the geological setting and associated potential modes of instability. It details the design of the instrument installations and presents results obtained to date. In particular, the novel acoustic emission monitoring approach is described including sensor design, method of operation and comparison of the measured AE response with the deformation measurements and detected micro-tremor trends. Initial results indicate a strong response of the acoustic sensors to rainfall events. No sig-nificant rock mass deformations have been detected at depth within the slope to date, although a surface ex-tensometer has shown widening of a bedding tension crack. Upgrading of the instrumentation system is ongo-ing and it is planned to continue monitoring for the foreseeable future...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the microbial communities of deep terrestrial subsurface environments associated with high-organic-matter coal and lignite bearing <b>strata.</b> A sedimentary <b>sequence</b> from the Waikato Basin, New Zealand consisting of interbedded organic-rich layers, sandstones, siltstones and mudstones was drilled. Viable microbial communities were enumerated using most probable number (MPN) series with media selective for a) general heterotrophs b) sulfate-reducing bacteria c) iron(III) - and manganese(IV) -reducing bacteria d) acetogens e) methanogens and f) lignite-reducing bacteria. Subcultures were made from positive MPN enrichment cultures and representative strains were isolated from the sediments. Selected isolates were tested for their metabolic capabilities and physiological characteristics and Molecular genetic techniques were used to investigate the microbial diversity. Viable counts for active metabolic groups ranged from 104 to 105 cells gsed" 1 and representatives from 5 bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacterid) were detected. Community size and diversity did not decrease with depth and viable microbes were present in deeply buried and previously heated and possibly sterilised sediments. A large and diverse set of isolates was obtained from the sediments. The collection included several genera previously detected in the deep terrestrial biosphere (Acetobacterium, Sporotalea, Microbacterium, Acidovorax, Sphingomonas) and also genera not typically associated with the deep biosphere (sulfurospirilium). Isolates had a wide range of metabolic capabilities and the collection includes both fermentative and respiring strains. There was also a good overlap between organisms detected using molecular genetic methods and cultivated organisms indicating that these may be important bacteria in situ. There is a substantial and diverse community of Bacteria inhabiting the sediments of the Waikato Basin. Although Archaea were detected in the sediments, none were isolated. The presence of these microbial communities implies that carbon and energy sources must persist within these sediments over millions of years.
