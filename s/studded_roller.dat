40|$|Since 1987 the Dept. of Agricultural Engineering and the Swedish Institute of Agricultural Engineering {{have been}} working on a project aiming at {{increasing}} the precision in and the effects of fertilizer spreading. This part of the work concerns an investigation of the behaviour of granular flow from a <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder. Visual studies through a transparent housing of the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder indicated that the granular flow could be divided into an active layer (the depth of which equals the stud height), a semi active layer (between the active layer and close to the base, flap) which is dragged along with the active layer, and a passive layer (directly against the base flap) where no continuous flow occurs (see Fig. 2. 1). Figure 2. 1. Active, semi active and passive layers in a <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder. Empirical flow models showed that the mean mass flow from the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder depended on angular velocity of roller, stud height, base flap setting and median particle size. The empirical models also show that the mass flow will vary with inclination of feeder. Mechanistic flow models based on a theoretical analysis of the flow from the active and the semi active layer in the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder showed good correlation with measured data. Analysis of the regression parameters and the residuals indicated that the models give a useful description of the flow from the feeder. The angular velocity of the roller and the stud height was found to have the biggest influence on the magnitude of the mass flow. Stud height changes both the general level of the mass flow at a given setting as well as the response of the mass flow to a change in the angular velocity of the feeder. The base flap setting was found to have a much lesser influence on the mass flow than stud height. A change in base flap setting changed the general level of the mass flow at a given setting of the feeder to a much lesser degree than a corresponding change in stud height. Furthermore, the response of the mass flow to a change in angular velocity of the feeder does not change with base flap setting. The influence of changes in particle size distribution was marginal. An explanation of this is that changes in particle size mean changes in internal friction. Since the internal friction, according to the theoretically based hypotheses, only affects the semi active layer, large changes in mass flow due to moderate changes in particle size distribution cannot be expected. The flow from the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder will change as a function of inclination. This is a well established fact in the literature. This work show that the effects of inclination is not neglectable in a high precision spreading system where application rates are varied locally on the field. The empirical models point to a change in mass flow of ca. 0. 8 % per degree incline. The work also indicates that the mass flow from the feeder is dependent on the angle from the inlet into the feeder to the outlet (see chapter 1 "NOTATION" and Fig. 1. 1 for definitions of angles). This angle will change as a function of inclination and as a function of base flap design (eg. base flap length). According to the mechanistic flow models, {{the main part of the}} flow stems from the active layer. Mass flow variations due to inclination affect the semi active layer. As a result of the work a new idea for feeding fertilizer with the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder was generated. If the semi active layer could be removed, the part of the feeder which is subjected to influence of inclination and friction would probably vanish. By increasing the stud height to provide enough flow and adjusting the base flap setting to zero this idea could be evaluated. The work also identified several areas where knowledge is lacking. Examples of such areas are correlation between angle of repose and angle of internal friction, theory for granular flow and effects of confined spaces on bulk density...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} part of {{a project}} {{initiated}} by the Swedish Riksdag, TYP 93. The goal of this work is to find the influence of sloping ground on massflow and spreader pattern of fertilizer spreaders. If there is any influence, a proposal of testing method is to be given. The change in drop point area when inclining a centrifugal broadcaster was calculated in a computer. Two fertilizer spreaders were used, Bogballe E 1000 and Amazone ZA-F 603. The drop point area was not changing when inclining the Bogballe E 1000. When Amazone ZA-F 603 was inclined sideways, the area changed with 3, 5 %/degree inclination. Experiments done by the National Machinery Testing Institute (NMTI) showed that the massflow were changing when inclining both Bogballe E 1000 and Amazone ZA-F 603 sideways. Further investigations are needed in this area. The change in massflow when inclining full-width spreaders is well-documented in the literature. The change in massflow when the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder is inclined perpendicular to the roller axis is 0, 8 %/degree inclination. Experiments done by the NMTI supports the literature. A certification is therefore possible. The certification should preferably be done when inclining the full-width spreader 10 degrees perpendicular to the roller axis. The influence of inclination on the spreader pattern from the centrifugal distributor was studied with a computer simulation model and by experiments. The greatest change in spreader pattern was found for broadcasters inclining on horizontal ground. But there is also a big change in spreader pattern when the broadcaster is driven on sloping ground. Sideways inclination causes bigger variation coefficient in the spreader pattern than inclining the spreader forward/backwards. This points towards a possible certification in this area. The change in spreader pattern from full-width spreaders mainly comes from the change in massflow when inclining the <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> feeder. There are no arguments for having a certification here...|$|E
40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The <b>studded</b> <b>roller</b> is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|E

50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (<b>studs)</b> of the <b>rollers.</b> Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and bearing ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (<b>studs)</b> of the <b>rollers.</b> The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
