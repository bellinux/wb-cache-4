40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} the test configuration on the noise generated by axial flow fans employed for automotive cooling systems. Different test configurations may be employed depending on the design phase. Discrepancies are often observed between the results of different tests, resulting in difficulties in transferring and generalizing the measured SPL. In the present case {{the effect of the}} mounting system (free-discharge wooden panel versus test plenum with zero and design downstream pressure) on the irregular growth of the tonal noise during <b>speed</b> <b>ramps</b> is considered. The spectral decomposition method applied to the measured SPL spectra has been used to obtain the propagation function which has been compared with the scaled SPL at the blade passage harmonics.

50|$|Flux braking {{is another}} method, based on motor losses, for {{handling}} an overrunning load. When braking {{in the drive}} system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the magnetizing current component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the direct torque control principle. With DTC the inverter is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified <b>speed</b> <b>ramp.</b> This is very different to the DC injection braking typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.|$|E

30|$|At {{the start}} of the test, the vessel was charged with known volumes of oil and brine. The liquids were then mixed at 650  rpm well above the speed at which {{separation}} was observed during cyclopentane tests. Gas was then added to maintain pressure at 1100 psi while maintaining temperature at 70  °F. Mixing was continued for 10 – 30  min before cooling was started. At hydrate formation onset the gas counter was reset and desired amount of gas was added to generated amount of hydrates. Gas supply was then cut off and the system was allowed to stabilize to a new pressure. Shaft <b>speed</b> <b>ramping</b> was then performed to establish the rheology of the flowing hydrate slurry. Shaft <b>speed</b> <b>ramping</b> involved increasing the speed from 600 to 800  rpm, decreasing the speed from 800 to 200  rpm, and then back to 600  rpm. This ramp ensured laminar regime at low shaft speeds and also checking separation behavior of the slurry. Ramping back to 600  rpm compares the slurry behavior before and after the ramp. Hysteresis provides useful information about yield stress behavior of the slurry.|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{breakdown}} in mineral insulating oil constitutes {{a critical part}} in the insulation of high voltage apparatus such as transformer. This paper presents an experimental investigation on transformer oil dynamic breakdown characteristics when subjected to AC voltage.

30|$|Heterogenization: {{detection}} and avoidance Cyclopentane {{tests showed that}} the generated slurries can be dispersed or segregated slurries. The type of slurry formed may depend on the fluid mixture charged to the system, operating conditions and additives used. Figure  6 shows a hypothetical torque response during hydrate formation. Heterogeneous slurries may result from severe agglomeration or settling of hydrate particles. Figure  6 also shows the effect of some unit operations and experimental conditions on the resulting viscosity and slurry type. On the other hand, torque signature may give indications whether the slurry is dispersed/ homogenous (no concentration gradient) or heterogeneous (with concentration gradient). This is important because viscosity can only be established with homogeneous systems. During shaft speed ramping, if solids agglomerate towards the mixing blade, torque is expected to rise. However, if the agglomerating solids {{move away from the}} blades, i.e., toward the wall, torque measurements decrease. Figure  7 shows a hypothetical toque response during shaft <b>speed</b> <b>ramp</b> down.|$|E

A nine blade rotor has been operated at free discharge conditions and in four geometrical configurations in which different kinds of tonal noise generating mechanisms are present: large-scale inlet turbulent structures, tip-gap flow, turbulent wakes, and rotor-stator interaction. The measurements have been taken in a hemi-anechoic chamber at constant rotational speed and, in order to vary the acoustic source strength, during low angular acceleration, linear <b>speed</b> <b>ramps.</b> In order to avoid erroneous quantitative evaluations if the acoustic propagation effects are not considered, the acoustic response functions of the different test configurations have been computed {{by means of the}} spectral decomposition method.

Despite of the wide literature on theoretical and experimental methods for increasing engine power, {{there is a general}} lack of data about tests on racing engine performance due to the obvious manufacturers' reluctance to spread information, especially for recent high technological level applications. This paper, instead, presents all the main results of the experimental tests conducted on a motorbike engine both in the original stock arrangement and in a modified configuration proposed in compliance with the Technical Regulations of the 2007 FIM Road Racing Supersport Italian Championship (CIV). Traditional testing techniques (steady-flow discharge coefficients measurements and chassis dynamometer tests performed in the slow <b>speed</b> <b>ramp</b> mode) are chosen to reduce time and costs and to limit engine wearing while obtaining an acceptable degree of accuracy. It is also proved that the tests to assess the improvements obtained with design changes could not have been completed in the steady-state mode using a single engine because of the short life cycle of racing engines due to wearing, which would have altered the comparisons.

40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Freeway ramp design speed criteria contained in current American Association of Highway and Transportation Official (AASHTO) and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) design policies have been traced through roughly 50 years of technical literature. The evolution of design speed criteria has been documented and technical rational leading to periodic changes has been included. TxDOT ramp design speed criteria are, essentially, the AASHTO criteria. The origins of driver acceleration and deceleration rates, which are built into the AASHTO criteria, are experimental studies performed during the late thirties. Several studies have raised questions about the appropriateness of the AASHTO minimum allowable ramp design speed, which is 50 percent of the freeway design speed. Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of high-speed ramp lengths designed by AASHTO criteria. A conceptual data collection plan has been designed to provide information that will answer questions regarding current criteria. Additionally, a nationwide survey of ramp design agencies indicates that (1) there is a variety of different design policies; (2) most designers have concern for entrance ramps, as opposed to exits; and (3) safety is the most commonly used evaluation measure. 17.

Non-invasive measurements of pump impeller rotational speed (omega), motor power (P), and {{pulse width modulation}} signal acquired from the pump controller were used as inputs to the model. The model was validated {{over a wide range}} of <b>speed</b> <b>ramp</b> studies, including (i) healthy (C 1), variations in (ii) heart contractility (C 2); (iii) afterload (C 2, C 3, C 4), and (iv) preload (C 5, C 6, C 7). Linear regression analysis between estimated and extracted mean inlet pressure obtained from in vivo animal data (greyhound dogs, N = 3) resulted in a highly significant correlation coefficients (R(2) = 0. 957, 0. 961, 0. 958, 0. 963, 0. 940, 0. 946, and 0. 959) and mean absolute errors of (e = 1. 604, 2. 688, 3. 667, 3. 990, 2. 791, 3. 215, and 3. 225 mmHg) during C 1, C 2, C 3, C 4, C 5, C 6, and C 7, respectively. The proposed model was also used to design a controller to regulate mean diastolic pump inlet pressure using non-invasively measured omega and P. In the presence of model uncertainty, the controller was able to track and settle to the desired input within a finite number of sampling periods and minimal error (0. 92 mmHg).

BackgroundIn CF-LVAD patients, the dynamic interaction of device speed, left and right ventricular decompression, and valve function can be assessed during an echocardiography-monitored <b>speed</b> <b>ramp</b> test. MethodsWe devised a unique ramp test protocol to be routinely used {{at the time of}} discharge for speed optimization and/or if device malfunction was suspected. The patient's left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, frequency of aortic valve opening, valvular insufficiency, blood pressure, and CF-LVAD parameters were recorded in increments of 400 rpm from 8, 000 rpm to 12, 000 rpm. The results of the speed designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power were calculated. ResultsFifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, and speed was changed in 17 (61 %) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 ± 211 rpm. Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis, and 10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were then treated with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergent transplantation. Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis, but none of the remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension slope >− 0. 16.

40|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of genomes, the use of positive charge increases, on average, approaching protein N-termini. Such charged residues slow ribosomes by interacting with the negatively charged exit tunnel. This has been proposed to be selectively advantageous as it provides an elongation <b>speed</b> <b>ramp</b> at translational starts. Positive charges, however, are known to orientate proteins in membranes by the positive-inside rule whereby excess charge lies on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Which of these two models better explains the N-terminal loading of positively charged amino acids? We find strong evidence that the tendency for average positive charge use to increase at termini is exclusively due to membrane protein topology: 1) increasing N-terminal positive charge is not found in cytosolic proteins, but in transmembrane ones with cytosolic N-termini, with signal sequences contributing additional charge; 2) positive charge density at N-termini corresponds to the length of cytoplasmically exposed transmembrane tails, its usage increasing just up until the membrane; 3) membrane-related patterns are repeated at C-termini, where no ramp is expected; and 4) N-terminal positive charge patterns are no different from those seen internally in proteins in membrane-associated domains. The overall apparent increase in positive charge across all N-termini results from membrane proteins using positive charge adjacent to the cytosolic leaflet, combined with a skewed distribution of where N-termini cross the plasma membrane; 5) while Escherichia coli was predicted to have a 5 ′ ribosomal occupancy ramp of at least 31 codons, in contrast to what is seen in yeast, we find in ribosomal footprinting data no evidence for such a ramp. In sum, we find no need to invoke a translational ramp to explain the rising positive charge densities at N-termini. The membrane orientation model makes a full account of the trend...|$|E

40|$|We {{used the}} two-microelectrode voltage clamp {{technique}} and tetrodotoxin (TTX) {{to investigate the}} possible occurrence of slow inactivation of sodium channels in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers under physiologic conditions. The increase in net outward current during prolonged (5 - 20 s) step depolarizations (range - 70 to + 5 mV) following the application of TTX is time dependent, being maximal immediately following depolarization, and declining thereafter towards a steady value. To eliminate the possibility that this time-dependent current was due to inadequate voltage control of these multicellular preparations early during square clamp pulses, we also used slowly depolarizing voltage clamp ramps (range 5 - 100 mV/s) to ensure control of membrane potential. TTX-sensitive current also was observed with these voltage ramps; the time dependence of this current was demonstrated by {{the reduction of the}} peak current magnitude as the <b>ramp</b> <b>speed</b> was reduced.
