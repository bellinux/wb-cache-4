40|$|A {{combination}} of changing migration patterns and US immigration restrictions acted {{to shift the}} male-female balance in many {{ethnic groups in the}} early 20 th Century. I use this variation to study the consequences of changing <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> for the children of immigrants. Immigrant <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> affected the second generation for a number of reasons, most importantly because immigrants and their children typically married in the same ethnic group. The results suggest that higher <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> defined as the number of men per woman, had a large positive impact on the likelihood of female marriage. More surprisingly, second-generation male marriage rates were also an increasing function of immigrant <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> The results also suggest that higher <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> raised male earnings and the incomes of parents with young children. The interpretation of these findings is complicated by changes in extended family structure associated with changing <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> On balance, however, the results are consistent with theories where higher <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> increase male competition for women in the marriage market. ...|$|R

5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis.

This paper uses variation in immigrant flows as a natural experiment to study the effect of <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> on the children and grandchildren of immigrants. The flow of immigrants affected the second generation marriage market because second generation marriages were mostly endogamous, i. e., {{to members of the}} same ethnic group. The empirical results suggest that high <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> had a large positive effect on the likelihood of female marriage, and a large negative effect on female labor force participation. Perhaps surprisingly, the marriage rates of second generation men appear to be a slightly increasing function of immigrant <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> Higher <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> also appear to have raised male earnings and the incomes of parents with young children.

50|$|W.D. Hamilton {{hypothesized}} that non-Fisherian <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> can result when relatives interact with one another.

40|$|The {{proximity}} of mates can influence mating opportunities and {{the quantity and}} quality of offspring, especially in dioecious plant species. Progeny <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> modulated by environmental conditions is one of the most radical ways in which offspring quality may be influenced, yet it has rarely been reported in plants. A mechanism proposed to influence progeny <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in dioecious plants involves competition between female- and male-determining microgametophytes (certation) as a result of variation in pollination intensity. However, the role of selective fertilization in dioecious plants is controversial and has not been demonstrated under field conditions. Here we investigate whether natural variation in the spatial arrangement of females and males influences pollination intensity and progeny <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in the wind-pollinated herb Rumex nivalis. Based on previous experimental manipulation of pollination intensity in this species, we predicted that maternal parents in close proximity to males would produce more strongly female-biased progeny <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> We tested this prediction in six alpine populations in Switzerland by measuring the distance between focal females and neighboring males and assessing pollen loads and seed <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of maternal parents. In four of the six populations, females positioned in close proximity to males captured more pollen and exhibited more female-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> Our results demonstrate that demographic aspects of the maternal mating environment can influence progeny <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> The most probable explanation for biased primary <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in Rumex is selective fertilization resulting from pollen tube competition...|$|R

5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b> N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b> The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{proportion}} of women to men in the Indian population is disturbingly low and continues to decline. This decline {{is a reflection of}} sex differentials in mortality, arising out of the unequal access women have to life-sustaining inputs like food, nutrition and health care. Female labor participation (FLP) in productive activi-ties is an important determinant of such an access, and has been recognized in literature as such. However, the conventional analyses of the impact of FLP on <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> do not incorporate the role of cultural factors. This paper examines the effect of FLP on juvenile <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in India using district-level data. The analysis introduces three new elements: (i) incorporation of the kinship variable to take cultural factors into account, (ii) disaggregation of the juvenile <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> into <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> for the 0 - 4 - and 5 - 9 -year age group, and (iii) separate analysis of the relationship for tribals, Scheduled Castes {{and the rest of the}} population.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of wild vertebrate populations are determined by mechanisms that are directly influenced by environmental characteristics. The Trivers–Willard (TWH) and extrinsic modification (EMH) hypotheses postulate differing determinants of mammalian offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> TWH states that mothers allocate resources according to their current condition and sex-specific offspring costs. EMH states that environmental forces that affect maternal condition determine offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> independently of maternal tactics of sex-biased allocation. We statistically assessed support {{for each of these}} hypotheses using long-term life histories of the allied rock-wallaby, Petrogale assimilis; a continuously breeding, polygynous, weakly dimorphic marsupial. We showed that birth <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> were equal and independent of maternal and environmental conditions. However, secondary <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> were male-biased under good environmental conditions and for high quality mothers or mothers in good condition. Sex differences in offspring survival contributed to these biases: (1) environmental conditions strongly influenced survival to pouch emergence (in support of EMH) and (2) maternal quality affected survival to the end of maternal care (in support of TWH). Environmental effects on survival were more important than maternal factors over the entire period of maternal care and contributed most to male-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> at pouch emergence. In contrast, maternal mass was the best predictor of <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> at the end of maternal care—the life history stage where offspring body mass differed between the sexes.

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
