A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

However, she said that they assume that she is {{currently}} busy and will not work with them. She said with knowing Wonder would {{like to work with}} her was a dream come true. She said she will continue to collaborate with Alicia Keys on her upcoming album, and she would be flattered to work with Knowles as her voice is unparalleled. Nicki Minaj was also someone who she would like to collaborate with on the album, but did not get the chance. Her vocal ability is often compared to Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Beyoncé Knowles, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera and Annie Lennox.|$|E
25|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, the first mountain {{stage of the}} race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There {{was a lot of}} crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stay in the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni felt bad about giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.|$|E

500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo's {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within much of the middle to lower income strata of Chongqing society, and made Bo a star with both conventional Marxists and neo-leftists. Bo won praise for returning the city to what some called China's 'true socialist heritage' by de-emphasizing material wealth, and evoked nostalgia to the social egalitarianism that existed during Mao's time. Some retirees were particularly inspired and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pass on [...] "revolutionary spirit" [...] to their children, while others participated {{as a means to}} praise the Communist Party for the country's economic progress.|$|E

500|$|All outdoor {{canvassing}} {{scenes were}} {{shot in a}} neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, outside the Parks and Recreation studio. Michael Schur <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> establish the type of groundwork public servants often had to conduct in a small town. Seth Gordon sought to make the canvassing scenes as realistic as possible, so he allowed {{a large amount of}} improvisation among the actors. The Pawnee residents who are vocally opposed to parks were based on real-life California residents the Parks and Recreation producers encountered who opposed the construction of parks in their hometown. One such group, [...] "The Committee for a Better Park", was actually a group of residents opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the Parks producers while writing [...] "Canvassing".|$|E

Parks co-creator Michael Schur <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E

It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, [...] "The creators of the show called me, <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put me in as this new character, that I’d be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I’m still playing the straight guy, but he’s kind of got a bit of a quirk to him." [...] The writing staff for The Office are fans of The Wire, and have referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said [...] "New Boss" [...] was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him [...] "a really interesting and great foil for Michael". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be [...] "incredibly nice and incredibly funny".|$|E

Vazgen Sargsyan was the main target of the group and the other deaths were said to be unintended. According to reporters who witnessed the shooting, the men went up to Sargsyan and said, [...] "Enough of drinking our blood," [...] to which Sargsyan calmly responded, [...] "Everything is being done for you and the future of your children." [...] Vazgen Sargsyan was hit several times. Hunanyan claimed that the eight deaths and dozens of injuries in the attack were all [...] "innocent victims" [...] except for the case of Sargsyan, who he said had [...] "failed the nation". Anna Israelyan, an eyewitness journalist, stated that [...] "the first shots were fired directly at Vazgen Sargsyan at a distance of one to two meters" [...] and, in her words, [...] "it was impossible that he would have survived."

500|$|A state {{grand jury}} indicted Cisneros, Martínez, Garza, Olivarez, and Puentes Pizaña on July 28, 1993. Defense {{attorneys}} <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move the trial out of Cameron County because {{the case had}} attracted {{a lot of media}} attention in the local area. Martínez' defense attorney said he wanted to file a motion to change the venue, and have his client tried separately from the other accused. He also said that he would try to suppress a statement made by Martínez after she was arrested in April. On August 12, in a packed courtroom at the 357th State District Court house in Brownsville, Cisneros and Martínez pleaded not guilty to the murder charges. Garza also entered a not-guilty plea, and stood with the accused during the court session. The judge agreed to remove [...] "La Curandera" [...] (Healer-Fortune Teller) from Martínez' name on the indictment after the defense complained that the alias was a media creation. The judge set the hearing date for pre-trial motions for October 7, and the trial for November 8. On September 20, defense attorneys for Martínez and Garza filed motions to suppress statements their clients had made since March. Martínez's attorney said she did not understand her right to have a lawyer because she is not fluent in English, and that her arrest was unlawful. The defense asked the judge to discard the video and wire tap recordings because they claimed that their client was involuntarily coerced to make statements that incriminated her, and thus violated the Miranda warnings. Martínez' defense requested a court-appointed translator, the elimination of the indictment, and a severance to have their client tried separately. In addition, Garza's defense said that their client's constitutional rights were violated when he made his statements. They also said that Garza's encounter with Martínez after Fischer's murder was recorded without his knowledge.|$|E

500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
