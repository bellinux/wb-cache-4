5000|$|The Evans balance {{measures}} susceptibility indirectly {{by referring}} to a calibration standard of known susceptibility. The most convenient compound for this purpose is mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4, which has a susceptibility of 16.44×10−6 (±0.5%) CGS at 20 °C. Another common calibration standard is Ni(en)SO which has a susceptibility of 1.104 x 10−5 erg G−2 cm−3. Three readings of the meter are needed, of an empty tube, R0 of the tube filled with calibrant and of the tube filled with the sample, Rs. Some balances have an auto-tare feature that {{eliminates the need for}} the R0 measurement. Accuracy depends somewhat on homogenous packing of the sample. The first two provide a calibration constant, C. The mass susceptibility in grams is calculated aswhere L is the length of the <b>sample,</b> <b>C</b> is the calibration constant (usually 1 if it has been calibrated), and m is its mass in grams. The reading for the empty tube is needed because the tube glass is diamagnetic. There is a V term multiplied by an A term in the most general form of the equation. These two terms (V∗A) are colletively added to the numerator in the above equation. The V term is the volume susceptibility of air (0.029 x 10−6 erg G−2 [...] cm−3) and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. These two terms can be ignored for solid samples, yielding the original equation written above.|$|E

40|$|The cooling {{properties}} of a locally formulated coolant (<b>sample</b> <b>C)</b> vis-a-vis, its boiling characteristics and {{specific heat capacity}} were investigated along side with a common coolant-water (as sample A) and a commercial coolant (sample B). The {{results of the investigation}} showed that <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> gave the best performance compared to the other two samples A and B: the boiling points of <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> was 1100 C, sample A 1000 C, and sample B 1010 C. This means that the possibility of a boil-out of <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> from the radiator is little compared to samples A and B.

30|$|Slip-dependent {{frictional}} behavior also changes systematically {{according to}} the content of smectite or clay minerals, from slip hardening of sandstone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2571, through quasi steady-state slip of tuff <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 9087 and siltstone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 9073, to slight slip weakening of siltstone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2652 and distinct slip weakening of claystone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2516 (Figure  4). Such systematic change in slip-dependent frictional behavior {{according to the}} content of clay minerals is also consistent with the results of previous studies (e.g., Saffer and Marone 2003; Moore and Lockner 2011). It should be noted, however, that slip-dependent frictional behavior is only transient until a steady-state is reached. Clay-poor gouge samples likely experienced substantial grain-size reduction and compaction, resulting in slip hardening (e.g., Morrow and Byerlee 1989). In contrast, in clay-rich gouge samples, initial compaction hardening was likely followed by weakening due to preferred alignment of clay minerals along shear planes (e.g., Moore and Lockner 2004).|$|E

30|$|Our {{triaxial}} friction experiments {{revealed that}} samples of different lithologies {{are not only}} different in steady-state frictional strength, but also in slip-dependent frictional behavior (Figures  4 and 7; Table  3). These differences in frictional strength and behavior according to lithology are attributable to their different clay mineral contents, in particular, their smectite contents, as discussed below. The content of clay minerals differs according to lithology; it is 6  wt% in sandstone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2571, ≈ 17  wt% in tuff <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 9087, 29 to 34  wt% in siltstone samples C 2652 and C 9073, and 42  wt% in claystone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2516 (Table  2). Except for sandstone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2571, in which smectite is absent, smectite is the most abundant clay mineral in the samples, comprising 68 to 76  wt% of the total clay minerals (Table  2).|$|E
30|$|All samples {{exhibited}} velocity-strengthening {{behavior as}} shown {{by an increase in}} μ when Vaxial was increased, and vice versa (Figure  4).

As already described in Takahashi et al. (2013), claystone <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> 2516 exhibited an asymptotic change in μ following instantaneous and decayed responses after a stepwise change in Vaxial (Figure  4). Such frictional behavior had also been observed during friction experiments on serpentinite (Reinen et al. 1991; Takahashi et al. 2011) and has been ascribed to a flow component during frictional sliding (Takahashi et al. 2011, 2013).|$|E

To compare {{the sensitivity of}} the m-PCR with conven- tional culture techniques, the same spiked stool samples were cultured on an antibiotic free Co- lumbia blood agar using the filtration technique. The detection limit of conventional culture me- thod was 105 cells/gm of stool for C. concisus and 106 cells/gm of stool for C. jejuni and C. coli. The m-PCR was applied to test 127 faecal samples from children with gastroenteritis and the results were compared with the conventional bacterial cultures data. By this m-PCR technique, C. jejuni was detected in 7 <b>samples,</b> <b>C.</b> coli in 2 <b>samples,</b> and <b>C.</b> concisus in 7 samples. However, the conven- tional culture results for these samples were 6 for C. jejuni, 2 for C. coli and only one sample was positive for C. concisus. In total, 19 samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. by m-PCR while only 9 samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. by culture. In conclusion, m-PCR is more sen- sitive than the culture technique to detect C. concisus and other fastidious campylobacters in faeces...|$|R

40|$|Genotyping {{studies on}} the source and human {{infection}} potential of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water have been almost exclusively conducted in industrialized nations. In this study, 50 source water samples and 30 tap water samples were collected in Shanghai, China, and analyzed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1623. To find a cost-effective method to replace the filtration procedure, the water samples were also concentrated by calcium carbonate flocculation (CCF). Of the 50 source water samples, 32 % were positive for Cryptosporidium and 18 % for Giardia by Method 1623, whereas 22 % were positive for Cryptosporidium and 10 % for Giardia by microscopy of CCF concentrates. When CCF was combined with PCR for detection, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium (28 %) {{was similar to that}} obtained by Method 1623.

Understanding whether certain patterns of themes exist could help inform a customized strength-based development curriculum in relation to internship preparation. Three data sets including 964 cases from a selective liberal arts college (C), 14. 7 million cases from Gallup (G), and 6. 1 million Gallup women (GW) were analyzed using frequency tables, chi-square tests for independence, and relative risk ratios. ^ While one of the most frequent and three of the least frequent themes overlap across samples, statistically significant differences exist in the patterns for the most and least frequent themes in <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> as compared to samples G and GW. Part of the methodology involved calculating relative risk ratios for <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> compared to samples G and GW. The five most frequent themes and statistically significant RR ratios for <b>Sample</b> <b>C</b> were Input (84. 55 %, 61. 99 %), Empathy (75. 72 %, 26. 43 %), Learner, Restorative (61. 56 %, 51. 96 %), and Intellection (125. 4 %, 116. 78 %) and the five least frequent themes were Command (68. 12 % (GW)), Significance, Belief (- 63. 90 %, - 65. 90 %), Arranger (- 70. 01 %, - 67. 37 %), and Self-Assurance (- 43. 26 % (G)). ^ Themes in <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> fell into the following four StrengthFinder domain areas: Relationship Building (32. 84 %), Strategic Thinking (32. 78 %), Executing (23. 49 %), and Influencing (10. 89 %). Three of the five most frequent themes in <b>sample</b> <b>C</b> were part of the Strategic Thinking domain area and three of the five least frequent themes were part of the Influencing domain area.
