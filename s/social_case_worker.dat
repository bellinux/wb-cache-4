40|$|The lens {{model is}} a {{representation}} of judgment in situations for which multiple cues relate to a criterion in the environment. Typically, the {{model is a}}pplied where the judgment and criterion are independent. For example, a judgment {{of whether or not}} it will rain does not impact whether it does in fact do so. In some situations, however, the two are dependent. A <b>social</b> <b>case</b> <b>worker</b> who judges the likelihood of a recurrence of maltreatment of a child will use this judgment {{to decide whether or not}} to intervene in the situation. This intervention is purposefully intended to impact the criterion of recurrence. The present paper presents a theory applying the lens model for assessing performance in these common situations. The theory is then demonstrated using actual judgments of the need for protective service intervention as determined by child welfare workers in the state of Minnesota...|$|E

Families in the above agency have consistently complained for several years of the system of clothing distribution. Many felt it degrading to be deprived of an opportunity to make a choice. Others were of the opinion that given {{the same amount of money}} spent by the agency they could have shopped to their own individual taste and made better investments. In other words, it was evident that families had not accepted the clothing room favourably. Clients and workers together were aware that clothing received through the agency was poor in quality and insufficient in quantity. The <b>social</b> <b>case</b> <b>worker</b> was also conscious of the clients’ emotional conflict which evolved from the necessity of clients visiting the agency’s clothing room to collect the needed items. Many clients were fearful of meeting friends or neighbours from whom they wished to conceal their association with the agency.

The economizing (Miller & Power, 2013) of social work is indeed happening. The overall purpose of this PhD is to investigate how this results in the development of new management accounting practices (Chapman, Cooper, & Miller, 2009). My hope is first of all, that such knowledge will give detailed insights into how it is possible for social work professionals to be both accountable to the needs of the child and the budget of their department. Secondly, I hope this knowledge will make visual some of the management accounting practises that enables the children to get the help, they need and not only those management accounting practises that happen to the detriment of the children and clients (Brodkin, 2011; Lipsky, 2010; Munro, 2004). Doing the PhD. thesis within the field of management accounting research hopefully enables me to do, what Power and Miller (2013, p. 592) asks of us: “ [...] . scholars of organizations and management need to view accounting practices as central to their discipline rather than a merely technical and peripheral activity”.

There are situations in which, whatever they do, moral blame and guilt will result. Thus it seems that moral goodness is not always within the grasp of social workers. The problem of what is called moral 'dirty hands' always looms as a possibility with the realities of front-line practice.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{clinical}} guide that brings together {{a broad range}} of brief interventions and their applications in treating psychosis. It describes two core approaches that can narrow the current, substantial gap between the need for psychotherapeutic interventions for all individuals suffering from psychosis, and the limited mental health resources available. The first approach involves utilizing the standard therapeutic modalities in the context of routine clinical interactions after adapting them into brief and effective formats. To that end, the book brings in experts on various psychotherapeutic modalities, who discuss how their particular modality could be adapted to more effectively fit into the existing system of care delivery. The second approach, addressed in detail, is to extend the availability of these brief interventions by utilizing the circle of providers as well as the social circle of the clients so that these interventions can be provided in a coordinated and complementary manner by psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> <b>case</b> managers, peer support specialists and other providers on the one hand, and by family members, friends, social and religious institutions on the other...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} mother-infant attachment relationships as identified by {{a social work}} team working with a highly vulnerable cohort. Infants in the ultra-high risk population are most at risk of poor attachment styles. Mothers often {{have a history of}} childhood abuse and adversity, criminality, substance abuse, and poor mental health. When combined with socio-environmental aspects within families a high incidence of poor attachment is likely. This study investigated Social Workers’ identification of attachment issues using qualitative methodology in the form of document analysis of <b>Social</b> <b>Worker</b> <b>case</b> notes and semi-structured interviews with Social Workers. Results indicate that the accuracy and frequency of identifying attachment varied and that often the focus was on individual behaviours rather than the dynamic attachment processes of the mother-infant dyad. Disturbance in the attachment relationship was most clearly and accurately identified in cases that involved a major disruption to the mother-infant relationship. Attachment styles were identified as secure in almost every non-crisis case, particularly in the infant’s early years. Possible early manifestations of insecure attachment styles were not viewed through the lens of attachment theory, but rather in the context of behavioural and parenting problems. The potency of the Social Worker-mother relationship emerged as a factor that may in and of itself be crucial in helping mothers attach to their infants...|$|R

40|$|Bureaucratic {{performance}} standards are featured in many proposals {{to increase efficiency}} in government. These standards reward bureaucrats {{on the basis of}} measured outcomes. The {{performance standards}} system created under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 is often cited as a successful prototype. Under the JTPA system, local training centers receive monetary rewards based on the employment levels and wage rates attained by their trainees upon completion of the program. Critics of the JTPA performance standards system argue that it creates an incentive for program managers to encourage <b>case</b> <b>workers</b> to `cream-skim' the most employable applicants into the program. We examine this issue by analyzing the determinants of acceptance into JTPA among applicants at a training center for which we have data on everyone who applied over a two year period. We find that <b>case</b> <b>workers</b> prefer to accept the least employable applicants, rather than the most employable as suggested by the cream-skimming story. This evidence indicates that concerns about cream-skimming in JTPA may be exaggerated. Instead, the performance standards system may operate as a countervailing force against the preferences of <b>case</b> <b>workers.</b> Using experimental data from the recent National JTPA Study, we also determine whether or not <b>case</b> <b>workers</b> accept those applicants with higher expected gains from the program. Our evidence only weakly supports this hypothesis. ...|$|R
