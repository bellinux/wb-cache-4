5000|$|In the Manifesto Against Labour, Krisis argues {{against the}} {{traditional}} Marxist notion of class <b>struggle</b> as the motor of history. According to Krisis, {{there is no}} class-subject. The <b>struggle</b> between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is not a <b>struggle</b> between a revolutionary class and its oppressor, but rather a <b>struggle</b> between two opposed interests that are integral to capitalism and form a single [...] "labor camp". Contrary to traditional Marxism, then, Krisis asserts that the <b>struggle</b> against capitalism is not the <b>struggle</b> for the liberation of labor, but rather a <b>struggle</b> for liberation from labor.|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{psychological}} {{research has}} associated spiritual <b>struggle</b> with negative outcomes, including depression, post-traumatic distress, suicidality, and mortality. Yet other research has linked it with positive outcomes, such as personal and spiritual growth, less prejudice, greater compassion, and increased religious tolerance. Furthermore, religious and developmental theorists posit that spiritual <b>struggle</b> {{is essential to}} value development and life adjustment, as rigid systems are replaced by flexible ones. The paradox of <b>struggle</b> being associated with negative outcomes but linked to spiritual and personal growth raises the question: what distinguishes healthy or productive spiritual <b>struggle</b> from maladaptive <b>struggle?</b> The current study hypothesizes that <b>struggle</b> can be beneficial if it is resolved over time: by integrating benevolent views of a higher power, increasing psychological closure, and finding meaning in questioning. It is this productive <b>struggle</b> that exercises a “spiritual muscle, ” developing psychosocial resources and forging a stronger and more flexible spirituality. The study empirically tests correlates of spiritual <b>struggle</b> and outcomes of resolution of <b>struggle</b> over time {{in response to a}} writing paradigm (versus a control condition).

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} the characters? <b>struggle</b> against fate in Thomas Hardy?s Wessex Tales. I find that the four main characters: Matthaus Tina, Gertrude Lodge, George Barnet, and Charles Darton have some <b>struggles</b> against their fate. They <b>struggle</b> against fate because they cannot accept and {{surrender}} to their fate. I decide discuss the ways the main characters <b>struggle</b> against their fate as my topic. I {{need to use the}} literary approach and employ the literary theory especially the theory of conflict as the main tool to analyze the situations that show the characters? <b>struggle</b> against fate. In addition, I also use the theory of characterization to analyze the characters? thinking or action as their <b>struggles</b> when they fight against fate. Finally, as my finding, I see the four main characters <b>struggle</b> against fate but they cannot fight against fate. The important point is not the result of their <b>struggle</b> but their <b>struggles</b> and willingness to fight against fate. When they <b>struggle</b> against fate, they prove that {{they do not want to}} surrender to their fate...|$|R
