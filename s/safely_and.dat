Despite the {{severity}} of the fire, all personnel were evacuated <b>safely,</b> <b>and</b> the efforts of the embassy staff elicited a commendation from President Jimmy Carter. Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E
5|$|As Japanese {{shelling}} intensifies in Burma, Chandrasekaran and Gnanasekaran {{decide to}} return to India. Chandrasekaran, accompanied by Saraswati, reaches Tiruchi <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> becomes a judge, but Gnanasekaran is lost in the journey and loses a leg in the shelling before arriving in India. He begs for a living, forms an association for beggars and tries to reform them. Kalyani reaches Chandrasekaran's palatial house seeking food, but Chandrasekaran throws her out without recognising her. She later arrives at a temple seeking help, but the pujari (priest) also tries to molest her. Frustrated with life and unable to feed her child, Kalyani throws it into a river and attempts suicide, but is soon arrested for killing the child and brought for trial.|$|E
5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected <b>safely,</b> <b>and</b> the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E

5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack is operating <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E

5|$|The film {{centers on}} the Dixon family, in {{particular}} Alan Dixon, who has recently received his driver's license and is eager to begin driving a car. When local police officer Hal Jackson visits the Dixons and learns that Alan's license has arrived, he sits down and tells Alan ways to drive <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> avoid getting into accidents. Although the film is fictional, a real family served as {{the inspiration for the}} film's scenario.

5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> marched inland, attacking French outposts as they approached the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend Saint Denis and that the militia would take too long to mobilise, the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its stores to Rowley.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E
5|$|It took Henry IV {{several years}} to retake Paris. By the time he succeeded in 1594, {{the area around the}} Bastille formed the main stronghold for the Catholic League and their foreign allies, {{including}} Spanish and Flemish troops. The Bastille itself was controlled by a League captain called du Bourg. Henry entered Paris early on the morning of 23 March, through the Porte-Neuve rather than the Saint-Antoine and seized the capital, including the Arsenal complex that neighboured the Bastille. The Bastille was now an isolated League stronghold, with the remaining members of the League and their allies clustering around it for safety. After several days of tension, an agreement was finally reached for this rump element to leave <b>safely,</b> <b>and</b> on 27 March du Bourg surrendered the Bastille and left the city himself.|$|E
5|$|South of Waegwan, {{two more}} North Korean {{divisions}} stood ready {{to cross the}} Naktong River in a coordinated attack with the divisions to the north. The experienced NK 3rd Division was concentrated {{in the vicinity of}} Songju, while the untested NK 10th Division was concentrated in the Koryong area. These two divisions crossed in the US 1st Cavalry Division's line. The NK 3rd Division's 7th Regiment started crossing the Naktong on August 9. Despite being spotted and taking fire, the bulk of it reached the east bank <b>safely</b> <b>and</b> moved inland into the hills. The 5th Cavalry Regiment and its supporting artillery, now fully alerted, spotted the other two regiments and forced them back to the west bank. Only a small number of North Koreans reached the east side where either they were captured, or hid until recrossing the river the following night.|$|E

5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left <b>safely,</b> <b>and</b> they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E
