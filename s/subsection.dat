5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), <b>subsection</b> Piperites. Species in this <b>subsection</b> are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a group that includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E
5|$|At Romani, near Pelusium, {{were the}} Gloucestershire Hussars (less one squadron), and {{a machine gun}} <b>subsection</b> in reserve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>subsections</b> {{are also}} {{divided into two}} matrimoieties, each {{consisting}} of four <b>subsections.</b> One always belongs to the same matrimoiety as one's mother, and women in a matriline will cycle through the four <b>subsections</b> of that matrimoiety.|$|R

2500|$|The genus Philodendron {{can also}} be {{subdivided}} into several sections and <b>subsections.</b> Section Baursia, section Philopsammos, section Philodendron (<b>subsections</b> Achyropodium, Canniphyllium, Macrolonchium, Philodendron, Platypodium, Psoropodium and Solenosterigma), section Calostigma (<b>subsections</b> Bulaoana, Eucardium, [...] Glossophyllum, Macrobelium and Oligocarpidium), section Tritomophyllum, section Schizophyllum, section Polytomium, section Macrogyniumand section Camptogynium.|$|R
5|$|In Ponce de Leon's {{classification}} of Geastrum, {{he placed the}} species in the subgenus Geastrum, section Geastrum, as the type of the <b>subsection</b> Sulcostomata, group Pectinatum. Other species in this group—characterized by a determinate peristome surrounded by a groove—are G.xerophilum, and G.furfuraceum. In Stanek's (1958) infrageneric concept, G.pectinatum is placed in section Perimyceliata (encompassing species whereby the mycelial layer covers the entire endoperidium), in <b>subsection</b> Glabrostomata, which includes species with plicate peristomes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these numbers}} h'i are the multiplicative inverses of the M'i, {{they may be}} found using Euclid's {{algorithm}} {{as described in the}} previous <b>subsection.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Katia was one {{squadron}} and {{a machine}} gun <b>subsection</b> of the Gloucestershire Hussars, along with 40 dismounted men of the Worcestershire Hussars, and a detail from the Royal Army Medical Corps, Army Veterinary Corps and camel transport.|$|E
40|$|The genus Mycena is {{subdivided}} into 23 sections, {{three of which}} are further {{subdivided into}} <b>subsections.</b> A number of these sections are described as new or proposed as new combinations, as follows. Mycena sect. Luculentae (with the <b>subsections</b> Elegantes, Rosellae, and Pterigenae), M. sect. Polyadelphia, M. sect. Monticola, M. sect. Cinerellae, M. sect. Intermediae, M. sect.

5|$|Carex binervis is {{classified}} in Carex <b>subsection</b> Elatae, part of Carex section Spirostachyae, alongside C.laevigata and other species. Natural hybrids are known between C.binervis {{and various other}} Carex species, including C.laevigata (forming C.×deserta), C.viridula (forming C.×corstorphinei), C.punctata and C.flava.|$|E
5|$|In their 1963 {{monograph}} of the Hygrophorus of North America, American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith classified H.agathosmus in the <b>subsection</b> Camarophylli, a {{grouping of}} related species {{characterized by a}} dry stem, {{and the absence of}} a gelatinous outer veil.|$|E
5|$|The Phengaris genus is a <b>subsection</b> {{within the}} Maculinea genus (explaining why the P. rebeli was {{formerly}} known as the M. rebeli) and the Maculinea-Phengaris clade is thought to be a section within Glaucopsyche. There are three groups within this Maculinea-Phengaris clade: the alcon group, the teleius group, and the Arion-Phengaris group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subsections</b> (a) to (d) were {{substituted}} {{for the former}} <b>subsections</b> (a) and (b) by section 37(1) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.|$|R

5|$|Agaricales {{specialist}} Rolf Singer included Suillus brevipes in the <b>subsection</b> Suillus of genus Suillus, an infrageneric (a {{taxonomic level}} below genus) grouping of species {{characterized by a}} cinnamon-brown spore print, and pores less than 1mm wide. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that the most closely related species to Suillus brevipes include S.luteus, S.pseudobrevipes, and S.weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae).|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each <b>subsection</b> had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the <b>subsection</b> Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E
50|$|The section has {{traditionally}} included two <b>subsections,</b> classified {{on the basis}} of their leaves, young twigs and corolla. Phylogenetic analysis has confirmed both the monophyly of the section and its <b>subsections.</b>|$|R
30|$|Within {{the four}} <b>subsections</b> we {{examined}} for weather patterns, lightning strike occurrence varied significantly {{from year to}} year. The summer total number of lightning strikes has ranged {{by more than a}} factor of ten across the 16 yr of the analysis. The range was even greater during monthly intervals within the summer, with some months having essentially zero strikes and some having several hundred. Year to year variability was very similar across the four <b>subsections,</b> especially between the <b>subsections</b> in the Sierra Nevada and the Mojave Desert. The same patterns of high and low occurrence exist to some extent among all four <b>subsections.</b>|$|R

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F.rubiginosa to be most closely related to the rainforest species F.watkinsiana and two rock-growing (lithophytic) species of arid northern Australia (F.atricha and F.brachypoda). They classified these species in a new series Rubiginosae in the <b>subsection</b> Platypodeae. Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae {{was first}} {{described}} by the American mycologist Harry Delbert Thiers in 1971, from collections made in San Mateo County, California, the previous year. In that state, it {{is known as the}} manzanita bolete because of its close association with manzanita trees. It is classified in <b>subsection</b> Versicolores of the section Leccinum in the genus Leccinum. Closely related species in this section include L.piceinum, L.monticola, L.albostipitatum, and L.versipelle.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this <b>subsection</b> of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, in the {{following}} <b>subsections,</b> a range is specified for h associated with a non-negative or non-positive trapezoidal fuzzy semi-number. This range must satisfy some constraints which will be explained in {{the following}} <b>subsections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The book is {{systematically}} partitioned into twelve {{sections and}} thirty <b>subsections,</b> {{with the majority}} of the book (169 pages) contained within the twenty-four <b>subsections</b> of section 4: Showing the Characteristics of a Godly Man.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{molecular}} phylogenic {{analyses of}} Medicago {{indicate that the}} sections and <b>subsections</b> defined by Small & Jomphe, as outlined above, are generally polyphyletic. However, with minor revisions sections and <b>subsections</b> could be rendered monophyletic.|$|R
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{was first}} {{described}} by Haruki Takahashi (2002) {{in an article}} in Mycoscience, based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 2000 and 2001. The specific name sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, it probably belongs to the section Marasmius, and the <b>subsection</b> Penicillati, due to characters of the stem, gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E
5|$|Russula brevipes was {{initially}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1890, from specimens collected in Quogue, New York. It is {{classified in the}} <b>subsection</b> Lactaroideae, a grouping of similar Russula species characterized by having whitish to pale yellow fruit bodies, compact and hard flesh, abundant lamellulae (short gills), {{and the absence of}} clamp connections. Other related Russula species with a similar range of spore ornamentation heights include Russula delica, R.romagnesiana, and R.pseudodelica.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica is {{the type}} species of the genus Russula. According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} of Russula, {{it is also the}} type of the section Russula. In an alternative classification proposed by Henri Romagnesi, it {{is the type}} species of <b>subsection</b> Emeticinae. A molecular analysis of European Russula species determined that R.emetica groups in a clade with R.raoultii, R.betularum, and R.nana; a later analysis confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship between R.emetica and the latter two Russulas.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} optical circuit {{includes a}} first device and a second device, which devices are connected by a polarization convertor. The polarization convertor includes a curved section of a waveguide, integrated in the optical circuit. The curved section may have several differently curved <b>subsections.</b> The conversion ratio is determined {{in part by the}} radius of curvature of the curved <b>subsections</b> {{as well as by the}} number of transitions between <b>subsections...</b>|$|R
