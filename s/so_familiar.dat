25|$|A book of {{the show}} has become all but necessary, if only {{to allow us to}} ingest this {{information}} at normal brain speed, and because such fine and creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print. So it's slightly disappointing that the book arrives in the question-and-answer format made <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> by last year's big hit Does Anything Eat Wasps? There are actually about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in Waterstones, making book-buyers feel a bit depressed.|$|E

500|$|Chaffee was {{transferred}} to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, to continue his training. His first project was not flying, but repairing a A3D twin-engine jet photo reconnaissance plane. This plane was typically flown by pilots with the rank of lieutenant commander or above, but since Chaffee became <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> with the plane from repairing it, {{he became one of}} the youngest pilots ever to fly it. He joined Attack Squadron 44 (VA-44) in September 1959, and from October 1959 to March 1960 he trained with Reconnaissance [...] Attack Squadron (Heavy) 3 (RVAH-3).|$|E
500|$|Of {{the little}} media {{coverage}} received, Saturate garnered positive reception, with Jason Taylor from AllMusic {{stating that the}} album [...] "has serious potential {{to become one of}} 2002's most successful debuts," [...] feeling that [...] "although it is repetitive and generic, it is undeniably addictive", ultimately scoring the album 2.5 out of 5. The disc received a favorable review from Schwegweb's Vin Cherubino, who noted, [...] "The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre. Influences from bands such as Tool can be heard, making the music seem all <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> and palatable." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} The Great War, Ian F. W. Beckett also cited Sheffield: the latter commented that Blackadder Goes Forth was {{successful}} because [...] "the characters and situations needed no explanation, <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> was {{the audience with}} the received version of the war". Beckett noted {{the popularity of the}} episode's final scene, and compared it to a similarly popular one from Dad's Army. He said that this comparison demonstrates the historian A. J. P. Taylor's observation that the Second World War has been regarded as a [...] "good war" [...] in comparison to the first; he opined that [...] "television producers ... have much to answer for in the perpetuation of the image of the Great War as one in which a generation of 'lions' were needlessly sacrificed by the 'donkeys'".|$|E
500|$|Two {{contrasting}} {{versions of}} the song were recorded in London in mid 1970 during the sessions for All Things Must Pass, {{both of which were}} intended for release, from the outset. According to Harrison, after recording the first version, he had decided he was unhappy with it, and the second version came about by chance [...] "weeks later", when one of the backing musicians began playing the song during a session. The so-called [...] "Isn't It a Pity (Version Two)" [...] is noticeably slower than the better known, seven-minute [...] "epic" [...] reading of the song. Eric Clapton's lead guitar fills, phased piano from Tony Ashton, and John Barham-arranged woodwinds dominate Version Two, which is also more in keeping with the Beatles' earlier attempts on the track; as with [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp", it features extensive use of the Leslie speaker sound <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> from the band's Abbey Road album.|$|E
500|$|The team {{reported}} that [...] "the highest levels" [...] of Nintendo of America knew about their project, {{though they did}} not intervene. Young said that their localization team transparently stated that they would curb the project if the company were to make an announcement {{about the future of}} the game. Though the team acknowledged that the legality of the localization was unclear, Young said that it would not be reasonable to call the fan translation [...] "impetuous or unfair". The team added that they were against software piracy. They directed others to import the game from Japan (or otherwise purchase official merchandise when the game began to go out-of-print), with the ultimate aim to help the franchise. Tomato received encouragement from a Square Enix employee who anticipated the translation. At the end of the project, the team felt that the fan translation would lead to more protection against fan translations rather than more encouragement, so as to maximize the underserved audience. Tomato said that he was unable to appreciate his work since it was <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> to him, with every original and translated line memorized. He expected that would change in five years. The project left Tomato with a greater respect for the craft of writing.|$|E

25|$|CGI became {{ubiquitous}} in earnest during this era. Video games and CGI cinema had spread {{the reach of}} computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s.

500|$|Agent Broyles {{discovers that}} the army did {{classified}} experiments in Edina called [...] "Project Elephant", {{but most of the}} records are gone. The team brings the body, along with a butterfly Walter found in the town and thought Astrid would like, back to the lab in Boston. They discover that both have transformed into deformed versions of themselves. Peter and Olivia go back to Edina to talk with the sheriff and try to locate the owner of the truck. Meanwhile, back in the lab, Walter tries to remember why the case feels <b>so</b> <b>familiar.</b> Throughout the episode Walter had been humming some strange melody, and he and Astrid realize he might previously have worked on the project with the army. The melody was a memory trick Walter used to remind himself where he stored the experiment files so many years ago. The experiment was done by the army in the late 1970s to test how electromagnetic pulses can camouflage soldiers and was conducted on the townspeople; the army was unaware of the long-term effects of the study until it was too late, and the people were stuck in a deformed state. The [...] "hum" [...] hides their deformities from the human eye through a massive electromagnetic pulse that runs through the town, and once they leave and are out of the pulse's reach, their true deformities show.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} speaks about the protagonist's {{choice between the}} comfort they find in sorrow {{and the idea of}} their {{possible}} happiness. As explained by Lee, it was meant to represent the process of [...] "breaking free" [...] from the continuous periods of feeling trapped in bad life situations and relationships, from which nevertheless, it is hard to leave even when one recognizes the negativity that comes along with them. In order to delve into the aforementioned inner conflict, Lee uses the concept of addiction as a medium. The word [...] "lithium" [...] is continuously repeated throughout the song in a metaphorical sense, as the protagonist describes her love–hate relationship with sorrow. A writer of Billboard saw [...] "Lithium" [...] as a lyrical continuation of the theme explored in the band's previous single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; while in the former Lee determinedly broke up with her lover, in the latter [...] " [...] mourns his departure as she tries not to wallow in despair that's <b>so</b> <b>familiar,</b> it's almost a friend". [...] Similarly, a writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan, with the latter song exploring his [...] "apparently pathetic" [...] perspective of the story touched upon by Lee in the former one.|$|E
500|$|Zak Penn, {{who wrote}} {{a draft of the}} first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but {{stressed}} it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which was a very different film from Alien, but still in the same continuity. He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty. After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand. Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography. In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set. Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America, and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story. There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand. Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film. Feige commented, [...] "we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [...] canon." ...|$|E

500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a {{computer}} game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolish female-centered stories." [...] Variety's Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, [...] is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you never feel like you're watching a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries to tug at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground <b>so</b> <b>familiar</b> you can fall asleep for ten minutes and still know exactly what happened".|$|E
