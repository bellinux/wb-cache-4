40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{experimental}} method for {{the identification of}} rigid body inertia properties. The method’s central element is a mathematical model of a multi-wire suspension condition that unlike previous models accounts for all geometric stiffness ef-fects caused by the unknown gravity preload. The suspension model {{makes it possible to}} identify accurate rigid body properties from excitations and response measurements at a single frequency within the rigid body range. In this way, the suspension model enables a new identification method based on a sensorless single-rotor unbalance actuator that can be built at minimal cost. Unlike a conventional shaker or impulse actuator, the proposed actuator can be rigidly attached to the test structure, whereby accurate alignment is made relatively easy. A prototype of the actuator was applied to four different test structures. The experimental procedure was found to be straightforward, and the identified rigid body properties showed high accuracy.

The velocity and acceleration contact conditions {{as well as the}} displacement contact condition are imposed with special consider-ation of the high-velocity contact point moving on the deformed wire. Especially, it is shown that the Coriolis and centripetal accelerations of the contact point moving rapidly on the deformed wire play the crucial roles for the stability of the solution.

40|$|Some new {{passive and}} active methods for {{reducing}} the effects of seismic disturbances on suspended masses are described, with special reference to gravitational radiation detectors in which differential horizontal motions {{of two or more}} suspended test masses are monitored. In these methods {{it is important to be}} able to determine horizontal seismic accelerations independent of tilts of the ground. Measurement of changes in inclination of the <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> of a test mass, relative to a direction defined by a reference arm of long period of oscillation, makes it possible to carry this out over the frequency range of interest for earth-based gravitational radiation detectors. The signal obtained can then be used to compensate for the effects of seismic disturbances on the test mass if necessary. Alternatively the signal corresponding to horizontal acceleration can be used to move the point from which the test mass is suspended in such a way as to reduce the effect of the seismic disturbance and also damp pendulum motions of the suspended test mass. Experimental work with an active anti-seismic system of this type is described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} {{to get a}} correct measurement of all variables involved in different metrological processes, takes major importance every day. In order to improve the uncertainty of some processes in metrology of density, the surface tension (ST) arises as the new important one in the uncertainty budget. In density measurements different variables like {{the properties of the}} liquids are involved (density, viscosity, compressibility coefficient, and surface tension), especially for the reference materials used for the calibration of hydrometers, and their characterization in density (density calibration). The ST appears in those methods were a <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> is hanging from a balance {{and at the same time}} is holding a solid (density standard or a mass) which is introduced/immersed into a liquid. This method is usually known as hydrostatic weighing. Nowadays there are diverse methods for the determination of the ST, and various devices to do these measurements based on these methods. The present work focuses on two methods to measure the ST (Method of rupture and hydrostatic weighing method), whose modifications and adjustments were realized in order to reduce the uncertainties of the resulting values.

Recently {{there has been an}} evolution of this technique toward the progressive reduction of trauma with an improvement of the results, also from the aesthetical point of view. In this article we describe our new videolaparo-cholecystectomy technique. Trans-umbilical videolaparo-cholecystectomy represents a variant of the traditional technique. This new method allows the operation to perform with only two trocars positioned in the peritoneum cavity through only one umbilical incision. The technical innovation of this method consists of the substitution of the others trocars, utilized in the traditional technique, with an equal number of trans-parietal <b>suspension</b> <b>wires.</b> Up to now, we have given 95 patients this kind of operation being successful in 67 % of the cases.

40|$|While a {{torsion balance}} in vacuum can easily measure the {{momentum}} transfer from a gas beam impinging on a surface {{attached to the}} balance, this measurement depends on the accommodation coefficients of the atoms with the surface {{and the distribution of}} the recoil. A torsion balance is described for making absolute flux measurements independent of recoil effects. The torsion balance is a conventional taut <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> design and the Young modulus of the wire determines the relationship between the displacement and the applied torque. A compensating magnetic field is applied to maintain zero displacement and provide critical damping. The unique feature is to couple the impinging gas beam to the torsion balance via a Wood's horn, i. e., a thin wall tube with a gradual 90 deg bend. Just as light is trapped in a Wood's horn by specular reflection from the curved surfaces, the gas beam diffuses through the tube. Instead of trapping the beam, the end of the tube is open so that the atoms exit the tube at 90 deg to their original direction. Therefore, all of the forward momentum of the gas beam is transferred to the torsion balance independent of the angle of reflection from the surfaces inside the tube...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{recursive}} shape adjustment {{algorithm is}} proposed, {{which will be}} used for flexible antenna reflectors for space application. The antenna reflector is composed of flexible mesh surface, cable networks, and support structures. Length adjustment mechanisms are attached to the <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> between the surface cable and the backup network, and the shape of the mesh surface is controlled by the adjustment mechanisms. For the purpose of effective adjustment, the matrix of influence coefficients (sensitivity matrix) of the adjustment length to the surface displacements is needed, and the matrix is usually calculated by analytical model. But some modeling errors, such as prediction error of material properties or error due to model simplification, are unavoidable in the preliminary analysis. Besides, the sensitivity matrix may change during the process of adjustment because of nonlinearity of the structure in some cases. To avoid the above problems, a recursive shape adjustment algorithm is proposed. The major characteristic of the algorithm is the recursive modification of the sensitivity matrix based on the be-havior of the system in the iterative adjustment. Using this algorithm, the modeling error is automatically corrected in the adjustment process and the procedure will converge efficiently. The effectiveness of the algorithm is confirmed by numerical simulations and an experiment using a model of a large antenna reflector. Since this algorithm allows the change or modeling error of structural sensitivity, it shall also be useful for the on-board shape control of flexible reflectors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} the petrogenetic {{relations between the}} 4 groups of lavas erupted at Piton de la Fournaise (PdF), constrain {{the structure of the}} feeding system and the magma storage conditions, experimental phase equilibria have been determined, both at 1 atm and high pressures (HP), on a lava representative of Steady State Basalts (SSB). The lava (SiO 2 = 49. 2 wt%, MgO= 7. 8 wt%, CaO/Al 2 O 3 = 0. 81) was fused at 1400 • C, 1 atm in air. The resulting glass was crushed and the powder directly used as starting material. The 1 atm experiments were performed with the wire-loop method in a vertical CO-CO 2 gas mixing furnace. To minimize Fe-loss from the charge, experiments were repeated under constant T-fO 2 conditions to progressively saturate the <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> with Fe. Intermediate charges were dissolved in HF and the charge from the last cycle retained for detailed study. Analyses of experimental products are in progress. The HP experiments were carried out in an internally heated pressure vessel, at 50 MPa and 400 MPa, between 1100 - 1200 • C and under fluid-present conditions. Glass (30 - 50 mg) plus 10 % in mass of volatiles (H 2 O or H 2 O+CO 2) were loaded in Au 80 Pd 20 capsules. Distilled water and Ag 2 C 2 O 4 (CO 2 source) were weighted to give charges with xH 2 O initial (molar H 2 O / (H 2 O+CO 2)) ranging from 1 to 0. Run durations lasted for 2 - 14 h. Redox conditions were controlled by loading a given proportion of H 2 gas in the vessel (3 bar H 2 for 50 MPa, 5 bar H 2 for 400 MPa). Experimental fH 2 were determined by solid Pd-Co sensors, leading to fO 2 conditions approaching NNO- 1. All experiments were rapidly drop quenched and products analyzed by SEM, EMPA and µ-FTIR Spectroscopy. To overcome Fe-loss, both capsule Fe pre-saturation and charge Fe pre-enrichment were tested. The first method was shown to be time-consuming and fraught with difficulties while the second is still being developed. Consequently, the experimental data presented here were obtained with no attempt to circumvent Fe loss, resulting in losses around 10 - 25 %. Results at 50 MPa lead to a crystallization sequence in the order olivine (ol, + spinel), clinopyroxene (cpx), plagioclase (plag) in marked contrast with previous experimental results under volatile-free conditions. Volatile concentrations in experimental glasses (0. 5 - 1 wt% H 2 O, 30 - 180 ppm CO 2) are within the range of natural glass inclusions. Fo contents, cpx Mg# and plag An contents match compositions of natural phenocrysts. Preliminary experiments at 400 MPa indicate a change in the crystallization sequence, olivine being replaced by cpx as the liquidus phase. Our data illustrate the importance of volatiles in controlling the order of crystallization even at low concentrations...|$|E
