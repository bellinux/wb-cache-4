Members of a nationwide Swedish association enlisting persons who have problems concerning a whiplash injury (n = 1, 928) were included. A total of 979 persons participated in the study, a response rate of 50. 8 %. A multivariable regression model is presented, with general health as the dependent variable, and the independent variables inserted en-bloc. The model was highly significant with an explained variance of 28 %. Among background factors, only older age appeared as significantly and strongly related to poorer general health. The strongest explanatory contributions came from the health related variables. Oral disease and extra-oral body pain were both strongly related to poorer general health, most obviously for the oral disease variable.

Previous studies suggest that this association might be negative, yet it is unclear to what extent this reflects causation (an effect of union dissolution of health) and/or selection (an effect of health on union dissolution). We analyzed the relationship between <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and 3, 894 union dissolutions in about 60, 000 respondents aged 18 – 59 across eight waves of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). Fixed-effect panel analyses show that the negative association between dissolution and <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> is not due to a general negative effect of divorce on health. Rather, after union dissolution <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> improves among some individuals, while for others it declines. Compared to being in a union continuously, union dissolution seems to cause increases and decreases in health. We also find evidence for a negative effect of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> on dissolution risks. This selection effect appears {{to be associated with}} being in poor <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> for a prolonged period of time rather than by the immediate effect of a health decline.

40|$|AIMS: Socioeconomic health {{differences}} {{have been studied}} elaborately for many Western societies. Relatively little is know about the social variations in health in the former communist states of Eastern Europe. This study investigated socioeconomic health inequalities in Latvia. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was undertaken of the 1999 Norbalt-II Living Conditions Survey, a random population-based sample in Latvia, and included males and females aged 25 to 70. RESULTS: Lower educated subjects had higher rates of <b>self-assessed</b> poor <b>health</b> than those with tertiary education (men OR 2. 21; 1. 31 - 3. 71 95 % CI, and women OR 2. 48; 1. 74 - 3. 54 95 % CI). After adjusting for income, educational differences were significant only for women. Income differences were larger than educational differences in <b>self-assessed</b> poor <b>health</b> for both genders (OR of highest vs. lowest quintile for men: 5. 10; 2. 26 - 11. 5 95 % CI, women: OR 3. 26; 1. 92 - 5. 51 95 % CI). For long-standing health problems socioeconomic differences were smaller. After adjusting for income no educational differences were found, but income differences were significant (men: OR 2. 06; 1. 15 - 3. 69 95 % CI, women: OR 1. 42; 1. 12 - 2. 63 95 % CI). The economically non-active were in worse health than the (self-) employed subjects (men: OR 6. 12; 3. 65 - 10. 3 95 % CI, women: OR 2. 79; 1. 66 - 3. 39 95 % CI). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial social inequalities in <b>self-assessed</b> poor <b>health</b> and longstanding health problems exist in Latvia for both sexes. Inequalities by material circumstances, as measured by income, appear to be larger than educational differences. Economic activity was also strongly associated with health.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The single-item {{question}} of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> has consistently {{been reported to}} be associated with mortality, even after controlling {{for a wide range of}} health measurements and known risk factors for mortality. It has been suggested that this association is due to psychosocial factors which are both related to <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and to mortality. We tested this hypothesis. METHODS: The study was carried out in a subsample (n = 5667) of the GLOBE-population, a prospective cohort study conducted in the southeastern part of the Netherlands. Data on <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health,</b> sociodemographic variables, various aspects of health status, behavioural risk factors, and a number of psychosocial factors (social support, psychosocial stressors, personality traits, and coping styles) were collected by postal survey and structured interview in 1991, and mortality data were collected between 1991 and 1998. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to calculate the association between <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and mortality, before and after controlling for the psychosocial variables. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic variables, various aspects of health status, and behavioural risk factors, <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> is still strongly associated with mortality in our dataset (Relative Risk [RR] of dying for 'poor' versus 'very good' <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> = 3. 98; 95 % CI: 1. 65 - 9. 61). After controlling for the same set of confounders, many of the psychosocial variables are statistically significantly associated with a 'less-than-good' <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health,</b> particularly instrumental social support, long-lasting difficulties, neuroticism, and locus of control. However, only 'disclosure of emotions'-coping style has a statistically significant relationship with mortality. Adding the psychosocial variables to a model already containing <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> does not attenuate the association between <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find indications that the association between <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and mortality is due to the psychosocial factors included in this analysis. It seems likely that the unexplained mortality effects of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> are due to the fact that <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> is a very inclusive measure of health reflecting health aspects relevant to survival which are not covered by other health indicators...|$|E

The objective here was to determine the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes and to analyze the associations with risk and protection factors among adults. DESIGN AND LOCAL: Cross-sectional study in a state capital in northeastern Brazil. METHODS: Data on adults of both sexes aged ≥ 45 years who were interviewed in the Vigitel telephone survey in 2014 were analyzed. Prevalence ratios were estimated using Poisson regression, to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Among women, the prevalence of hypertension was 48. 4 % and of diabetes, 12. 7 %; among men, the prevalences were 41. 9 % and 13. 8 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that for women, age group ≥ 65 years, overweight, <b>self-assessed</b> poor <b>health</b> and dyslipidemia remained associated with higher prevalence of hypertension. For men, overweight and <b>self-assessed</b> poor <b>health</b> remained associated with higher prevalence of hypertension. Regarding diabetes, in the multivariate model for women, age group 55 - 64 years, schooling level between zero and four years and no regular consumption of beans remained associated with higher prevalence. For men, age groups 55 - 64 years and ≥ 65 years and being married or in a stable partnership were associated with higher prevalence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the prevalences of hypertension and diabetes were high and that preventable factors were associated with this situation, thus providing support for public policies aimed towards coping with this...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{potential}} differences in the predictive ability of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> for mortality between educational groups, and to find explanations for any of these educational differences. Methods: We used data from the longitudinal GLOBE study, with a 13 -year mortality follow-up. Analyses were performed for people aged between 25 - 74 years at baseline (n = 16 722). The associations of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> with mortality were estimated with Cox regression analyses, and the resulting hazard ratios were used as indicators of the 'predictive ability' of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> for mortality. Differences between educational levels were estimated by including an interaction term of education with <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> in regression models with mortality as the outcome. The analyses were subsequently adjusted for: life threatening chronic conditions, non-life threatening conditions, stressors and health behaviour, to test the contribution of these factors to the predictive ability of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health.</b> Results: Results indicated that the predictive ability of <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> for mortality was greater in men with tertiary education as compared with the lowest educated men. No differences were observed in women. None of the four health aspects accounted for the educational difference in men. Conclusions: Because differences in the predictive ability for mortality were limited to the extreme educational groups in men, educational differences in <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> that are reported in numerous studies should not be expected to seriously overestimate educational differences in 'objective' health status...|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between educational attainment and <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> {{is well established}} but the mechanisms that explain this association are not fully understood yet. It is likely {{that part of the}} association is spurious because (genetic and non-genetic) characteristics of a person’s family of origin simultaneously affect one’s educational attainment and one’s adult health. In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the {{association between}} education and health, we have to control for all relevant family factors. In practice, however, it is impossible to measure all relevant family factors. Sibling models are particularly appropriate in this case, because they control for the total impact of family factors, even if not all relevant aspects can be measured. I use data on siblings from a US study (MIDUS) and Dutch study (NKPS) to assess the total family impact on <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> and, more importantly, to assess whether there is a family bias in the association between educational attainment and <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health.</b> The results suggest that there is a substantial family effect; about 20 % of the variation in <b>self-assessed</b> <b>health</b> between siblings can be ascribed to (measured and unmeasured) family factors.

Consequently, we expect to find that job characteristics play an important mediating role in associations between SES and <b>self-assessed</b> overall <b>health</b> and cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health problems. To address these hypotheses, we use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). We find support for our hypotheses, although the extent to which job characteristics mediate SES-health relationships varies across health outcomes and by sex.

40|$|This study quantifies gender-specific {{differences}} in retirement income in Germany, Denmark, and France. We {{show that the}} "gender pension gap" in Germany is higher than in France and much higher than in Denmark. This ranking {{is similar to the}} ranking in the gender pay gap, where Germany has also the highest gender difference. The authors also investigate gender-specific {{differences in}} health, i. e. the so-called "gender health gap", in the same age group. <b>Self-assessed</b> general <b>health</b> in 2013 reveals no significant {{differences between men and women}} in the countries studied. However, gender-specific differences in depressive symptoms follow a similar pattern as the gender pension gap: Denmark has the lowest difference between the sexes. Although the study does not measure causal relationships between income and health, the results indicate that measures to reduce the gender pay gap do not only reduce differences during the economically active phase; they may also lead to a reduction in the gender pension gap and in women's susceptibility to depressive symptoms...|$|R
