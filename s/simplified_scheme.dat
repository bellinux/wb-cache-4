40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{efficiency}} of <b>simplified</b> weak <b>schemes</b> for stochastic differential equations. We present a numerical comparison between weak Taylor <b>schemes</b> and their <b>simplified</b> versions. In the <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> discrete random variables, instead of Gaussian ones, are generated to approximate multiple stochastic integrals. We show that an implementation of <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> based on random bits generators significantly increases the computational speed. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is demonstrated. random bits generators; stochastic differential equations; <b>simplified</b> weak taylor <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

Various schemes are proposed for numerical calculations, which allowed us to describe the process of heat transfer with different accuracy. The calculation error was estimated, by using <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes,</b> {{as a function of}} the ratio of heat conductivities.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} the derivation of families of semi-implicit schemes of weak order N= 3. 0 (general case) and N= 4. 0 (additive noise case) for the numerical solution of Itô stochastic differential equations. The degree of implicitness of the schemes {{depends on the}} selection of N parameters which vary between 0 and 1 and the families contain as particular cases the 3. 0 and 4. 0 weak order explicit Taylor schemes. Since {{the implementation of the}} multiple integrals that appear in these theoretical schemes is difficult, for the applications they are replaced by simpler random variables, obtaining <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this way, for the multidimensional case with one-dimensional noise, we present an infinite family of semi-implicit <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> of weak order 3. 0 and for the multidimensional case with additive one-dimensional noise, we give an infinite family of semi-implicit <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> of weak order 4. 0. The mean-square stability of the 3. 0 family is analyzed, concluding that, as in the deterministic case, the stability behavior improves when the degree of implicitness grows. Numerical experiments confirming the theoretical results are shown...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{planning}} of two-layer long-term evolution-advanced cellular systems, taking both the co-tier and cross-tier interference into account. In particular, we propose the novel multi-level soft frequency reuse (MSFR) scheme, where the users in three different regions of a macro/micro cell adopt distinct frequency segments and different transmission power levels. The optimization of power control parameters and cell association with MSFR results in a non-convex problem. We present the iterative-MSFR (I-MSFR) scheme, where the main optimization problem {{is divided into two}} sub-problems that can be subsequently solved by means of classical optimization methods. Finally, we propose two <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> that achieve a comparable performance as I-MSFR in terms of utility, cell capacity, and outage conditions. I-MSFR and the <b>simplified</b> <b>schemes</b> have shown better performance than other schemes in the literatur...|$|R

50|$|Photo {{oxidation}} {{is suspected}} {{to be driven}} by OH. radical and reduction is driven by wind and surface layer disturbances. In the dark, mercury redox reactions continue due to microbial activity. The biological transformations are different and have a smaller rate compared to sunlight driven processes above. Inorganic mercury Hg2+ and methyl mercury has the ability to get adsorbed in to particles. A positive correlation of binding is observed for the amount of organic matter vs. the concentration of these mercury species showing that most of them bind to organic matter. This phenomenon can determine the bioavailability and toxicity of mercury in the ocean. Some methyl mercury is released to the ocean through river run-off. However, most of the methyl mercury found in the ocean is produced in -situ (inside the ocean itself). Methylation of inorganic mercury can occur via biotic and abiotic pathways. However, biotic pathways are more predominant. The reactions illustrated in a <b>simplified</b> <b>scheme</b> below are actually parts of complex enzyme driven metabolic pathways taking place inside microbial cells.|$|E

50|$|In housing policy, a {{shift of}} {{emphasis}} in housing policy towards rehabilitation {{was evident in the}} further {{increase in the number of}} General Improvement Areas and the number of Housing Action Areas declared. An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with Attendance Allowances extended to cover handicapped foster children and non-contributory disablement pensions extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. In July 1977, an experimental Job Introduction Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there was reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job. In July 1978, a revised and <b>simplified</b> <b>scheme</b> designed to assist severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced.|$|E
