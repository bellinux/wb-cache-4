40|$|Polarization {{control in}} vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) has {{attracted}} {{a lot of interest}} and different techniques have been proposed to achieve it. Among them, one of the most attractive relies on slight modifications of existing and well-behaving devices, i. e., by introducing a noncircular transverse <b>section</b> <b>layer</b> somewhere in the device. Even though experimental verifications of this principle have already been carried out, a theoretical framework to better understand and possibly optimize such devices is still missing. This mainly originates from the need of a fully vectorial and three-dimensional approach. In this paper, we will undertake a joint experimental and theoretical effort: first, we give experimental evidence of polarization control by applying elliptical surface etching. Then, after having validated the vectorial electromagnetic model by comparing numerical and experimental results, we are able {{for the first time to}} explain and compare the polarization selection mechanisms and, consequently, to provide guidelines for optimized structures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this work, a {{two-dimensional}} finite element (FE) model for physical and geometric nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete beams and plane frames, {{developed by the}} authors, is presented. The FE model {{is based on the}} Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory, in which shear deformations are neglected. The bar elements have three nodes with a total of seven degrees of freedom. Three Gauss-points are utilized for the element integration, with the element section discretized into layers at each Gauss point (Fiber Model). It is assumed that concrete and reinforcing bars are perfectly bonded, and each <b>section</b> <b>layer</b> is assumed to be under a uniaxial stress-state. Nonlinear constitutive laws are utilized for both concrete and reinforcing steel layers, and a refined tension-stiffening model, developed by the authors, is included. The Total Lagrangean Formulation is adopted for geometric nonlinear consideration and several methods can be utilized to achieve equilibrium convergence of the nonlinear equations. The developed model is implemented into a computer program named ANEST/CA, which is validated by comparison with some tests on RC beams and plane frames, showing an excellent correlation between numerical and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentialities}} of a {{thin layer}} of steel fibre reinforced self-compacting concrete (SFRSCC) for the flexural strengthening of handmade brick structural elements are investigated. For this purpose an experimental program was carried out covering the relevant phenomena that can influence the effectiveness of this technique. The SFRSCC has a post-cracking residual tensile strength capable of improving the flexural stiffness, flexural resistance and ductility of prototypes representatives of ancient handmade brick based structures that fail in bending. To appraise the flexural strengthening effectiveness of this technique, straight beams composed of handmade bricks, low strength mortar (LSM) and SFRSCC were tested. The obtained results have shown that this technique can increase significantly the flexural stiffness and resistance, and the ductility performance of 2 this type of structures. The strengthening effectiveness depends on the post-cracking residual strength of the SFRSCC, its layer thickness and on the possibility of replacing part of the LSM by SFRSCC. Based on the experimental results for the characterization of the intervening materials, and adopting a cross <b>section</b> <b>layer</b> model capable of predicting the moment-curvature relationship for the distinct types of cross sections of this structural system, the maximum load registered in the tested prototypes was predicted with good accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{pavement}} structural {{performance by}} Non Destructive Test (NDT) {{has been growing}} since {{the introduction of the}} Benkelman Beam at the WASHO Road Test in the early 1950 's. The deflection basin data have to be analyzed d to obtain the structural properties of pavement layers and subgrade, that are typically used for pavement evaluation and rehabilitation design. One of the more common methods for analyzing deflection data is the back-calculation, in which theoretical deflections are compared with measured deflections and the assumed moduli are then adjusted in an iterative procedure until theoretical and measured deflection basins match acceptably well. The iterative process assume the pavement model as an input, and the accuracy and the precision of the backcalculation process can be reduced by errors due to the inaccurate input evaluation. Particularly pavement layer thickness and interface condition between layers are affected by a construction and measurement related variability. As matter of fact layer thickness information are measured accurately from core, in a limited number of test points because of their destructive nature, and are rough estimated from Ground Penetrating Radar equipment along the entire profile <b>section.</b> <b>Layer</b> interface properties depends on many factors (such as temperature, coat binder, normal pressure etc.) and are very difficult to be estimated. In this study a sensitive analysis to evaluate the combined impact of the layer thickness and interface condition variability was performed. A back-calculation program to accurately evaluate the layer moduli, based on a linear elastic multilayer model, was developed and a simulation procedure, based on Monte Carlo method, was applied to represent the thickness variability. The study showed that layer thickness and interface condition variability have a strong impact on the back-calculated results, therefore it was proposed to perform the design of maintenance treatment according to suitable percentile value of their probability distribution. This former could be evaluated by the simulation procedure developed, as a case study reported shows...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{appropriate}} numerical {{constitutive model}} of lightweight aggregate concrete filled steel tubes (LCFST), layered method was adopted {{to predict the}} complete moment-curvature curves of LCFST composite section subjected to pure bending. A FORTRAN program for the moment-curvature curves was developed.

The practical composite flexural stiffness, ultimate moment and practical moment-curvature relationship of LCFST composite section were presented. The predicted results of both layered method and practical moment-curvature relationships of LCFST composite section are in good agreement with the test results from reference.
