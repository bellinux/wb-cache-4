5|$|The <b>Sawtooth</b> Berry Fields {{is located}} {{just north of}} <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountain, around Surprise Lakes and the <b>Sawtooth</b> Trailhead for the Pacific Crest Trail.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness was {{originally}} designated the <b>Sawtooth</b> Primitive Area in 1937 before {{becoming part of}} the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1972 under the Wilderness Act. Although entirely managed by <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest, only about a quarter (25.33 percent) of the <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness lies within the area Congressionally designated as <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest, with the majority (69.13 percent) lying in Boise National Forest and a relatively small portion (5.54 percent) in Salmon-Challis National Forest. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness has some of the clearest air in the lower 48 states.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> Mountain is {{the third}} highest peak the Indian Heaven Wilderness in Washington and the Cascade Range. On clear days hikers can see views of four nearby volcanoes: Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier from the <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountain Trail, which skirts the subalpine upper west side of <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most obvious in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest is a National Forest {{that covers}} 2,110,408 acres (854,052 ha) in the U.S. states of Idaho (~96 percent) and Utah (~4 percent). Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it was {{originally}} named the <b>Sawtooth</b> Forest Reserve in a proclamation issued by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. On August 22, 1972 {{a portion of the}} forest was designated as the <b>Sawtooth</b> National Recreation Area (SNRA), which includes the <b>Sawtooth,</b> White Clouds, and Hemingway–Boulders wilderness areas. The forest is managed as four units: the SNRA and the Fairfield, Ketchum, and Minidoka Ranger Districts.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} of <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains formed from the Eocene <b>Sawtooth</b> batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the <b>Sawtooth,</b> Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. Foothills of the Smoky Mountains {{are from the}} Pennsylvanian and Permian Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho batholith, {{while some of the}} exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a feasibility study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing <b>Sawtooth</b> Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted {{that it was not}} designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish <b>Sawtooth</b> National Park and another to establish the <b>Sawtooth</b> National Recreation Area (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Movies, {{television}} shows, and documentaries {{have been}} filmed {{in and around}} <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest, particularly around the Sun Valley area. Movies filmed in Sun Valley include I Met Him in Paris (1937), Sun Valley Serenade (1941), and Bus Stop (1956). Clint Eastwood's 1985 film Pale Rider was filmed in the SNRA, mostly in the Boulder Mountains in late 1984. The opening credits scene was shot south of Stanley {{in front of the}} <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains. The SNRA was one of the settings of the 2010 3-D computer animated film Alpha and Omega.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains {{were last}} {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the Little Ice Age, which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation is {{abundant in the}} <b>Sawtooth,</b> White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as the}} north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} of this pattern has a {{characteristic}} growing <b>sawtooth</b> wave shape {{that can be used}} to recognize physical processes that behave similarly to Rule 90. spectra|journal=Physical Review E|volume=70|year=2004|page=032101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.70.032101|arxiv=cond-mat/0308277|bibcode = 2004PhRvE..70c2101C }}.|$|E
5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and <b>Sawtooth</b> mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest {{balances}} {{interests of}} different groups, {{such as those}} interested in recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, in some areas allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products, alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.|$|E
5|$|The single live cell of the {{starting}} configuration is a <b>sawtooth</b> pattern. This {{means that in}} some time steps the numbers of live cells grow arbitrarily large while in others they return to only two live cells, infinitely often.|$|E
5|$|Towns {{around the}} forest, {{including}} Stanley, Ketchum, and <b>Sawtooth</b> City, were founded as mining {{towns in the}} latter part of the 19thcentury by prospectors and trappers, including Civil War veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the trapper and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after trapper William Sublette, who lived in the area in the 1830s. Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and homesteaders. For much of the 20thcentury, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest. Sheep drives were common in the Wood River Valley after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north to graze the upper elevation areas in <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest. The original sheepherders were Basque Americans, while today many of the sheepherders are Peruvians contracted through the Department of Labor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a <b>sawtooth</b> engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down dead or dying organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and in wood chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the <b>Sawtooth</b> Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after <b>sawtooth</b> diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after <b>sawtooth</b> profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest {{receives}} {{over one}} million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at Redfish Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA. Most of the campgrounds are on a first come first served basis, while some can be reserved.|$|E
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N <b>sawtooth</b> waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member <b>Sawtooth</b> Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest {{was created}} as the <b>Sawtooth</b> Forest Reserve in the U.S. Department of Agriculture by {{proclamation}} of President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. It {{was named after}} the <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains in the northwestern part of the forest. On October 12, 1937, the U.S. Forest Service established the <b>Sawtooth</b> Primitive Area in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Mountains. Subsequently, <b>Sawtooth</b> National Forest began to extensively develop recreation opportunities, including new campgrounds, trails, and roads.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sawtooth</b> Range {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of lakes created by vanished alpine glaciers, with nearly 400 lakes in the <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness. Five of the six largest lakes in the range are located outside the wilderness (Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, Yellow Belly, and Stanley lakes), while <b>Sawtooth</b> Lake is within the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|The {{aliasing}} distortion in {{the lower}} frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies, and while the bandlimited <b>sawtooth</b> is still clear at 1760Hz, the aliased <b>sawtooth</b> is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental.|$|E
25|$|Dentilly is {{a modern}} invention, similar to indented, but {{with one of the}} sides of the points {{perpendicular}} and the other angled, as in a <b>sawtooth</b> wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualitative}} {{effects of}} aliasing {{can be heard}} in the following audio demonstration. Six <b>sawtooth</b> waves are played in succession, with the first two sawtooths having a fundamental frequency of 440Hz (A4), the second two having fundamental frequency of 880Hz (A5), and the final two at 1760Hz (A6). The sawtooths alternate between bandlimited (non-aliased) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22.05kHz. The bandlimited sawtooths are synthesized from the <b>sawtooth</b> waveform's Fourier series such that no harmonics above the Nyquist frequency are present.|$|E
25|$|Multimonica (1940) {{designed}} by Harald Bode, produced by Hohner: dual keyboard instrument consisting of an electrically blown reed organ (lower) and a monophonic <b>sawtooth</b> synthesizer (upper).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sawtooth</b> bits {{are also}} available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have {{advantages}} over Forstner bits when boring into end grain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{animation}} of a square wave at top right {{it can be}} seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a <b>sawtooth</b> wave are shown underneath.|$|E

While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing <b>Sawtooth</b> Primitive Area. While the 1963 bill also died, Church admitted that it wasn't designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. Support for greater protection of the Sawtooths and surrounding areas grew after {{the discovery of a}} molybdenum deposit at the base of Castle Peak in the White Cloud Mountains in 1968.|$|E
25|$|A pest which spreads through {{olive trees}} {{is the black}} scale bug, a small black scale insect that resembles a small black spot. They attach {{themselves}} firmly to olive trees and reduce {{the quality of the}} fruit; their main predators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats the edges of leaves, leaving <b>sawtooth</b> damage.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the east}} side of the <b>Sawtooth</b> Range is drained by the main stem of the Salmon River and the west side by the South Fork Payette River. Small {{portions}} of the northern and southern ends of the range are in the watersheds of the Middle Fork Salmon River and Boise River, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{library is}} near located, {{accessible}} by a door which the jambs and the lintel are carved in marble, {{adorned with a}} frieze of floral decoration. The library window is marked by an elegant setting that has two columns flanking the opening, which is a horseshoe arch topped by six blind arches and crowned {{by a series of}} berms <b>sawtooth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Land cover {{types in}} the <b>Sawtooth</b> Wilderness include pine and spruce-fir forests, meadows, and alpine tundra. Lodgepole pine forms nearly {{monotypic}} forests in lower elevations of the wilderness, while douglas fir and quaking aspen can also be found. Higher elevations contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine. There are no known threatened or endangered plant species in the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|Idaho's {{highest point}} is Borah Peak, , in the Lost River Range north of Mackay. Idaho's lowest point, , is in Lewiston, where the Clearwater River joins the Snake River and {{continues}} into Washington. The <b>Sawtooth</b> Range is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range. Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the Bitterroot Range, the White Cloud Mountains, the Lost River Range, the Clearwater Mountains, and the Salmon River Mountains.|$|E
