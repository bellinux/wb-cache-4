His administration oversaw the construction of thousands of new schools and health clinics. Road rehabilitation aided in improving rural farmers' access to markets. The establishment of the independent anti-corruption agency BIANCO, and the adoption of diverse <b>supporting</b> <b>policies</b> resulted in a decline in government corruption. The acreage of natural areas under protection expanded in fulfillment of Ravalomanana's [...] "Madagascar Naturally" [...] development program. The 2007 release of Ravalomanana's comprehensive development strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan, set targets and goals for national development over his second term {{in the areas of}} governance, infrastructure, agriculture, health, economy, environment and national solidarity.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's {{political}} {{frame for}} her travel narrative {{was a difficult}} one to sell to readers. Her audience wanted to support the revolutionaries, especially exiles living among them, such as Mazzini, {{but they were also}} fearful of the violence of the Carbonari and its nationalist ideology. They connected nationalism to their historic enemy—Napoleonic France. In fact, other travel works published at the time made the argument that Napoleon was responsible for Italian unification. Shelley therefore contends that the Risorgimento is primarily inspired by the English and only secondarily by the French (she never names Napoleon). Shelley writes a history of Italian nationalism acceptable to English readers, in which the French are the tyrants oppressing the rising nation of Italy, which the Carbonari, although violent, has inspired and created. Her readers could therefore comfortably support Italian nationalism without <b>supporting</b> <b>policies</b> reminiscent of Napoleon. She also placed most of her political commentary {{at the end of the}} text. As Moskal explains, [...] "Shelley creates a structure in which the reader, having already befriended the traveller for some pages, receives this political matter from a friend, not from a stranger." [...] She also praises Italian literature, particularly the works of Alessandro Manzoni, Pietro Colletta, and Michele Amari, connecting it to Italian nationalism.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} has a three pronged purpose: one, {{describe}} how the faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct {{developed by the}} Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) exists at four Virtual Colleges and Universities Consortia (VCU). Two, describe how VCUs degree of centralization and emphasis on business practices influences the faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct of their respective sampled institutions. Three, search for patterns in policy characteristics across the same four VCUs accounting for their degree of centralization and emphasis on business practices. The study is among the first in-depth qualitative studies to apply SREB 2 ̆ 7 s faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct to representative VCUs of the Epper and Garn taxonomy, delve into specific details of the faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct proposed by SREB, and search for policy patterns among representative VCUs selected for the study. The study provides much needed insight that is currently missing from the literature and that should assist university leaders, policy makers, and faculty {{in the administration of}} day-to-day activities at Virtual Colleges and Universities Consortia or academic collaborations. The study design is a multiple-case study. The design facilitated obtaining better insight, description, and discovery of how the faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct exists today at the selected VCUs, how the construct influences the operation of each VCU, and if patterns exist in faculty support characteristics among the four institutions. The design encouraged a high level and comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under study, distance learning policy, and the development of general theoretical statements. Data gathering techniques were semi-structured phone interviews and document analysis. Study findings revealed that the SREB faculty <b>support</b> <b>policy</b> construct exists at the four sample institutions with very distinct levels of intensity. Findings also revealed that sampled VCUs degree of centralization and business practice influence some faculty <b>support</b> <b>policies</b> implemented at the sampled higher education institutions. Lastly, findings reveal that patterns exist across higher education institutions in terms of faculty <b>support</b> <b>policies.</b> While some patterns diverge from the Epper and Garn taxonomy most patterns are just expected and consistent across higher education institutions...|$|R
