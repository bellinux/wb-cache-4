5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> {{the runway}} while {{attempting}} to land {{at the airport in}} a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E

6000|$|Too late! Dorn {{watched the}} youth's last {{clutching}} of empty fingers, the last look of consciousness at his conqueror, the last quiver. The youth died and <b>slid</b> back <b>off</b> the rigid bayonet. War of men! ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{would all}} no doubt have {{been eager to}} hear Bert's story over again, but it was it this point that Laurier showed his quality. [...] "No, SIR," [...] he said, and <b>slid</b> from <b>off</b> his table.|$|R
5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> into the sea.|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The session was held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to swerve to avoid hitting a van parked at the corner. It prompted the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{accordingly}} {{went back}} to the kitchen. They found that Dorothy had taken the nails away from the fire, and they were now almost cool. Stuyvesant <b>slid</b> them <b>off</b> from the shovel upon a small board, which he had brought in for that purpose, and then they {{went back to}} the shop.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent damage to a {{desiccator}} the lid should be carefully <b>slid</b> on and <b>off</b> instead of being directly placed onto the base.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You cannot bind me!' shouted Makoma, rushing {{upon him}} and {{striking}} with his hammer. But the river giant was so slimy that the blow <b>slid</b> harmlessly <b>off</b> his green chest, and as Makoma stumbled {{and tried to}} regain his balance, the giant swung one of his long hairs around him and tripped him up.|$|R
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil braked later and <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
60|$|Joel {{ran down}} to his skiff and, leaping in, began to row vigorously across. Bostil watched while the workmen turned the boat over and <b>slid</b> it <b>off</b> the sand-bar and tied it {{securely}} to the mooring. Bostil observed that not a man there saw anything unusual about the river. But, for that matter, {{there was nothing to}} see. The river was the same.|$|R
50|$|When {{the song}} was {{released}} in June 2013, a music video for it was filmed {{and it had to}} be released later on. The single <b>slid</b> quickly <b>off</b> the charts, with the label promoting Bentley's next single, 'I Hold On'. The music video remained unreleased until it premiered in February 2014 as 'Bourbon in Kentucky - The Lost Video. It was directed by Ryan Pallotta.|$|R
60|$|Owen {{had always}} been with her before, but there was now a force of habit in the proceeding, and with Arcadian innocence she assumed that a row on the water was, under any circumstances, a natural thing. Without another word being spoken on either side, they went down the steps. He {{carefully}} handed her in, took his seat, <b>slid</b> noiselessly <b>off</b> the sand, {{and away from the}} shore.|$|R
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The track was dusty when the first practice sessions were held; grip was poor and some drivers were forced onto the run-off areas after they <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the track. Hamilton set the pace in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 40.887 seconds; almost one-tenth of a second quicker than Kubica. Rosberg and Michael Schumacher set the third- and sixth-fastest times respectively for Mercedes; they were separated by Vettel and Button. Webber was seventh quickest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld. The two Williams drivers completed the top ten; Nico Hülkenberg was ahead of Rubens Barrichello. Hispania driver Bruno Senna spun at turn nine after his left rear suspension broke and stopped on the track without hitting the barriers. Grip was improved for the second practice session, in which Webber set a time of 1:37.942—the quickest of the day—despite spinning late in the session. Alonso was second-quickest and Hamilton was third. Kubica set the fourth-quickest time. Button, who was sidelined for most of the session with an overheated exhaust, was fifth. Massa, Vettel, Vitaly Petrov, Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi made {{up the rest of the}} top ten. Sakon Yamamoto in the other Hispania car caused the session to be suspended after spinning and stopping his car at turn sixteen.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, 2011, United Express Flight 3363, an Embraer ERJ-145 (N840HK) {{operated}} by Trans States Airlines, <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the runway upon landing. All 44 passengers and the 3 crew aboard were uninjured, although the plane sustained substantial damage.|$|E
25|$|May 15, 1953: A Braniff International Airways Douglas DC-4 {{carrying}} 48 {{passengers and}} five crew <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> {{the end of}} Runway 36, crossed Lemmon Avenue, and plowed into an embankment. Despite reportedly heavy automobile traffic on the busy street, no vehicles were struck, and nobody aboard the airliner was seriously injured. The crash was attributed to poor braking action on the rain-slicked runway.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1987 a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle 10R (SE-DEC) crashed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Immediately after take-off, at an {{altitude}} of , a fault with the elevator caused the nose to pitch down and the aircraft to land hard. The aircraft subsequently <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the runway and bust into fire. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. None of the six crew members and twenty-one passengers were killed.|$|E
50|$|By race time on Sunday, {{there were}} 40,000 fans braving the cold winds {{and a threat}} of rain. At the start, Clark led off the grid, while Hill jumped into second behind him. With Ginther, Brabham, Gurney and McLaren following, the two Championship rivals pulled away, already {{lowering}} the F1 track record on lap 3! Gurney got by Brabham and Ginther and briefly took third place, but on lap 11, Ginther retook the spot behind his teammate when Gurney <b>slid</b> half <b>off</b> the track, inches from the Armco, {{on a patch of}} oil in the Loop.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} the steamer <b>slid</b> and lifted <b>off</b> the reef. For {{a few moments}} she wallowed; then {{suddenly}} her stern settled, her prow rose slowly in the air till it stood up straight, fifty or sixty feet of it. Then, with a majestic, but hideous rush, down went the Trondhjem and vanished for ever.|$|R
60|$|But Robin {{had not yet}} met his doom, {{although}} he had descended full sixty feet. His fall was broken by several leafy trees, through which he went like an avalanche; and a thick solid bush receiving him at the foot, checked his descent entirely, and <b>slid</b> him quietly <b>off</b> its boughs on to the grass, where he lay, stunned, indeed, but otherwise uninjured.|$|R
25|$|In one {{incident}} {{during the last}} few days of mixing, Anderson left the studio one morning with Offord carrying the tapes. Offord placed them on-top of his car in order to find his car keys, and proceeded to drive away, forgetting about the tapes. They stopped the car to find the tapes had <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> and fell on the road, causing Anderson to rush back and stop an oncoming bus to save them.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 2017 a VIM Airlines {{charter flight}} to Ufa, Russia <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> the runway during take-off. The plane was {{carrying}} 40 passengers and 7 crew members. No injuries were reported. Aircraft's engine was damaged as it hit airport equipment. The runway was checked and closed {{for three hours}} after incident. Flights were diverted to Tallinn Airport and Kaunas Airport and others were delayed. The Transport Accident and Incident Investigation Bureau of Latvia started an investigation.|$|E
25|$|Like Led Zeppelin's fourth album, {{neither the}} band's name nor the album title was {{printed on the}} sleeve. However, manager Peter Grant did allow Atlantic Records to add a {{wrap-around}} paper title band to US and UK copies of the sleeve {{that had to be}} broken or <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> to access the record. This hid the children's buttocks from general display, but still the album was either banned or unavailable {{in some parts of the}} Southern United States for several years.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the final}} lap, the cars {{approached}} the famous [...] "Corkscrew" [...] turns, with Herta leading. It was {{a spot on}} the track where competitive passes were seldom, due to being a tight, steep downhill segment. Zanardi made a daring, diving pass to the inside as Herta was under braking, and slid into the lead. Zanardi, however, <b>slid</b> forward <b>off</b> the track, attempting to go straight through the turns. As the hill dipped, and the corkscrew turns reversed, the inside lane became the outside line. His car bounced wildly over the curbing, throwing up dirt, became airborne, and narrowly missed a barrier. He swung across the track in front of Herta, with Herta narrowly missing a collision. Zanardi was able to gather control, and astonishingly made the pass stick. Zanardi held Herta off over the final two turns, and scored an improbable victory.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 August 1998 - Korean Air Flight 8702 (Boeing 747-400) from Tokyo to Seoul. The flight {{departed}} Tokyo at 16:50 for {{a flight}} to Seoul, scheduled to arrive there at 19:20. Inclement weather at Seoul forced the flight crew to divert to Jeju. The aircraft took off from Jeju at 21:07 bound for Seoul. On landing in Seoul, the 747 bounced multiple times and <b>slid</b> 100 meters <b>off</b> the runway before coming {{to a stop in}} a grassy area.

6000|$|... "That puzzled me. There is no tide {{to speak}} of in these seas, {{and there was no}} wind moving about. I could make out now that it was a boat, though a very small one, but {{certainly}} there was no one rowing it. It looked a very strange craft, and as I saw by the way it was bearing that it would come ashore about five or six fathoms from where I was sitting, I <b>slid</b> quietly <b>off</b> the rock, put my sword down by me handy for action, and waited. Presently the boat came up alongside the rock, and a fellow stood up from behind the stern. I was glad to see him, for I had begun to think that there was witchcraft in the thing moving along by itself, but I can tell you I was savage with myself for not having guessed there was a man swimming behind and pushing it on.|$|R
