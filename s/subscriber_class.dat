40|$|The {{growth in}} the number of {{cellular}} mobile subscribers worldwide has far outpaced expected rates of growth with worldwide mobile subscriptions reaching 6 Billion subscribers in 2011 according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). More than 75 % of this figure is in developing countries. With this rate of growth, greater pressure is placed on radio resources in mobile networks which impacts on the quality and grade of service (GOS) in the network. With varying demands that are generated from different <b>subscriber</b> <b>classes</b> in a network, the ability to distinguish between subscriber types in a network is vital to optimise infrastructure and resources in a mobile network. In this study, a new approach for subscriber classification in mobile cellular networks is proposed. In the proposed approach, traffic data extracted from two network providers in South Africa is considered. The traffic data is first decomposed using traditional feature extraction approaches such as the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). The result...|$|R
50|$|A novel but {{subsequently}} disastrous feature {{designed by}} Bell Antwerp {{was used to}} hold the <b>subscriber’s</b> <b>class</b> of service information i.e. PBX, shared service, incoming calls barred (ICB), temporary out of service (TOS) etc. This was a capacitor store, and it held information on a thin plastic strip, into which could be inserted up to 10 little copper squares which had a capacitance of 10 pico farad. The thin plastic strips were then inserted into the Data Store rack, one at the position representing the directory number and another at the position representing the equipment number. This {{can be seen in}} the photograph together with some plastic strips hanging by wire. Hanging the strips by wire was a common practice for subscribers who were constantly changing their Class of Service, i.e. being made TOS. This information was then pulsed by the STC common control translator and appropriate action taken. STC had enormous trouble getting it to work, which caused a delay to the opening of the exchange. In the end the problem turned out to be cable interference requiring substantial re-cabling at the rear of the rack. This system was not used again and was replaced by a threaded-core store called Dimond Rings in TXE3, TXE4 and TXE2, which were extremely reliable.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{importance}} of taking into account accurate mobility effects in performance evaluation of key teletraffic metrics of mobile communication networks. To accomplish this task, we introduce a new discrete stochastic node, the Pole of Gravity characterizing the temporal and spatial behavior of mobile users. This novel concept forms the realm of our mobility model termed as Scalable Mobility Model (SMM) and provides a realistic set of Oaths traversed by subscribers {{on a daily basis}} by taking into account attraction points, geographical environments, time factor and grouping individual <b>subscribers</b> into specific <b>classes</b> of mobility. Using this Approach, we demonstrate the need and importance of taking mobility-related factors in the analysis of teletraffic issues by investigating the signaling and traffic related parameters such cell residence time and traffic load. Our simulation results include a comparative performance of SMM against the well known random way point model for same performance issues for the City Area of Bristol, UK during the rush and busy hour...|$|R

The <b>subscribers</b> in each <b>class</b> arrive to the system in batches; the batch sizes follow the geometric process. If the server is free at the time of any batch arrivals, the subscriber of this batch begins to be served immediately and leave the system forever. The priority subscribers that find the server busy are queued and then are served in accordance with FCFS discipline. The arriving non-priority subscribers on finding the server busy cannot be queued and leave the service area and try their chance after some random time. If a subscriber is being served at the instant of the server failure, the service is interrupted and restarted after repair. The life time of the server is assumed to be exponentially distributed. The repair time and service time are also assumed to be i. i. d. general distributed. We obtain the condition of Ergodicity for such a queueing system. The analytical results for queue size distribution as well as some performance characteristics under steady state conditions by applying supplementary variable technique are derived. The waiting time distribution is also discussed for priority and non-priority subscribers. By taking illustration, computational results are provided to facilitate the sensitivity analysis...|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{provides}} {{the ability to}} obtain results from, and analyse, a system without physically building the system. These results {{can be used to}} inform the actual construction of the physical system, how best to use a system, how best to integrate a system with another system, and so on. A simulation {{can also be used to}} train and educate the end-users of a system either before the system is actually produced or when the availability of the actual system is limited. Most end systems are in some way composed of subsystems. The subsystems themselves may be composed of subsystems. This type of architecture is generically referred to as a system of systems. For example, a ship is composed of a hull, engines, sensors, etc. The engine system may be composed of the fuel and cooling subsystems, for example. Systems constructed this way have numerous benefits including allowing subsystems to be built independently of each other (after creating well defined interfaces), and allowing for subsystems to be replaced without affecting other subsystems. These same benefits are desirable in the construction of a simulation of a system. One simulation framework that supports these ideals is the High Level Architecture (HLA). The HLA is an international modelling and simulation framework that specifically provides for distributed simulation. The HLA uses the term federate for component simulations that are then brought together in a distributed computing environment to form a federation. The HLA defines a data model for documenting the data interfaces of the federates and the application programming interface used by the federates to communicate data. A simulation of a systems of systems architecture can be implemented in the HLA by creating federates for each subsystem and defining the data communicated between subsystems in terms of HLA’s data model. HLA’s default communication model defines publishers and <b>subscribers</b> of data <b>classes.</b> The HLA provides class based filtering, i. e., a federate only receives data for a data class to which it has subscribed. However, HLA’s default communication model has no notion of direct ‘wiring’ between federates. Thus, it is not possible to have data sent to a specific federate. This creates a problem if multiple instances of a system of systems are simulated concurrently, which may be desirable so as to observe the interactions between systems. In this case, the data sent within one system is exposed to all other systems in the simulation. This thesis explores this problem of simulating multiple systems of systems using the HLA. The problem is stated formally by introducing the concept of a message path and showing that a federation containing multiple systems of systems contains incorrect message paths which communicate intra-system data between systems. Three methods are presented and shown to solve the problem by either eliminating the incorrect message paths or allowing a receiving federate to determine whether intra-system data was delivered via an incorrect message path. The three solutions are Local Data Filtering (LDF), Data Distribution Management (DDM), and Federation Communities (FC). The LDF solution marks all intra-system data with a system identifier, allowing receivers to distinguish whether they should process it. The DDM method uses a service defined by the HLA that essentially provides an automated version of the LDF solution. The FC method restricts one federation to simulating one system and requires a multiple system simulation to enable inter-federation communication, something that is not defined in the HLA. These three methods are analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis looks at performance overhead imposed by each method and how well each method reduces the number of incorrect intra-system messages communicated. The qualitative analysis is presented in terms of identifying the complexity of implementing each method for a specific systems of systems federation: the election process for the Australian federal government. The thesis concludes that the LDF method is simple to understand but potentially finicky to implement and is wasteful of network resources. The DDMmethod is advantageous in that it is a service defined by the HLA standard. However, the implementation of the DDM services by a Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) is not defined by the HLA. Thus, the performance of the DDMmethod is coupled to a specific RTI and its configurability. The FC method achieves an ideal of replicating the simulation of a single system without modification to achieve a multisystem simulation. However, it requires and inter-federation communicationmechanism that is not defined by the HLA. The FC method introduces extra latency and reduced throughput to inter-system messages in a Local Area Network (LAN) environment. Thesis (Ph. D.)
