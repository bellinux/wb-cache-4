2500|$|Prosperity {{returned}} after the war, with the efficiently managed Seaboard Road showing a profit {{even during the}} Panic of 1873, and paying stockholders an annual dividend of 8 percent for many years. [...] In 1871, the Raleigh and Gaston acquired the Raleigh and Augusta Air-Line Railroad, which, however, reached only to Hamlet, North Carolina. [...] When the R and its <b>subsidiary</b> <b>fell</b> into financial straits in 1873, the Seaboard's president, John M. Robinson, acquired financial control of them, becoming president of all three railroads in 1875.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, {{the current}} Veolia Transport Česká republika a.s. with its four <b>subsidiary</b> {{companies}} <b>fell</b> under Arriva group as Arriva Transport Česká republika a.s. The daughter companies were simultaneously renamed and rebranded as Arriva Praha s.r.o., Arriva Teplice s.r.o., Arriva Vychodni Cechy a.s. and Arriva Morava a.s. They operate primarily buses (it {{is the biggest}} bus transport operator in the Czech Republic) but also trolleybuses in Teplice (Arriva Teplice) and Desná Railway (Arriva Morava).|$|R
25|$|Investment in {{exploration}} at YPF as {{a percentage}} of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol <b>subsidiaries,</b> and <b>fell</b> from 30 new wells in 1998 to eight in 2010 (French energy firm Total S.A. overtook YPF as the leading oil driller in Argentina). Its reserves of crude and natural gas fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011, and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas.|$|R
50|$|After Moment of Clarity was released, {{the band}} was courted by major labels {{including}} Roadrunner Records. They eventually signed to a Universal imprint, but that deal folded when Universal restructured and eliminated that particular <b>subsidiary.</b> The band <b>fell</b> back to KMG, which had then been resurrected as Fashion Pop Records by Frank Chimento, releasing an eponymous album in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Stolpe became {{division}} manager in Wärtsilä in 1976 and in 1978 {{he became the}} company director of operations. During period of dual leadership in 1978-1987 he managed Wärtsilä together with Tankmar Horn, after which he became managing director. Stolpe left his position in 1989 — {{in the same year}} when the company <b>subsidiary</b> Wärtsilä Marine <b>fell</b> in bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|A June 1959 Halls {{merger with}} Thermotank and Vent-Axia to form Hall-Thermotank proved a disaster. Profits <b>fell,</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> were sold, and the foundry closed. In 1968 the company {{decided to focus}} on the {{production}} of concentrate refrigeration units and air conditioners, producing small automatic compressors using methyl chloride as the refrigerant. The company's financial situation began to improve after a major reorganization in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{feature of}} many Pennine dales and Lake District fells are {{the groups of}} cairns on the high ground. There is a fine cluster of ‘stone men’ on The Nab of Wild Boar Fell — and a smaller group on <b>subsidiary</b> peak, Little <b>Fell</b> (1,834 ft, 559 m) at , 1¼ miles (2 km) to the north. There seems little {{agreement}} on when, why, or by which people such cairns were built. (One common suggestion, that they were built by shepherds as markers for paths, may {{explain some of the}} cruder ‘piles of stones’; but groups like those on The Nab surely need a more convincing explanation.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Gavel Fell {{being the}} [...] "middle finger" [...] {{has a long}} ridge running south west from the valley. This rises gently at first past High Nook farm, before {{accelerating}} its climb up the face of Black Crag to the summit plateau. A subsidiary top (1,601 ft) is reached first, unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps but referred to as High Nook in some guidebooks. The ridge widens, damply, and turns south at the summit, dropping over a rough patch of ground named White Oak. Beyond is Banna Fell (1,496 ft), which could lay claim to separate status but is generally considered a <b>subsidiary</b> of Gavel <b>Fell.</b> Banna Fell has a very prominent eastern top named Floutern Cop (1,480 ft).|$|R
5000|$|Under Outlet, WIOQ {{evolved into}} an eclectic music format often {{described}} as [...] "adult rock". The station played a blend of softer songs heard on rock music stations, some deeper album cuts, a few top 40 crossover hits, {{and a bit of}} uptempo jazz. Leading air personalities on WIOQ in this era included John Harvey ("Harvey in the Morning"), Helen Leicht who hosted a show called [...] "Breakfast With The Beatles" [...] on Sunday mornings, David Dye, Ed Sciaky and Michael Tozzi. (Leicht and Dye are now the midday DJs for the adult alternative public station WXPN. The former continues her [...] "Leight Lunch" [...] program at noon, and Dye is the producer and host of the nationally distributed World Cafe.) After a proposed sale of Outlet's broadcast properties to Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures <b>subsidiary</b> around 1982 <b>fell</b> through, the station group was acquired by Wesray Capital Corporation, a corporation partially owned by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon.|$|R
