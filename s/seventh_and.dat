5|$|Though {{the first}} six are {{unanimously}} accepted by texts, the name and features of the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> eighth Matrika are disputed.

The Varaha Purana names Yami– the Shakti of Yama, as the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> Yogishwari as the eighth Matrika, created by flames emerging from Shiva's mouth. In Nepal, the eighth Matrika is called Maha-Lakshmi or Lakshmi is added omitting Narasimhi.
