5|$|Swimming is {{the second}} most practised sport. There are two <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> {{complexes}} next {{to each other in the}} North side: one Municipally owned and another one privately held. The city pool complex is managed by Varzim Lazer. The venue has several pools including an Olympic-size <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> and swimming lessons for babies, children, and adults. It also holds the International Meeting of Póvoa de Varzim, in long course pool, part of the European winter calendar. The other complex is property of Clube Desportivo da Póvoa. The site also offers swimming lessons and some swimming pools, including a heated saltwater <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> filled with Póvoa de Varzim's seawater.|$|E
40|$|Bodies of water, {{particularly}} <b>swimming</b> <b>pools,</b> are land {{covers of}} high interest. Their maintenance involves energy costs that authorities {{must take into}} consideration. In addition, <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> are important water sources for firefighting. However, they also provide a habitat for mosquitoes to breed, potentially posing a serious health threat of mosquito-borne disease. This paper presents a novel semi-automatic method of detecting <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> in urban environments from aerial images and LIDAR data. A new index for detecting <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> is presented (Normalized Difference <b>Swimming</b> <b>Pools</b> Index) that is combined with three other decision indices using the Dempster–Shafer theory to determine the locations of <b>swimming</b> <b>pools.</b> The proposed method was tested in an urban area {{of the city of}} Alcalá de Henares in Madrid, Spain. The method detected all existing <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> in the studied area with an overall accuracy of 99. 86 %, similar to the results obtained by support vector machines (SVM) supervised classification...|$|R

50|$|Conventional halogen-based oxidizers such as {{chlorine}} and bromine are {{convenient and}} economical primary sanitizers for <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> {{and provide a}} residual level of sanitizer that remains in the water.

Both are members of the halogen group with demonstrated ability to destroy and deactivate a wide range of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses in <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> and spas. Both exhibit three essential elements as ideal first-line-of-defense sanitizers for <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> and spas: they are fast-acting and enduring, they are effective algaecides, and they oxidize undesired contaminants.|$|R
