25|$|Organic {{molecules}} often show {{a dramatic}} increase in solubility with temperature, partly because of the polarity changes described above, and also because the solubility of sparingly soluble materials tends to increase with temperature as they have a high enthalpy of solution. Thus materials generally considered “insoluble” can become soluble in superheated water. E.g., the solubility of PAHs is increased by 5 orders of magnitude from 25°C to 225°C and naphthalene, for example, forms a 10% wt <b>solution</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> at 270°C, and the solubility of the pesticide chloranthonil with temperature is shown in the table below.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{most commonly}} {{available as a}} <b>solution</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes {{described in terms of}} the volume of oxygen gas generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of oxygen gas when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in dedicated storage areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers.|$|E

30|$|To {{indicate}} that the analytical signal for the standard <b>solutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> and that <b>in</b> the chloroform-ethanol mixture were equal, an investigation was carried out. For this purpose, a series of working solutions were prepared, as follows: 20  μL of the standard solutions of Cu(II) ions in the concentration range of 10.0 – 100.0  μg mL− 1 was added to a mixture of 60  μL of chloroform and 120  μL of ethanol.

Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. [...] Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. [...] This information {{can be used to}} determine the distance between nuclei.

2500|$|It most {{commonly}} occurs as a crystalline decahydrate, which readily effloresces {{to form a}} white powder, the monohydrate. Pure sodium carbonate is a white, odorless powder that is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air). It has a strongly alkaline taste, and forms a moderately basic <b>solution</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> Sodium carbonate is well known domestically for its everyday use as a water softener. Historically it was extracted {{from the ashes of}} plants growing in sodium-rich soils, such as vegetation from the Middle East, kelp from Scotland and seaweed from Spain. Because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of timber (used to create potash), they became known as [...] "soda ash". It is synthetically produced in large quantities from salt (sodium chloride) and limestone by a method known as the Solvay process.|$|E
