The current {{study was conducted in}} two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application. It has been established {{for the first time that}} a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other <b>sorbant</b> surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication. A summation of the above for a 3 - 6 -year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 microg/kg/day. Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible, while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61 % of the total dose, respectively. If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues, the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 microg/kg/day. Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other <b>sorbant</b> surfaces, e. g., pillows, with large <b>sorbant</b> reservoirs, which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child. Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other <b>sorbant</b> surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern, and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment. The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys, pillows, and other <b>sorbant</b> objects during insecticidal application...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program is to develop methods for concentrating tritium in water based on large primary isotope effects in catalytic redox processes. Basic research is being conducted to develop the chemistry of a complete cyclic process. Because tritium (generally present as HTO) is in a rapidly established equilibrium with protio-water, it moves with groundwater and separation from water cannot be achieved by the usual pump-and-treat methods using <b>sorbants.</b> The general methodology developed in this work will be applicable {{to a number of}} DOE waste streams, and {{as a consequence of the}} process tritium will be incorporated into an organic compound that will not readily exchange the tritium with groundwater. The authors intend to develop a process to remove tritium from H{sub 2 }O by concentrating it with respect to protio-water. This research involves developing chemical cycles that produce high concentration factors for HTO and T{sub 2 }O based on the discrimination of C-H and C-T bonds in oxidation reactions. Several steps are required in a cyclic process for the concentration of tritium in water. In the first step the tritium is incorporated in an organic compound. H-T discrimination occurs as the tritium containing compound is oxidized in a step involving a Ru(IV) oxo complex. Strong primary kinetic isotope effects lead to the oxidation of C-H bonds in preference to C-T bonds, and this reaction leads to concentration of tritium in the organic compound. The reduced form of the ruthenium compound can be reoxidized so that the oxidation step can be made catalytic. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that certain manganese oxides have the ability to sorb aqueous metal cations much more efficiently than any of the naturally occurring iron oxides when normalized to surface area. This ability is, at least in part, related to the internal sites available in many manganese oxide structures, including those within tunnels and between sheets. Additionally, a new naturally-occurring manganese oxide structurally related to vernadite ({delta}-MnO{sub 2 }), collected along the Clark Fork River in western Montana, USA, has shown the ability to sorb arsenate, an anionic complex. The potential for manganese oxides to sorb anions has made it an attractive material as a radionuclide ''getter''. According to the US Department of Energy's Total Systems Performance Assessment, technetium and iodine are two major anionic radionuclides contributing to the list of potential contaminants released from Yucca Mountain repository, Nevada, USA. These two radionuclides are extremely problematic because they are very mobile in the environment. This project involves running flow-through sorption experiments using rhenium (a surrogate for technetium) and stable iodine as sorbates and several synthetic manganese oxides, including birnessite, vernadite, cryptomelane, and possibly the new vernadite-like phase mentioned earlier, as <b>sorbants.</b> For all synthesis reactions, manganese (VII) salts are reduced to manganese (III,IV) oxides. The different oxides are produced from specific reductants and/or the addition of heat, followed by multiple washing steps. To verify that the proper phases have been synthesized, all oxides are analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The sorption experiments will be run in flow-through reactors bearing the aqueous complex of interest, where solutions, at various temperatures, pH's, and ionic strengths, will pass through a bed of one of the manganese oxides.

Under optimised biotransformation conditions (37 degrees C, pH 5. 4) and with benzoyl formate as a substrate, benzaldehyde may be accumulated with yields above 85 %. Benzaldehyde is toxic to P. putida ATCC 12633; levels above 0. 5 g/l (5 mM) reduce the biotransformation activity. Total activity loss occurs at an aldehyde concentration of 2. 1 g/l (20 mM). To overcome this limitation, the rapid removal of the aldehyde is desirable via in situ product removal. The biotransformation of benzoyl formate (working volume 1 l) without in situ product removal accumulates 2. 1 g/l benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde removal by gas stripping produces a total of 3. 5 g/l before inhibition. However, the most efficient method is solid-phase adsorption using activated charcoal as the <b>sorbant,</b> this allows the production of over 4. 1 g/l benzaldehyde.

Glucose (1 % w/v) and a peptone/yeast extract ratio of 5. 1 (0. 6 % w/v final concentration) yielded an EPS fraction (HMW-glucose) exhibiting the highest anionic activity (20. 5) and specific emulsifying activity (EI 24 = 100 %) compared to EPS produced by cells grown on mannitol, sucrose, malt extract or no carbon source. The HMW-EPS fractions were capable of binding â‰ˆ 255 - 464 mg of methylene blue (MB) per gram of EPS, which represents the highest reported binding of MB by a bacterial EPS. A comparative evaluation of these properties to those of commercial hydrocolloids indicated that the combined effect of protein and anionic residues of the HMW-EPS contributed to its ability to emulsify n-hexadecane. Liquid chromatography revealed the HMW-glucose EPS to be a heterogeneous polymer with a polydispersity index of 1. 8.

Levels of VEGF and sVEGFR- 1 were compared in follicular fluid and serum, both {{on the day of}} human choriogonadotropin (hCG) administration and on the day of oocyte retrieval (OR), in controls and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing IVF cycles. The bioactivity of VEGF (VEGF/sVEGFR- 1 ratio) in the two groups was calculated. Thirty PCOS patients and 20 controls referring to the IVF Centre of the University of Pisa (Italy) were enrolled. In each patient, blood samples were collected on the day of hCG and on the day of OR administration, and follicular fluid samples.

Serum and follicular fluid VEGF bioactivity was greater in PCOS patients than in controls on the day of OR. The increase in VEGF bioactivity in PCOS patients undergoing IVF was not only because of increasing levels of VEGF but also to decreasing levels of its soluble receptor.

Total homocysteine level is a strong predictor of mortality in-patient with an angiographically confirmed Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), {{so we want to}} know at what age in males and females elevated homocysteine will be significantly elevated and this will help for better management and prognosis by decreasing the level of homocysteine. Approach: Plasma level of homocysteine was determined in male and female patients below and above 50 years old, who have coronary heart disease with diabetes or without diabetes. Fifty two coronary heart diseases with type 2 diabetic patients and a matched number of healthy subjects as a control and another 52 coronary heart disease patients without diabetes were included in this study. Plasma homocysteine was determined by Enzymatic Immuno <b>Sorbant</b> Assay (ELISA). Results: Plasma homocysteine level in coronary heart disease diabetic male and female patients who are - 1, respectively, while it is 28. 12 ± 9. 5 and 29. 44 ± 4. 3 umol L - 1 in male and female patients > 50 years old, respectively.

Despite their public health significance, routine detection of HuNoV in community settings, or food and environmental samples, is limited, and {{there is a need to}} develop alternative HuNoV diagnostic reagents to complement existing ones. The purpose of this study was to select and characterize single-stranded (ss) DNA aptamers with binding affinity to HuNoV. The utility of these aptamers was demonstrated in their use for capture and detection of HuNoV in outbreak-derived fecal samples and a representative food matrix. SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) was used to isolate ssDNA aptamer sequences with broad reactivity to the prototype GII. 2 HuNoV strain, Snow Mountain Virus (SMV). Four aptamer candidates (designated 19, 21, 25 and 26) were identified and screened for binding affinity to 14 different virus-like particles (VLPs) corresponding to various GI and GII HuNoV strains using an Enzyme-Linked Aptamer <b>Sorbant</b> Assay (ELASA). Collectively, aptamers 21 and 25 showed affinity to 13 of the 14 VLPs tested, with strongest binding to GII. 2 (SMV) and GII. 4 VLPs. Aptamer 25 was chosen for further study. Its binding affinity to SMV-VLPs was equivalent to that of a commercial antibody within a range of 1 to 5 µg/ml. Aptamer 25 also showed binding to representative HuNoV strains present in stool specimens obtained from naturally infected individuals. Lastly, an aptamer magnetic capture (AMC) method using aptamer 25 coupled with RT-qPCR was developed for recovery and detection of HuNoV in artificially contaminated lettuce.

This dissertation details the synthesis and properties of polymers that demonstrate such types of functionality for emerging electronics and chemical sensing applications. In Chapter 1, we present a general introduction to organic electronic materials and chemical sensory technologies.

In Chapters 2 and 3, we develop some novel polymeric materials for organic electronics applications. In Chapter 2, the development of several insulating polymers that demonstrate very high porosity in the solid state is discussed. The high porosity is provided by rigid three-dimensional frameworks, which present large amounts of internal free volume. In Chapter 3, we present the development of conducting polymeric materials that present rigid iptycene frameworks. These materials are prepared through an electro-chemical deposition process. (cont.) In Chapter 4, we find that the performance of an established conjugated polymer-based chemical sensory technology can be enhanced through the employment of pendant hexafluoroisopropanol groups that function as strong hydrogen bond-donating <b>sorbant</b> elements for weakly-binding analytes. In Chapter 5, we demonstrate that these hexafluoroisopropanol groups can be incorporated into a host of polymeric materials through a unique solid-state functionalization step that employs the reactive chemical hexafluoroacetone. These materials may be useful for analyte pre-concentration applications. Finally, in Chapter 6, we develop new, highly-luminescent conjugated polymers for future organic light-emitting diode-based display applications using hexafluoroacetone as a source of fluorination for the polymers. These materials demonstrate greater photo-oxidative stability that may extend their lifetimes in device applications. by John Paul Amara. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The main aims of this study were to {{investigate}} the presence of islet cell autoantibodies, differentiate between insulin dependence and insulin independence as well as to diagnose the prevalence of thyroid disorders among diabetes mellitus type two patients. Blood samples were taken from eighty eight(88) Sudanese type II diabetic patients (represented as 57. 2 % were female while 41. 8 % were males) and forty(40) apparently healthy individualsas control group as 50 % for both sexes. The mean age was (50. 3) and (48. 7) years for the patients and the control groups respectively ranged between (40 - 65) year. Out of the total patients, 69. 3 % have family history of diabetes. The duration of the disease ranged between 1 - 10 years. All of the patients received oral treatment (Insulin independence). Pancreatic autoantibodies were detected by using the Enzyme Linked Immuno <b>Sorbant</b> Assay (ELISA). To estimate the level of the thyroid hormones (T 3 & T 4) and the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) among diabetic patients, Radio Immune Assays (RIA/ IRMA) techniques were used to determine the relation between diabetes mellitus and thyroid gland disorders. The FBG was measured colourimetrically. A significant increase (p= 0. 00) in FBG level was observed among the patients compared to the healthy subjects. Pancreatic autoantibodies were detected in 9 patients (10. 2 %), but no evidence of a relation between Fasting Blood Sugar IV (FBG) level and the pancreatic autoantibodies detected. Out of the 9 patients examined, 3 of them were shown to have thyroid disorders. When the thyroid disorders were screened, 24 patients (27. 3 %) were found to have clinical, subclinical, hypo or hyper thyroidism from all the patients. Furthermore, TSH level(0. 01) in patients with type II DM was significant low compared to the healthy group. There was a significant negative correlation between the FBG level and TSH hormone (0. 038) while no correlation observed between FBG level and the T 3 and T 4. This study concluded that patients with blood glucose disturbances should examine pancreatic autoantibodies to differentiate the type of DM in order to choose the appropriate treatment. Further more, it is important to investigate the thyroid hormones and TSH annually to determine the clinicaland subclinical dysfunctions for the possible early treatment and control of endocrine disorder...|$|E

After culture initiation BBTV was indexed by double antibody sandwich (DAS) enzyme linked immuno <b>sorbant</b> assay (ELISA) and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and 97. 4 percent cultures were found BBTV free. During in vitro multiplication, BAP affected the shoot multiplication significantly and maximum shoot number (5. 44 /explant) was achieved on liquid medium having 4. 0 mg/l BAP 1. 0 mg/l IAA. When kinetin was used instead of BAP keeping all other parameters same, the maximum shoot number was 4. 33 /explant. Above optimal concentrations of cytokinins lowered the multiplication rate and callus like swelling was observed {{at the base of}} shoot tips. It was also observed from the results that auxins (IAA) did not affect shoot multiplication but increased shoot length up to 5. 5 cm against 1. 4 cm in control. During in vitro multiplication it was observed that multiplication behavior of each shoot tip was different on the same medium and under similar culture conditions. Multiplication rate declined after 3 rd sub-culturing however shoot tips which initially had higher rate of multiplication continued this behavior in succeeding sub-culturings. During in vitro rooting of banana shoots, use of IAA and IBA (1 mg/l) resulted in an increase in the root number and length to 8. 6 and 6. 8 cm respectively. During hardening of in vitro raised plants, maximum plants survived(88. 7 percent) in green house when covered with polythene. When tissue culture raised plants were compared with conventionally propagated plants in the field, it was observed that tissue culture plants were taller than suckers (8. 1 percent), produced more suckers (31 percent), time to flowering was reduced (2. 8 percent) and produced more fingers/bunch (9 percent). For callus induction and regeneration different explant sources were used but callus and regeneration was observed from male flowers. During plant transformation studies, shoot tips were injured either by biolistic gene gun or bisected longitudinally into two halves. Transgenic banana plants having marker gene were achieved when bisected shoot tips were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105 containing pCAMBIA 1301. Transgenic banana plants were selected on MS. Medium containing 50 mg/l hygromycin.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the influence of negative energy balance in dairy cows post partum on the LH release after a single GnRH application. Also the development of body condition, body weight and milk concentration of betahydroxybutyrate, Acetoacetat and phosphoenol pyruvate was analyzed to evaluate a possible correlation with energy balance. For 30 Holstein-Friesian cows daily dry matter intake, milk yield and weekly body weight was monitored. Based on this data, the negative energy balance per day was calculated for each cow as the difference between energy needed for maintanence plus lactation and energy consumed. The cows were divided in four different groups. Group 1 (n = 7) : Cows treated with 500 µg GnRH (Fertagyl®) intramuscularly when the most negative point of energy balance (nadir) was reached. Group 2 (n = 6) : Cows treated with the same dose of GnRH when about 30 % of the individual value of nadir was already compensated. Group 3 (n = 10) : Cows treated with the same dose of GnRH when about 60 % of the individual value of nadir was compensated. Controls (n = 7) : Cows received a placebo (0, 9 % NaCl solution) on different stages of negative energy balance. All cows were either in interestrus or in anestrus, as determined by plasma estradiol- 17 ? levels at the time of treatment. All animals did not experience any postpartum disorders. Blood samples were collected every 20 minutes beginning one hour before and ending four hours after treatment. LH was determined using enzyme linked immuno <b>sorbant</b> assay (ELISA). Body condition and body weight was evaluated weekly. Ultrasonic measurements of the backfat thickness were made over the area between the hook- and the pin bone. Weekly milk samples were taken and analyzed for betahydroxybutyrate, Acetoacetate and phosphoenol pyruvate. The LH release of group 1 cows was significantly higher than in every other group. Group 2 and 3 cows were showing no difference. In group 4 no changes in LH concentration could be detected before and after placebo administration. None of the metabolic parameters tested was significantly correlated with energy balance. In this study no statement was made about the biological quality of the released LH. We conclude, that the sensitivity of the pituitary gland for GnRH is not directly affected by the level of energy balance post partum. It is possible, that the interval from calving to nadir (i. e. the slope of the negative energy balance curve) has a higher influence of the sensitivity of the pituitary gland than the absolute level of negative energy balance...|$|E
40|$|The Salton Sea in California {{was formed}} between 1905 - 1907 by an {{accident}} that diverted Colorado River water to the Salton Sea Basin of the Colorado desert. Since 1924 the Salton Sea serves as an agricultural drainage reservoir maintained by agricultural and municipal wastewater inputs from the Coachella and Imperial Valleys in California and the Mexicali Valley in Mexico. Today, the Salton Sea is California's largest lake by area (975 km 2) and constitutes a vital habitat {{for more than a}} million birds belonging to more than 400 species, including migratory and endangered populations. The Salton Sea, however, has been called an “ecological time bomb” given the threat that the convergence of selenium accumulation, chemical pollution, water diversion and climate change poses to this unique environment. Selenium (Se) is considered an “essential toxin” due to its role as both an essential nutrient and an environmental contaminant. Selenium contamination is a concern in important areas of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Egypt and Israel where mining, agriculture and the extraction and refinement of fossil fuels and metals lead to selenium release from seleniferous parent rock material and selenium bioaccumulation in wildlife. In aquatic ecosystems, selenium bioaccumulation is preceded by the accumulation of selenium in sediment which is driven by sorption and microbial activity, more specifically, the assimilatory and dissimilatory reduction of water-soluble selenium oxyanions. For the Salton Sea it remains unclear whether the sorptive and reductive capacity of sediments will suffice to prevent dissolved selenium concentrations in water from increasing in the future. In order to characterize the transfer of selenium from water to underlying sediments in the Salton Sea, in this dissertation I describe the spatial variability in sediment parameters controlling selenate reduction rates across seven geographical locations and four depth intervals. I identify organic carbon content in sediment as an important driver of selenium accumulation in Salton Sea littoral sediment due to its dual nature as a <b>sorbant</b> for selenium oxyanions and as a source of reducing power for sediment microbial communities capable of selenate reduction. In the the first chapter, I quantify organic carbon content, selenate reducer abundance, selenium content and potential selenate reduction rates using sediment slurries in sediment collected from seven Salton Sea littoral locations. I show a broad diversity of sediment characteristics and the effect of sediment organic carbon content on selenate reduction potential. In the second chapter, I show a range of Km and Rmax values for selenate and selenate reduction, respectively, comparable to that obtained in sediment collected from eleven geographical locations in the states of California and Nevada. Km values for selenate in evaluated sediment are well above ambient selenate concentrations and therefore microbial communities capable of selenate reduction operate well below their selenate reduction potential. I also show unexpectedly high selenate sorption which, under present conditions, contributes more than microbial activity to selenium retention in sediment. In the third chapter, I use sediment slurries and a microbial consortium recovered from Salton Sea littoral sediment to suggest that nitrate reducers {{play an important role in}} selenium accumulation in the Salton Sea. I discuss this data in the context of our current knowledge regarding the microbial pathways of selenate reduction and the thermodynamic constraints associated with selenate respiration and microbial biomass synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-range}} {{objective of}} this study was to develop chemically assisted technologies for removing heels from tanks. In FY 01, the first two steps toward this objective were taken: (1) catalogue the occurrence and nature of tank heels and assess which materials are available for study and (2) develop methods for synthesizing non-radioactive surrogate heel materials for use in testing potential removal technologies. The chief finding of Task 1 was the existence of ''heels'', depending on the definition used. Hard materials that would be almost impossible to remove by sluicing are all but absent from the records of both Savannah River and Hanford. Historical usage suggests that the term ''heel'' may also apply to chunky, granular, or semi-solid pasty accumulations. These materials are documented and may also be difficult to remove by conventional sluicing technologies. Such heels may be comprised of normal sludge components, dominantly iron and aluminum hydroxides, or they may result from added materials which were not part of the normal fuel reprocessing operations: Portland cement, diatomaceous earth, sand and soil and spent zeolite ion exchange ''resins''. The occurrence and chemistry of the most notable ''heel'', that of the zeolite mass in Tank 19 F at Savannah River, is reviewed in some detail. Secondly, no clear correlation was found between high tank temperatures and difficulties encountered in removing materials from a tank at a later date; nor did the sludges from these tanks give any indication of being particularly solid. Experimental studies to develop synthetic heel materials were caned out using a number of different approaches. For normal sludge materials settling, even when assisted by a centrifuge, it proved ineffective. The same result was obtained from drying sludge samples. Even exposing sludges to a molten salt melt at 233 C, only produced a fine powder, rather than a resilient ceramic which resisted disaggregation. A cohesive material, however, was produced by wicking the pore fluid out of a sludge gel (into packed diatomaceous earth), while simultaneously applying pressure to compact the sludge as it dehydrated. Osmotic gradients could provide the same function as the capillary forces provided by the diatomaceous earth <b>sorbant</b> placed in contact with the sludge. Tests on the anomalous materials added to the tanks all indicated potential problems. Hard granules, and maybe chunks, may be encountered where Portland cement was added to a tank. Sand, spent zeolite resin, and diatomaceous earth, will all react with the tank fluids to produce a sodalite/cancrinite material. The degree of reaction determines whether the grains become cemented together. SRS activities showed that heels formed when spent zeolites were added to tanks can be readily dislodged and it is expected that heels from sand would possess equal or less cohesion. Diatomaceous earth may form more resilient crusts or masses. To summarize, the existence of ''hard'' heels has yet to be documented. A broader definition suggests inclusion of poorly cohesive cancrinite-cemented masses and dense past-like accumulations of abnormally compacted ''normal'' sludges. Chemical treatments to remove these materials must focus on agents that are active against aluminosilicates and hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Exploiting the high pore-water content of these materials may provide a second avenue for dislodging such accumulations. Techniques were developed to produce synthetic sludges on which various removal technologies could be tried...|$|E
