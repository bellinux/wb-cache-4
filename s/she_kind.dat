I think as far as artists reinventing themselves, she did it before anybody else. <b>She</b> <b>kind</b> of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

[...] "She {{walked into the room}} where I was recording it and heard a few words and said, ‘What’s going on?’ The whole room just started laughing and <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of smiled and walked backwards out of the room. She didn’t know what it was about and she didn’t want to listen to it, but later on she heard the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Her verse in Kanye West's [...] "Monster" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics {{said she had}} the best verse in the song. Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [...] vocal delivery. <b>She</b> <b>kind</b> of {{reminds me of a}} female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions." ...|$|E

500|$|Coulter {{has said}} that she grew up {{listening}} to artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, citing the latter as an influence. She has also named Michael Jackson and Beyoncé as influences, she told Cosmopolitan magazine, [...] " [...] so driven, she pushes herself to the limits and she's achieved so much but she's always looking for what that next thing is and how she can improve from what she's done in the past. She's really setting the benchmark for female artists and I think <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of is the Michael Jackson of this generation". Critics have compared Coulter's songs [...] "Do It Like That" [...] (2012) and its accompanying music video, as well as [...] "Giddyup" [...] (2014) to Beyoncé's work. Coulter has expressed admiration for other female artists such as Madonna, Pink, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.|$|E
500|$|On the friendship, Metcalfe {{said that}} the [...] "{{characters}} are like chalk and cheese, which I think works well", while Hassan said the characters [...] "have this kind of prickly friendship". She added that they have [...] "a {{lot of things in}} common, but they’re very different people. It’s almost like they shouldn’t be friends, but opposites attract. Lynsey sees qualities in Mercy that <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of wishes she had herself. Mercy’s very straight-talking, she’s quite ballsy and calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto. So I think that’s what attracts her to Mercy". Both Metcalfe and Hassan praised the friendship between Mercedes and Lynsey, with Metcalfe saying she [...] "loved" [...] the friendship and enjoyed seeing her persona [...] "form a good bond with Lynsey" [...] while Hassan praised the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe.|$|E
500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So I got to be wild and crazy, and at the same time I got to be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rashida Jones {{said she}} liked the new storylines that had {{developed}} for Ann Perkins' character, preferring that she remain single than simply get back together with Chris: [...] "It was pretty embarrassing what Ann went through, so I think <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of has to recover from that before anything else. And {{this is a good}} time for Ann to be single too, because she hasn't been single ever on the show. I think she needs to do that a little bit." [...] Shortly after [...] "Camping" [...] first aired, a fake website for the bed and breakfast business The Quiet Corn was put up on the official NBC website, advertising the fictional establishment's features, room amenities and meal services. During one scene in [...] "Camping", Tom refers to one of the gadgets in his tent as DJ Roomba, an iPod music player attached to an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. The gadget, built by Tom, was previously featured in the second season episode [...] "Sweetums".|$|E
500|$|Nava praised Beyoncé's {{acting in}} the commercial, stating: [...] "She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her {{dangerous}} high-heels, <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of sets her world on fire." [...] In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyoncé described the sexual tone of the video stating: [...] "'It's called Heat, so we wanted the ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just {{getting out of the}} tub or the shower and I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [...] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural." [...] "Fever" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of [...] "Fever" [...] on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded [...] "Fever" [...] again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E
500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] <b>She</b> <b>kind</b> of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 22, 2010, Michael Ausiello {{revealed}} that Cat Grant, a gossip {{columnist for the}} Daily Planet in the comic books, would be appearing as Clark's new partner during season ten. Ausiello stated that Grant would act more as a [...] "comedic foil" [...] for Clark, and {{is not intended to}} interrupt the relationship he has with Lois. Instead, Grant will act as Lois's professional rival, and is considered by the producers to be her opposite. Keri Lynn Pratt, who portrays Grant, stated that her character will have a crush on Clark, which will annoy Lois more than threaten her. Pratt described her characters motivations: [...] "Cat really believes in what she's working on and her message. She just really wants to get that through and have everyone on the same page as her. <b>She</b> <b>kind</b> of loses track of the big picture".|$|E
2500|$|The Coens' {{script was}} mostly {{faithful}} to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, [...] "One of us types into the computer while the other holds {{the spine of the}} book open flat." [...] Still, they pruned where necessary. A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed. Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, [...] "the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. <b>She</b> <b>kind</b> of falls apart. In the film she's been through so much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it." [...] In the book, there is also some attention paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts.|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 2016, emails were {{obtained}} that revealed Powell's private communications regarding both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

In another email discussing Clinton's controversy, Powell noted {{that she should have}} told everyone what she did [...] "two years ago", and said that she has not [...] "been covering herself with glory." [...] Writing on the 2012 Benghazi attack controversy surrounding Clinton, Powell said to then U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, [...] "Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt."

2500|$|James P. Allen commented [...] "Sometimes you weren't {{sure whether}} Omm Sety wasn't pulling your leg. Not {{that she was}} a phoney in what she said or {{believed}} – she was absolutely not a con artist – but she knew that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it...She believed enough to make it spooky, and it made you doubt your own sense of reality sometimes." [...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as I go through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I think once her cover was blown with the Connors, <b>she</b> <b>kind</b> of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
