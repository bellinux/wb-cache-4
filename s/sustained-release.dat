5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The <b>sustained-release</b> preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

In this clinical study, the pharmacokinetics of this SRP tablet were investigated in human volunteers (phase 1; 12 volunteers), and its curative efficacy was examined in clonorchiasis patients (phase 2; 20 volunteers). In the phase 1 clinical study, blood concentrations of both tablets showed wide individual variation. The AUClast of SRP was 497. 9 ± 519. 0 ng · hr/ml (mean ± SD) and PZQ of 628. 6 ± 695. 5 ng · hr/ml, and the AUCinf of SRP was 776. 0 ± 538. 5 ng · hr/ml and of PZQ 658. 6 ± 709. 9 ng · hr/ml. Cmax values of SRP and PZQ were 90. 7 ± 82. 2 ng/ml and 214. 9 ± 251. 9 ng/ml, and Tmax values were 3. 42 ± 1. 43 hr and 1. 96 ± 1. 23 hr, respectively.

30|$|According to the {{molecular}} structure analysis, the anticancer activity of cis-DIDP {{was better than}} that of cisplatin. However, there was little research on the clinical application of cis-DIDP for its unstability, which defect is overcome by incorporating cis-DIDP into the carriers. Meanwhile, the common toxicity and cross-resistance of platinum-based anticancer drugs have also been inhibited. In this work, the controlled-release systems of cis-DIDP from the electrospun carriers were tested, in which cis-DIDP was finely incorporated into the PCL nanofibers. It is obviously effective that cis-DIDP <b>sustained-releases</b> from the nanofibers inhibit human lung tumor cells in vitro. The results show that cis-DIDP@PCL are ideal controlled-release drug carrier, and the vehicle may be applied in clinic. It is instructive to improve other inorganic anticancer drug anticancer chemotherapy with the same method. The total evaluation of the system in vivo would be confirmed after more perfect evaluation in vitro, and the results would be further verified by animal experiments.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using complexes with cyclodextrins (CDs) in nicardipine (NC) controlled delivery has been examined, {{with a view}} to extending the pharmaceutical applications spectrum of these carriers. For a fast release fraction, a hydrophilic [beta]-cyclodextrin derivative (hydroxypropyl-[beta]-cyclodextrin) was employed to form a water-soluble complex. For the <b>sustained-releasing</b> portion, triacetyl-[beta]-cyclodextrin (TA[beta]CD) was used to provide complexes with appropriate hydrophobicity. An optimal formulation was designed by the combination of each fraction in different mixing ratios. The release behaviour of the complexes, as well as of their mixtures, was examined in simulated gastric (pH 1. 2) and intestinal (pH 6. 8) fluids. The formulations released the drug rapidly at the initial stage, followed by a slow release. The drug release rate was markedly retarded in the increasing order of the amount of NC/TA[beta]CD complex. When NC was administered to rabbits, its absorption was very rapid with a short elimination half-life, while a prolonged maintenance of the plasma levels was obtained for the two selected formulations. The drug bioavailability was considerably improved especially after the administration of the mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic complexes, when compared with the NC/TA[beta]CD complex. The results suggested that the critical combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic CDs complexes, in appropriate ratios, could be a promising drug delivery system with a prolonged therapeutic effect coupled with a more balanced bioavailability.

Methods: Data were derived from a survey of pharmacists dispensing antiasthmatic drugs to adults with asthma who visited participating pharmacies from October through November 2002. The patients were limited to regular users of ICS whose medication had not been changed for at least 6 months before the survey. Drug compliance and the daily administration frequency of antiasthmatic agents were evaluated on the basis of pharmaceutical records. Results: Completed data were received for 322 patients. ICS compliance was lower than compliance with oral <b>sustained-released</b> theophylline (OSRT) and compliance with LTRA.

40|$|The {{concern about}} weight gain that usually accompanies smoking {{cessation}} {{is a substantial}} impediment to quitting for many women. Given that <b>sustained-released</b> (SR) bupropion is associated with decreased post-cessation weight gain (Jorenby et al., 1999), this pharmacological agent may be particularly effective in improving quit rates among weight-concerned women. Despite the increasing utilization of smoking cessation medications, such as bupropion, relatively {{little is known about}} adherence to these regimens. This study examined the rates, predictors, and sequalae of medication adherence among weight-concerned women participating in a 90 -day smoking cessation program. In addition to receiving group behavior therapy, participants were randomized to receive either SR bupropion or placebo. Medication adherence was measured over time with electronic pill cap monitors, smoking cessation was measured by self-report and verified with carbon monoxide readings, and several psychosocial variables were assessed with self-report questionnaires. With 112 participants (91 % Caucasian; mean age = 43, SD = 10 years), descriptive statistics were computed to summarize medication adherence, and linear and logistic regression analyses were used to predict medication adherence and prolonged smoking abstinence through the end of treatment, respectively. Overall medication adherence was less than optimal throughout the 90 -day study period and adherence rates decreased during each successive 30 -day period. Depending on the type of summary index, results indicated that medication adherence ranged from 26 % to 73 % over the 90 -day period. Conscientiousness, openness to experience, social support and medication outcome expectancies measured at Week 6 were positively associated with 90 -day medication adherence. Independent of medication status, medication adherence predicted increased likelihood of maintaining prolonged smoking abstinence. Follow-up cross-lagged panel design analyses indicated that medication adherence significantly predicted subsequent point-prevalence abstinence. Moreover, openness to experience and Week 6 social support predicted increased likelihood of maintaining prolonged smoking abstinence, and post-hoc analyses indicated that medication adherence mediated the associations between openness to experience and prolonged abstinence, and between Week 6 social support and prolonged abstinence. These results suggest that interventions designed either to modify psychosocial variables associated with medication adherence or to match treatments with individual differences may enhance adherence and possibly improve smoking cessation rates among weight-concerned women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background l -Dopa {{has been}} used for Parkinson's disease {{management}} for a long time. However, its wide variety in the rate and the extent of absorption remained challenge in designing suitable therapeutic regime. We report here a design of using d -phenylglycine to guard l -dopa for better absorption in the intestine via intestinal peptide transporter I (PepT 1). Methods d -Phenylglycine was chemically attached on l -dopa to form d -phenylglycine- l -dopa as a dipeptide prodrug of l -dopa. The cross-membrane transport of this dipeptide and l -dopa via PepT 1 was compared in brush-boarder membrane vesicle (BBMV) prepared from rat intestine. The intestinal absorption was compared by in situ jejunal perfusion in rats. The pharmacokinetics after i. v. and p. o. administration of both compounds were also compared in Wistar rats. The striatal dopamine released after i. v. administration of d -phenylglycine- l -dopa was collected by brain microdialysis and monitored by HPLC. Anti-Parkinsonism effect was determined by counting the rotation of 6 -OHDA-treated unilateral striatal lesioned rats elicited rotation with (+) -methamphetamine (MA). Results The BBMV uptake of d -phenylglycine- l -dopa was inhibited by Gly-Pro, Gly-Phe and cephradine, the typical PepT 1 substrates, but not by amino acids Phe or l -dopa. The cross-membrane permeability (Pm*) determined in rat jejunal perfusion of d -phenylglycine- l -dopa was higher than that of l -dopa (2. 58 ± 0. 14 vs. 0. 94 ± 0. 10). The oral bioavailability of d -phenylglycine- l -dopa was 31. 7 times higher than that of l- dopa in rats. A sustained releasing profile of striatal dopamine was demonstrated after i. v. injection of d -phenylglycine- l -dopa (50 mg/kg), indicated that d -phenylglycine- l -dopa might be a prodrug of dopamine. d -Phenylglycine- l -dopa was more efficient than l- dopa in lowering the rotation of unilateral striatal lesioned rats (19. 1 ± 1. 7 % vs. 9. 9 ± 1. 4 %). Conclusion The BBMV uptake studies indicated that d -phenylglycine facilitated the transport of l -dopa through the intestinal PepT 1 transporter. The higher jejunal permeability and the improved systemic bioavailability of d- phenylglycine- l -dopa in comparison to that of l -dopa suggested that d- phenylglycine is an effective delivery tool for improving the oral absorption of drugs like l -dopa with unsatisfactory pharmacokinetics. The gradual release of dopamine in brain striatum rendered this dipeptide as a potential dopamine <b>sustained-releasing</b> prodrug. </p...|$|R

Methods: Chitosan was selected as the biological membrane carrier to prepare <b>sustained-released</b> membranes. Twelve micrograms of 5 -FU or MMC was covalently conjugated onto the membranes by solvent volatilization. Rabbits underwent glaucoma filtration surgery and were randomly allocated into one of the four treatment regimens: glaucoma filtration operation with no implantation of chitosan membrane group (as control), drug-free chitosan membrane implantation group (blank/placebo group), membrane containing 5 -FU treatment group (5 -FU group), and membrane containing MMC treatment group (MMC group). Each group consisted of 12 rabbits. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured and evaluated over a 28 -day period follow-up preoperatively, then after surgery on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 by Tono-Pen. The aqueous humor was analyzed in each experimental and control groups at days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20 after operation. Bleb survival and anterior segment were examined with a slit lamp microscope and photographed simultaneously. Two rabbits from each group were killed on day 28 and eight eye samples obtained for histopathological study. Corneas and lenses were examined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both 5 -FU and MMC significantly prolonged bleb survival compared with control groups. The filtering bleb’s survival period was significantly more prolonged in the MMC and 5 -FU groups (maintained 14 days) than the other two groups (maintained 7 days). Significantly lower IOP was observed within the control, blank, and 5 -FU groups after surgery on day 14 compared with that before operation, with F-values of 6. 567, 11. 426, and 13. 467, respectively (P < 0. 01). The most significant lower IOP was recorded in the MMC group on day 28 postoperation (F-value 26. 866, P < 0. 01). No obvious abnormalities were found in cornea or anterior lens capsule 28 days after surgery. Conclusion: The study provided evidence that 5 -FU and MMC biological delivery membranes could significantly improve the outcome of filtering procedures, the survival of the bleb, and maintenance of lower IOP. MMC membrane is superior to 5 -FU, with regard to the more effective reduction of IOP. The results indicated a safe and effective treatment strategy in glaucoma surgery.

In their study, a CoCr alloy surface {{was used as the}} stent platform and an auxiliary platform for loading l-AA, namely a polymer-free phosphoric acid platform and polymer-based-PLGA platform. The potential ability of vitamin-C (l-AA) to treat as a therapeutic drug over anti-proliferative drugs such as sirolimus for encouraging endothelial cells growth has been demonstrated in the previous study (Kakade and Mani 2013). Despite successful l-AA coating onto CoCr alloy surfaces, results of drug release from two distinct platforms of polymer-free and polymer-based platform were not the same. l-AA was burst released from the polymer-free CoCr alloy surface for 1  h. However, l-AA was <b>sustained-released</b> from PLGA coated CoCr alloy surface for 24  h (Thiruppathi and Mani 2014). Drug-eluting process is confirmed to be an inevitable mechanism for stents today. Making use of nanotechnology, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been regarded as excellent drug-carrier for polymer-free stents for the following properties: first, tunable pore size; second, high specific surface area; third, large pore volume; and finally, their biocompatibility to the tissue (Popat et al. 2011; Vivero-Escoto et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2008). In a study by Wang et al. (2013 b) a novel polymer-free DES stent was constructed making use of magnetic MMSNs and carbon nanotubes. The nano-structured coating on the stent platform has resulted in a new polymer-free stent that exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility, blood compatibility with a satisfactory drug releasing profile. Rapid endothelialization, which is important as the inhibitor of late ST, has been achieved through the coated composite layer on the stent platform. In their previous studies Liu et al. 2012; Rosenholm et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012 employed core–shell MMSNs as the drug-carrier system and were the first to report on the use of MMSNs as a coating layer on cardiovascular stents experimented in vivo. The disappointing result, though, was within low flexibility and mechanical failure of the coating during stent expansion. A promising report was within a study (Alviar et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2009) in which a nanothin-microporous hydroxyapatite surface-coated stainless steel stent was used as a polymer-free DES for releasing sirolimus. The low-dose drug-loaded polymer-free stent has shown satisfying results for 1  year clinical trials. Recently, there has been a report on drug delivery and capability of DES-based crystallized coating. The polysaccharide top coating was applied onto a Rapamycin (RM) crystalline layer. The top coat was a protective layer for the crystalline layer to suppress delamination during the stent crimping and expansion. The crystalline top coating enhanced the quality of the carrier-free stenting system regarding the physical, mechanical, and chemical stability of the stent (Farah 2018). Although all these efforts had advantages to the development of polymer-free stents, designing new coating materials and structures is still needed. Nanotechnology could be a beneficial technology for promising results in this field. The modification of these stents brought both its own advantages and disadvantages the same as all previous stent technologies. They have improved the duration of drug release from the stent although they have failed in mechanical integrity required for stent backbone in most cases (Hsiao et al. 2013). Polymer-free stents also indicated a capability for long-term safety in comparison to traditional coated DES (Farah 2018). There is still no guaranteed success, though, and more research studies need to be developed.|$|R
