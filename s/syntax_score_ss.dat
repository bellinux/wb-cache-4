40|$|BackgroundCurrent {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) recommend the GRACE score for risk stratification with assessment of admission variables. The <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> is a comprehensive angiographic scoring system that is derived entirely from the coronary anatomy and lesion characteristics. We investigated the relationship between severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> (<b>SS)</b> and GRACE Score (GS) in patients with AMI. Patients and MethodsFrom the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or (RICO) survey, 614 consecutive patients hospitalized for an AMI from 1 st march 2011 to 30 august 2012 and who underwent coronary angiography were included. Patients were analyzed into 3 tertiles of risk based on GS. ResultsThe tertiles of risk were defined as low (n= 205) (GS 165). Age and co-morbidities increase gradually with increased GS risk. Also, the number of diseased vessels on coronary angiography increased across the tertiles (p< 0. 001). In-hospital mortality increased from the low to the highest tertile (0. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 11. 8 %, p< 0. 001). Patients at high risk had significantly higher SS values compared with the intermediate and low GS risk (median (IQR) SS: 13 (6 – 20) vs 9 (4 – 15) vs 7 (3 – 12), respectively, p< 0. 001). Moreover, SS was strongly correlated with GS (r=+ 0. 254, p< 0. 001), and remained significant in patients with multivessel disease. By logistic regression analysis, both GS and SS score are significant correlate of hospital mortality (OR(95 %CI) 1. 04 (1. 02 – 1. 05), p< 0. 001 and OR(95 %CI) 1. 11 (1. 07 – 1. 15)). ConclusionAlthough SS and GS don’t share any common items, they are strongly associated for prognostic information. Both scores allow for an accurate personalized assessment of patient risk...|$|E

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) affects {{both men and}} women. Cardiovascular {{biomarkers}} have been suggested to relate to CAD severity, but data on sex-specificity is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association of established biomarkers with the severity of CAD in stable patients undergoing coronary angiography in a sex-specific manner. Methods: We studied stable patients undergoing coronary angiography and measured CAD severity by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and biomarker levels (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), cystatin C (CysC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and von Willebrand factor (VWF)). We tested for sex differences in SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS (TM) and cardiac surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>scores</b> and biomarker levels using multivariable ANCOVA. We investigated the association of biomarker levels with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in a multivariable linear regression with interaction terms for sex. Results: We analysed data on 460 men and 175 women. <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly lower in women (9. 99 points vs. 11. 88 points). Univariably, hsCRP and hsTnI levels {{were significantly associated with}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (both beta 2. 5). In multivariable analysis only hsCRP associated with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (b 1. 9, p = 0. 009). Sex did not modify the association of biomarkers with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Conclusion: CAD severity as quantified by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> is lower in women than men based on coronary angiography.

40|$|Aims: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> {{is a tool}} to {{quantify}} the complexity of coronary artery disease. We investigated {{the relation between the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and the occurrence of a periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) according to the historical definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the recently updated universal definition of MI. Methods and results: The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was calculated in 1, 243 patients enrolled in TWENTE, a randomised trial which assessed second-generation drug-eluting stents. PMI was defined by the WHO definition and the third universal definition of MI. Patients were divided into tertiles of the SYNTAX score: ≤ 7 (n= 430); > 7 and < 15 (n= 390); ≥ 15 (n= 423). PMI according to the WHO definition occurred more frequently in patients in the highest <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile (7. 3 % vs. 3. 1 % vs. 1. 6 %, p< 0. 001) compared to the mid and lowest tertile. Similar findings were seen for universal PMI (9. 9 % vs. 7. 7 % vs. 3. 7 %, p< 0. 01).

Objective: We sought to 1) validate and compare {{the performance of the}} <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and 2 for predicting major cardiovascular events at 4 years in patients who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty and 2) evaluate the long-term outcome according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> 2 -recommended revascularization strategy. Methods: We retrospectively studied 132 patients from a single-centre registry who underwent unprotected left main angioplasty between March 1999 and December 2010. Discrimination and calibration of both models were assessed by ROC curve analysis, calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Total event rate was 26. 5 % at 4 years. The AUC for the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 1 and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 for percutaneous coronary intervention, was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 73) and 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 78), respectively. Despite a good overall adjustment for both models, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 tended to underpredict risk. In the 47 patients (36 %) who should have undergone surgery according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2, event rate was numerically higher (30 % vs. 25 %; p= 0. 54), and for those with a higher difference between the two <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> 2 scores (Percutaneous coronary intervention vs. Coronary artery by-pass graft risk estimation greater than 5. 7 %), event rate was almost double (40 % vs. 22 %; p= 0. 2).

30|$|Because of {{the lack}} of better {{objective}} indicators for evaluating the coronary complexities, previous studies about the correlations between risk factors such as the hypertension and the severity and complexity of coronary arterial lesions (CAL) were few. The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> is a lesion-based angiographic scoring system that was developed to quantify the number, complexity, and location of lesions in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Higher SS are related to more-complex diseases. Therefore, patients undergoing PCI with high SSs are likely to have worse prognosis. The SS is based on anatomical features of CAL and can be used to quantitatively evaluate the complexity of CAL according to anatomical features such as lesion location, severity, bifurcation, and calcification. Although its clinical applications have some limitations such as its inability to determine the characteristics of plaques and coronary flow reserve, a large number of studies have confirmed that the SS has strong clinical practicality when used as a risk assessment tool for coronary revascularization (Farooq et al. 2014; Head et al. 2014; Mohr et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> is a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally {{devised to}} grade the anatomic complexity of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score.</b> Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55.

METHODS: Three hundred one consecutive patients (age: 59. 7 ± 13. 2 years, 85. 5 % men) underwent primary PCI during 2009 - 2012. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found the optimal cutoff for non-IRA <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> to be 2. 5. We divided the patients into two groups according to this cutoff value. RESULTS: By multivariable analysis, non-IRA SS (≥ 2. 5) was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2. 15, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 21 - 3. 79, P  =  0. 008) and all-cause mortality (HR: 3. 49, 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 10. 8, P  =  0. 03). However, the prediction of cardiovascular mortality had only borderline significance (HR: 3. 29, 95 % CI: 0. 90 - 12. 08, P  =  0. 07).

The calculation of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> derived from non-invasive modalities such as coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as a mean to obtain the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> before invasive cardiac catheterization. Likewise, the computation of the non-invasive fractional flow reserve CT (FFRCT) allows for the calculation of the non-invasive functional <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Ultimately, the combination of anatomical and functional evaluations with clinical factors further refines the identification of patients at risk and provides a recommendation for the Heart Team regarding the treatment strategy (i. e., PCI or CABG) based on the predicted 4 -year mortality. The purpose of this review is to describe the integration of a novel non-invasive functional coronary assessment with the angiographic risk score in patients with multivessel CA...|$|R
40|$|Background: In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} reduced global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GLPSS) and the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Methods: We examined 71 patients undergoing both echocardiogram and coronary angiography within 15 days. All patients had normal global and/or regional wall motion on resting echocardiogram. We calculated GLPSS using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. SS was calculated for each group of patients based on the presence and/or the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) : no CAD on angiogram (n = 10, control group), low SS (n = 36, SS < 22) and high SS (n = 25, SS ≥ 22). We hypothesised that GLPSS at rest is inversely correlated with the angiographically derived SS. Results: Age, sex {{and most of the}} risk factors were equally distributed among the groups. There was a significant inverse correlation between GLPSS and SS values (r 2 = 0. 3869, P < 0. 001). This correlation was weaker in the low-SS group (r 2 = 0. 1332, P < 0. 05), whereas it was lost in the high-SS group (r 2 = 0. 0002, P = NS).

40|$|<b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be an independent predictor of future cardiac events including target lesion revascularization. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relation between SS and plaque characteristics and poststent vascular response using optical coherence tomography in coronary artery tree and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in patients with stable angina. A total of 179 lesions among 165 patients, including 100 lesions in LAD, were analyzed. Patients were stratified into tertiles. In pre–percutaneous coronary intervention analysis of whole coronary tree and LAD, lesions of the third tertile had the highest prevalence of lipid-rich plaque. Compared with the first tertile, the third tertile had greater lipid index, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma. In poststent optical coherence tomography, the incidence of stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion was higher in the third tertile compared with the first tertile in coronary tree analysis. In LAD analysis, the prevalence of irregular protrusion was the highest in the third tertile. In conclusion, high SS may reflect higher plaque vulnerability. Stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion were more frequent in patients with higher SS, indicating poor vascular response to stenting. Our results may explain higher cardiac event rate and target lesion revascularization in patients with higher SS...|$|E
40|$|Aims: In {{patients}} with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) treated with PCI, high (H) platelet reactivity (PR) significantly affects one-year outcome. The {{aim of this}} report was to analyse the relationships between HPR, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> and one-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis) according to diabetes mellitus (DM) status in patients included in the GEne Polymorphism, Platelet REactivity, and the Syntax Score (GEPRESS) study. Methods and results: PR was measured using the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay at three time points (before PCI, at hospital discharge and at one month after PCI), with HPR defined as > 50 % PR index in 1, 042 patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for one year after PCI. Patients with DM and an SS ¡Ý 15 had the highest MACE rate between one month and one year, further increased {{by the presence of}} HPR (16. 4 %). On the other hand, among all {{patients with}} an SS < 15, MACE rates remained low (< 3 %), irrespective of DM status and PR. Conclusions: Among NSTE-ACS patients treated with PCI, the combination of DM, an SS < 15 and HPR characterised a cohort with the highest MACE rate from one month to one year. In such high-risk patients, careful clinical monitoring and implementation of secondary prevention measures, including the use of potent P 2 Y 12 inhibitors, are strongly advised...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} our study was to {{investigate}} the utility of the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score in aiding patient selection for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a large contemporary registry of patients undergoing revascularization of left main coronary artery. BackgroundThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> has been developed as a combination of several validated angiographic classifications aiming to grade the coronary lesions with respect to their functional impact, location, and complexity. MethodsBetween March 2002 and December 2008, 819 patients with left main coronary artery disease underwent revascularization in 2 Italian centers. We compared clinical outcomes of PCI versus CABG in patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 and patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34. ResultsThe rates of 2 -year mortality were similar between CABG and PCI in the group of patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 (6. 2 % vs. 8. 1 %, p = 0. 461). Among patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34, those treated with CABG had lower rates of mortality (8. 5 % vs. 32. 7 %, p 34 (hazard ratio: 2. 54, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 to 5. 92, p = 0. 031).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> {{prognostic}} value {{has recently}} been highlighted in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), however its prognostic value in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for multivessel CAD is still unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prognostic value of the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> in patients undergoing CABG for 3 -vessel CAD. METHODS: A cohort of 320 consecutive patients with multivessel (3 -vessel) CAD who were subjected for CABG were included in this study and divided into tertiles according to the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (34). During the 1 -year follow-up, cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke were systematically indexed. The primary end point was the composite criteria death/MI/stroke. RESULTS: The <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> ranged from 11 - 74 with a mean of 31. 2 +/- 12. 6 and a median of 28. 5 [22 - 38]. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the tertiles.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} assess {{relationship}} between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis assessed by <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI. Methods: After accounting for exclusion criteria, a total of 291 patient with STEMI in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed were retrospectively included (216 male, 75 female; mean age 61. 6 + 14. 0 years). Total and differential leukocyte counts and other biochemical markers were measured at admission. Patients were categorized into tertiles {{on the basis of}} SS. Monitoring for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) was performed during the in hospital follow-up period. Results: The SS high group leukocyte (p= 0. 009), neutrophil (p= 0. 008), NLR (p= 0. 048), peak troponin (p< 0. 001), peak CK-MB (p= 0. 001) lactate dehydrogenase (p= 0. 005), aspartate aminotransferase (p= 0. 004) values were significantly higher compared with SSlow and SSmid groups. SS was increased, left ventricular ejection fraction was decrease (p< 0. 001) and left ventricular systolic diameter was increased (p= 0. 007). The in-hospital death rate and MACEs were greater in the high SS group than in the other groups (p< 0. 001 both of). Conclusion: We found that high NLR was significantly and correlated increased with SS. In addition, high SS were significantly associated with increased in-hospital MACE and in-hospital death. Further prospective studies assessing the predictive role of both SS and NLR in conjunction for risk stratification might improve risk prediction in patients with STEMI.

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} an {{angiographic}} score {{was introduced in}} clinical practice to stratified different levels of risk after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents. The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> classified patients in three different risk levels and was included in revascularization guidelines that patients allocated with low SS could be equally treated with either PCI or CABG, whereas those with intermediate or high SS were better off with CABG. However, using original SS each coronary lesion with a diameter stenosis ≥ 50 % in vessels ≥ 1. 5 mm was scored. In ERACI IV registry we used a revascularization strategy during PCI where operators were advised to only treat lesions≥than 70 % in a≥ 2. 0 mm reference vessel; therefore, no intermediate lesions should be treated, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm was discouraged as well. If we recalculated SS using the above-mentioned operators' advices all intermediate lesions were not scored, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm were excluded for the analysis, including bifurcations, trifurcations and chronic total occlusions; after this new scoring, the original SS dropped significantly which is {{in accordance with the}} goal of complete functional revascularization strategy of the ERACI IV study and the low one year adverse events of such study. In conclusion, if we performed an SS scoring, only severe stenosis in vessels with a reference diameter ≥ 2. 0 mm would allow a more rational assessment of coronary anatomy, and the use of a more conservative PCI strategy...|$|E

MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was calculated. The influence of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis. Balancing score analysis was performed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. ResultsA total of 716 patients were enrolled. Mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively).
