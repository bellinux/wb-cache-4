40|$|Generally, waste {{management}} {{in major cities}} in Indonesia are still relying on landfilling that requiring large land and continue to grow along with the increasing volume of waste generation from day to day. Meanwhile the land where the final disposal (landfill) of waste in large cities increasingly limited. This study aims to develop a model of {{waste management}} through waste reduction, ranging from the source. There are several criteria and sub-criteria {{that should be considered}} in developing a model that negative impacts arising can be minimized. Based on the results of previous studies, using Analytical Network Process (ANP), the chosen model for the handling of waste is individual models on a scale of RT/RW. In order to implement this model required an appropriate institutional because it involves community participation as the key to success. By using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) showed that the treatment of urban waste must be oriented on raising awareness of the public to maintain cleanliness and environmental health through the concept of 3 R (reduce, reuse and recycle). To overcome the obstacles faced during the Local Government should need to restructure the organization of waste management by establishing a Public Service Board/BLUD business Waste and Waste ManagementCommissionoftheCity/KPSK.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to present}} further information {{on the effects of}} boars' seminal plasma on sperm motility and female genitals, while paying particular attention to the boars' characteristics. On this occasion the seminal plasma was tested with regard to practical applicability as an additive to boar semen diluents in liquid form. The first series of tests served to analyse the effect of seminal plasma exchange among ejaculates of two boars on the sperm motility in vitro and mating ability in vivo. The effects on sperm motility were examined in a thermostability test. Furthermore, gilts were inseminated with sperm of either a good or a bad <b>service</b> <b>boar</b> with an additive of homologous or heterologous seminal plasma in the diluent. Success of fertility was determined by the number of recovered ova and embryos. In the course of the test, faeces were taken from the gilts to determine the P 4 - progesteronecontent. That was carried out to observe reactions of gilts to the application of seminal plasma from good or bad service boars and of ovulation synchronisation. The objective of the second series of tests was to characterize the effect of a determinate part of seminal plasma in the fluid-preserved semen of boars on sperm motility and fertilisation results, whereby boar specificity was also considered. Ejaculates from five boars were used in the preliminary test for this, having first been treated with diluents containing 0 %, 10 %, 20 % or 40 % seminal plasma. In field trials 196 sows were inseminated with semen, which had been preserved with diluents containing either some 40 % or no seminal plasma. In {{the first part of the}} trial we additionally used seminal plasma from nine sires, which were good service boars in practice. In the second part we used seminal plasma from only one boar, whose seminal plasma in previous experiments had shown a constant stimulating effect on the motility of foreign sperm. We subsequently obtained the following results: Homologous and heterologous seminal plasma can have different effects on the portion of movable sperms. Seminal plasma from ejaculates with a high sperm motility enhanced the motility of foreign sperms and was superior to diluents containing no seminal plasma with regard to the effect on activity of movement by sperm cells. Inseminations of gilts with the sperm of both good and poor service boars, which had been preserved with diluents, which contained 30 % seminal plasma of a good <b>service</b> <b>boar,</b> resulted in high conception rates (70, 1 (31, 3) %or rather 77, 7 (19, 6) %). When seminal plasma from a poor <b>service</b> <b>boar</b> was used as an additive for diluents, only inseminations with such preserved homologous sperms obtained similar high conception rates (82, 9 (29, 2) %). The conception rate of sows, which were inseminated with preserved homologous sperms through the above mentioned mix of seminal plasma and diluent, was only 53, 0 (34, 7) %. Differences have not been proved by statistics (-> = 0, 05). These insemination attempts shared that with P 4 - progesterone-determination in faeces, it is possible to obtain information about the cycle activity of sows and to check the activity of corpus luteum. No connexion was found between the application of seminal plasma from good and poor service boars and the excretion of progesterone through faeces. In laboratory experiments the additive of seminal plasma to diluent showed a positive effect on sperm motility when stored for 72 hours. In these studies no significant differences were found between the various seminal plasma portions in diluent (10 %, 20 %, 40 %). When ejaculates from routine sperm production were used, a generally stimulating effect of seminal plasma additives to diluent (seminal plasma 40 %) on sperm motility could only be shown during a storage period of about 24 hours. Only the seminal plasma of a determinate boar which clearly and constantly stimulated sperm motility had a significantly positive effect after 72 hours. The insemination of adult sows with semen, which had been preserved with diluents containing either some or no seminal plasma achieved good results as regards farrowing rates (experimental ratio 1 : 88, 3 % or rather 85, 7 %; experimental ratio 2 : 90, 5 % or rather 85, 7 %), piglet indices (experimental ratio 1 : 838, 6 or rather 762, 7; experimental ratio 2 : 760, 2 or rather 771, 3) and product of the farrowing rate and the size of the litter (experimental ratio 1 : 856, 5 or rather 797, 0; experimental ratio 2 : 760, 2 or rather 814, 2). There are no significant differences. Tendentiously positive effect of a seminal plasma additive to diluent were only seen in the size of litter (+ 1, 1) in the experimental ratio 2. </ul...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHunting in Poland {{has a long}} {{tradition}} and became more popular after 1990. Each year over 60, 000 wild boar are hunted. Some of them may act as Trichinella carriers thus all carcasses of wild boar are systematically sampled in game-handling establishments as part of the post-mortem examination. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the species of Trichinella and to evaluate the year to year differences in the occurrence of those species in the populations of wild boar in Poland. Samples for the study were provided by the Veterinary Inspection <b>Service.</b> Wild <b>boar</b> carcasses were examined using a digestion method. Only samples recognized as positive for Trichinella in these examinations were sent to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for confirmation of genus identity. Samples from 450 animals were obtained for the study (380 muscle samples and 70 larval isolates preserved in 90 % ethyl alcohol). Tissue samples were digested to isolate larvae. Extracted larval DNA was amplified using a modified multiplex PCR protocol to identify the species of Trichinella. Five larvae from each sample were examined by PCR. The study revealed that Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi are present in wild boar in Poland in a ratio of 3 : 1. Mixed infections with T. spiralis and T. britovi were found in 1 % of the animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic parameters for litter size of Black Slavonian pigs using the repeatability, multiple trait, and random regression models, and to consider the possibility to increase litter size in Black Slavonian pigs by selection. A total of 4733 litter records from the first to the sixth parity from sows that farrowed between January 1998 and December 2010 were included in the analysis. Individual record consisted of the following variables: breeding organisation (eight regions), parity (1 - 6), <b>service</b> <b>boar,</b> and farrowing season (month-year interaction). Estimation of all the covariance components with three different models was based on the residual maximum likelihood method. Estimate of additive genetic variance and heritability for number of piglets born alive with repeatability model was 0. 23 and 0. 10, respectively. Estimates of additive genetic variance with multiple trait and random regression model were in a wider range from 0. 05 to 0. 65 across parities, and heritabilities were estimated in the range between 0. 03 and 0. 26. Estimates of phenotypic and additive genetic correlations were much smoother with random regression model in comparison with multiple trait model. Due to unexpected changes of variances along trajectory obtained with multiple trait and random regression model, the best option for genetic evaluation of litter size for now could be the use of repeatability model. With increasing number of data with proper data structure alternative modelling of litter size of Black Slavonian pig using multiple trait and random regression model could be taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sow {{performance}} {{is a key}} component of the productivity of commercial pig farms. Reproductive failure in the sow is common in pig production. For every 100 sows served, 89 should farrow. In absence of specific diseases such as porcine parvovirus, pseudo-rabies, swine fever, leptospirosis and brucellosis, management failures are the most important causes of loss. A syndrome associated with reproductive inefficiency, and post-service vaginal discharge and high sow mortality in a commercial pig farm is described. Pregnancy failures exceeded 20 % and sow mortality exceeded 12 % for two consecutive years. The abnormal post-service vaginal discharge rate was 1. 7 % during the period of investigation. An investigation involving an analysis of farm records, a review of breeding management practices, clinical examinations, laboratory analysis and examination of urogenital organs was conducted. The main contributing factors found were a sub-optimal gilt breeding management, an inadequate culling policy in combination with a sub-optimal culling rate and the presence of cystitis in more than 1 % of the urogenital organs examined. The high sow mortality rate was related to an aged breeding herd. A control programme was recommended based on management changes involving oestrus detection, movement of gilts post-service, hygiene in the <b>service</b> area, <b>boar</b> exposure post-service and urinary acidification. This programme failed to increase the farrowing rate due to incomplete implementation of the recommendations made. The farrowing rate increased to 86. 5 % subsequent to a farm manager change in January 2005, which resulted in complete implementation of the control programme. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pig {{movements}} play {{a significant}} role in the spread of economically important infectious diseases such as the African swine fever. Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya-Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within-country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0. 2 – 0. 5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border <b>boar</b> <b>service</b> between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.

40|$|Artisan pig {{family farms}} are an {{important}} mean of income, {{in spite of their}} poor performance they represent a small capital fund that can be used when faced with urgent cash flow situations, or to face immediate family feeding needs. <b>Boar</b> <b>service</b> rental in urban and rural areas is still common, this consists of renting boars for breeding in exchange of cash or in species. The objective {{of the present study was}} to carry out a retrospective analysis of the records of 63 boars, in order to characterize the frequency of use, age, preferred breed by the public of the region, and distances walked and traveled by the <b>boars</b> in <b>service</b> in the Chinampa region of Xochimilco, Mexico City. An average of 0. 19 to 0. 27 mountings per day was observed which corresponds to 1. 36 and 1. 92 mountings per week. Boars had short intervals between mountings, one or two days, or else carried out one mounting per year, registering an average of 15. 94 days between breedings. Boars older than twelve months had the highest number of mountings, more than 50, and were used only for one year. Surprisingly, males staying for 3 to 4 years, were not the ones that registered more mating activity since these pigs could not overcome an average of 40 mountings during their 4 years staying at the farm. Distances walked by <b>boars</b> during <b>service,</b> varied from 0. 5 km in the Chinampa region, to 25 km in urban areas. The results obtained in this study indicate that the reproductive efficiency in backyard swine breeding can not be established due to the lack of an appropriate reproductive program. It is necessary to consider hygiene and health measures in all the boars, since the increase in annual number of mountings could also rise the risk of venereal diseases during contact with females from different origin and unknown hygiene habits...|$|R
