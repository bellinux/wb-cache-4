5|$|N: Although films {{produced}} {{inside the}} United <b>States</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> eligible for {{consideration for the}} Best Foreign Language Film Award, those produced in U.S. overseas possessions are. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, was thus able to receive a nomination for What Happened to Santiago (1989). However, this rule was changed in 2011 barring Puerto Rican submissions.|$|E
5|$|Damage totals in the United <b>States</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fully known, {{although}} media {{summaries of}} Nora included {{a loss to}} agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E

5|$|Each {{country has}} {{different}} requirements {{and procedures for}} licensing or registering osteopathic physicians and osteopaths. The only osteopathic practitioners that the U.S. Department of Education recognizes as physicians are graduates of osteopathic medical colleges in the United States. Therefore, osteopaths who have trained outside the United <b>States</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> eligible for medical licensure in the United States. On the other hand, U.S.-trained DOs are currently able to practice in 45 countries with full medical rights and in several others with restricted rights.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental <b>states</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{has given}} Academy Awards to foreign {{language}} films since 1945. The Academy defines {{a foreign language}} film as a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Films that meet these criteria are eligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. They can be nominated for awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film provided {{that they have been}} commercially released in Los Angeles County and comply with the special rules governing those categories. In addition, foreign-language films produced in the United <b>States</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> eligible for Best Foreign Language Film, but are eligible for awards in other categories.|$|E

While Indian reservations typical {{in most of the}} United <b>States</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.|$|E

Most of the cited declarations by American or British politicians are not legal statements but solely political intents.|$|E
25|$|For MIMO systems, pole {{placement}} can {{be performed}} mathematically using a state space representation of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions.
