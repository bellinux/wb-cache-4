5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{the video}} was planned to feature {{the story of}} a delicate-hearted protagonist, played by Yamaguchi, who is put into a glass case while evil and hypocritical events {{happened}} in the world outside the case. After discussions with the band, the plan for the video changed: the protagonist was kept, and instead the video featured a story where the protagonist was hurt by different characters and by society, culminating in a scene where he lost <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> him. The video was recorded like a theatrical play, and incorporated optical illusions created by stage techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{antagonism}} of abjad versus alphabet, {{as it was}} {{formulated by}} Daniels, has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term {{not only for the}} Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonemic or even phonological point of view, rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.|$|E

500|$|Carter {{announces that}} he and Barbara are getting a divorce, causing Peter to suggest he meet other people. Taking him to the local club, Peter {{introduces}} Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde. Going on to demand an African American patron fetch him a drink, Carter is {{accused of being a}} racist by Paula, who leaves him. Continuing to desire Barbara, Carter decides to take a bouquet of roses to his former wife. While there, he discovers that Barbara has begun dating the man she had an affair with during the war (who sings to her in the tune of 'The Miners Mother'). Announcing he has <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> say to Barbara, Carter confesses his love for her, and apologizes. Barbara then allows Carter to earn her trust by letting him move back in, and the two ultimately embrace in a passionate kiss.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its {{lack of respect for}} individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{disliked the}} episode, criticizing it as [...] "sloppy," [...] the science as [...] "repeating itself," [...] and the fringe element [...] as [...] "especially goofy"; he rated the episode 6.0/10. Writing for Mania.com, critic Stephen Lackey thought Anna Torv's {{performance}} [...] "felt forced", but heaped praise on John Noble. Lackey believes Torv and Joshua Jackson have good chemistry, and consequently partly disliked the episode {{because they had}} few scenes together. He also thought {{the case of the}} week was [...] "fairly entertaining," [...] but the storyline was [...] "just...passable", as he wanted the show [...] "to be done with all of the introductions and get more into the mystery of the pattern". He concluded his review, [...] "Hopefully, next week the story will be just a little more concise, Olivia and Peter back working together and maybe at some point Astrid will actually have <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> do". The Los Angeles Times thought the episode was [...] "solid if unexceptional", as he liked Walter but disliked the [...] "vacuum of personality" [...] that is Astrid.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember <b>something</b> <b>important,</b> <b>to</b> really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "No Reaper Left Behind," [...] John {{attempts}} to regain {{some semblance of}} a normal life {{through the use of}} the internet, only to be disappointed. [...] In an effort to find some purpose, he asks Sam to send him to Hell in an attempt to locate Alan Townsend and help Sam get out of his deal. [...] Sam agrees and sends him to Hell with the Nerf gun vessel. John subsequently contacts Sam by cell phone and tells him he's discovered a way for Sam to break the deal, but he's trapped in the third circle of Hell (it is unknown how he got there as the third level is inhabited by the gluttons). Nina goes to Hell to get it and rescue him, but he stays behind, saying he has <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
2500|$|Michelle Remembers chronicles Pazder's {{therapy in}} the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith. In 1973 Pazder first started {{treating}} Smith at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided {{she felt that she}} had <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> tell him, but could not remember what it was. Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover alleged memories of Satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a [...] "Satanic cult" [...] in Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine, {{who gave}} the season a [...] "B", felt Harlem was [...] "a wonderfully {{utilized}} character, both a welcome departure from the well-explored Hell’s Kitchen and a distinct neighborhood unto itself," [...] along with strong performances from Colter (bringing [...] "a needed intensity") and Ali ("compelling and threatening as Cottonmouth"), though felt some of its [...] "talkier moments" [...] and its pacing {{were some of the}} season's weak spots. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen awarded the season a [...] "B-" [...] saying [...] "Luke Cage is a meaningful attempt at developing a new-model black hero. As entertaining drama, it’s trapped in a not-so-Marvelous trapped cage", though he criticized it as [...] "one more piece of Marvel pop that expresses its ballyhooed shared-world premise so poorly, it’s jarring when it even happens," [...] {{as well as some of}} the season's logic, [...] "sluggish pace [...] thinly stretched plot". Reviewing the entire season, Terri Schwartz of IGN awarded it an 8.4 out of 10, saying, [...] "Marvel's Luke Cage doesn't reach the heights of Daredevil and Jessica Jones, and its flawed second half ends up diminishing what was otherwise a fantastic season. But with <b>something</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> say and interesting new characters, Luke Cage is another win for Marvel's Netflix shows." ...|$|E
