40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the actual situations of emergency patients with <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> treated by emergency-medical-service (EMS) personnel. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed population-based ambulance records in Osaka City, Japan, between January 2010 and December 2012, and enrolled emergency patients {{who suffered from}} <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> such as poisoning by drugs or gas, cutting/piercing skin, jumping from heights, hanging, and drowning. The endpoint was the annual incidence per 100, 000 populations in Osaka City of emergency patients who presented with <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> by age and sex. Their outcomes including deaths at the scene and hospital arrival were also evaluated. Results: During the study period, a total of 8, 671 patients with 9, 424 incidents of <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> were documented. The annual incidence of <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> was higher among women than men in the whole population and in the age group = 50 years (49. 0 versus 68. 9, P < 0. 001). The total number of self-inflicted deaths was 1, 564 (16. 6 %), and the overall proportion of self-inflicted deaths was greater among men than women (32. 2 % [1075 / 3340] vs. 7. 5 % [451 / 6027], P < 0. 001). The proportion of self-inflicted hanging was 76. 7 % [1142 / 1489], followed by poisoning by carbon monoxide at 57. 1 % [56 / 98] and jumping to death at 47. 6 % [254 / 534]. Discussion: Using large-scale EMS records, we investigated characteristics and outcomes of emergency patients with <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> treated by EMS personnel. Our findings suggested the gender paradox {{that the proportion of}} self-inflicted deaths was higher among men than women, while the proportion of non-fatal <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> was higher among women than among men, particularly in the group aged <= 49 years. Our findings showing the importance of the prevention for <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> as well as the gender paradox of <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> will provide important epidemiological information to improve psychiatric cares in prehospital emergency settings. Conclusions: In the total population, the annual incidence of <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> responded to by EMS personnel was higher among women than among men. However, the proportion of self-inflicted deaths was greater among men than women, and the most frequent manner among deceased patients was by hanging...|$|R

On March 21, the Kulagas went {{to check on the}} house, where they encountered Moseley, who held them hostage for more than an hour, binding and gagging Matthew and raping his wife. He then took the couple's car and fled. Moseley travelled to Grand Island, where, on March 22, he broke into another house and held a woman and her daughter hostage for two hours before releasing them unharmed. He surrendered to police shortly afterwards, and was charged with escape and kidnapping, to which he pleaded guilty. Moseley was given two additional fifteen-year sentences to run concurrently with his life sentence.|$|E

Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself {{in a way that would}} shock her.

2500|$|When an {{affected}} {{individual has}} fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and {{cognitive and behavioral}} disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made. [...] Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first suspected when <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injury</b> behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, familial dysautonomia, choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: <b>Self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> {{and other}} serious self-destructive {{behaviours}} are common {{and difficult to}} recognize, prevent, and manage. Although they have previously been understood as repeated, failed attempts at suicide, they are better understood as maladaptive coping strategies. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: Women who present repeatedly with <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> need help to control this self-destructive behaviour and substitute more positive coping strategies. Physicians also need help in working with patients who respond to problems in this way. MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM: The program {{is made up of}} two broad sections. The first section involves understanding the problem and its origins in post-traumatic stress disorders. The second section offers a practical approach to helping patients presenting with injuries inflict upon themselves. CONCLUSIONS: A deeper understanding of the etiology and management of repeated <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> will enable physicians to help patients with this difficult problem while minimizing their own anxiety and frustration...|$|R

40|$|In 2005, an {{estimated}} 372, 722 {{persons in the}} United States were treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs) for intentional, nonfatal <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> (1). Nonfatal <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> are most common among {{adolescents and young adults}} (2); few studies have investigated these types of injuries among adults aged> 65 years.

To characterize ED visits for nonfatal <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries</b> among U.

This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2005, adults aged> 65 years made {{an estimated}} 7, 105 visits to EDs (i. e., 19. 3 visits per 100, 000 population) for nonfatal <b>self-inflicted</b> <b>injuries,</b> and ED health-care providers attributed 80. 4 % of these visits to suicidal behavior. In addition, a significantly higher percentage of adults aged> 65 years compared with younger adults were hospitalized after ED visits for suicidal behavior. Comprehensive prevention strategies that combine community outreach, crisis intervention, and clinical management are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality from suicidal behavior among older adults.
