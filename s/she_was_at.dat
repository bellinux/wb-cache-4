5|$|Fonda {{has been}} a {{longtime}} supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit The Vagina Monologues, of which she is an honorary chairperson. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.|$|E

He had met her in 1932, when she was having an affair with Chiron. <b>She</b> <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> that time, married to Alfred Hoffman-Trobeck, a Swiss businessman and heir to a pharmaceutical empire. She had taken care of Caracciola after Charlotte died, and shortly after began an affair with him, unbeknownst to Chiron. They were married in June in Lugano, just before the trip to America.|$|E
5|$|Coloman {{married his}} second wife Eufemia {{in the summer of}} 1112. Born in 1096 or 1097, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> least 25 years younger than Coloman. She was the {{daughter}} of Vladimir Monomakh, who was Prince of Pereyaslavl {{at the time of her}} marriage. After Coloman repudiated her on a charge of adultery, Eufemia fled to Kiev, where she gave birth to a son, Boris, who was never regarded as Coloman's son by his Hungarian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire to express her {{emotions}} when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E

5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012 Radner {{made her}} debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in Götterdämmerung. The {{production}} was {{documented in the}} film Wagner's Dream by Robert Lepage and the 11 February 2012 performance was recorded and broadcast by radio. In March 2012, she participated in Die Frau ohne Schatten at La Scala under Marc Albrecht. In the fall of 2012, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Opera House in London performing in three Wagner operas conducted by Pappano: the Erda in Siegfried and Rheingold during September and October, and the first norn in Götterdämmerung during October and November 2012. She sang in Dvorak's Requiem under Tomas Netopil in Lyon, and in Mahler's Symphony No.3 under Sebastian Weigle in Frankfurt am Main.|$|E
5|$|Kurama {{attended}} the Coronation Fleet Review of King George V in Spithead on 24 June 1911. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Yokosuka in August 1914 and {{was assigned to}} the 1st South Seas Squadron to search for the East Asia Squadron. They departed there on 14 September and reached Truk on 11 October as troops carried by the squadron occupied the Carolines. The squadron was based in Suva, Fiji in November in case the East Asia Squadron decided to double back into the Central Pacific. Kurama was flagship of the 2nd Squadron in 1917 and was transferred to the 5th Squadron the following year. Like her sister, she was disarmed in 1922, stricken in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Most of Rachel's {{songs are}} solos, with some being group tracks {{and a few}} being duets. About one song in every episode is led by Rachel. Depending on the theme, her song choice changes from Broadway to Top 40 to '60s music. In college, she leaned more into Broadway songs, because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> a musical theater college, but did match mostly with {{whatever}} theme the Glee club was doing that week.|$|E
5|$|President and Endymion {{continued}} to England, arriving at Spithead on 28March. President was commissioned into the Royal Navy {{under the name}} HMS President. Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|She put to sea in late December with 103 Marines to {{reinforce}} their detachment at Johnston Island (about 750 nautical miles—860 miles, or 1,390km—west of Hawaii), and evacuated 47 civilians to Hawaii the following month. A convoy assignment took Mahan to Samoa, where she joined Task Force 17 (including the carrier , two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on Jaluit Atoll, Mili Atoll and Makin Atoll (Butaritari) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Mahan {{moved on to}} Canton Island in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty. By early April, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California. The ship then steamed north to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, docking on 18 April 1942.|$|E

5|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Toulon {{when the}} Germans invaded Vichy France and was scuttled there on 27 November 1942 to avoid capture by the Germans. Refloated by the Italians on 1 May 1943, Commandant Teste was {{captured}} by the Germans in September 1943 and sunk again the following year by Allied bombs on 18–19 August 1944. Raised again in February 1945, she was still thought to be repairable and was considered for conversion as an escort or training carrier. The proposals were eventually dropped and the ship {{was used as a}} store ship for U.S.-built equipment until sold for scrap on 15 May 1950.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 {{damage to}} Timothy Bloodworth was {{considered}} slight, {{so it did}} not prevent her from sailing from Antwerp two days later. On 30 December, she left Liverpool for New York and arrived on 13 January 1945. The cargo ship headed south to Hampton Roads and departed for Gibraltar on 7 February. She put in at Gibraltar on 23 February and sailed for Oran. From that port she returned to Hampton Roads on 24 March in convoy GUS 76. Timothy Bloodworth next sailed from New York for Liverpool, Southend, and Antwerp, arriving at the latter port on 30 April. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Antwerp on Victory in Europe Day. Timothy Bloodworths last reported movement was in convoy ATM 168 from Antwerp to Southend on 28/29 May.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios next {{operation}} was a sortie against the British convoy MW 9 bounded from Alexandria to Malta in February. She departed from Taranto on 14 February {{with a pair}} of light cruisers and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. Her mere presence at sea, however, forced the British escort to scuttle the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft. On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began to suffer a severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation was so bad that Caio Duilio had to be placed in reserve and drained of fuel, {{in order to keep the}} escort craft operational. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet.|$|E

5|$|Disobeying {{his orders}} {{to return to}} Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, {{gathered}} the convoy, and escorted them to Britain. It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth £1 million, {{and would have been}} at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort. However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of Trustys officers while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy. The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port. There it was suggested that he wait in Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the height of her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 1944, Duke of York and {{the bulk}} of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship {{operated}} in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on Tirpitz in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship Anson on 25 April 1945. A problem with the ship's electrical circuitry delayed her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it too late for her to take any meaningful part in hostilities against the Japanese.|$|E
