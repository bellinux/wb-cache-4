6000|$|... "I know Peter Sherringham's birthday!" [...] Biddy {{broke out}} innocently, as a pacific diversion. She had passed {{her hand into}} Nick's arm, to signify her {{readiness}} to go with him, while <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> remoter reaches of the garden {{as if it had}} occurred to her that to direct their steps in some such sense might after all be the shorter way to get at Peter.|$|E

60|$|The automobile, {{with its}} brass and varnish {{shining in the}} sunlight, was waiting a little way up the street, and the first person Honora met in the {{vestibule}} of Delmonico's was Lula Chandos. She was, as usual, elaborately dressed, and gave one the impression of being lost, so anxiously was <b>she</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> face of every new arrival.|$|R

60|$|The sun {{was still}} {{slanting}} {{over the tops}} of the houses the next morning when Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew the lock and bolt on the front door. The street was still, save for the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early rounds. The chill air of the morning made her shiver as <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> entry for the newspaper. Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall. Its hands were at quarter past five.|$|E
60|$|Alarmed and irresolute, Cleer {{sat down}} on the rock, and facing landwards for awhile, waved her {{handkerchief}} to and fro to attract, if possible, her father's attention. Then <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> opposite cliffs, beyond the gap or chasm that separated her from the mainland; but she could nowhere see him. He must have forgotten her and gone home to dinner alone, she fancied now, for it was nearly seven o'clock. Nothing remained but to climb down again and follow him. It was getting full late to be out by herself on the island. And tide was coming in, and the surf was getting strong--Atlantic swell from the gale at sea yesterday.|$|E
60|$|Josephine {{looked down}} with the fixed gravity of a Red Indian, immovable, inscrutable. It was not till the scene was ended that {{she lifted her head}} as if {{breaking}} a spell, sent the point of her tongue rapidly over her dried lips, and looked round into the box. Her brown eyes expressed shame, fear, and disgust. A curious grimace went over her face--a grimace only to be expressed by the exclamation Merde! But she was mortally afraid of society, and its fixed institutions. Rapidly <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> eyes of her friends in the box. She rested on the eyes of Lilly, a dark, ugly man.|$|E
60|$|September 15th.--To-day is Flora's birthday. Dear lass! it is {{well that}} she cannot see her boy, as she used to call me, shut up among the ice fields with a crazy captain and a few weeks' provisions. No doubt <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> {{shipping}} list in the Scotsman every morning {{to see if we}} are reported from Shetland. I have to set an example to the men and look cheery and unconcerned; but God knows, my heart is very heavy at times.|$|R

6000|$|Vainly <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> packed {{multitude}} on the dock. What {{had become}} of him? She felt she could pay any price for one more glimpse of him, and she almost hoped that some mortal sickness would strike the lonely captain on the bridge and delay departure. For {{the first time in}} her life she looked at her father with a calculating eye, and as she did she noted with newborn fear the lines of will and determination. It would be terrible to oppose him. And what chance would she have in such a struggle? But why had Steve not spoken? Now it was too late. Why had he not spoken under the hau tree at Waikiki? ...|$|E
60|$|Two taut lassoes {{stretched}} from the pommel of his saddle {{down a little}} into a depression full of brush and cactus and rocks. Then Lucy saw a red horse. He was down in a bad position. She heard his low, choking heaves. Probably he had broken legs or back. She {{could not bear to}} see a horse in pain. She would do what was possible, even to the extent of putting him out of his misery, if nothing else could be done. Yet <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> surroundings closely, and peered into the bushes and behind the rocks before she tried to urge Sage King closer. He refused to go nearer, and Lucy dismounted.|$|E
60|$|The Virgin, {{standing}} behind him, then did what a man's best friend was not privileged to do. Reaching over Daylight's shoulder, {{she picked up}} his hand and read it, {{at the same time}} shielding the faces of the five cards close to his chest. What she saw were three queens and a pair of eights, but nobody guessed what she saw. Every player's eyes were on her face as <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> cards, but no sign did she give. Her features might have been carved from ice, for her expression was precisely the same before, during, and after. Not a muscle quivered; nor was there the slightest dilation of a nostril, nor the slightest increase of light in the eyes. She laid the hand face down again on the table, and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her, having learned nothing.|$|E
60|$|The {{pedestrian}} stood up, apparently with revived determination, {{and looked}} around. The road {{appeared to be}} familiar to her, and <b>she</b> carefully <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> fence as <b>she</b> slowly walked along. Presently there became visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone. She drew her fingers across its face to feel the marks.|$|R

50|$|Seven then recounts to the ship's {{holographic}} Doctor {{the events}} in her mind of how she remembers her violation. It begins with a weapons test where Lt. Paris was using a new energy assault rifle for Voyager defenses on the Entharan planet, when Seven went with Kovin to do some remodulating. At Kovin's workshop, <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> device, but he turns the weapon on her and fires—which incapacitates her. Seven then remembers a female lab assistant, and the extraction of her Borg parts. Then {{she goes on to}} detail her assimilation tubules being removed of nanoprobes, tested the probes on another person in the lab which assimilated him, and other internal components. Afterwards, she can only recall Kovin telling her the weapon overloaded and burned her hand — which Seven now believes to be a lie.|$|R
60|$|While she mused thus, like a ray {{of light}} through the clouds, a sense of consolation, sweet as it was sudden, seemed to pierce the {{darkness}} of her bitter thoughts. She knew not whence it came, nor what it might portend, yet it existed, {{and the source of}} it seemed near to her. <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> faces of the crowd, finding pity in a few, curiosity in more, but in most gross admiration if they were men, or scorn of her misfortune and jealousy of her loveliness if they were women. Not from among these did that consolation flow. She looked up to the sky, half expecting to see there that angel of the Lord into whose keeping the bishop, Cyril, had delivered her. But the skies were empty and brazen as the faces of the Roman crowd; not a cloud could be seen in them, much less an angel.|$|E
60|$|Madeline took up her sister's {{letter with}} a strange {{sensation}} of how easily sight of a crested monogram and scent of delicately perfumed paper could recall the brilliant life she had given up. <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> pages of beautiful handwriting. Helen's letter was in turn gay and brilliant and lazy, {{just as she was}} herself; but Madeline detected more of curiosity in it than of real longing to see the sister and brother in the Far West. Much of what Helen wrote was enthusiastic anticipation of the fun she expected to have with bashful cowboys. Helen seldom wrote letters, and she never read anything, not even popular novels of the day. She was as absolutely ignorant of the West as the Englishman, who, she said, expected to hunt buffalo and fight Indians. Moreover, there was a satiric note in the letter that Madeline did not like, and which roused her spirit. Manifestly, Helen was reveling in the prospect of new sensation.|$|E
60|$|The riot in Hingston's Mill, {{after the}} failure of Dylks to appear {{personally}} and work the promised miracle, left the question of his divinity where it had been. With no evident change in their numbers on either side, the believers assented, the unbelievers denied. The faithful held that the miracle had been wrought and the seamless raiment torn to pieces by the mob; some declared that they had seen the garments, and tried {{to keep them from}} the sacrilege but had been overpowered. The unfaithful laughed at the pretense, and defied the faithful to show any scrap of the cloth having the form of clothing. The pieces remained with the poor woman who had brought the cloth for the miracle; she carried them weeping home, and she and her husband remained like the rest, believing and unbelieving as before; but at every chance <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> dishonored fragments in secret, and pieced them together, trying to follow the lines of imaginary garments in them.|$|E
2500|$|<b>She</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> sea {{waiting for}} a ship to bring good news about her exiled father (who {{actually}} lived comfortably in France, ignoring her terrible fate),in the vain hope that her condition would improve with his return. Charles V (known as [...] "Caesar" [...] in the lyrics) is accused of [...] "preventing a father from helping his daughter" [...] (privar il padre di giovar la figlia) and Francis I is the [...] "great king" [...] (gran re), to whom all hopes for her own liberation were addressed, but they were shattered as the French monarch was finally defeated by his rival, making Isabella even more depressed. Her mother is portrayed as an old and miserable woman unable to control her children; her brothers are [...] "extremely and disgustingly indolent" [...] (in estrema ed orrida fiacchezza) blaming Fortune for depriving them of the kindly nature enjoyed by their ancestors and explaining [...] their uncouth and despotic manners by saying: [...] "by those who,through ignorance, do not understand me , I am, alas, reproached" [...] (da chi non son per ignoranza intesa i' son, lassa, ripresa).|$|R

When Fu was competing near her home turf, <b>she</b> would <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> crowd in hopes of locating her parents. In time, however, they became almost unrecognizable.

60|$|<b>She</b> {{carefully}} <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> strings, and tuned them carefully; {{then placed}} the guitar in the casement-bench, and knelt before it; and in low, sweet, and changefully modulated notes, so barely audible, that Pierre {{bent over to}} catch them; breathed the word mother, mother, mother! There was profound silence for a time; when suddenly, to the lowest and least audible note of all, the magical untouched guitar responded with a quick spark of melody, which in the following hush, long vibrated and subsidingly tingled through the room; while to his augmented wonder, he now espied, quivering along the metallic strings of the guitar, some minute scintillations, seemingly caught from the instrument's {{close proximity to the}} occasionally irradiated window.|$|R
60|$|Phyllis {{looked about}} her with some curiosity. It {{was too early}} for the habitués of the place, {{and most of the}} tables were empty. The scarlet-coated band were smoking cigarettes, and had not yet {{produced}} their instruments. The conductor curled his black moustache and stared hard at the beautiful young English lady, without, however, being able to attract a single glance in return. One or two men also tried to convey to her by smiles and glances the fact that her solitude need continue no longer than she chose. The unattached ladies put their heads together and discussed her with little peals of laughter. To all of these things she remained indifferent. She ordered a supper which she ate mechanically, and wine which she scarcely drank. All the while she was considering. Now that she was here what could she do? Of whom was she to make inquiries? <b>She</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> faces of the newcomers with a certain grave curiosity which puzzled them. She neither invited nor repelled notice. She remained entirely at her ease.|$|E
6000|$|Neither spoke {{till they}} reached the {{appointed}} tryst. The others were not there, and, waiting for them, Pauline sat on a mossy stone, Gilbert leaned against the granite boulder beside her, and both silently surveyed a scene that made the heart glow, the eye kindle with delight as it swept down from that airy height, across valleys dappled with shadow and dark with untrodden forests, up ranges of majestic mountains, through gap after gap, each hazier than the last, far out into that sea of blue which rolls around all the world. Behind them roared the waterfall swollen with autumn rains and hurrying to pour itself into the rocky basin that lay boiling below, there to leave its legacy of shattered trees, then to dash itself into a deeper chasm, soon to be haunted by a tragic legend and go glittering away through forest, field, and intervale to join the river rolling slowly to the sea. Won by the beauty and {{the grandeur of the}} scene, Pauline forgot she was not alone, till turning, she suddenly became aware that while <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> face of nature her companion had been scanning hers. What he saw there she could not tell, but all restraint had vanished from his manner, all reticence from his speech, for with the old ardor in his eye, the old impetuosity in his voice, he said, leaning down as if to read her heart, [...] "This is the moment I have waited for so long. For now you see what I see, that both have made a bitter blunder, and may yet repair it. Those children love each other; let them love, youth mates them, fortune makes them equals, fate brings them together that we may be free. Accept this freedom as I do, and come out into the world with me to lead the life you were born to enjoy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Flack was {{wonderful}} on all occasions in finding what he wanted--which, as we know, {{was what he}} believed the public wanted--and Delia {{was the only one}} of the party with whom he was sometimes a little sharp. He had embraced from the first the idea that she was his enemy, and he alluded to it with almost tiresome frequency, though always in a humorous fearless strain. Even more than by her fashion of hanging over the registers she provoked him by appearing to find their little party not sufficient to itself, by wishing, as he expressed it, to work in new stuff. He might have been easy, however, for he had sufficient chance to observe how it was always the fate of the Dossons to miss their friends. They were continually looking out for reunions and combinations that never came off, hearing that people had been in Paris only after they had gone away, or feeling convinced that they were there but not to be found through their not having registered, or wondering whether they should overtake them if they should go to Dresden, and then making up their minds to start for Dresden only to learn at the eleventh hour, through some accident, that the hunted game had [...] "left for" [...] Biarritz even as the Rosenheims for Brussels. [...] "We know plenty of people if we could only come across them," [...] Delia had more than once observed: <b>she</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> Continent with a wondering baffled gaze and talked of the unsatisfactory way in which friends at home would [...] "write out" [...] that other friends were [...] "somewhere in Europe." [...] She expressed the wish that such correspondents as that might be in a place that was not at all vague. Two or three times people had called at the hotel when they were out and had left cards for them without an address and superscribed with some mocking dash of the pencil--"So sorry to miss you!" [...] or [...] "Off to-morrow!" [...] The girl sat looking at these cards, handling them and turning them over for a quarter of an hour at a time; she produced them days afterwards, brooding upon them afresh as if they were a mystic clue. George Flack generally knew where they were, the people who were [...] "somewhere in Europe." [...] Such knowledge came to him by a kind of intuition, by the voices of the air, by indefinable and unteachable processes. But he held his peace on purpose; he didn't want any outsiders; he thought their little party just right. Mr. Dosson's place in the scheme of Providence was to [...] "go" [...] with Delia while he himself [...] "went" [...] with Francie, and nothing would have induced George Flack to disfigure that equation. The young man was professionally so occupied with other people's affairs that it should doubtless be mentioned to his praise that he still managed to have affairs--or at least an affair--of his own. That affair was Francie Dosson, and he was pleased to perceive how little SHE cared what had become of Mr. and Mrs. Rosenheim and Master Samuel and Miss Cora. He counted all the things she didn't care about--her soft inadvertent eyes helped him to do that; and they footed up so, as he would have said, that they gave him the rich sense of a free field. If she had so few interests there was the greater possibility that a young man of bold conceptions and cheerful manners might become one. She had usually the air of waiting for something, with a pretty listlessness or an amused resignation, while tender shy indefinite little fancies hummed in her brain. Thus she would perhaps recognise in him the reward of patience. George Flack was aware that he exposed his friends to considerable fatigue: he brought them back pale and taciturn from suburban excursions and from wanderings often rather aimless and casual among the boulevards and avenues of the town. He regarded them at such times with complacency however, for these were hours of diminished resistance: he had an idea that he should be able eventually to circumvent Delia if he only could catch her some day sufficiently, that is physically, prostrate. He liked to make them all feel helpless and dependent, and this was not difficult with people who were so modest and artless, so unconscious of the boundless power of wealth. Sentiment, in our young man, was not a scruple nor a source of weakness; but he thought it really touching, the little these good people knew of what they could do with their money. They had in their hands a weapon of infinite range and yet were incapable of firing a shot for themselves. They had a sort of social humility; it appeared never to have occurred to them that, added to their loveliness, their money gave them a value. This used to strike George Flack on certain occasions when he came back to find them in the places where he had dropped them while he rushed off to give a turn to one of his screws. They never played him false, never wearied of waiting; always sat patient and submissive, usually at a cafe to which he had introduced them or in a row of chairs on the boulevard, on the level expanse of the Tuileries or in the Champs Elysees.|$|E
50|$|At the dance, Durant and Lily {{impress the}} investors {{with tales of}} the speed {{traveling}} across country will be with the railroad.

A man on horseback lassos him, and the mob tars and feathers him and runs him out of town. By nightfall, Cullen still hasn't found Harper, but continues searching the camp. As the train bearing the marshals arrives, Cullen finds Harper and chases him down, but loses his gun. Harper {{picks it up and}} points it at Cullen. He insists that he has proof he didn't kill Mary. Cullen, refusing to believe him, runs at him, knocks the gun away, and then strangles him. After Harper dies, Cullen sees the discharge notice sticking out of Harper's pocket. Reading the document, Cullen realizes his mistake. At the dance, he watches from afar as Lily dances with Durant. Lily glimpses Cullen, but he slips out of view as Durant wheels her around. When she comes full circle, Cullen is gone. Down by the tracks, Cullen admits to Elam that he killed the wrong man. With the rising sun, Cullen rides out of town and The Swede, scarred from his tarring, comes across a wanted poster offering a $250 bounty for the capture of Cullen Bohannon.|$|R
50|$|An {{elderly woman}} {{witnesses}} a rape as <b>she</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> street with her high-powered binoculars, but at first, she {{decides not to}} get involved. The victim’s father helps identify a suspect named Ziv Nevo, and Detective Eli Nahum believes he has an easy case. Nevo has been found {{at the crime scene}} with no plausible explanation. He is innocent of the rape, but his real reason for being in the neighborhood is even worse. He is—well, {{it has to do with}} the Mafia. Detective Nahum is experienced, confident and careless, ready to take shortcuts and get the case over with. Under interrogation, Nevo is afraid to explain what he was doing at night in a strange neighborhood. In fact, he thinks he’s been caught for what he was really doing. Once he caves and admits he did it, he finally learns what “it” is. His protestation that he didn’t rape anyone can’t keep him out of prison. Meanwhile, Nahum gets caught carrying on an affair with a woman in the chief’s office. Nahum’s career and his marriage collapse at about the same time he realizes what shoddy police work he has done. The good news? Now he has plenty of time to exonerate Nevo, learn his secret and—perhaps hardest of all—rebuild his own marriage. What begins as a crime thriller becomes the story of a detective’s search for redemption. This book marks the author’s U.S. debut. Let’s hope he gives us many more stories like it.|$|R

Her luck was in as the well known Midlands leader Ronnie Hancock was advertising for that very thing! An immediate audition was arranged, and Susan joined this fine band and sang happily with them for three years. In September 1961 Susan decided to try her luck in London, and during her brief 36-hour visit she won not only a recording contract but also a year's contract as featured singer with the Ray Ellington Quartet. Her biggest break came in September 1962 when she recorded 'Bobby's Girl'; her success brought so many offers that in November 1963 Susan decided to branch out as a solo artist."In early 1963, following the success of [...] "Bobby's Girl", Maughan had further minor UK hits entitled [...] "Hand A Handkerchief To Helen" [...] and [...] "She's New To You".

40|$|Nine-year-old Susan waits patiently in her seat. The teacher {{walks around}} the room giving out the {{subtraction}} worksheets.

Ms. Smith is {{at the front of the}} class signaling the start of the lesson. Susan puts her paper in the folder deciding this is one work sample that will not go home. The thought that Ms. Smith "hates me" crosses her mind while she struggles to concentrate on what her teacher is saying. Evans's study (cited in Simon and Ballanca, 1976) found a consistent stream of survey research, dating from Starch and Elliot's National Education Survey in 1912, that claimed teachers had arbitrary grading procedures. Therefore Susan's teacher, Ms. Smith, could have a strange reason why Susan deserved a D. Where would Ms. Smith learn about grading? The literature gives her little guidance. Ms. Smith's teacher education program probably paid little attention to grading. Her colleagues, principal, and district policies either may suggest that assigning grades to individual papers is a scaled-down version of assigning course grades, like her own high school or college, or may advise against giving grades. It is important that we distinguish our interest in assigning grades to one piece of work from global grades given to students for courses. While they are related, this paper focuses on the task of grading individual work samples...|$|R
