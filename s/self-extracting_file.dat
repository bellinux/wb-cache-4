40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} Terrain Parabolic Equation Model (TPEM) Version 1. 5, its operation, and the format {{required for the}} environmental and system input files. TPEM 1. 5 calculates and plots propagation loss in dB on a height vs. range display. It allows for range-dependent refractivity environments and variable terrain. TPEM 1. 5 is based on methods and source code originally developed by Fred Tappert, from the University of Miami, for propagation over a smooth surface. It is a pure parabolic equation (PE) model based on the split-step Fourier method and is described in Barrios (1994), with a more efficient method described in Barrios (1993). This program was developed at the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center RDT&E Division, Code 543, 49170 Propagation Path, San Diego CA 92152 - 7385. For technical support, call (619) 553 - 1429, DSN 553 - 1429, or FAX (619) 553 - 1417, between the hours of 7 : 15 a. m. and 4 : 45 p. m., Pacific Time, Monday through Thursday, excluding holidays. For support via the Internet, email to barrios@nosc. mil. The program is written entirely in FORTRAN using the Microsoft 32 -bit FORTRAN Powerstation compiler. To facilitate distribution via the Internet, TPEM 1. 5 has been compressed into one <b>self-extracting</b> <b>file,</b> TPEM 15. EXE, which can be directly downloaded from NRaD's Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Division (Code 54) web page, [URL] nosc. mil. System requirements for TPEM 1. 5 are IBM/PC or compatible with an EGA or VGA graphics adapter and at least 4 MB of extended memory in addition to DOS. INSTALLATION Use the following procedure to install the software. 1. Create a directory named TPEM. 2. Copy the font file MSFONTS. FON from the distribution disk to the TPEM directory.

50|$|Additionally, some {{systems for}} distributing files {{do not accept}} {{executable}} files {{in order to prevent}} the transmission of malicious programs. These systems disallow <b>self-extracting</b> archive <b>files</b> unless they are cumbersomely renamed by the sender to, say, somefiles.exx, and later renamed back again by the recipient. This technique is gradually becoming less effective however as an increasing number of security suites and antivirus software packages instead scan file headers for the underlying format rather than relying on a correct file extension. These security systems will not be fooled by an incorrect file extension and are particularly prevalent in the analysis of email attachments.|$|R

The effectiveness of these changes has recently been verified through a comprehensive test program which saw the SPE OGA operate for over 740 hours at various test conditions, including over 690 hours, or approximately 460 cycles, simulating the orbit of the space station. This report documents the changes made to the SPE OGA, presents and discusses the test results from the acceptance test program, and provides recommendations for additional development activities pertinent to evolution of the SPE OGA to a flight configuration.

40|$|We {{find that}} {{intervals}} between successive drops from a leaky faucet display scale-invariant, long-range anticorrelations {{characterized by the}} same exponents of heart beat-to-beat intervals of healthy subjects. This behavior is also confirmed by numerical simulations on lattice and it is faucet-width- and flow-rate-independent. The histogram for the drop intervals is also well described by a Lévy distribution with the same index for both histograms of healthy and diseased subjects. This additional result corroborates the evidence for similarities between leaky faucets and healthy hearts underlying dynamics. Comment: <b>Self-extracting</b> uuencoded postscript <b>file.</b> Phys.

40|$|Computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) {{models are}} used widely in policy analysis. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to contribute to and facilitate the use of CGE models. The paper includes a detailed presentation of a “standard” CGE model (an equation-by-equation description) and its required database. It incorporates features developed in recent years in research projects conducted at IFPRI. These features, which are of particular importance in developing countries, include household consumption of non-marketed (or “home”) commodities, explicit treatment of transaction costs for commodities that enter the market sphere, and a separation between producing activities and commodities that permits any activity to produce multiple commodities and any commodity to be produced by multiple activities. The paper discusses the implementation of the model in GAMS (the General Algebraic Modeling System) and is accompanied by a <b>self-extracting</b> zip <b>file,</b> which includes the GAMS files for the model, sample databases, simulations, solution reports, and a SAM aggregation program. Although the paper provides a standardized framework for analysis, the analyst is not forced to make “one-size-fits-all” assumptions. The GAMS code is written in a manner that gives the analyst considerable flexibility in model specification. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 TM...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of direct perturbation theory a fully self-consistent approximation beyond the well known NCA will be presented for the Anderson Model. The resummation of a class of skeleton diagrams up to infinite order in V includes all contribution up to the order O(1 /N^ 2) (N = degeneracy of the magnetic state). Qualitative improvements in maintaining local Fermi-Liquid relations and one-particle spectral properties {{in comparison to the}} well known NCA will be reported. The location and temperature dependence of the AS-resonance for the case N= 2 is found to be rather close to the chemical potential in excellent agreement with Friedel's sum rule; the static magnetic susceptibility exhibits the same N-dependence as the exact Bethe-Ansatz solution.

40|$|We study {{diffraction}} corrections to the semiclassical {{spectral density}} of dispersing (Sinai) billiards. They modify {{the contributions of}} periodic orbits (PO's), {{with at least one}} segment which is almost tangent to the concave part of the boundary. Given a wavenumber $k$, all the PO's with length up to the Heisenberg length $O(k) $ are required for quantization. We show that most of the contributions of PO's which are longer than a limit $O(k^{ 2 / 3 }) $ must be corrected for diffraction effects. For orbits which just miss tangency, the corrections are of the same magnitude as the semiclassical contributions themselves. Orbits which bounce at extreme forward angles give very small terms in the standard semiclassical theory. The diffraction corrections increase their amplitude substantially.

40|$|We {{review in}} details a {{recently}} proposed technique to extract information about dynamical correlation functions of many-body hamiltonians {{with a few}} Lanczos iterations and without the limitation of finite size. We apply this technique to understand the low energy properties and the dynamical spectral weight of a simple model describing the motion of a single hole in a quantum antiferromagnet: the t-J_z model in two spatial dimension and for a double chain lattice. The simplicity of the model allows us a well controlled numerical solution, especially for the two chain case. Contrary to previous approximations {{we have found that}} the single hole ground state in the infinite system is continuously connected with the Nagaoka fully polarized state for J_z → 0. Analogously we have obtained an accurate determination of the dynamical spectral weight relevant for photoemission experiments. For J_z= 0 an argument is given that the spectral weight vanishes at the Nagaoka energy faster than any power law, as supported also by a clear numerical evidence. It is also shown that spin charge decoupling is an exact property for a single hole in the Bethe lattice but does not apply to the more realistic lattices where the hole can describe closed loop paths.
