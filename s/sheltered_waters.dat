5|$|Poole Harbour and Poole Bay {{are popular}} areas {{for a number}} of {{recreational}} pursuits, including sailing, windsurfing, surfing, kitesurfing and water skiing. The harbour's large areas of <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters</b> attract windsurfers, particularly around the northern and eastern shores. Water skiing takes place in the harbour in a special designated area known as the Wareham Channel. The waters around the harbour, Poole Bay and Studland Bay are also popular for recreational angling and diving.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. The Pilgrims explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims eventually came across the <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters</b> of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to a site in the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz {{continued}} to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters</b> of Altafjord, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, {{it was decided to}} conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} next series of Arctic convoys. In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use Tirpitz offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters,</b> or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{the numbers}} of {{southern}} humpback and southern right whales entering the bay of Port Phillip have shown increases. Unlike in Portland and on Great Ocean Road, Southern Rights in eastern Victorian waters are still critically endangered and in very small numbers; however, presences of cow-calf pairs in the bay in recent years indicate that Port Phillip Bay was possibly once a wintering/calving ground for these whales. They swim very close to shores to take rests in shallow, <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters,</b> sometimes just next to piers in Frankston.|$|E
25|$|The term harbour salvage {{refers to}} the salvage of vessels {{stranded}} or sunk in <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters.</b> Such vessels are not normally {{subject to the same}} deterioration caused by marine and weather conditions as offshore salvage vessels are. In addition, unless the vessel to be salvaged is obstructing navigation, then {{there is no need to}} work as swiftly as in offshore salvage. Also, harbour pre-salvage survey and planning stages tend to be less time consuming and environmentally dependent. It is also easier to gain access to local labour resources and heavy equipment such as floating cranes and barges.|$|E

40|$|Tests {{have been}} made on a large four-engined flying boat (Sole~,t Mk. 3), to {{determine}} the hydrodynamic performance in <b>sheltered</b> <b>water</b> and in open-sea swells. The <b>sheltered</b> <b>water</b> characteristics were investigated over a range of weights between 72, 000 and 84, 000 lb. The performance in swell covered weights up to 82, 000 lb, and swell heights up to 5 feet. The latter tests were made at Gibraltar in February, 1951. The main conclusions of the investigation which may be applied generally to hulls similar to the Solent can be summarised, as follows: (a) D ~ <b>Sheltered</b> <b>Water</b> (i) The hydrodynamic longitudinal stability and spray are acceptable in calm water at a Cs o of 1. 2 (84, 000 lb weight for the Sole~,t). (ii) Short seas up to 4 feet in height have relatively little effect on hydrodynamic performance. (iii) Acceleration through the hump region has a considerable effect on the acceptable amount of porpoising, and the limiting out of wind angle for take-off. For military aircraft, a minimum take-off acceleration of 0. lg is recommended. (b) In Ocea~ ¢ Swel...|$|R

Nevertheless, 250employees at the terminal, one of the largest employers in the region, lost their jobs. There was also significant environmental impact and the local fishing industry was affected.

500|$|The <b>sheltered</b> <b>waters</b> of Blakeney Haven {{had brought}} {{prosperity}} to the internationally important Glaven ports of Cley, Wiveton and Blakeney. Blakeney gained its market charter in 1222, {{and the three}} ports, along with Salthouse, were jointly required to provide three ships for Edward II in 1322, having previously contributed to his father's navy in 1301. By the early 15th century, Blakeney {{was one of the}} few ports permitted to trade in horses, gold and silver, through [...] "merchants sworn by oath to the king", which contributed to the town's growing wealth. In 1640, land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf, and further reclamation east of the Glaven meant that all the Glaven ports declined; Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century, but Blakeney had packet ships until 1840. Similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere, often with the same consequence for the local harbours, as for example at Holkham. Only Wells-next-the-Sea had significant trade into the late 20th century.|$|E
500|$|In May 1545, the French had {{assembled}} a large fleet in the estuary of the Seine {{with the intent}} to land troops on English soil.

In addition to the massive fleet, 50,000 troops were assembled at Havre de Grâce (modern-day Le Havre). An English force of 160 ships and 12,000 troops under Viscount Lisle was ready at Portsmouth by early June, before the French were ready to set sail, and an ineffective pre-emptive strike was made in the middle of the month.
