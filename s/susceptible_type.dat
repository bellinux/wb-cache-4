40|$|Bell-cell (beta-cell) {{impairment}} {{is central}} to the development and progression of human diabetes, {{as a result of the}} combined effects of genetic and acquired factors. Reduced islet number and/or reduced beta cells amount in the pancreas of individuals with Type 2 diabetes have been consistently reported. This is mainly due to increased beta cell death, not adequately compensated for by regeneration. In addition, several quantitative and/or qualitative defects of insulin secretion have been observed in Type 2 diabetes, both in vivo and ex vivo with isolated islets. All this is associated with modifications of islet cell gene and protein expression. With the identification of several <b>susceptible</b> <b>Type</b> 2 diabetes loci, the role of genotype in affecting beta-cell function and survival has been addressed in a few studies and the relationships between genotype and beta-cell phenotype investigated.

This study investigated {{for the first}} time whether colonic intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) produce cytokines or chemokines following T. muris infection and whether divergence of the innate response could explain differentially polarized adaptive immune responses in resistant and susceptible mice. Increased expression of mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor and the chemokine CCL 2 (MCP- 1) were seen after infection of susceptible and resistant strains, with the only difference in expression being a delayed increase in CCL 2 in BALB/c IEC. These increases were ablated in MyD 88 −/− mice, and NF-κB p 65 was phosphorylated in response to T. muris excretory/secretory products in the epithelial cell line CMT- 93, suggesting involvement of the MyD 88 -NF-κB signaling pathway in IEC cytokine expression. These data reveal that IEC respond innately to T. muris.

Cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from BM 4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class A β-lactamase named CAD- 1. The blaCAD- 1 gene {{was assigned to}} a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. CAD- 1 shared 53 % and 42 % identity with β-lactamases from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alignment of CAD- 1 with other class A β-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional amino acids in class A β-lactamases. Escherichia coli harboring blaCAD- 1 exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. Mature CAD- 1 consisted of a 34. 4 -kDa polypeptide. Kinetic analysis indicated that CAD- 1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6, 600, 3, 200, and 2, 900 mM− 1 s− 1, respectively.

40|$|Fluoroquinolone {{resistance}} (FQ-R) {{in clinical}} isolates of Enterobacteriaceae species {{has been reported}} with increasing frequency in recent years. Two mechanisms of FQ-R {{have been identified in}} gram-negative organisms: mutations in DNA gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. A single point mutation in gyrA has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. To determine the extent of gyrA mutations associated with FQ-R in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the QRDRs from 8 Enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens. Although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80. 8 to 93. 3 %, when compared with that of E. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyrA QRDR were highly conserved. Conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the QRDRs of the <b>susceptible</b> <b>type</b> strains of C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca (Ser- 83 to Thr), and P. stuartii (Asp- 87 to Glu). Strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of > 2 μg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the Gly- 81, Ser- 83, or Asp- 87 position. Fluoroquinolone MICs varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyrA mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyrA contribute to resistance. The type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. High-level FQ-R frequently was associated with single gyrA mutations in all species of Enterobacteriaceae in this study except E. coli...|$|E

40|$|Paraquat-resistant hairy {{fleabane}} (Conyza bonariensis L. Cronq.) {{has been extensively}} studied, with some contention. A single, dominant gene pleiotropically controls levels of oxidant-detoxifying enzymes and tolerance to many photooxidants, to photoinhibition, and possibly to other stresses. The weed forms a rosette on humid short days and flowers in dry long days and, thus, needs plasticity to photooxidant stresses. In a series of four experiments over 20 months, the resistant and susceptible biotypes were cultured in constant 10 -h low-light short days at 25 [deg]C. Resistance was measured as recovery from paraquat. The concentration required to achieve 50 % inhibition of the resistant biotype was about 30 {{times that of the}} susceptible one just after germination, increased to > 300 times that of the susceptibles at 10 weeks of growth, and then decreased to 20 -fold, remaining constant except for a brief increase while bolting. Resistance increased when plants were induced to flower by long days. The levels of plastid superoxide dismutase and of glutathione reductase were generally highest in resistant plants compared to those of the susceptibles at the times of highest paraquat resistance, but they were imperceptibly different from the <b>susceptible</b> <b>type</b> at the times of lower paraquat resistance. Photoinhibition tolerance measured as quantum yield of oxygen evolution at ambient temperatures was highest when the relative amounts of enzymes were highest in the resistant biotype. Resistance to photoinhibition was not detected by chlorophyll a fluorescence. Enzyme levels, photoinhibition tolerance, and paraquat resistance all increased during flowering in both biotypes. Imperceptibly small increases in enzyme levels would be needed for 20 -fold resistance, based on the moderate enzyme increases correlated with 300 -fold resistance. Thus, it is feasible that either these enzymes {{play a role in the}} first line of defense against photooxidants, or another, yet unknown mechanism(s) facilitate(s) the lower level of resistance, or the enzymes and unknown mechanisms act together...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis for resistance to organophosphate insecticides in greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), was investigated. Two resistant populations (Type I and Type II) exhibited of two distinct enhanced esterase isozymes. Restriction digests of genomic DNA from <b>susceptible,</b> <b>Type</b> I, and Type II individuals probed with {{a fragment of}} the E 4 esterase gene which confers organophosphate resistance in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), indicated similarity of esterase gene fragments in the two aphid species. ^ Nested-PCR performed on greenbug genomic DNA with a Type I-specific degenerate primer paired with an esterase active site primer and two E 4 -specific internal primers resulted in a single product. Sequencing revealed that the fragment contained a region homologous to exon 2 of the E 4 gene. Southern hybridization of genomic digests with HindIII and EcoRI probed with the Type I PCR product resulted in hybridization signal patterns in Type I digests {{different from those of}} susceptible and Type II digests. The susceptible and type II digests were indistinguishable regardless of the enzyme used. A number of fragments from the Type I strain produced in more intense signals, indicating that an esterase is amplified in Type I. The copy number of the greenbug esterase gene was estimated by digesting serial dilutions of genomic DNA with MspI and probing the blotted digests with the Type I fragment. Results indicated that Type I greenbugs contained four-to eight-fold higher number of copies of the gene than susceptible individuals. ^ In summary, the molecular mechanism of esterase-mediated organophosphate resistance in the Type I strain appears to be due to gene amplification and is analogous the E 4 gene of M. persicae. Although the Type II strain did not exhibit any evidence for gene amplification using the materials available, it is still possible that an esterase is amplified in the Type II genome but was not detected in this study. Evolutionary implications of the similarities between esterase E 4 and the Type I esterase are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} is a multifactorial disease {{in which the}} insulin producing Î²-cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system, a process determined by the activity of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted T lymphocytes. Progress {{has been made in}} elucidating genetic factors involved in Type 1 diabetes in Caucasians, with less data available from Asia. For Asians, the human MHC locus (HLA region), especially the class II region, is the major susceptibility interval. The role of IDDM 2, the insulin locus, has been questioned in Asia. In contrast to Caucasians, Asian populations have a very low incidence of Type 1 diabetes (0. 4 - 1. 1 cases/ year/ 100 000 individuals). This low incidence rate in the Asian population {{may be related to the}} population frequency distribution of <b>susceptible</b> <b>Type</b> 1 diabetes genes, especially of HLA. The overall risk for Type 1 diabetes from HLA DR and DQ is determined by polymorphic residues (alleles) and particular combinations of alleles (haplotypes and genotypes) in a given individual. In Asians, it is very common that a protective DR 4 allele is associated with susceptible DQ alleles while neutral/protective DQ alleles are associated with the susceptible DR 4 alleles. Our analyses indicate that the counterbalancing between susceptible DRB 1 and protective DQB 1, and vice versa, is a factor that may contribute to the low incidence of diabetes in Asians. We find that identical HLA DRB 1 -DQB 1 haplotypes of Asians and Caucasians have similar transmission to diabetic children and similar associations with diabetes. Moreover, the association with diabetes and transmission to a diabetic offspring of DR 4 haplotypes varies depending on the haplotype borne on the homologous chromosome. This might contribute not only to the synergistic effect of DR 3 / 4, but also to the susceptibility influence of DQB 1 * 0401 haplotypes confined to DR 4 /X. High-risk DR 4 subtypes were predominant in DR 4 /X, whereas protective DR 4 subtypes were observed mainly in the DR 3 / 4 genotype. Since in Asians DQB 1 * 0401 is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with DRB 1 * 0405, we find more DRB 1 * 0405 -DQB 1 * 0401 haplotypes in patients with DR 4 /X than in patients with DR 3 / 4, suggesting that the contribution of the DRB 1 locus may be greater in DR 4 /X than in DR 3 / 4 genotypes. Several genome scans suggested additional susceptibility intervals and provided supporting evidence for several previously reported linkages. Other studies focused on the confirmation of linkage using multipoint sib-pair analyses with densely spaced markers and multiethnic collection of families. Although significant and consistent linkage evidence was reported for the susceptibility intervals IDDM 12 (on 2 q 33) even in Asia, evidence for most other intervals varies in different data sets. LD mapping has become an increasingly important tool for both confirmation and fine-mapping of susceptibility intervals, as well as identification of etiological mutations. The examination of large and ethnically varied data sets including those of Asia has allowed identification of haplotypes that differ only at a single codon in a single locus. As more data become available, the study of pairs of haplotypes which differ at a single polymorphic site, but have different effects on disease susceptibility, should allow more precise definition of the polymorphisms involved in the disease process.

40|$|The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) {{can reduce}} the yield of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] cultivars that are {{susceptible}} to the insect. Two genes that confer resistance to some biotypes are Rag 1 (R 1) from PI 548663 and Rag 2 (R 2) from PI 200538. These genes individually can limit the development of soybean aphids and prevent yield loss. The impact of these genes combined is not known. One objective of my research {{was to determine the}} impact of the Rag 1 and Rag 2 genes on the performance of lines for agronomic and seed traits. A second objective of my research was to compare the growth of aphid populations on soybean lines with both resistance genes (R 1 /R 2), Rag 1 alone (R 1 /S 2), Rag 2 alone (S 1 /R 2), and neither resistance gene (S 1 /S 2). The four types of lines were selected from the same backcross population to achieve a similar genetic background for traits other than the aphid resistance genes. In Experiment 1, the lines were grown at three locations in 2010 to evaluate their agronomic and seed traits. In this experiment, the mean seed yields of the S 1 /S 2 lines yielded 17. 4 % more than the R 1 /R 2 lines, 10. 8 % more than the R 1 /S 2 lines, and 8. 8 % more than the S 1 /R 2 lines. Even though the mean yields of the resistant types were significantly less than the <b>susceptible</b> <b>type,</b> high yielding lines of R 1 /R 2, R 1 /S 2, and S 1 /R 2 lines were identified. For Experiment 2, a bulk of lines was made {{for each of the four}} genotypes. The lines were grown at a single location in 2010 to evaluate their agronomic and seed traits. The mean seed yield of the S 1 /S 2 line was 2. 5 % more than the R 1 /R 2 line, 19 % less than the R 1 /S 2 line, and 11. 8 % more than the S 1 /R 2 line. In Experiment 3, a bulk of lines for each genotype was grown in netted cages and artificially infested with soybean aphids to achieve five treatment levels: aphid-free, 675 aphids per plant (AP), 25, 000 cumulative aphid days (CAD), 50, 000 CAD, and 75, 000 CAD. The intrinsic rate of growth of soybean aphids from after the initial infestation until the population reached 675 AP or reached a plateau was significantly different for the S 1 /S 2 line than the R 1 /R 2, R 1 /S 2, or S 1 /R 2 lines. The R 1 /R 2, R 1 /S 2, and S 1 /R 2 lines were not significantly different during this same time. From after the second infestation until the end of the season, the intrinsic rate of growth of soybean aphids on R 1 /R 2, R 1 /S 2, and S 1 /R 2 lines were still not significantly different. The yield reduction of the S 1 /S 2 lines was 2. 1 % at 675 AP, 18. 8 % at 25 K CAD, and 26. 9 % at 50 K CAD. Aphid development on the R 1 /S 2 and S 1 /R 2 lines after two infestations reached a maximum of 25 K CAD at the same time. The yield of the R 1 /S 2 line increased by 5. 8 % at 675 AP and decreased by 2. 3 % at 25 K CAD compared to a decrease of 9. 9 % at 675 AP and a decrease of 11. 8 % at 25 K CAD for the S 1 /R 2 line. The maximum treatment level reached for the R 1 /R 2 line was only 675 AP, at which there was no significant yield reduction. The results indicated that for the biotype used in the study, cultivars with R 1 /R 2 would be expected to have less aphid development and less yield reduction than R 1 /S 2 or S 1 /R 2 lines...|$|E

40|$|It makes {{economic}} sense {{to use as}} little fungicide as possible on a crop. In many settings, {{it is common to}} apply less than the manufacturer's recommended dose. If sources of disease are scarce, or conditions are unsuitable for it to increase, the reduced control from a low dose may be adequate. In other cases, a big reduction in dose may cause little reduction in control, again permitting savings - especially for growers prepared to run a little risk. But the label recommendations for most fungicides state that to avoid resistance, a full dose must always be used. Are individual cost-savings therefore endangering everyone's access to an exceptionally useful tool? The emergence of fungicide resistance is evolution in action. In all cases, it involves the genetic replacement of the original susceptible population of the pathogen by a new population with genetically distinct biochemistry, which confers resistance. The resistant biochemistry originates in rare genetic mutations, so rare that initially the population is hardly altered. Replacement of susceptible forms by resistant ones happens because, with fungicide present, the resistant form multiplies more rapidly than the susceptible form.

This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance...|$|R
40|$|Discontinuous {{initial data}} can {{generate}} spurious {{waves in the}} numerical solution of some systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this paper we study a particular model of a dusty gas {{that appears to be}} especially <b>susceptible</b> to this <b>type</b> of starting error. Using a combination of analysis and numerical computation, we identify the source of the error and propose remedies. The method of analysis should be applicable to other systems...|$|R
50|$|Lithium {{batteries}} {{can provide}} extremely high currents and can discharge very rapidly when short-circuited. Although {{this is useful}} in applications where high currents are required, a too-rapid discharge of a lithium battery can result in overheating of the battery, rupture, and even an explosion. Lithium-thionyl chloride batteries are particularly <b>susceptible</b> to this <b>type</b> of discharge. Consumer batteries usually incorporate overcurrent or thermal protection or vents to prevent an explosion.|$|R
50|$|It is very {{important}} that the fast ions are confined within the plasma long enough for them to deposit their energy. Magnetic fluctuations are a big problem for plasma confinement in this type of device (see plasma stability) by scrambling what were initially well-ordered magnetic fields. If the fast ions are <b>susceptible</b> to this <b>type</b> of behavior they can escape very quickly, however some evidence suggests they are not susceptible.|$|R
