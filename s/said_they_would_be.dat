The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi. On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expanding the roll-out of the service to users.

5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were {{similar to those of the}} Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E

The referendum led to the arrests of Jordi Sànchez, speaker of the Catalan National Assembly and Jordi Cuixart, the leader of pro-independence group Òmnium Cultural.

25|$|Engel did {{not agree}} with the committee's report, which {{contained}} proposals {{for the creation of a}} committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite—in this case, the Executive—and handing it to another—a group of senior Back Benchers'. She also <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done , we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.|$|E

25|$|There are {{international}} {{organizations such as}} IEA Bioenergy, established in 1978 by the OECD International Energy Agency (IEA), {{with the aim of}} improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programs in bioenergy research, development and deployment. The UN International Biofuels Forum is formed by Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, the United States and the European Commission. The world leaders in biofuel development and use are Brazil, the United States, France, Sweden and Germany. Russia also has 22% of world's forest, and is a big biomass (solid biofuels) supplier. In 2010, Russian pulp and paper maker, Vyborgskaya Cellulose, <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> producing pellets {{that can be used in}} heat and electricity generation from its plant in Vyborg by the end of the year.

25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime was the worst thing about living in the city; about a quarter said they or a family member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to pay for private security for their building or block.|$|E
25|$|The final {{battle for}} The Majestic {{took place on}} 25 August in the {{afternoon}} as Jaques Massu and Colonel Paul de Langlande of the 2nd Armored Division (France) moved their troops from the Champs-Élysées to the heavily fortified and barricaded Avenue Kleber. One of Massu's officers worked {{his way around the}} rear of The Majestic on Rue la Perouse, which was protected by a blockhouse that could only be subdued by a bazooka, but the Germans inside the hotel <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to surrender to regular soldiers, rather than men of the Resistance. A German spokesman was brought to Massu under a white flag and with Langland'e approval, Massu went to The Majestic accompanied by Senior Sergeant Dannic. As they approached Dannic was shot dead by a sniper firing from the hotel's rooftop. Despite this, Massu continued up the hotel's steps and entered The Majestic's lobby to find fifty German officers and 300 other ranks. The Germans surrendered to Massu without further resistance, using a bilingual bell-boy from the hotel as their interpreter.|$|E

The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims." [...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to draw Muhammad.

However, the network was not happy with this story, and specifically asked for an episode that contained the same things that had [...] "made the short so special, like the crazy opening dance, the 'Abe Lincoln moment,' funny catchwords, and the awkward princess/kiss moment at the end. Ward then created an early storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original short. Eventually, Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] became the first episode to enter into production.|$|E
