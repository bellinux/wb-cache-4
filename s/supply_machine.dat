40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a Possibilistic Linear Programming (PLP) method of solving integrated Manufacturing and Distribution Planning Decisions (MDPD) problems with multiple imprecise goals in supply chains under uncertain environment. The model aims to minimize total net costs, total delivery time and total imperfect quality items {{with reference to}} available <b>supply,</b> <b>machine</b> capacities, labour levels, quota flexibility, cost budget, forecast demand, warehouse space at each destination, inspection cost at each source and imperfect quality items transported from origins to destinations. Triangular distribution numbers are used to represent imprecise numbers. An industrial case is used to demonstrate the application of PLP method for MDPD problem. LINGO software is used to solve the problem...|$|E
40|$|A {{regulator}} {{is described}} {{for the maintenance}} of a constant pressure difference above airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation in a cuffed tracheal tube. It comprises a tubular threshold valve which is powered by the anaesthetic gas supply source to a breathing system. The valve is interposed between the anaesthetic gas <b>supply</b> <b>machine</b> and the breathing system creating a pressure differential. The upstream pressure is transmitted to the pilot tube supplying the cuff of a tracheal tube via an upstream connection. The valve is suitable only for breathing systems that require a constant gas supply. The regulator was evaluated during anaesthesia, using a modified Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo jet ventilation tube to obtain simultaneous pressure measurements within the cuff and the lumen of the tracheal tube. A greater pressure was demonstrated in the cuff than in the airway and the two traces were approximately parallel throughout the respiratory cycle. The device should prevent excessive cuff inflation pressure and solves the problem of forgetting to let the cuff down before extubation. Articl...|$|E

40|$|In most {{real-world}} situations {{for transportation}} planning decision (TPD) problems, environmental coefficients and parameters are imprecise/fuzzy in nature, {{and the decision}} maker (DM) generally faces a multi-objective TPD problem in a fuzzy environment. This work develops an interactive fuzzy linear programming (FLP) method for solving TPD problems with fuzzy goals, available supply and forecast demand. The proposed method attempts simultaneously to minimize the total production and transportation costs and the total delivery time with reference to available <b>supply,</b> <b>machine</b> capacities and budget constraints at each source, as well as forecast demand and warehouse space constraints at each destination. In addition, the proposed method provides a systematic framework that facilitates the DM interactively to modify the imprecise data and related parameters until a satisfactory solution is derived. An industrial case is used to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed method to real-world TPD problems. Especially, several significant characteristics of the proposed FLP method are presented in contrast {{to those of the}} main TPD methods.

50|$|Churchill {{was named}} after his uncle Walter Myers, an eminent {{physician}} and bacteriologist who died in 1901 aged 28. He was educated at Sedbergh School, and in 1926 read Modern Languages at Kings College, Cambridge. He then became an aeronautical engineer with Armstrong-Siddeley Motors, Coventry, after which he started an aviation precision engineering company, Churchill Components (Coventry) Ltd, in 1937, which <b>supplied</b> <b>machined</b> parts such as exhaust valves for radial aero-engines to Armstrong-Siddeley. After being blitzed out of Coventry in 1941, the company re-located to Market Bosworth. The company worked for Sir Frank Whittle, the jet-engine pioneer, and it machined compressor blades for the gas-turbine engines in the early 1940s.|$|R

MQL (minimal {{quantity}} lubrication) machining produces almost similar cutting {{performance to}} conventional flood <b>supply</b> <b>machining</b> while using much less metal working fluid. To {{take full advantage}} of MQL machining and expand its applicability, an understanding of its jet orientation is critical. Through computer fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of MQL flow field surrounding the workpiece and tool, it was found that a zone of negative pressure (ZNP) existed between workpiece and flank tool face in turning and was in favor of coolant particle arriving at tool tip. Cutting force was minimal and discontinuous chip effect was best of all when spraying from principal flank face and at range of target 20 mm...|$|R
