The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west side, with one bay added to the west wing. A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third of the waiting room, with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor is the upper hall and the captain's chamber, used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle's commander, and {{converted}} into a dining room and a bedroom in the 19th century.

5|$|Texas {{kicked off}} to the Ohio State fiveyard-line and Holmes {{returned}} it 26yards to the Buckeye 31. Justin Zwick was in at quarterback for Ohio State. On first-and-ten and needing a score to win the game, Zwick rushed around the left <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 35 but a fumble was forced by UT's Drew Kelson. UT's Brian Robison recovered the fumble at the 30and advanced it nine yards before being tackled by Vernon Gholston at the Ohio State 21.|$|E

5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the Upper East <b>Side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and East Harlem to the north, some residents of East Harlem stated that their neighborhood was not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E

5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to send an}} American <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, so as not to interfere with the start of the English domestic season.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal competed against Nantes in {{the third}} round of the contest.

They battled Deportivo La Coruña in the fourth round. Arsenal played at their home ground in the first match, and comprehensively beat the Spanish outfit by five goals to one, before suffering a 1–2 loss at Estadio Municipal de Riazor, which was still enough to take the English <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next round on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|At {{international}} level, Giovinco {{has represented}} Italy {{at all levels}} since first being called up by the under-16 side in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the 2008 Summer Olympics with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the Italy under-21 <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and he later took part at UEFA Euro 2012; winning a runners-up medal, and at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup; winning a bronze medal, and also scoring his first international goal during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Buffon has {{represented}} Italy at all youth levels, from the under-15 <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> under-23 side, {{as well as}} the Olympic side in 1996. With the Italy under-16 side, he reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, saving three penalties in the semi-final shootout. With the Italy U-17 side he took part at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan. In 1995, he reached the final of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship with the Italian U-19 side. He was most notably a member of Italy's 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship-winning squad. Buffon {{was a member of the}} Italy squad that won the gold medal for football at the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, on home soil. Buffon currently holds the record for the most clean sheets with the Italian national side.|$|E
5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the legal arguments, but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had almost universally recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008–09 season, Roberts {{attracted}} the attention of Stevenage — and joined the Hertfordshire side on an initial one-month loan deal, before signing permanently in January 2009 for an undisclosed fee. He was made team captain ahead of the 2009–10 season, a campaign in which Roberts would help lead the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history. The following season, Roberts helped guide the club to back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. He has also spent two spells as caretaker manager of the club, once in January 2012 and again in March 2013. After a successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in July 2013. He captained Fleetwood to promotion via the play-offs during his first season with the club. After two seasons at Fleetwood, Roberts joined League Two side Cambridge United in May 2015, where he spent two seasons. In August 2017, he signed for fellow League Two club Forest Green Rovers.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Malaysian Datuk Chan Tien Ghee {{took over}} as club chairman, with Vincent Tan also {{investing}} and joining the board. The following year, the club appointed Malky Mackay as manager, who took the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> League Cup final {{for the first time}} in the club's history during his first season. The following season, Cardiff won the 2012–13 Championship title and with it gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time, returning to the first-tier {{for the first time in}} 52 years. On 18 August 2013, Cardiff played their first ever Premier League match away to West Ham United, losing 2–0. Cardiff won only three games in the first half of the season and, on 27 December 2013, Mackay was sacked by Vincent Tan following showdown talks and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Despite the change, Cardiff were relegated to the Championship after a single season following a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle United. Solskjær himself was sacked on 18 September 2014 after a disappointing start to the following Championship season, and replaced by Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Milne {{featured}} in a further two Cup finals for United, losing 1–0 to Rangers in October 1984 in the Scottish League Cup Final and losing 2–1 to Celtic in May 1985 in the Scottish Cup Final. He aggravated a hamstring injury in the final against Rangers and was out of action for three months. In 1986–87, {{he played in the}} first three rounds of the UEFA Cup run (scoring once, against RC Lens in the first round) which eventually saw the team beat Barcelona and Borussia Mönchengladbach {{on their way to the}} final. However Milne had left in January 1987 before these high-profile games took place, sold to Charlton Athletic, having lost his place in the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> up-and-coming Kevin Gallacher. He made a total of 285 appearances for Dundee United in major competitions and is the club's all-time top scorer in Europe (UEFA Cup and European Cup) with a tally of 15 goals.|$|E
