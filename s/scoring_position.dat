30|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a coplayer music robot capable of {{presenting}} a musical expression together with humans. Although many instrument-performing robots exist, they may have difficulty playing with human performers {{due to the lack of}} the synchronization function. The robot has to follow differences in humans' performance such as temporal fluctuations to play with human performers. We classify synchronization and musical expression into two levels: (1) melody level and (2) rhythm level to cope with erroneous synchronizations. The idea is as follows: When the synchronization with the melody is reliable, respond to the pitch the robot hears, when the synchronization is uncertain, try to follow the rhythm of the music. Our method estimates the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> for the melody level and the tempo for the rhythm level. The reliability of the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> estimation is extracted from the probability distribution of the <b>score</b> <b>position.</b> The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing score following system in 16 songs out of 20 polyphonic songs. The error in the prediction of the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> is reduced by 69 % on average. The results also revealed that the switching mechanism alleviates the error in the estimation of the <b>score</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
40|$|One {{challenge}} in score following (i. e., mapping audio frames to <b>score</b> <b>positions</b> in real time) for piano performances is the mismatch between audio and score {{caused by the}} us-age of the sustain pedal. When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration nat-urally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their no-tated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong <b>score</b> <b>positions</b> for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of “new notes ” in the audio repre-sentation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previ-ous wrong <b>score</b> <b>positions,</b> hence encourages the system to align to the correct <b>score</b> <b>position.</b> We implement this idea based on a state-of-the-art score following framework. Ex-periments on synthetic and real piano performances from the MAPS dataset show significant improvements on both alignment accuracy and robustness...|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E
5|$|Further {{back in the}} field, Max Verstappen overtook Nasr and Button to {{move into}} twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively.

Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat.

40|$|Abstract — Our goal is {{to develop}} a co-player music robot, i. e., a robot that {{presents}} a musical expression together with humans. A music interaction requires two important functions: synchronization with the music and musical expression, such as dancing or playing a musical instrument. Many instrumentperforming robots are only capable of the latter function, they may have difficulty in playing live with human performers. The synchronization function is critical for the interaction. We classify synchronization and musical expression into two levels: (1) the rhythm level and (2) the melody level. Two issues in achieving two-level synchronization and musical expression are: (1) simultaneous estimation of the rhythm structure and the current part of the music and (2) derivation of the estimation confidence to switch behavior between the rhythm level and the melody level. This paper presents a score following algorithm, incremental audio to score alignment, that conforms to the twolevel synchronization design using a particle filter. Our method estimates the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> for the melody level and the tempo for the rhythm level. The reliability of the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> estimation is extracted from the probability distribution of the <b>score</b> <b>position.</b> Experiments are carried out using 20 polyphonic jazz songs. The results confirm that our method switches levels to alleviate the error in the <b>score</b> <b>position</b> estimation.

5|$|Following the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return, Nebraska's offense {{began work}} at its 21-yard line. Three rushes by as many {{different}} players—Joel Makovicka, Damon Benning, and Jay Sims—resulted in 11 yards and a first down. During Sims' run, Tech's Loren Johnson committed a 15-yard personal foul facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47-yard line. From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, who picked up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line.

40|$|When a {{musician}} gives a recital or concert, the music performed generally includes accompaniment. To render a good performance, the soloist and the accompanist must know the musical score and must follow the other musician's performance. Both performing and rehearsing {{are limited by}} constraints on {{the time and money}} available for bringing musicians together. Computer systems that automatically provide musical accompaniment offer an inexpensive, readily available alternative. Effective computer accompaniment requires software that can listen to live performers and follow along in a musical score. This work presents an implemented system and method for automatically accompanying a singer given a musical score. Specifically, I offer a method for robust, real-time detection of a singer's <b>score</b> <b>position</b> and tempo. Robust score following requires combining information obtained both from analyzing a complex signal (the singer's performance) and from processing symbolic notation (the score). Unfortunately, the mapping from the available information to <b>score</b> <b>position</b> does not define a function. Consequently, this work investigated a statistical characterization of a singer's <b>score</b> <b>position</b> and a model that combines the available musical information to produce a probabilistic position estimate.

40|$|Abstract—Soundprism, as {{proposed}} in this paper, {{is a computer}} system that separates single-channel polyphonic music audio played by harmonic sources into source signals in an online fashion. It uses a musical score to guide the separation process. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first online system that addresses score-informed music source separation that can be made into a real-time system. The proposed system consists of two parts: 1) a score follower that associates a <b>score</b> <b>position</b> to each time frame of the audio performance; 2) a source separator which reconstructs the source signals for each time frame, informed by the score. The score follower uses a hidden Markov approach, where each audio frame is associated with a 2 -D state vector (<b>score</b> <b>position</b> and tempo). The observation model is defined as the likelihood of observing the frame given the pitches at the <b>score</b> <b>position.</b> The <b>score</b> <b>position</b> and tempo are inferred using particle filtering. In building the source separator, we first refine the score-informed pitches of the current audio frame by maximizing the multi-pitch observation likelihood. Then, the harmonics of each source’s fundamental frequency are extracted to reconstruct the source signal. Overlapping harmonics between sources are identified and their energy is distributed in inverse proportion to the square of their respective harmonic number. Experiments on both synthetic and human-performed music show both the score follower and the source separator perform well. Results also show that the proposed score follower works well for highly polyphonic music with some degree of tempo variations.

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was a six-yard run by Linton, and it was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler. Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play, when he caught a short pass for a first down from Keldorf. Now at the Hokies' 31, Linton ran straight ahead for a two-yard gain. Linton's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf, but rather than punt, the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down. The fourth-down pass fell incomplete, and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30-yard line. Clark completed a six-yard pass to Parker, then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the clock. On third down, Clark completed a nine-yard pass to Michael Stuewe for a first down. A first-down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense, but on second down, Clark completed a pass to Stuewe for a first down at the Tar Heels 40-yard line. After a deep pass went incomplete, Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball {{for the second time in}} the first half. The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field. North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> before the end of the half, but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 220 lead.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's Tommy Edwards fielded {{the opening}} kickoff, which was {{returned}} to the Tech 29-yard line, where the Hokies' offense began the first play of the game, an incomplete pass by Virginia Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo. On the second play of the game, DeShazo again attempted a forward pass. This time, however, the ball was intercepted by Tennessee linebacker Tyrone Hines. Hines returned {{the ball to the}} Tech 28-yard line, allowing the Volunteers' offense to begin the game already in <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Tennessee's first play was a run up the middle by James Stewart, who gained three yards. On the second play, Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning completed a nine-yard pass to wide receiver Nilo Silvan. During the play, Silvan suffered a broken ankle and did not return to the game. Now at the 16-yard line, Tennessee continued its drive with a rush by Stewart, who wasn't able to advance the ball. On the next play, the Volunteers were penalized 10 yards for a block {{in the back of a}} Virginia Tech player. Despite the penalty and an incomplete pass on a subsequent play, Tennessee was able to gain a first down to the five-yard line with a pass from Manning to Joey Kent. Two plays later, the Volunteers scored on a one-yard touchdown run by Stewart. The extra point kick was successful, and Tennessee took a 70 lead with 11:41 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
