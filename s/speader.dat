5000|$|A rib spreader, {{also known}} as Finochietto {{retractor}}, {{is a type of}} retractor specifically designed to separate ribs in thoracic surgery. Rack-and-pinion-type stainless steel rib spreaders (with a thumb-screw to lock it in place) were an innovation introduced by French surgeon Theodore Truffier in 1914. This was modified in 1936 by Argentinian surgeon Enrique Finochietto to have [...] blades (blades with [...] "windows") and a hand-cranked lever to both separate the arms in a staged fashion and lock them in place at each stop. The Burford-Finochietto rib <b>speader</b> has replaceable blades. [...] The Truffier and especially the Burford-Finochietto (and its variants) are ubiquitous in open thoracic surgery, which accounts for over 90% of thoracic surgeries. Minimally invasive thoracic techniques (such as VATS and teleoperated surgical machines) have yet to prove superior, despite decades of development. Recently, a new intelligent, automated rib spreader in development demonstrated results superior to the Finochietto-style retractors.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} th carryover coarticulatory effecrs of consonantal context upon the acoustic characteristics of voqwia in Arabic. Five <b>speaders</b> read {{a list of}} 65 ev. c syllables containing various initial fricatives, five long vowels, and either final voiceless or voiced alveolar stop consonants. Formant frequency analysis have shown that fricative consonants induced significant coarticuatory effects on the F 2 steady state frequency of the variation varies significantly {{as a function of}} fricative place of articulation. The degree of fricative-to-vowel coarticulation appears {{to be related to the}} amount of articulatory constraint on the tongue activity duriqg the pro¬duction of fricativeee consonant. Thus the large amount of F 2 transition may reflect the antagnoistic demand on the articulatory movements during the production of fricative-to-vowel sequence as in emphatic or pharyneal fricatives and front high vowels combinations, whereas therelatively small amount of F 2 transition may reflect the complementary devand on the articulatory movements as in the sequence of alveolar or palatal fricatives and front high vowels. The insignificant F 2 transition variation in the sequence of labio-dental or glottal fricative and vowel may be interpreted to mean neutral demand on the articulatory movements...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{importance}} of gender {{with regard to the}} relationships depicted in Carol Ann Duffy's collection of poems "The World's Wife", arguing that factors such as individual traits and social circumstances are of greater weight than any gender incompabilities. Firstly, the characteristics with which Duffy endows female and male characters are discussec, pointing out that the relationships described fail for other reasons than mere gender discord. Secondly, reasons offered for failures in heterosexual relationships are explored futher, focusing on the poems "Little Red-Cap" and "Pygmalion's Bride" after which follows a discussion pertaining to the transgression of gender norms in "Mrs Beast" and "Delilah", along with a section questioning the existence of gender-specific traits. The chapter ends in an analysis of the potentially successful heterosexual relationship depicted in "Anne Hathaway", and the last chapter deals with the relationship between two women in "Mrs Tiresias", as compared to the <b>speader's</b> previous heterosexual marriage. Whereas non-gender-specific individual traits such as greed and selfishness, along with historical gender discrimination and other social circumstances, account {{for the majority of the}} failing relationships depicted in the collection, communication emerges as the main determining factor in successful and prosperous relationships, wheter heterosexual or between two women...|$|R
