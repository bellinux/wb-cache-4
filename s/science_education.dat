40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{facilitate}} informed decision-making in the development of a curriculum guide for Massachusetts family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> programs by gathering new knowledge related to the National Standards for Family and Consumer <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> (National Association of State Administrators of Family and Consumer Sciences·Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States [NASAFACS·V-TECS], 1998). The three goals of this study were: (1) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 16 areas of study of the National Standards for Family and Consumer <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> vision, (2) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 86 content standards of the National Standards for Family and Consumer <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> vision, and (3) to determine how often each content standard is taught in local family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> programs in Massachusetts. The national vision states that: “Family and Consumer <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> empowers individuals and families across the life span to manage the challenges of living in a diverse global society. Our unique focus is on families, work, and their interrelationships” (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998, p. 2). ^ The descriptive survey involved data collection from a national population of head state administrators of family and consumer sciences and the population of Massachusetts family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> professionals. The study found that whereas the question asked respondents to identify six areas of study, the results indicated that seven areas of study were perceived as distinctly more important. Six of the seven family and consumer <b>sciences</b> <b>education</b> areas of study were selected as more important by both the head state administrators and the Massachusetts professionals. These areas of study were: parenting; interpersonal relations; human development; family; career, community, and family connections; and nutrition and wellness. The Massachusetts professionals included the early childhood, education, and services as one of the seven more important areas of study, whereas the head state administrators selected the consumer and family resources as one of the seven more important areas of study. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} finding out the facts and hopes about the students’ English mastery from two perspectives, that is (1) the institutional perspective – the required English mastery level of Mathematics and Natural <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> Department students, and (2) the students’ perspective - the students’ hopes in relation to learning English. The reserch instruments are the documentation and the questionnaire ditributed to 168 of Mathematics and Natural <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> Department, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sriwijaya University. The findings show that the facts about the available English Course implementation and the target set by the Mathematics and Natural <b>Sciences</b> <b>Education</b> Department, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sriwijaya University and the current students’ English mastery {{are not the same}} as what the students’ hopes are.

5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding <b>science</b> <b>education.</b> A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially.
