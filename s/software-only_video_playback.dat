30|$|Apart {{from higher}} {{delivery}} ratio of high-priority packets, another main {{objective of the}} proposed SDS algorithm is to reduce <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> delay. In the situations of heavy traffic load and severe channel condition, <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> delay is unavoidable. In this simulation, <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> delay {{is defined as the}} accumulated time of the video discontinuity during the overall <b>video</b> stream <b>playback.</b> <b>Video</b> discontinuity is caused because the required high-priority packets (which constitute I-frames) are undelivered within their playback deadlines.|$|R

40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>playback</b> is a {{technique}} used to study the visual communication and behaviors of animals. While <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> is a useful tool, most experiments lack the ability for the visual stimulus {{to interact with the}} live animal. The limited number of experiments involving interactive <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> can be attributed partially to the lack of software available to conduct instructive interactive <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> experiments. To facilitate such interactive experiments, I have created a method that combines real-time animations with video tracking software. This method may be used to conduct interactive playback experiments. To demonstrate this method, a prototype was created and used to conduct automated mating choice trials on female swordtail fish. The results of the mating choice trials show that this prototype is able to create effectively interactive visual stimulus automatically. In addition, the results show that the interactive <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> has a measurable effect on the female swordtail fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni...|$|R
30|$|Compressed {{video streams}} {{are able to}} {{tolerate}} small amount of packet loss without degrading the quality of <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> very much, since some packets are less important for video decoding [4]. This feature {{can be used for}} schedule algorithms to deliver important packets and discard unimportant packets when traffic is heavy, or a wireless channel is unreliable. In this paper, the proposed SDS algorithm is designed to improve <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> quality and reduce <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> delay, especially when traffic load is heavy.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the {{consensus}} of a workshop that critically evaluated the utility and problems of <b>video</b> <b>playbacks</b> as stimuli in studies of visual behavior. We suggest that <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> is probably suitable for studying motion, shape, texture, size, and brightness. Studying color is problematic because video systems are specifically designed for humans. Any difference in color perception must lead to a different color sensation in most animals. Another potentially problematic limitation of video images is that they lack depth cues derived from stereopsis, accommodation, and motion parallax. Nonetheless, when used appropriately, <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> allows an unprecedented range of questions in visual communication to be addressed. It {{is important to note}} that most of the potential limitations of <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> are not unique to this technique but are relevant to all studies of visual signaling in animals...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of electronic information technology, traditional interpretation pattern in exhibition building and museum is developing towards digitization, information, intelligence, automation and multi functionality. A novel intelligent <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> system, {{which can be}} widely used in tourism and exhibition, is provided in this paper. The video playing system consists of radio frequency identification (RFID) module and <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> module. The novel system integrates advanced RFID technology, embedded control technology, and video playing technology. The RFID module identifies visitors, and selects the language and other information. The main chip of the RFID module card reader is MF RC 522 which is working in frequency bands of 13. 56 MHz, and the microcontroller of the module is Atmega 8. C programming language was used to program microcontroller in order to realize the function of automatically reading. The <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> module realizes the function of playing video files and controlling RFID module. On the hardware design of the <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> module, the S 3 C 2440 chip with ARM 920 T core {{was selected as the}} main control chip. The <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> module was developed by WinCE developing platform. Related drivers and application software were developed to control card reader, select language and to play the video file. The intelligent <b>video</b> <b>playback</b> system has several advantages such as: good real-time property, high portability and easy in maintenance. The system has its application prospect in exhibition and tourism. </p...|$|R
