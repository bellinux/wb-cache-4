A <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> is a regular change of one or more non spatial attributes when spatially moving away from a start object. <b>Spatial</b> <b>trend</b> detection is a graph search problem therefore heuristic methods can be good solution. Artificial immune system (AIS) is a special method for searching and optimizing. AIS is a novel evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological immune system.

However, even though the dimension of the <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> was increased considerably, a significant overdispersion was still evident (Table  2).

In this paper, we present new algorithms for spatial characterization and <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> analysis. For spatial characterization it is important that class membership of a database object is not only determined by its non-spatial attributes but also by the attributes of objects in its neighborhood. In <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> analysis, patterns of change of some non-spatial attributes in the neighborhood of a database object are determined. We present several algorithms for these tasks. These algorithms were implemented within a general framework for spatial data mining providing a small set of database primitives on top of a commercial spatial database management system. A performance evaluation using a real geographic database demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we show how the algorithms can be combined to discover even more interesting spatial knowledge...|$|E

40|$|As {{technology}} progresses, {{the availability}} of massive environmental data with global spatial coverage has become quite common. An example of such data is total column ozone (TCO) remotely sensed from a satellite. In their raw form, these data are often spatially (and temporally) dense, but irregular. The problem considered {{here is one of}} detecting a large-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> at a given time point (actually, in a given time interval). We propose a sequential aggregation method, producing different levels of coarser (spatial) resolution data and, at the same time, preserving both the local information content and the locations of the raw data. In estimating the large-scale trend, we consider different types of smooth <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> surfaces on the sphere, all linear combinations of smooth basis functions and satisfying the topological constraints imposed by the sphere. These include trend surfaces based on tensor products of splines, spherical harmonic basis functions, smoothing spherical splines and a new trend surface that we call fixed-rank smoothing (FRS). The FRS trend surfaces can be based on any set of smooth basis functions on the sphere and are estimated via penalized weighted-least-squares regression (ridge regression) using a data-adaptive penalty term. In comparing the various trend surfaces considered, we look at data fidelity, trend-surface consistency when fitted to data at different resolutions, and small- and large-scale spatial behavior of the resulting detrended fine-resolution data. An application to the TCO data reveals that the large-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> can be detected and effectively estimated using coarse-resolution data. The FRS trend surfaces are seen to achieve better data fidelity than other trend surfaces considered, and, in terms of trend-surface consistency and small- and large-scale residual behavior, FRS is seen to have as good, and sometimes better, performance.

In contrast to non-spatial outliers which only consider non-spatial attributes, spatial outliers are defined to be those sites which {{are very different from}} its neighbors defined in terms of spatial attributes, i. e., locations. In this paper, we propose a local trimmed mean approach to evaluating the spatial outlier factor which is the degree that a site is outlying compared to its neighbors. The structure of our approach strictly follows the general spatial data model, which states spatial data consists of trend, dependence and error. We empirically demonstrate trimmed mean is more outlier-resistant than median in estimating sample location and it is employed to estimate <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> in our approach. In addition to using the 1 st order neighbors in computing error, we also use higher order neighbors to estimate <b>spatial</b> <b>trend.</b> With true outlier factor supposed to be given by the spatial error model, we compare our approach with spatial statistic and scatter plot. Experimental results on two real datasets show our approach is significantly better than scatter plot, and slightly better than spatial statistic...|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{heterogeneity}} of covariates that are spatially correlated, but unknown, or only insufficiently available, {{in many cases the}} response data are autocorrelated. Haining et al.

Fahrmeir and Echavarrı ([2006]) introduce an extensive methodology using structured additive regression models STAR for overdispersed and zero-inflated count data. These models make it possible to model non-linear covariate effects, individual or cluster-specific uncorrelated random effects, spatially correlated random effects or 2 -dimensional <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> surfaces simultaneously. The methodology employed in our investigation (Wood [2006]) offers similar technical possibilities for the Poisson and negative binomial distributions and, in combination with Rigby and Stasinopoulos’s ([2005]) methods, for the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. The inventory plots are located exactly via coordinates, and hence a 2 -dimensional <b>spatial</b> <b>trend</b> function is fitted instead of spatially correlated random effects for distinct areas. The observations at the 4 subplots were aggregated due to their proximity, which makes the estimation of uncorrelated random effects at the plot level redundant. Overall, the approach adopted combines an appropriate distribution assumption for count data with non-linear effects of causal covariates and an advanced method for covering spatial autocorrelation.|$|E

Our empirical case concerns the Metropolitan Area (MA) of Paris in France which is divided in 2 636 neighborhood areas.

40|$|Mine {{planning}} for a new reserve is based on information obtained from exploratory coreholes. A critical component of an exploration program is the geotechnical evaluation. Poor assumptions about roof conditions greatly add to the risks of mining. Rock mechanics testing is central to a geotechnical exploration program. Typically, 3 to 5 uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are made to characterize a particular roof unit at a given corehole. The average (mean) of these tests is taken as The UCS for that location. Isopach contour maps are then used to show <b>spatial</b> <b>trends</b> in roof strength. Two issues are raised by this traditional approach. The first {{is due to the}} large variability in UCS values that is typical even within a single unit from a single hole. The average UCS might be higher at Corehole A than it is at Corehole B, but the difference may not be statistically significant. The second issue is whether widely spaced coreholes can identify valid <b>spatial</b> <b>trends</b> in rock strength. The answer depends upon whether rock strength changes over distances that are longer or shorter than the corehole spacing. This is a classical geostatistical problem. While geostatics have been used to investigate many coal quality parameters, they have seldom been used to evaluate rock strength. This paper describes an extensive investigation of these issues conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in collaboration with Peabody Energy. The study employed the Peabody Rock Mechanics Data Base which contains more than 10, 000 individual test results. Data from four important roof units were subjected to statistical analysis: Brereton Limestone above the Herrin 6 seam (Illinois) Turner Mine Shale above the No. 9 Seam (Kentucky) Sandstone above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) Shale above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) The study did not find significant <b>spatial</b> <b>trends</b> in rock strength in any of the cases.
