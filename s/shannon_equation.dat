40|$|A {{method of}} {{significantly}} improving {{the capacity of}} high-altitude platform (HAP) communications networks operating in the millimeter-wave bands is presented. It is shown how constellations of HAPs can share a common frequency allocation by exploiting the directionality of the user antenna. The system capacity of such constellations is critically affected by the minimum angular separation of the HAPs and the sidelobe level of the user antenna. For typical antenna beamwidths of approximately 5 /spl deg/ an inter-HAP spacing of 4 km is sufficient to deliver optimum performance. The aggregate bandwidth efficiency is evaluated, both theoretically using the <b>Shannon</b> <b>equation,</b> and using practical modulation and coding schemes, for multiple HAP configurations delivering either single or multiple cells. For the user antenna beamwidths used, it is shown that capacity increases are commensurate {{with the increase in}} the number of platforms, up to 10 HAPs. For increases beyond this the choice of constellation strategy becomes increasingly important...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} limit {{given by}} the <b>Shannon</b> Capacity <b>equation</b> has been the origin of communications systems based on the interchange between bandwidth and power. This article explores the interchange between the power spectral density and the reflections that can be generated in a communications channel, with the ultimate aim {{of being able to}} decrease the power spectral density for the same capacity. The reflections can be expressed as a number of controlled reflections or by a reflection coefficient. The channels studied show that this exchange is possible. A new model based on feedback circuits was found to represent a transmission line, which was useful to study the MISO channel formed by several transmission lines of different length. A geometric elliptic dispersion model to represent a SISO channel was studied too...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Complexity {{analysis}} of functional brain structure data represents a new multidisciplinary approach to examining complex, living structures. I aimed {{to construct a}} connectivity map of visual brain activities using resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data and to characterize the level of complexity of functional brain activity using these connectivity data. Methods. A total of 25 healthy controls and 20 patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated. fMRI preprocessing analysis was performed that included head motion correction, temporal filtering, and spatial smoothing process. Brain entropy (BEN) was calculated using the <b>Shannon</b> entropy <b>equation.</b> Results. My findings demonstrated that patients exhibited reduced brain complexity in visual brain areas compared to controls. The mean entropy value of the ADHD group was 0. 56 ± 0. 14, compared to 0. 64 ± 0. 11 in the control group. Conclusion. My study adds an important novel result to the growing literature pertaining to abnormal visual processing in ADHD that my ADHD patients had lower BEN values, indicating more-regular functional brain structure and abnormal visual information processing...|$|R

It is assumed that each microstate is equally likely, so that the probability of a given microstate is pi = 1/W. When these probabilities are substituted into the above expression for the Gibbs entropy (or equivalently kB times the <b>Shannon</b> entropy), Boltzmann's <b>equation</b> results. In information theoretic terms, the information entropy of a system is the amount of [...] "missing" [...] information needed to determine a microstate, given the macrostate.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issue of}} measurement of dynamic variables of open nonlinear dynamical systems. Most of real physical and biological systems in the surrounding world are the nonlinear dynamic systems. The spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal structures are formed in such systems because of dissipation. The collective effects that associated with the processes of self-organization and evolution are possible there too. The objective {{of this research is}} a compilation of the <b>Shannon</b> entropy measurement <b>equations</b> for case of nonlinear dynamical systems. It’s proposed to use the interval mathematics methods for this. It is shown that the measurement and measurement results analysis for variables with complex dynamics, as a rule, cannot be described by classical metrological approaches, that metrological documents, for example GUM, contain. The reason of this situation is the mismatch between the classical mathematical and physical approaches {{on the one hand and}} processes that occur in real dynamic systems on the other hand. For measurement of nonlinear dynamical systems variables the special measurement model and measurement results analysis model are created. They are based on Open systems theory, Dynamical chaos theory and Information theory. It’s proposed to use the fractal, entropic and temporal scales as tools for evaluation of a systems state. As a result of research the <b>Shannon</b> entropy measurement <b>equations,</b> based on interval representations of measurement results. are created, like for an individual dynamic variable as for nonlinear dynamic system. It is shown that the measurement equations, based on interval mathematics methods, contains the exact solutions and allows take into account full uncertainty. The new results will complement the measurement model and the measurement results analysis model for case of nonlinear dynamic systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-to-one}} relationship {{exists between}} scalar periodically correlated nonstationary processes and multivariate stationary processes. This fact {{allows us to}} transfer results proven for ones to the others. We are interested in a probabilistic approach of results sometimes already known in a different (analytical or numerical) context, in order to simplify, generalize and unify them. We use a probabilistic approach of generalized reflection coefficients to give a constructive condition of extension of partial covariance sequences, achieved by an autoregressive model. We develop a Trench-Zohar recursion for the nonstationary case which leads to an economical algorithm to solve the associated Yule-Walker <b>equations.</b> <b>Shannon</b> and Burg entropies are linked through a Szëgo type theorem.

30|$|There {{also have}} been various {{approaches}} to investigate the optimal base station (BS) placement to achieve the operator's desired QoS or coverage targets. Much of the previous work [6 – 8] has focused on minimising the transmitting power of BS. Fagen et al. [9] proposed a new automated method of simultaneously maximising coverage while minimising interference for a desired level of coverage overlap. However, such an approach is not always practical as network optimisation is constrained {{by a number of}} restrictions on BS placements, interference and power emissions. Ashraf et al. [10] described an approach of adjusting the transmitting power of fixed positions of FAPs in the enterprise offices to achieve coverage optimisation and load balance, but did not consider the evaluation of the effect on the positions of FAPs. In [11], a joint power and channel allocation method was proposed to improve the uplink throughput, but the calculation of the throughput, which was the key parameter of the algorithm, was relatively simple and might be inaccuracy by just using <b>Shannon</b> capacity <b>equation.</b> Ki Wo et al. [12] derived the downlink SINR formula for the residential femtocell but the formula did not take the throughput into account while researchers in [13] provided system simulation to evaluate the femtocell network performance, however the simulation was relatively simple without an extensive theoretical model verification. A theoretical framework was proposed in [14] to analyse the interference characteristics of different femtocell sub-bands for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems employing the Fractional Frequency Reuse scheme which could be extended to optimise power and frequency allocation, but the pathloss model employed in this framework is far too simple to reflect the real characteristics of the indoor scenario.|$|R
40|$|Clearcutting is {{a common}} {{harvesting}} practice in many eastern hardwood forests. Among the vegetation strata of these forests, the herbaceous layer is potentially the most sensitive in its response to harvest-mediated disturbances and has the highest species diversity. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the response of herbaceous layer diversity to forest harvesting. Previous work on clearcut and mature stands at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF), West Virginia, has shown that, although, harvesting did not alter appreciably herbaceous layer cover, it influenced the relationship of cover to biotic and abiotic factors, such as tree density and soil nutrients, respectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the response of species diversity of the herbaceous layer to harvesting at FEF. Fifteen circular, 0. 04 ha sample plots were established in each of four watersheds (60 plots in total) representing two stand age categories: two watersheds with 20 years even-age stands following clearcutting and two watersheds with mature second growth stands. All woody stems ≥ 2. 5 cm diameter at breast height were identified, tallied, and measured for diameter. The herbaceous layer was sampled by identifying all vascular plants ≤ 1 m in height and estimating cover for each species in each of 10 (1 m 2) circular sub-plots per sample plot (600 sub-plots total). Species diversity for each plot was calculated from herbaceous layer data using the ln-based <b>Shannon</b> Index (H′) <b>equation.</b> Ten stand and soil variables also were measured on each plot. Mean herbaceous layer cover for clearcut versus mature stands was 27. 2 ± 14. 3...|$|R
