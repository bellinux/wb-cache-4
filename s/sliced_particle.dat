40|$|Causeway Lake is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} area for water sports. It was created when a bridge, a weir and a causeway were built across the Mulambin estuary in 1939. The current water depth varies from 0. 5 - 1. 3 m, versus the original 2 - 3 m depth. The Mulambin area has recently seen residential and other developments. The sedimentation rates in the lake were estimated recently at 1000 m 3 /y transported into the lake by tidal currents and 1500 m 3 /y from the catchment. 	 This study aimed to determine metal concentrations in Causeway Lake sediments using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and the k 0 -method of standardisation, and to assess the sediment quality using the ANZECC sediment quality guidelines. NAA is attractive because of its minimal sample preparation requirements and multi-element detection capability; furthermore a single monitor is sufficient for the k 0 -method to determine the concentration of all detectable elements in a sample. To check {{the reliability of the}} k 0 -NAA method, BCSS- 1 (estuarine) and PACS- 2 (marine) certified sediment reference materials were analysed. The k 0 -NAA anlyses of the Causeway Lake sediments were also compared with ICP-OES or ICP-MS analyses. The study used the new 20 MW OPAL research reactor operated by ANSTO. At the INAA irradiation positions used the neutron flux was around 1. 5 × 1013 cm- 2 s- 1 and was well thermalised (thermal/epithermal flux ratio > 1000). Irradiations were carried out in both the short and long residence time facilities to maximise the number of quantifiable elements. The neutron flux monitor for k 0 -NAA was the reference material IRMM- 530 R which contained 0. 1 % gold. Gamma-ray spectra were analysed using HyperLab and elemental concentrations calculated using Kayzero for Windows. The ratios of the k 0 -NAA data to the reference sediments’ certified values were generally 0. 9 - 1. 1 indicating reliability of the method. At least 30 elements (excluding Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb, but including rare earths) were detected in the Causeway Lake sediments. However only eight elements were compared because of the limited ICP-OES/ICP-MS dataset. The table (ratio of k 0 -NAA to ICP-OES/ICP-MS data) shows comparable average concentrations for surficial sediments and core <b>slices</b> (<b>particles</b> < 60 micron), except for Cr and Sb.

Of particular interest to me are analytical visualization systems which can show METOC models and measured data simultaneously so that a user can explore the complex physical dynamics. OBJECTIVES My objective is to develop a distributed visualization and virtual environment for METOC. This system would have readers for many ocean model outputs (e. g., NLOM, POM, WAM, etc.), for many meteorology model outputs (COAMPS, NOGAPS/NORAPS, etc.), and for measured data (CTDs, satellite data, scattered data, etc.). APPROACH We realized early on that we needed to prioritize our efforts. We decided to attack distributed visualization first, then concurrent visualization, and finally a virtual environment. To do such we decided we needed to build a visualization system that would allow us to create batch mode (off-screen) rendering packages, interactive (on-screen) visualization packages, and virtual environments with the same core functionality (color mapping, <b>slicing</b> planes, <b>particle</b> traces, isosurfaces, etc.). Early in our effort we were told by our collaborators in the NRL Ocean Dynamics and Prediction Branch (NRL 7320) at Stennis Space Center, MS that what they most needed was a batch-mode, off-screen rendering toolkit that would let them make movies overnight of their daily model runs utilizing the parallel computation resources in the NAVO/MSRC.

40|$|Particle {{clusters}} are preferential accumulations of a solid, {{secondary phase}} {{that can be}} caused by turbulence. It is well known that particle clusters can influence the performance of systems employing suspension flows, such as pulverised fuel combustion systems. However, statistical analysis of clusters is limited by available methods to quantify them. In the current study, a method to identify planar <b>slices</b> of large-scale <b>particle</b> clusters from planar images of instantaneous particle distributions is presented. The method employs smoothing of instantaneous particle scatter images by a length scale, L S, to produce pseudo-scalar fields of particle distributions. The scalar fields are compared with mean (not smoothed) images to produce cluster masks that are then multiplied by the original instantaneous image to produce a map of the locations of cluster slices. The sensitivity to the smoothing length scale is assessed parametrically for its influence on the statistical measures of the following parameters characterising slices of large-scale clusters in four representative flows: the physical locations of the cluster slice centroids; the area of the cluster slice; and the number of cluster slices per image. While the results are influenced by the selected value of smoothing length scale, L S, the sensitivity is low in a physically reasonable range and the method performs well in this range for the four different flow cases. The method could be extended to provide volumetric measurements with suitable volumetric imaging systems. C. H. Birzer, P. A. M. Kalt, G. J. Natha...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a parallel, cosmological N-body code {{based on a}} hybrid scheme using the particle-mesh (PM) and Barnes-Hut (BH) oct-tree algorithm. We call the algorithm GOTPM for Grid-of-Oct-Trees-Particle-Mesh. The code is parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library and is optimized to run on Beowulf clusters as well as symmetric multi-processors. The gravitational potential is determined on a mesh using a standard PM method with particle forces determined through interpolation. The softened PM force is corrected for short range interactions using a grid of localized BH trees throughout the entire simulation volume in a completely analogous way to P 3 M methods. This method makes no assumptions about the local density for short range force corrections and so {{is consistent with the}} results of the P 3 M method in the limit that the treecode opening angle parameter, θ → 0. The PM method is parallelized using one-dimensional <b>slice</b> domain decomposition. <b>Particles</b> are distributed in slices of equal width to allow mass assignment onto mesh points.

40|$|For {{simulating}} the strong-strong beam-beam effect, us-ing Particle-In-Cell codes {{has become}} one of the methods of choice. While the two-dimensional problem is readily treatable using PC-class machines, the three-dimensional problem, i. e., a problem encompassing hourglass and phase-averaging effects, requires the use of parallel pro-cessors. In this paper, we introduce a strong-strong code NIMZOVICH 1, which was specifically designed for par-allel processors and which is optimally used for many bunches and parasitic crossings. We describe the paral-lelization scheme and give some benchmarking results. PARALLELIZATION NIMZOVICH uses parallelization according to the SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) scheme. A cluster of processors is divided in two sections, called Rings. Each Ring is subdivided into several Bunches. Bunches within a Ring are completely independent. Bunches in opposing Rings are independent, except if they have a design or par-asitic interaction point in common, i. e., if one of their two geometric interaction points falls into a section of the ring (the Window) shared by both beams. Each Bunch is divided longitudinally into several Slices. For reasons of load balancing, the slicing scheme is cho-sen in such a way as to have the same number of <b>particles</b> within each <b>slice,</b> assuming an initial gaussian distribution of given length. Slice borders are, however, not dynami-cally adapted to changed longitudinal distributions. Given enough available processors, each <b>Slice’s</b> portion of <b>particles</b> can be further subdivided. Portions of a Bunch with the same subdivision index in each slice are called a Slab. They do not represent any geometric subdivision.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} Lorentzian {{general relativity}} with zero cosmological constant and spinless point particles are studied. The topology of spacetime is M x R, where M is a Riemann surface and global hyperbolicity is assumed. The system has only finite {{degrees of freedom}} corresponding to non-trivial topology, since all solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations are locally flat spaces in three dimensions. After a generic introduction to phase space reduction, the polygon model of 't Hooft is introduced. This finite dimensional Hamiltonian system is encoded {{by a number of}} Euclidean polygons. It arises as the foliation of the three dimensional universe with spacelike Eucliden polygons, whose edges are decorated by two real numbers, their lengths L and the "so-called" boost parameters h of the corresponding transition functions of the geometric structure. Such an object is an element g of the Lorentz group SO(2, 1). 	Particles are easily added to this model by cutting out wedges from the polygons corresponding to a new pair of glued edges meeting at the "point particle". The condition for the angle {{at the tip of the}} wedge is Tr g=cos(m) in suitable units, where m is interpreted as the mass of the particle, which determine the angle. The deficit from 2 pi in the rest frame of the particle is equal to its mass. These vertices carry three dimensional curvature singularities as opposed to the trivalent ones. 	This thesis contains two main results. One concerns the case of higher genus spacelike <b>slice</b> without <b>particles.</b> It is shown that the h variables parametrize Teichmüller space, (which is the reduced configuration space of physically distinct universes) if they are interpreted as geodesic lengths in hyperbolic space. Then the dual graph of the skeleton yields an ideal triangulation of a uniformizing hyperbolic with the same topology as the physical equal time surface and with constant curvature - 1. Using this one can show that the constraints corresponding to the closure of the Euclidean polygon (in case there is only one) can always be solved by a clever choice of the chart corresponding to basepoint of the geodesic loops on the uniformizing surface. It is very likely that each physically distinct universe admits a slicing in terms of only one polygon. The question of generalization for particles is more difficult, and even explicit configurations are found where the construction does not work. 	The second result is the derivation of the postulated symplectic structure from the first order action of general relativity by means of symplectic reduction. It is done in two steps: the first is a reduction from the (infinite dimensional) dynamical fields of the action to a finite set of variables describing a non-planar polygonal contour in a background Minkowski space. This covariant model is then gauge-fixed to arrive at the 't Hooft polygon model. In the last subsection aspects of quantization procedures from these and related starting points are discussed...|$|R

TEM images of FIB slices revealed that clay minerals occurred as either nano-thin platelets or relatively thick plates. Chemical compositions and lattice fringes of the nano-thin platelets suggested that they included illite, smectite, illite–smectite mixed layers, and their nanoscale mixtures (illite–smectite series clay minerals, ISCMs) {{which could not be}} resolved with an electron microbeam. EDXS chemical analysis of the clay mineral grains revealed that the average Fe content was 5. 8 % in nano-thin ISCM platelets assuming 14 % H 2 O, while the Fe content of illite and chlorite was 2. 8 and 14. 8 %, respectively. In addition, TEM and EDXS analyses were performed on clay mineral grains dispersed and loaded on micro-grids. The average Fe content of clay mineral grains was 6. 7 and 5. 4 % in Asian and Saharan dusts, respectively. A comparative X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk dusts showed that Saharan dust was more enriched in clay minerals than Asian dust, while Asian dust was more enriched in chlorite. Clay minerals, in particular nanocrystalline ISCMs and Fe-rich chlorite, are probably important sources of Fe to remote marine ecosystems.

40|$|Background: In this {{interdisciplinary}} project, {{the biological}} effects of heavy ions are {{compared to those}} of X-rays using tissue slice culture preparations from rodents and humans. Advantages of this biological model are the conservation of an organotypic environment and the independency from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Its open access allows easy treatment and observation via live-imaging microscopy. Materials and methods: Rat brains and human brain tumor tissue are cut into 300 micro m thick tissue slices. These slices are cultivated using a membrane-based culture system and kept in an incubator at 37 °C until treatment. The slices are treated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt at doses of up to 40 Gy. The heavy ion irradiations were performed at the UNILAC facility at GSI with different ions of 11. 4 A MeV and fluences ranging from 0. 5 – 10 x 106 particles/cm². Using 3 D-confocal microscopy, cell-death and immune cell activation of the irradiated slices are analyzed. Planning of the irradiation experiments is done with simulation programs developed at GSI and FIAS. Results: After receiving a single application of either X-rays or heavy ions, slices were kept in culture for up to 9 d post irradiation. DNA damage was visualized using gamma H 2 AXstaining. Here, a dose-dependent increase and time-dependent decrease could clearly be observed for the X-ray irradiation. Slices irradiated with heavy ions showed less gamma H 2 AX-positive cells distributed evenly throughout the <b>slice,</b> even though <b>particles</b> were calculated to penetrate only 90 – 100 micro m into the slice. Conclusions: Single irradiations of brain tissue, even at high doses of 40 Gy, will result neither in tissue damage visible on a macroscopic level nor necrosis. This {{is in line with}} the view that the brain is highly radio-resistant. However, DNA damage can be detected very well in tissue slices using gamma H 2 AX-immuno staining.

40|$|Lily (Lilium spp.) {{is among}} the most {{traditional}} and beloved ornamental flowers worldwide. The genus Lilium comprises almost one hundred species, among which is the primary subject of our research, described in this thesis, the species Lilium longiflorum (Thunb.), known as trumpet lily or Easter lily. Despite the great economic importance of ornamental lily species, little is known about its biology at the molecular level so far. In a time when two genomes are fully sequenced, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, only a few genes have been characterized in Lilium spp. yet. Possible reasons for this are discussed throughout this thesis. This work intends to be a contribution to bridging the fundamental research concerning transcription factors involved in development of flower morphology in model species and the applied objectives of molecular breeding for manipulating flower morphology, endeavouring to create new cultivars with specific and novel features, more specifically in Lilium spp. The ABC model for floral development was proposed more than 10 years ago and since then many studies have been performed in model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, petunia and many other species in order to confirm this model. This investigation has led to additional information on flower development and to more complex molecular models. In the first chapter of this thesis, notions of molecular floral development, the difficulties of working with molecular biology of lily, the state-of-the-art in lily transformation are introduced, as well as general overviews of transcription factors, MADS-box genes, the ABCDE model for flower development and functional characterization of genes in heterologous systems. These concepts will guide the reader throughout the work we present here. AGAMOUS (AG) is the only C type gene found in Arabidopsis and it is responsible for stamen and carpel development as well as floral determinacy. In the second chapter, we describe the isolation of LLAG 1, a putative AG orthologue from lily (L. longiflorum) by screening a cDNA library derived from developing floral buds. The deduced amino acid sequence of LLAG 1 revealed the MIKC structure and a high homology in the MADS-box among AG and other orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relationship between LLAG 1 and AG orthologues from monocot species. Spatial expression data showed LLAG 1 transcripts exclusively in stamens and carpels, constituting the C domain of the ABC model. Functional analysis was carried out in Arabidopsis by overexpression of LLAG 1 driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter. Transformed plants showed homeotic changes in the two outer floral whorls with some plants having the second whorl completely converted into stamens. Altogether, these data indicate a functional relationship between LLAG 1 and AG. (SEP 3) is a MADS-box homeotic gene possibly determining the E function in the ABCDE model. This function is essential for proper development of petals, stamens and carpels. In order to gain further information on lily (Lilium longiflorum) flower development at the molecular level, the cDNA library constructed from developing floral buds was screened again and our findings are reported in the chapter three. A clone (LLSEP 3) was isolated with high similarity to the SEP 3 transcription factor from Arabidopsis. LLSEP 3 belongs to the AGL 2 subfamily of MADS-box genes and shares its closest relationships with DOMADS 1 and OM 1, from the orchid species Dendrobium grex and Aranda deborah, respectively. Expression analysis by Northern hybridisation showed that LLSEP 3 was expressed throughout lily flower development and in tepals, stamens and carpel tissues of mature flowers, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. Overexpression of LLSEP 3 in Arabidopsis under the CaMV 35 S promoter induced early flowering but did not induce any floral homeotic changes, which is in accordance with the effect of SEP 3 overexpression in this species. Altogether, these data are consistent with the putative role of LLSEP 3 as an E functional gene in lily flower development. Drawbacks found during our work on functional characterisation of LLAG 1, by means of complementing the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana are described and critically discussed in chapter four. Such difficulties are, on the one hand, the nature of the AGAMOUS gene, of which the loss of function induces sterility and, on the other hand, the unavailability of the defective ag- 1 allele in another Arabidopsis background than the Landsberg erecta ecotype, which is recognisably difficult to transform by the floral dip method. Even though we did not manage to complement the AG function with LLAG 1 in a defective ag genotype so far, we could observe clear floral homeotic changes in those Arabidopsis plants ectopically overexpressing LLAG 1, which together with our data on sequence identities and expression profile described in the previous chapter of this thesis, indicated that LLAG 1 is a strong candidate to control the C function in L. longiflorum. This work also contributes towards the improvement of lily transformation procedures. In the chapter five we describe a transformation of bulblet <b>slices</b> by <b>particle</b> bombardment using a vector carrying the ArabidopsisSUPERMAN gene driven by the petunia flower-specific FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 1 promoter and the bialaphos resistance gene phosphinothricin acetyltransferase under the CaMV 35 S promoter. Our intentions were improving the transformation parameters for lily transformation in order to reach higher efficiency, and creating novel phenotypes in lily flowers using transcription factors originating from dicot plants. We were capable of obtaining transgenic lines expressing in vitro resistance to bialaphos. The transgenic plants were transferred to the greenhouse, grown and monitored for two flowering seasons. Flowers derived from these plants appeared normal and indistinguishable from wild-type flowers and the possible reasons for this are currently under investigation. Homeotic changes in floral organs of lily (Lilium spp.) are described in chapter six. Usually, lily flowers show similar organs in their first and second whorls called tepals. They constitute the appealing and colourful features determining flower appearance. Stamens and the pistil appear as the third and fourth whorls, respectively. A double lily flower shows replacement of stamens by tepals and of its carpel by a new flower in a reiterated manner, similar to what is seen in the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis. A novel floral phenotype of lily, denominated festiva here, has never been reported in other species so far and shows a complete homeotic change of stamens into tepals, but keeps the carpel identity. We tried to explain these phenotypes taking into consideration all the evidence on the genetic mechanisms involved in flower development gathered over the last 15 years. This work launches challenges and encouragement for exploiting the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development of lily. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system has shown to be of great potential in reverse plant genetics. Advantages of VIGS over other approaches, such as T-DNA or transposon tagging, include the circumvention of plant transformation, methodological simplicity and robustness, and speedy results. These features enable VIGS as an alternative instrument in functional genomics, even in a high throughput fashion. The system is already well established in Nicotiana benthamiana, but efforts are being addressed to improve VIGS in other species, including monocots. Current research is focussed on unravelling the silencing mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and VIGS, as well as finding novel viral vectors in order to broaden the host species spectrum. In chapter seven, we discuss the advantages of using VIGS to assess gene functions in plants. We address the molecular mechanisms involved in the process, present the available methodological elements such as vectors, inoculation procedures, and we show examples in which the system was applied successfully to characterize gene function in plants. Moreover, we analyse the potential application of VIGS in assessing genetic function of floral transcription factors from monocots. Analyses of gene functions involved in lily flower development and generation of useful information on the molecular breeding potential of this species were the main objectives of the work described in this thesis. The field for studying the molecular aspects of lily flower development is now wide open and the future may uncover very interesting aspects that will produce new tools for ornamental breeders as well as reveal particular features of monocots and the Liliaceae plant family...|$|R
40|$|This work {{described}} {{the generation of}} hierarchically-structured particles by two methods. Electrospraying {{was used for the}} synthesis of polymeric PS/PMMA Janus particles and composite particles made of Silica and a microgel component by interface-induced self assembly. As a second method wrinkle templates were used to generate and modify patchy particles by surface-induced self-assembly. Chapter 5 dealt with particle design via electrospraying. It was shown that from a side by side alignment of canulas PS/PMMA Janus particles could be obtained. By changing the experimental parameters of the electrospraying setup the composition and even form of particles could be tuned. The proof of different chemical compartmentalization was performed by decomposition of the PMMA component. The second part of this chapter {{described the}} fabrication of hierarchically-structured Silica/microgel particles from one canula. The structural composition of the particles was analyzed by electron microscopy methods, also investigating <b>slices</b> of cut <b>particles</b> to determine the structure from the inside. For additional information on composition of the particles TGA measurements were performed showing that the mass consists of 31 % microgel, 52 % Silica and 17 % ethoxy groups from unreacted PAOS residues. Furthermore the PAOS/water+microgel system was investigated via tensiometry for {{a better understanding of the}} electrospraying process. It was shown that the condensation of PAOS at the interface happens very fast even without addition of a catalyst and led to extremely low values of the interfacial tension after very short measurement time. The addition of microgels even more decreased the interfacial tension attributed to the Pickering effect of particles aligning at that water/PAOS interface while the addition of a catalyst did not show any further impact. Normally for such low interfacial tensions a breaking of the droplet would be expected but a series of photographs with increasing time showed the stability of the developed Silica shell at the interface even in a way that the droplet does not break after removal of the canula. Particles synthesized by this approach could be used as filtration units after calcination of the microgel compartment or for drug delivery. The sixth chapter introduced the concept of surface wrinkling upon strain release in a bilayer system consisting of a rigid top layer and a flexible PDMS fundament. It was shown that wrinkle dimensions, thus amplitude and wavelength, were tunable by variation of plasma treatment time. Wrinkles with differing dimensions served as templates for surface-induced self assembly for the alignment of SiO 2 NH 2 particles inside the grooves, achieving varying immersions in the wrinkles. This was relevant for the modification step of aligned particles as varying immersion meant shielding to different extent of one side of the particles. Deposition of Au NP on top of aligned particles led to the formation of patches on the surfaces by an electrostatic adsorption step. Patchy particle removal in aequeous solution was successful by ultrasonic treatment as well as repeated wetting of the templates. The characterization with electron microscopic methods showed a relation between initial immersion and actual patchiness of the particles. This means that wrinkle substrates can be used for direct influence of desired patchy particle appearance. Additionally the growth of Au NP on top of Silica surfaces while aligned was demonstrated. On one side this shows the ability to generate dense halfshells from patches and on the other hand this generally demonstrates that a further modication of particles can be applied while they are still templated without the needof changing the medium and avoiding filtration processes or other. Chapter 7 described the interfacial behaviour of patchy particles designed in the previous chapter. It was shown that, related to patchiness of a particle, the interfacial tension decreases for patchy particles compared to homogeneous particles. The amount of decreasing is directly related to different properties of those patchy particles. First of all it is dependant on the patchiness which influences the coverage of the surface. If the particle is close to Janus balance the cross section of these cover a larger area of the oil/water interface than for more deviating patchiness. It was shown that particles with a patchiness of 1. 17 have a much lower interfacial tension than those with a patchiness of 1. 82 and of course homogeneous SiO 2 NH 2 particles. Those results were confirmed with calculations of the corresponding surface energy. Additionally it was shown that the curvature of the droplet combined with the orientation of each side plays a role. Particles with a patchiness of 0. 82 which is almost as close to Janus balance like patchiness 1. 17 show a much higher interfacial tension. This is related to the fact that steric hindrance due to curvature of the droplet prevents a dense packing at the interface. Another major role plays the charge and charge distribution of the particles. When one side of the particle was neutralized either by lowering the pH value to switch the negative charge of the Au NP o or by adding a counterion to cover the positive charge of the amine groups a large increase of the interfacial tension was discovered, even exceeding the interfacial tension of homogeneous SiO 2 NH 2 particles. As the oil/water interface is charged, shown by various publications, a removal of charges on the particles leads to a less stabilizing effect at the interface by attraction and repulsion so that a zwitterionic particle lowers the interfacial tension to a way larger extent. Particles designed by this method could be used as tunable emulsiers by just varying charge and patchiness. Content of the eighth chapter utilized the same method as described in chapter 6 but a more complex type of particle was aligned. Wrinkle substrate dimensions had to be adjusted for the alignment of SiOx@PNIPAAm-SH. As applicable wrinkle dimensions are not showing a signicant variation in amplitude and aligned particles show certain size distribution estimating a relation between immersion and plasma treatment time was rather difficult. On top of the surface of aligned particles again Au NP were deposited, this time using the thiol group for a covalent bond towards the gold. The removal of those particles could also be performed by ultrasonic treatment. Analysis of the resulting particles also showed no real relation between patchiness and plasma treatment time of the wrinkles. Nonetheless crosslinking experiments via thiol-ene click chemistry were performed for close particle alignments and indicated to be successful though still a proper method for string removal is lacking. Patchy particles achieved by this method could use the thermoresponsiveness of the PNIPAAm component on one side by heating the gold with a laser or in string form serve as actuators also addressable with an external stimulus...|$|R
