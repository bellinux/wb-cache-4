5|$|After two Kaqchikel {{messengers}} sent by Pedro de Alvarado {{were killed}} by the Tz'utujil, the conquistadors and their Kaqchikel allies marched against the Tz'utujil.

The survivors were pursued across a causeway to an island on foot before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon arrived and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety. The Spanish could not pursue them because 300 canoes <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kaqchikels had not yet arrived.
