5000|$|The {{business}} {{called the}} Oliver Chilled Plow Works {{was established by}} James Oliver in 1853. [...] James Oliver first settled in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a local foundry business. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Indiana. Plows with cast iron bottoms and moldboards had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States {{since the time of}} Thomas Jefferson. [...] However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not [...] "scour"; that is, the <b>sticky</b> <b>soil</b> would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in <b>sticky</b> <b>soil,</b> various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal plow bottom had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include rapid chilling of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms.|$|E

50|$|The Green Street Historic District, {{located on}} a half- mile stretch along the major western {{approach}} {{to the city of}} Marion, include twelve significant examples of Federal and Greek Revival style homes and an unusually early example of the Gothic Revival. In addition to being architecturally important, these structures are primary indicators of the lifestyles of the Black Belt planter class during the prosperous antebellum period. One of them, the Andrew Barry Moore House, is listed on the Historic American Buildings Survey. Interspersed among the pre-Civil War homes is a fine collection (9 structures) of early 20th century bungalows, as well as several modest recent structures. As a whole, the district depicts the ongoing attractiveness of Green Street as one of the city's most prestigious residential areas. Marion, the county seat of Perry County, is located in the fertile Black Belt Region of west central Alabama. Under the 1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson, the area was ceded to the federal government by the Creek Indians. Squatters and prospectors moved in until the land was put up for sale in 1817. A boom period began in the early 1830s, when farmers realized that the <b>sticky</b> <b>soil</b> was extraordinarily adaptable to the cultivation of cotton. Ultimately, production of that crop led the region to a position of economic importance in the antebellum years which it has never surpassed. Settled in 1817 and named the first permanent county seat in 1822, Marion soon emerged as the principal city of Perry County. With the influx of cotton planters to the area, the town's economy boomed from the late 1830s to the onset of the Civil War. Its location on a high, red clay rise provided a solid, dry ground for settlement which many planters preferred to the dampness and mud of the surrounding farmlands. Increasing educational, economic, and political opportunities attracted prominent men of many professions to the young community. Green Street, one of the city's earliest traffic arteries, was a popular building location during the pre-Civil War years, and 13 antebellum structures remain. The typical upper-middle class residence was a modest frame house with Greek Revival ornament and often a retention of Federal Period scaling. Homes such as the Italianate-detailed Magnolia Hill and the Gothic Revival Howze-Woodfin House were unusually elaborate for this area.|$|E

U dosadašnjim istraživanjima koja se provode već 13 godina, istraženo je 3. 200 m 2, od čega je istraženo 200 m 2 tijekom 2010. godine. Radovi su obuhvatili iskop zemljišta u nastavku na prošlogodišnju istraženu površinu u dijelu naselja koje se prostire jugozapadno od obredno ukopnog prostora, otkrivenog 1997. g. tijekom prve godine istraživanja Galova. Jugozapadno od zemunice 2012 otkrivena je i istražena u cijelosti jama 2010 koja je po svojem obliku i inventaru vrlo slična jamama 41 i 43 koje su bile ukopane jugozapadno od stambene zemunice 37 u sjeverozapadnom dijelu naselja. Po rubnom dijelu jame nađene su rupe od drvenih stupova koji su najvjerojatnije iznad jame držali nadstrešnicu. Gornji sloj u jami sastojao se od jako crne masne zemlje s rijetkim ulomcima keramike – dvije noge od zdjele na nozi, ručka većeg lonca i mala glinena figurica – stupasti idol na kojem se samo vidi istaknuti nos. Ulomci keramike kao i kameni artefakti nađeni u ovim jamama pripadaju početnom stupnju starčevačke kulture Linear A. In August 2010, the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb {{continued}} systematic archaeological excavations of {{an early}} Neolithic Starčevo culture settlement in the north-eastern part of Slavonski Brod on the Galovo plot, which belongs to the initial development phase – Linear A stage. In the excavations, which have already lasted 13 years, 3200 m 2 have been excavated, of which 200 m 2 were excavated in 2010. The works comprised {{the continuation of the}} dig of the plot excavated last year in the part of the settlement stretching to the south-west of the ritual burial space discovered in 1997, the first year of excavations at Galovo. South-west of pit-dwelling 2012, pit 2010 was discovered and completely excavated. Its form and inventory are very similar to pits 41 and 43, which were dug south-west of pit-dwelling 37 in the north-western part of the settlement. The horizontal projection of pit 2010 had an irregular round shape with diameters of 2. 50 m (N-S) and 1. 70 m (E-W), dug in sterile soil from the level of the settlement to a depth of 40 cm. On the north-eastern side, three steps were dug. The walls on the western, southern and eastern sides were vertical, and near the bottom a small elongated niche was dug 20 cm into the wall. On the margins of the pit, there were holes from wooden poles which probably bore the eaves above the pit. The upper part of the pit consisted of very black <b>sticky</b> <b>soil</b> with occasional pottery shards: two feet from a footed bowl, a handle of a larger pot and a small clay figurine (a pillared idol on which only the nose stands out). In {{the northern part of the}} pit, below a group of pottery items, there were several pieces of bone and charcoal. In the southern part of the pit, a number of stone artefacts were unearthed (microliths), parts of two footed bowls of fine structure, and part of a handled coarse-structured pot. Several pieces of burned earth (daub) of unknown purpose were also found. In the area north of pit 2010, the upper parts of pit dwelling 2012 were explored. In the upper layers of this large pit-dwelling, fragments of coarse pottery were found: pots variously decorated with appliqués, carved lines and fingerprints (the representation of a snake) along the edges. The handles found belong to this type of pot, as well as to parts of a belly with twin knobs suggesting that the pots used to hang on ropes. Among the coarse pottery, the bottom of a pot decorated with carved lines like a net stands out. The fine pottery includes footed bowls with traces of red paint visible on the surface. In these upper layers of the pit-dwelling, there were pieces of grindstones as well as stone artefacts: part of an axe with a hole in it, a small axe, various blades, bladelets, flakes and cores. The excavated structures and the moveable archaeological finds in them that were unearthed in 2010 belong, just as in past excavations, to the Linear A stage which, according to the current state of research, represents the initial development phase of the Starčevo culture on Croatian territory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Soil {{adheres to}} the {{surfaces}} of soil engaging components of various tools. The adhesion of soil increases the draft and adversely affects the quality of work. For example, up to 50 % of the gross energy required for tillage operations may be consumed by adhesion and friction between soil and tillage tools. Therefore, {{it is important to}} find out the ways to reduce adhesion of soil to {{the surfaces of}} various tools. Soil animals such as ground beetles stay in moist <b>sticky</b> <b>soils</b> for extended periods without soil sticking to their bodies. The soil adhesion preventing mechanisms of such animals can be used as guide for improving the scouring properties of various tools. Both the surface morphology and chemical composition of soil animal’s cuticle play important role in preventing adhesion of soil to their bodies. The surfaces of mouldboard ploughs and bulldozing plates were modified based on the surface morphology of ground beetle and tested in the laboratory. Two materials such as Steel- 45 and Ultra High Molecular Weight – Polyethylene (UHMW-PE) were used for convexes. The modified ploughs and plates have better scouring properties and required less draft than conventional tools. The size of convexes, their arrangement and the material of these convexes playe...|$|R

In the pursuit of a polished and thus slicker surface for a plough, he experimented with portions of saw blades and by 1837, he was making polished, cast steel ploughs. The energy effort required was lessened, which enabled the use of larger ploughs, making more effective use of horse power.|$|R

40|$|The {{adhesive}} {{action of}} clays confronted during tunnel drives in which slurry shields are implemented has a devastating {{impact on the}} advance rate. This report evaluates past experiences of the clogging action of cohesive soils (clays) and introduces detailed examinations of adhesion between cohesive soils and steel surfaces. This allows good definition of <b>sticky</b> <b>soils</b> and also gives {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms that cause stickiness. The conclusions drawn out of experiences gained from past tunnel drives have been based upon the analysis of soil parameters. These enable forecasts to be made to the potential clogging effect (stickness) of clays. Furthermore, typical clogging forms and areas are introduced as well as current countermeasures to prevent them. The concepts for the laboratory tests to measure adhesion are based on thorough research and evaluation of existing publications. These also give insight of the fundamentals of soil adheshion, the technical possibilities to measure them as well as the large number of influencing factors. Laboratory test samples have partly been taken from tunnel drives and cover a wide spectrum of different mineralogical compositions. Shear and tension tests are carried out in order to measure tangential and normal adhesion. All surfaces of the samples and testing equipment (steel) are moistened, prior to sample placement, to simulate the interaction between clays and shields on slurry drives. The moistening of the test samples and equipment is carried out with water as well as other fluids with additives. The results of the adhesion tests show a clear dependence on the moistening time and the duration of contact between soil and steel. Further dependencies are found on the consistency of the clay and the composition of the moistening fluid. Significant correlations can be found between the adhesion and the mineralogical composition of a clay as well as its plasticity. Theoretical evaluations indicate that adhesion is created by differing water/fluid pressures in the soil pores and the surrounding. Previous moistening causes a film of water/fluid to be trapped between the clay and the steel surfaces. The swelling action of the clay absorbs part of the water film which causes suction and makes the clay stick to the steel surface. This effect not only applies to the excavation chamber of slurry shields, but also to all other soil handling activities in which water is present. The report includes advice which contributes to a better assessment of the adhesion of clays during the preparations of future tunnel drives in which slurry shields are to be implemented. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Ploughing {{is one of}} {{the most}} power {{consuming}} and expensive processes in agricultural production. It is known that the draft resistance of ploughs, the energy requirement for ploughing, the quality of ploughing and expenses depend on the plough body design, which is determined by the share-mouldboard parameters and the parameters of its supporting surfaces, as well as on such soil properties as its hardness, density, friction and adhesion, values of which are depending on soil mechanical composition, structure and humidity. Studies are carried out to determine the impact of the soil humidity on the ploughing resistance of the main soil types: sandy soil, loam and clay soils. It was cleared up that humidity most of all impacts the soil hardness and cutting resistance which considerably dominates in the summary resistance of the plough body. Increase in the soil humidity leads to decrease in the ploughing resistance that is more remarkable on clay soils. The working speed of the plough influences also the ploughing resistance. The optimum humidity of <b>sticky</b> clay <b>soils</b> when ploughing at the speed 2 … 2. 5 m s- 1 is 18 … 22 %.

5000|$|The mature female lays {{variable}} {{batches of}} eggs, usually in damp soil or litter. Oviposition is slow; {{she takes a}} few minutes to lay each egg. The eggs are very difficult to find in the field because they are covered by <b>sticky</b> excreta containing <b>soil</b> that the female had swallowed. The eggs are spherical, pale yellow, and only {{about a quarter of a}} millimetre in diameter. Their resistance to both drought and cold has enabled the species to survive introduction from cool, moist conditions of Northern Europe, to Australasia and Southern Africa. In conditions of drought they simply enter a state of aestivation in the form of diapause in which embryonic development is delayed. The delay lasts till a period of soaking rain sets in or until irrigation begins. During a period of active breeding when there is plenty of moisture, the hatching period is variable; under favourable conditions most eggs hatch in perhaps two weeks, but some take three weeks or more, while eggs that have aestivated hatch at various intervals over period of about a week to a month or more after wet conditions return. When rain is delayed in spring a bank of partly developed eggs in the soil may accumulate, leading to something of an explosion of emergence after good rain.|$|R
