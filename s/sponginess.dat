6000|$|It {{would seem}} the Selenites {{who had come}} upon him carried him to {{some point in the}} {{interior}} down [...] "a great shaft" [...] by means of what he describes as [...] "a sort of balloon." [...] We gather from the rather confused passage in which he describes this, and from a number of chance allusions and hints in other and subsequent messages, that this [...] "great shaft" [...] is one of an enormous system of artificial shafts that run, each from what is called a lunar [...] "crater," [...] downwards for very nearly a hundred miles towards the central portion of our satellite. These shafts communicate by transverse tunnels, they throw out abysmal caverns and expand into great globular places; the whole of the moon's substance for a hundred miles inward, indeed, is a mere sponge of rock. [...] "Partly," [...] says Cavor, [...] "this <b>sponginess</b> is natural, but very largely it is due to the enormous industry of the Selenites in the past. The enormous circular mounds of the excavated rock and earth it is that form these great circles about the tunnels known to earthly astronomers (misled by a false analogy) as volcanoes." ...|$|E

Toughness and malleability appear to be the qualities whose expression is most aimed at; sometimes <b>sponginess,</b> softness, flexibility, tenuity, and occasionally transparency. Take, for instance, the foreground of Salvator, in No. 220 of the Dulwich Gallery. There is, on the right-hand side of it, an object, which I never walk through the room without contemplating {{for a minute or two}} with renewed solicitude and anxiety of mind, indulging in a series of very wild and imaginative conjectures as to its probable or possible meaning. I think there is reason to suppose that the artist intended it either for a very large stone, or for the trunk of a tree; but any decision as to its being either one or the other of these must, I conceive, be the extreme of rashness. It melts into the ground on one side, and might reasonably be conjectured to form a part of it, having no trace of woody structure or color; but on the other side it presents a series of concave curves, interrupted by cogs like those of a water-wheel, which the boldest theorist would certainly not feel himself warranted in supposing symbolical of rock. The forms which this substance, whatever it be, assumes, will be found repeated, though in a less degree, in the foreground of No. 159, where they are evidently meant for rock.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} {{ordinary}} fountains is simple enough, and affords help in discovering them. In a few words, {{it is as}} follows:--All the water that runs from them has originally Been supplied by rain, dew, or fog-damp, falling {{on the face of}} the land and sinking into it. But the subsoil and rocks below, are far from being of a uniform character: they are full of layers of every imaginable degree of <b>sponginess.</b> Strata of clay wholly impenetrable by water, often divide beds of gravel that imbibe it freely. There are also cracks that make continuous channels and dislocations that cause them to end abruptly; and there are rents, filled with various materials, that may either give a free passage or entirely bar the underground course of water. Hence, when water has sunk into the earth, it does not by any means soak through it in an equable degree. It is an easier matter for it to ooze many miles, along a layer of gravel, than to penetrate six inches into a layer of clay that may bound the gravel. Therefore, whenever a porous earth or a fissured rock crops out to the light of day, there is, in ignorance of all other facts, some chance of a spring being discovered in the lowest part of the outcrop. A favourable condition for the existence of a large and permanent fountain, is where a porous stratum spreads over a broad area at a high level, and is prolonged, by a gradually narrowing course, to an outlet at a lower one. The broad upper part of the stratum catches plenty of water during the wet season, which sinks into the depths as into a reservoir, and oozes out in a regular stream at its lower outlet. A fissured rock makes a still easier channel for the water.|$|E

Up to now the degree of <b>sponginess</b> has been determined by visually comparing the transversely cut tuber {{with a series of}} photographs of spongy tubers. This method is subjective, destructive and time-consuming. Therefore, an objective, non-destructive and rapid method is desired to determine the degree of <b>sponginess.</b> In this preliminary study some of these methods were tested, including (1) measurement of specific gravity, (2) X-ray analysis and (3) near infrared spectroscopy.

Amoxicillin is the first choice antibiotic, especially amoxicillin. Alternative antibiotic for use in penicillin-allergic patient is erythromycin.

Metronidazole is useful only against anaerobic bacteria, and should be reserved for situations in which only anaerobic bacteria are suspected. Contrary to healthy children, factors related to host risk: systemic illness, malnutrition and immunosuppressed patients must be evaluated when determining the risk for infection, and need antibiotics even if infection is only suspected. In light of the growing problem of drug resistance, the clinician should consider altering or discontinuing antibiotics following determination of either ineffectiveness or cure prior to completion of a full course of therapy.

Product texture is considered an important quality index by kpejigaou consumers. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimum processing conditions of kpejigaou with respect to its textural properties. The study followed a 2 3 design with two processing variables each at three levels as follows: griddling temperature (130, 200, 270 C) and time (5, 7. 5 and 10 min). Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) was done on freshly processed samples. The data were fitted into multiple regression models from which the optimum griddling conditions for kpejigaou were determined. Kpejigaou processed at the optimum condi-tions was evaluated by untrained consumers for acceptability. Traditionally processed kpejigaou served as the control. The TPA results showed that hardness, chewiness and modulus of deformability were signif-icantly affected by griddling conditions. Adjusted R 2 for the models for hardness, chewiness and modulus of deformability were 96 %, 97 % and 78 %, respectively.

Moreover, {{there is the possibility}} to incorporate an additional value using novel replacers. In this work, inulin and oligofructose were used as fat and sugar replacers, respectively. Different combinations of replacement levels were investigated: fat replacement (0 and 50 %) and sugar replacement (0, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %). Simulated microbaking was carried out to study bubble size distribution during baking. Batter viscosity and weight loss during baking were also analysed. Cake characteristics were studied in terms of cell crumb structure, height, texture and sensory properties. Fat and sugar replacement gave place to batters with low apparent viscosity values. During heating, bubbles underwent a marked expansion in replaced cakes if compared to the control cake. The low batter stability in fat-replaced samples increased bubble movement, giving place to cakes with bigger cells and less height than the control. Sugar-replaced samples had smaller and fewer cells and lower height than the control. Moreover, sugar replacement decreased hardness and cohesiveness and in- creased springiness, which could be related with a denser crumb and an easily crumbled product. Regarding the sensory analysis, a replacement up to 50 % of fat and 30 % of sugar, separately and simultaneously, did not change remarkably the overall acceptability of the cakes. However, the <b>sponginess</b> and the sweetness could be improved in all the replaced cakes, according to the Just About Right scales...|$|E

In this paper we analyse in greater detail the pathogenetic mechanisms by which the spongy and cystic lesions are formed and the response of astrocytic cells. For this purpose, tracer (Evans blue) -stained brain lesions were examined in 8 -month-old SHRSP immunohistochemically and electron microscopically. <b>Sponginess</b> of the neuropil in small lesions and at the periphery of larger lesions was due to swollen neuronal and astrocytic cell processes, i. e. at this stage the oedema was mainly intracellular.

In the white matter small slit-formed cysts along the fibre tracts were also formed by the expansion of ECS. In apparently recent lesions astrocytes displayed cyto-plasmic oedema but otherwise were still fairly normal. In more chronic lesions increased numbers of enlarged astrocytes with prominent staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein were present.

A mechanosensory system of bone and bone fluid are strongly interconnected. A mechanical stress plays {{a vital role in}} supplying the bone fluid. A mechanical strain supports the bone deformation process, which in turn produces the fluid flow [20, 30]. Bone cells also get affected through such a mechanism of mechanical strain; it helps in maintaining the bone remodeling process. Many bone diseases like osteoporosis have been examined by applying a continuous mechanical stress; such a stress gave anabolic effects on bone formation, whereas catabolic affects bone resorption [8]. A disparity among RANKL/OPG signaling equipoise gives rise to several bone pathological processes, mostly associated with ageing, called osteopenia, and with more extremity, osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a bone-related disorder regarded as skeletal infirmity with low bone mineral density (BMD), which subsequently causes recurrent microharms and impulsive cracks; it is a persistent syndrome demanding long-term cure. Middle-aged women and elderly people are the prime targets of osteoporosis, and currently its influence is intensely rising socially and economically; WHO has declared it as the second foremost healthcare issue. In a regular bone remodeling process, RANKL/OPG is prudently balanced; the rise in RANKL plays a vital part in supporting resorption via osteoclast development, activities, and persistence. As the human body gets older, the density of the osteons expands, and the cortical <b>sponginess</b> and architectural damages of bone also rise due to the execution {{of a large number of}} remodeling cycles. This scenario initiates a vicious cycle where microharms occur often, consequently weakening bone configuration and increasing proportion of impulsive fractures [31]. Furthermore, latest analyses on bone remodeling propose that plasma levels OPG and RANKL are contrariwise linked to BMD and take part in the growth of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [9].|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebrovascular}} lesions {{of severe}} chronic hypertension were studied by light microscopy in perfusion-fixed, subserially sectioned brains from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The leakage and spread of plasma proteins were visualized by immunohistochemical detection of extravasated fibrinogen and {{by using an}} exogenous marker (Evans blue injected i. v.) for blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. In most SHRSP the hypertension {{did not lead to}} major BBB lesions in spite of a mean arterial pressure around 200 mm Hg at 6 - 9 months of age. Multifocal BBB damage occurred in a minor group of SHRSP, particularly within the cortex and the deep gray matter. A close spatial correlation was found between the leakage-spread of plasma constituents and the neuropathologic alterations. Fibrinoid degeneration of penetrating arterioles was found within the leakage sites. The surrounding gray matter showed petechial hemorrhages and abundant proteinaceous exudates rich in antifibrinogen-positive material. The current leakage of Evans blue and wide spread of fibrinoid substances suggested long-lasting damage to the BBB. Most neurons within the edematous gray matter had well preserved nuclei surrounded by a rim of cytoplasm with ill-defined outline as if vacuolation or lysis of the peripheral cytoplasm had occurred. The <b>sponginess</b> of the tissue progressed in severe cases to formation of necrotic cysts. Condensed acidophilic neurons were seen in the border zone between the edematous and more compact gray matter. The appearance and distribution of the gray matter lesions deviated in many respects from those commonly seen in regional ischemic infarcts. The fibrin thrombi found close to the cysts might be regarded as secondary events. The extensive spread of antifibrinogen-positive material within the white matter seemed to originate mainly from the chronic leakage sites in the gray matter. Increased number of large astrocytes were seen within the leakage sites and along the spreading pathways for the edema constituents. The white matter showed a rarefied texture with widely dispersed nerve fiber tracts, volume expansion, and occasional cyst formation. The results indicate a crucial pathophysiologic role for the egress, spread, and accumulation of vasogenic edema {{in the development of the}} cerebrovascular lesions in SHRSP...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of food {{factory in the}} future essentially consists of three major aspects: control of contaminations, reduction of environmental impact, and optimization of production processes. In this regard, conventional vis/NIR spectroscopy has been adopted by the industry {{as a means for}} on-line/off-line non-destructive sensing of food quality or process control and proven to be a valuable approach for these aspects. This technique tackles these issues by allowing non-destructive quality assessment of individual products in batches or on production lines; which, to some extent, helps to reduce wastes or contaminants by destructive quality tests. It also provides a means for optimizing production processes by real time monitoring of production lines. In research point of view, the conventional vis/NIR spectroscopy which bases on quantifying the absorption of targeted components in the post-interacting lights at a single point to predict their concentrations in the analyzed samples reveals some downsides. Typically, the acquired post-interacting lights are the results of both intertwined phenomena: scattering, related to refractive index differences causing changes in direction of the propagating lights and thus microstructure, and absorption, related to chemical composition. Due to scattering effects, light propagation path lengths change; which consequently induces over-estimation of the absorption levels in samples having the same composition but different microstructures. Scattering has been, therefore, considered as ‘noise’ in vis/NIR spectroscopic data analysis and needs to be removed or reduced for improved prediction performance. However, in food quality point of view, besides chemical composition, scattering also contains information about food microstructure which is also related to many important quality attributes such as <b>sponginess</b> of bread, crispiness or crunchiness of crackers, firmness of fruits, etc. This research, therefore, aims at investigating the potential of spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS) for acquiring both chemical composition and microstructure of food. By combining multiple conventional vis/NIR spectroscopic measurements at different source-detector distances (spatially resolved), scattering and absorption properties of the samples can be separated with light propagation models. A setup for SRS was elaborated by combining a fiber-optics probe with a spectrograph-camera combination for measurement in the 400 - 1000 nm range. The probe consists of seven optical fibers: one serves as illumination fiber and the others serve as detection fibers to collect diffuse reflected light at different source-detector distances ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 2 mm. This probe has been used to characterize sugar foams, having the same chemical composition, prepared under different processing conditions (foaming times) to create different air bubble size distributions in them. These different microstructures were expected to produce different scattering properties of light thanks to the mismatch in refractive indices at the bubble interfaces. Preliminary results have shown significantly different reduced scattering coefficients in the range 400 - 1000 nm of 3 sugar foams prepared with foaming times of 1, 5, and 10 minutes; which indicated that different bubble size distributions in these foams, or different microstructures, have been successfully differentiated non-destructively by SRS technique. status: publishe...|$|E
