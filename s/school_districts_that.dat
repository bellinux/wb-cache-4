25|$|In 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education {{decision}} by the U.S. Supreme Court forced the then segregated schools of New Castle County to desegregate. However, the subsequent eleven <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>that</b> were created in the county, including the Wilmington School District, soon became de facto segregated, as the Wilmington School District became predominately black, and the districts outside the city remained overwhelmingly white. In response, the 1976 U.S. District Court decision Evans v. Buchanan implemented a plan by which students in Wilmington would be bused to attend school in the suburbs for certain grades, while suburban students would be bused into the City of Wilmington for other grades. By 1981, the four current districts in northern New Castle County, Brandywine, Christina, Colonial, and Red Clay, each composed of city and suburban areas, were established.
