50|$|In 1930, seed {{companies}} were not {{primarily concerned with}} varietal production, but were still trying to successfully commodify seeds. There {{was no need to}} protect <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> at that time because there were few markets for seeds. Seed companies first priority was simply to establish a market, and they continued to view the congressional distribution as a principal constraint.|$|E

40|$|This article studies optimal patents {{with respect}} to the timing of {{innovation}} disclosure. In a simple model, we identify forces that lead firms to either suboptimally patent too early or too late in equilibrium, and we determine conditions so that stronger patents induce earlier or later equilibrium disclosure. Then, by solving an infinite multistage patent game with a more explicit structure, we describe innovation growth, and derive detailed predictions {{that can be used for}} policy experiments. As an application, we calibrate our multistage game using summary statistics from the <b>seeds</b> <b>breeding</b> industry. We find that weaker patent rights may result in welfare gains of 46 % relative to the status quo. The gains are achieved because weaker patents reduce competition, thus leading firms to postpone patenting...|$|R
40|$|Kinnow {{mandarin}} is {{the major}} citrus cultivar of Pakistan. It is highly adapted to our soil and climatic conditions. A major drawback in Kinnow is its high number of <b>seeds.</b> <b>Breeding</b> for seedlessness of Kinnow has been the primary objective of these investigations. Natural and conscious ploidy manipulations have {{played a significant role}} in the domestication and improvement of crops. Production of seedless triploid citrus fruits could lead to the improvement of internal quality of fresh fruits. Many triploid citrus varieties have been developed and released by breeders elsewhere. Kinnow being the major cultivar in Pakistan, has been focused in this study. Methods for production of triploids were investigated. Diploid Kinnow mandarin, Succari sweet orange and Sweet lime were crossed reciprocally with tetraploid Kinnow. Low fruit set, fruit drop and underdeveloped <b>seeds</b> hampered the <b>breeding</b> program. Immature and mature embryo culture methods were employed to achieve maximum recovery of hybrids. Embryos were excised from seeds at 3 and 7 months after pollination and cultured in vitro. Different media formulations based on Murashige and Skoog (MS), and Murashige and Tucker (MT) salts were used. MS supplemented with adenine sulphate (20 mg/l) and malt extract (500 mg/l) proved successful for embryo germination. Embryo proliferation was observed from 2. 25...|$|R

This {{is an opportunity for}} soybean <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> at Subak Kusamba to supply soybean seed, especially for Klungkung regency. The research objective in this study is to determine income generated from soybean seed farming received by farmers and the constraints faced in farming. This study was conducted at Subak Kusamba, Dawan sub district, Klungkung. Samples were selected from all 25 farmers participated in the farming of soybean seed. Methodology in this study includes descriptive qualitative, farming analysis and Revenue/Cost (R/C) ratio. Results showed that the income received by farmers was Rp 2, 191, 885. 84 for an average of 34, 08 are of land for one growing season. The R/C ratio was 3. 07, implying that soybean seed farming is beneficial. Constraints faced by farmers were decreased rainfall in 2014 which affected the activity and productivity of soybean. Due to the lack of water availability, it is suggested to develop water reservation, especially during dry season by developing water tanks or other irrigation systems technology. To reduce variable costs, it can be done through the use of organic fertilizer or compost, superior seeds and soybean harvesting machines.
