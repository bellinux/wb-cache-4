His death caused an immediate sensation in the Argentine media, with speculation about a possible murder conspiracy. After a short trial, the driver of the other vehicle was found not guilty; the judge considered Bueno to have been responsible for driving imprudently.|$|E

40|$|Rationale/statement of {{the problem}} : Associations between <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> in {{everyday}} life and controlled laboratory conditions remain a controversial topic. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare psychological and physiological <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> assessed in a real-life setting with laboratory <b>stress</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods : Thirty-five healthy male students (age M&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 24. 4, SD&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 6 years) took part in the study. The first part of the study consisted of a 2 -day period within which subjects collected saliva and rated their <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> on a visual analogue scale immediately after awakening, 30 min later, at 9 am, and then every 2 hours for a total of nine times a day while maintaining their regular daily activities. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was assessed as a marker for autonomic nervous system activity at each time point. In the second part, subjects were invited to two laboratory sessions on two separate days, with randomized exposure to either a standardized stress test (cold pressor test (CPT), stress condition) or a rest condition (reading magazines). Again, sAA and subjective stress were assessed repeatedly during both conditions. Results : During both days, sAA levels showed a distinct diurnal rhythm, with a trough in the morning and a steady increase over the course of the day (time effect, p&# 60; 0. 001). Self-reported <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> significantly fluctuated over the course of the 2 days (time effect, p= 0. 022). In the laboratory part, the CPT resulted in significant increases in sAA and in self-reported <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> (time effect, p= 0. 004; interaction effect, p= 0. 001). Regression analyses revealed that overall sAA levels in everyday life predicted sAA levels in both laboratory conditions (p&#x 200 A;&# 60;&#x 200 A; 0. 01). The same held true for subjective <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> (p&# 60; 0. 001). It was also found that overall subjective <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> in everyday life predicted the psychological laboratory stress response (p= 0. 024). Furthermore, a trend was found for the sAA awakening response predicting overall sAA in the stress condition (p= 0. 067). Conclusions : <b>Stress</b> <b>levels</b> in everyday life were shown to predict psychological as well as physiological <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> in the laboratory. Furthermore, subjects with high <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> in everyday life experienced a more pronounced psychological stress response to a laboratory stressor...|$|R

25|$|Both ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} with the former being predominantly used. Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS <b>stress</b> <b>level,</b> either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold, may induce cell death. On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do. Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells {{can be used to}} achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there exists}} a {{hierarchy}} of <b>stress</b> <b>level</b> in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels. This can easily be understood by considering {{the direction of the}} greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' {{in the direction of the}} least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.|$|E

[...] Hall's team began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of both accidents, and initiated further research into measurable strain on the aircraft's skin. With the recovery of large sections of G-ALYP from the Elba crash and BOAC's donation of an identical airframe, G-ALYU, for further examination, an extensive [...] "water torture" [...] test eventually provided conclusive results. This time, the entire fuselage was tested in a dedicated water tank that was built specifically at Farnborough to accommodate its full length. Stress around the window corners was found to be much higher than expected and stresses on the skin were generally more than previously expected or tested. The windows' square shape caused stress concentration by generating levels of stress two or three times greater than across the rest of the fuselage.

The effect of time varying mesh stiffness, time varying frictional torque on the gear teeth, lateral and torsional flexibility of the shafts and flexibility of the bearings {{were included in the}} model. The model was developed by using the Lagrangian method, and it was applied to study the effect of three design variables on the vibration and <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> on the gears. The first design variable, module, had little effect on the vibration levels but a higher module resulted to higher bending <b>stress</b> <b>levels.</b> The second design variable, pressure angle, had little effect on the vibration levels, but had a strong effect on the <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> on the pinion of a high reduction ratio gear pair. A pressure angle of 25 o resulted to lower <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> for a pinion with 14 teeth than a pressure angle of 20 o. The third design variable, contact ratio, had a very strong effect on both the vibration <b>levels</b> and bending <b>stress</b> <b>levels.</b> Increasing the contact ratio to 2. 0 reduced both the vibration <b>levels</b> and bending <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> significantly. For the gear train design used in this study, a module of 2. 5 and contact ratio of 2. 0 for the various meshes was found to yield the best combination of low vibration levels and low bending stresses.
