50|$|In his 1997 report, Peter Bell {{indicated}} that approximately {{three-quarters of the}} timber <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> the underground hospital was missing. He also said that {{a portion of the}} remaining timber was suffering from termite damage and dry rot. Unfortunately the dry rot damage has accelerated since the 1997 fire because of the amount of water and foam pumped into the structure during the fire.|$|E
50|$|During excavation, shoring systems provide {{safety for}} {{workers in a}} trench and speeds up excavation. In this case, shoring should not be {{confused}} with shielding. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse where shielding is only designed to protect workers when collapses occur.Concrete structures <b>shoring,</b> <b>in</b> this case also referred to as falsework, provides temporary support until the concrete becomes hard and achieves the desired strength to support loads.|$|E

50|$|A box crib or {{cribbing}} is {{a temporary}} wooden structure used to support heavy objects during construction, relocation, vehicle extrication and urban search and rescue. It is commonly used to secure overturned motor vehicles, and debris within collapsed buildings. Cribbing is often {{used in conjunction with}} other stabilization equipment, such as pneumatic or hydraulic shoring. Cribbing is also used in sub-surface mining as a roof support. Cribbing has largely been replaced by hydraulic <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> modern mining applications.|$|E
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{furnishings}} and medical equipment. There {{is no evidence of}} the operating theatre equipment, beds, cupboards and other moveable equipment. Some material remaining prior to the fire included benching along the eastern wall, timber shelving, light fittings and timber <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> the north tunnel. There was also a considerable amount of post war material such as files, X-ray plates and medical equipment such as an autoclave. It is believed that the files and X-ray plates fuelled the 1997 fire.|$|E
50|$|Shoring is used {{on board}} when damage has been caused to a vessel's integrity, and to hold leak-stopping devices in place to reduce or stop {{incoming}} water. Generally consists of timber 100 mm x 100 mm and {{used in conjunction with}} wedges, to further jam <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> place, pad pieces to spread the load and dogs to secure it together. also used on board is mechanical shoring as a quick, temporary solution, however it isn't favoured due to its inability to move with the vessel.|$|E

Lake Township existed until 2009, when residents of the village of Grosse Pointe Shores (that portion of Grosse Pointe <b>Shores</b> <b>in</b> Macomb County located within Lake Township) voted to incorporate as a city.|$|R

50|$|The creek {{was named}} in the 1870s after early {{prospector}} and settler Oliver Furry. Loggers worked the slopes, and a two adits from the Britannia Creek mine opened into Furry Creek where logging camp supplied timbers for min <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> the early 1900s. Dams on Phyllis and Marion Lake and Furry Creek redirected water from Furry Creek to the Britannia mine for power generation. Later in the century a gravel pit operated in the area. Cabins and borstal at nearby Porteau Cove made the area sparsely populated for many years, with some camping and little other activity except for the highway and railroad that cut through {{the bottom of the}} watershed.|$|E
40|$|Archaeology shares {{some common}} safety {{concerns}} with other trenching operations such as grave digging and pipe laying. Foremost amongst {{these are the}} dangers of work-ing in unshored or inadequately shored excavations. It is not uncommon far archaeological excavations {{to be more than}} 1. 5 m deep and deep shafts 4 - 6 m deep have occa-sionally been dug (e. g. at Devils Lair, Koonalda Cave, Malakunanja 11 and Mushroom Rock). Shoring has been used in some cases. For instance, Jones used it in his excavations at Rocky Cape in 1 % 5 - 67 (R. Jones pers. comm.), at Nauwalabila 1 in 1981 (Jones and Johnson 1985) and most recently at Allens Cave (R. Jones and S. Cane p m. comm.). Dortch installed an internal scaf-folding of pipe-work and heavy duty timber <b>shoring</b> <b>in</b> the deep trench at Devils Lair (Dortch 1984). Sim used a series of nested prefabricated boxes in her excavations on King Island (Sim and Thorne 1990) and Horton and Wright used timber soldier sets in trenches at Trinkey (Wright pers. comm.). These however are the exceptions and it is still all too rare for shoring to be used on prehis-toric sites. The usual practice is to install some form of shoring only when deposits are demonstrably loose and unconsolidated or where slumping or fretting of the sec-tions is actively taking p k e. In cases where shoring has been used there is also some question as to whether it has been adequately engineered for the lateral stresses that would be imposed should the trench fail catastrophically. Many of us are reluctant to shore because it is seen as time-consuming, expensive and it interferes with access to the faces of an excavation. This is exacerbated by the fact that most Australian-trained field archaeologists lack dir-ect experience in the proper installation of shoring and that the industrial shoring equipment available for hire (e. g. acrow props, drag boxes, steel sheet pilings and trench linings) is clearly not suitable for most archaeologi-cal applications. However, excavating in deep unshored trenches is a form of 'Russian roulette ' in which we stake our lives on a rather casual assessment that the trench walls will continue to be self-supporting. Sooner or later a trench wall will fail and without the safety margin p m vided by shoring, someone will be killed (cf. Haywar...|$|E
