25|$|Geographic tongue {{could be}} {{considered}} to be a type of glossitis. It usually presents only on the dorsal 2/3 and lateral surfaces of the tongue, but less commonly an identical condition can occur on other mucosal sites in the mouth, such as the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, mucosa of the cheeks or lips, soft palate or floor of mouth; usually in addition to tongue involvement. In such cases, terms such as stomatitis erythema migrans, ectopic geographic tongue, <b>areata</b> <b>migrans,</b> geographic <b>stomatitis,</b> or migratory stomatitis are used instead of geographic tongue. Beside the differences in locations of presentation inside the oral cavity and prevalence among the general population, in all other aspects of clinical significance, symptoms, treatment, and histopathologic appearance, these two forms are identical.|$|R
