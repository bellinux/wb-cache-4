These collections have been substantially augmented by the field activities of museum personnel and donations made over the last 20 years. Eastern Atlantic collections from the Gulf of Guinea are available in some abundance. The western Atlantic collections acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Pascagoula laboratory and University of Miami are generally from greater depths and represent some of the museum's most valuable resources. Deepwater anguilliform, salmoniform, stomiiform, aulopiform, myctophiform, and ophidiiform families are particularly well represented. For certain families, i.e. searsiidae, alepocephalidae, these collections may be among the best North American holdings from the western Atlantic region.|$|E

50|$|Over 700 {{species are}} in the 11 {{families}}. The largest families are Bothidae, Cynoglossidae, Paralichthyidae, Pleuronectidae, and <b>Soleidae,</b> with more than 100 species each (the remaining families have less than 50 species each). Some families are the results of relatively recent splits. For example, the Achiridae were classified as a subfamily of <b>Soleidae</b> in the past, and the Samaridae were considered a subfamily of the Pleuronectidae. The Pleuronectidae may be split further still, as some authorities elevate Paralichthodinae, Poecilopsettinae, and Rhombosoleinae to families instead of subfamilies.|$|E
50|$|Wedge soles are a {{flatfish}} {{having a}} maximum size of 30 cm. Several characteristics permit their distinction from other <b>Soleidae,</b> notably the juveniles {{of other species}} with which it is sometimes confused.|$|E

50|$|The {{wedge sole}} (Dicologlossa cuneata), is a {{flatfish}} of the <b>Soleidae</b> family. It is a bottom dwelling predatory fish inhabiting both sandy and muddy soils at depths between 10 and 450 m in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It achieves a maximum size of 30 cm.|$|E
50|$|The American soles are {{a family}} (Achiridae) of {{flatfish}} occurring in both freshwater and marine environments of the Americas. The family includes about 35 species in seven genera. These {{are closely related}} to the soles (<b>Soleidae),</b> and have been classified as a subfamily of it, but achirids have a number of distinct characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The blackhand sole (Pegusa nasuta) is a {{fish species}} in the <b>Soleidae</b> family, common in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Azov. It was {{considered}} a subspecies of the sand sole in past, as Pegusa lascaris nasuta. Therefore, it is sometimes mistakenly mentioned for the Black Sea fauna as Pegusa lascaris. Marine subtropical demersal fish, up to 17 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The {{solenette}} {{or yellow}} sole, Buglossidium luteum, is {{a species of}} flatfish in the family <b>Soleidae,</b> and {{the only member of}} its genus. It is characterized by its small size, low-slung semi-circular mouth, and regularly placed dark fin rays. A common and widespread species, it is native to sandy bottoms in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is of little commercial value.|$|E
50|$|Sole is a fish {{belonging}} to several families. Generally speaking, they {{are members of}} the family <b>Soleidae,</b> but, outside Europe, the name sole is also applied to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the flounder family. In European cookery, there are several species which may be considered true soles, but the common or Dover sole Solea solea, often simply called the sole, is the most esteemed and most widely available.|$|E
50|$|Solea aegyptiaca, the Egyptian sole, is {{a species}} of {{flatfish}} in the true sole family, <b>Soleidae.</b> It lives on the sandy or muddy seabed of the Mediterranean Sea, and is now colonising the Red Sea. It often semi-immerses itself in the substrate. The upper side is greyish-brown while the underside is white. It grows to a maximum length of about 70 cm. This fish is used for human consumption and is prized as a food fish. It is caught mostly by trawling on the seabed.|$|E
50|$|The {{sand sole}} (Pegusa lascaris) is a fish {{species in the}} <b>Soleidae</b> family. Widespread in the {{north-eastern}} and south-eastern Atlantic, to the Gulf of Guinea in the south, also in the Mediterranean Sea. Recorded in the Suez Canal. Sometimes, it is mentioned for the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, but mistakly because it is inhabited by another species, Blackhand sole, which was considered as subspecies P. l. nasuta (now as a different species). It is a marine, subtropical, demersal fish, up to 40 cm long.|$|E
5000|$|The common sole, Dover sole, {{or black}} sole (Solea solea) is {{a species of}} {{flatfish}} in the <b>Soleidae</b> family. It is a flatfish living on the sandy or muddy seabed of the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea where it often semi-immerses itself in the substrate. The upper side is greyish-brown while the underside is white. It grows to a maximum length of about 70 cm. This fish is used for human consumption and is prized as a food fish. It is caught mostly by trawling on the seabed.|$|E
50|$|Its body is more {{elongated}} {{than most}} other species of the <b>Soleidae</b> genus, with scales that detach more easily than the common sole. The upper face is a chocolate brown and carries characteristic blueish marks. On this side, the pectoral fin has a black mark which doesn't extend to the end, contrary to other soles. This fin has a marked triangular shape. The angular snout covers {{a little of the}} lower jaw. Another feature is that the lateral line is formed of between 105 and 132 tubular scales, compared to between 116 and 163 for the common sole. Additionally, this line showed a marked curve towards the head in the supratemporal area, while it is more gently curved in solea solea.|$|E
5000|$|Flatfishes {{are found}} in oceans worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through the tropics, to Antarctica. Most species {{are found in}} depths between 0 and 500 m, but a few have been {{recorded}} from depths in excess of 1500 m. None have been confirmed from the abyssal or hadal zones. An observation of a flatfish from the Bathyscaphe Trieste {{at the bottom of}} the Mariana Trench at a depth of almost 11 km has been questioned by fish experts, and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid. Among the deepwater species, Symphurus thermophilus lives in congregating around [...] "ponds" [...] of sulphur at hydrothermal vents on the seafloor. No other flatfish is known from hydrothermal vents. Many species will enter brackish or fresh water, and a smaller number of soles (families Achiridae and <b>Soleidae)</b> and tonguefish (Cynoglossidae) are entirely restricted to fresh water.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soleidae</b> were studied. A {{division}} {{could be}} made into fish-feeders, Crustacea feeders and polychaeta-mollusca feeders. This division is based on experiments in which the behaviour of the fish was studied in relation to different sensory factors (olfaction and vision) and was confirmed by morphological study of the digestive tract and gill rakers. As a rule the Bothidae are fish feeders, the Pleuronectidae Crustacea feeders, and the <b>Soleidae</b> poly-chaeta-mollusca feeders. However exceptions occur, especially in the Pleuronectidae...|$|E
40|$|Overlapping {{external}} morphometric characters easily confound the flatfishes Solea aegyptiaca and Solea solea (<b>Soleidae)</b> {{in areas}} of the Mediterranean Sea where both species live in sympatry. This leads to uncertainties in the fisheries and marketing of the species, in addition to misinterpretations in biogeography and conservation studies. This paper describes a simple restriction fragment length-based diagnostic test that differentiates S. solea from S. aegyptiaca, as well as from other species of the <b>Soleidae</b> family.
