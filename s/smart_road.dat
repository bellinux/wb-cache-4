500|$|Wilde did {{not meet}} Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, {{published}} during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in De Profundis, Wilde called Pater's Studies... "that book that has had such a strange influence over my life". He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was John Ruskin who gave him a purpose for it. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing {{that the importance of}} art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence, he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a <b>smart</b> <b>road</b> neatly edged with flowers.|$|E

5000|$|The Virginia <b>Smart</b> <b>Road,</b> {{also known}} as simply the <b>Smart</b> <b>Road</b> or Smart Highway, is a short, limited access road in Montgomery County, Virginia, used for the testing of {{pavement}} technologies and as a proving ground for new transportation technologies.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{operation}} of most currently envisioned Intelligent Vehicle-Roadway System (IVRS) projects are advanced systems for surveillance, control and management of integrated freeway and arterial networks. A major concern {{in the development of}} such <b>Smart</b> <b>Roads,</b> and the focus of this paper, is the provision of decision support for traffic management center personnel, particularly for addressing nonrecurring congestion in large or complex networks. Decision support for control room staff is necessary to effectively detect, verify and develop response strategies for traffic incidents. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest a novel artificial intelligence-based solution approach to the problem of providing operator decision support in integrated freeway and arterial traffic management systems, as part of a more general IVRS. A conceptual design is presented that is based on multiple real-time knowledge-based expert systems (KBES) integrated by a distributed blackboard problem-solving architecture. The paper expands on the notions of artificial intelligence and <b>Smart</b> <b>Roads,</b> and in particular the role, characteristics and requirements of KBES for real-time decision support. The overall concept of a decision support architecture is discussed and the blackboard approach is defined.

50|$|The system {{developed}} by Cognitive Technologies {{does not require}} building smart cities and <b>smart</b> <b>roads</b> equipped with multiple sensors - it works the opposite way, {{trying to understand the}} situation on the road like humans do. The system uses a video camera like a driver who uses his eyes, analyzing the information and focusing on the relevant data. For this purpose the system uses a special type of computer vision - foveal computer vision. Only 5-7% of the data gathered by the video cameras and sensors is processed by the system as relevant. The prototype is being tested in Russia on rough roads, on roads without marking, with the goal to prepare the system for work in difficult situations and on bad roads all around the world.|$|R

After leaving Kahlotus as the Lind-Kahlotus Road, the highway turns northeast and later west as it passes over the Sand Hills Coulee four times. Curving due north, the roadway leaves Franklin County to enter Adams County. Passing farmland in the flat landscape, SR 21 intersects SR 26 and continues through an unnamed coulee to intersect <b>Smart</b> <b>Road.</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>Road</b> was the former alignment of SR 21 prior to the U.S. Route 395 (US 395) interchange being built.

In Downtown, the roadway is named Second, I and First Streets and serves as the main connector to other areas. After turning north to leave Lind, the road encounters the John Wayne Pioneer Trail and more plains before intersecting the pre-interstate alignment of Interstate 90 (I-90) and interchanging with I-90 at exit 206, another diamond interchange. North of the interchange, SR 21 travels through more plains and a coulee to leave Adams County and enter Lincoln County.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are {{advanced}} technologies and applications integrated in transportation networks {{with the aim}} of creating a safe and efficient transportation environment. ITSs are developing both in the cities, that will become smart cities, and on freeways, by designing <b>smart</b> <b>roads.</b> Focusing on freeways, tollbooths currently represent serious challenges in many countries. Most commonly used payment toll systems create traffic congestion with the consequent increase of traffic pollution, time delays and negative results in terms of vehicular throughput and freeways&# 039; efficiency. ITSs integrated with new arriving Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and novel toll collections designs, such as Open Road Tolling (ORT), could remove, or at least, mitigate these bottlenecks.

40|$|Abstract. To {{achieve the}} concept of <b>smart</b> <b>roads,</b> {{intelligent}} sensors are being placed on the roadways to collect real-time traffic streams. Traditional method is not a real-time response, and incurs high communication and storage costs. Existing distributed stream mining algorithms do not consider the resource limitation on the lightweight devices such as sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed traffic stream mining system. The central server performs various data mining tasks only in the training and updating stage and sends the interesting patterns to the sensors. The sensors monitor and predict the coming traffic or raise alarms independently by comparing with the patterns observed in the historical streams. The sensors provide real-time response with less wireless communication and small resource requirement, and the computation burden on the central server is reduced. We evaluate our system on the real highway traffic streams in the GCM Transportation Corridor in Chicagoland...|$|R
