The trio detach the car {{containing}} the rocket fuel and {{jump from the}} train, which crashes into the station underneath the Mikado Building.

He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was released to British music channels in April 2007. It {{was shot in}} black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing {{on top of a}} sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to [...] "slowly become a woman" [...] during the video, adding [...] "Well, a sexier woman – I'm always a woman." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

60|$|I {{keep the}} key of our door always {{fastened}} to my wrist at night, but <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walks about the room, and sits at the open window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (brusquely). Get up, get up. (He turns moodily {{away and}} takes a turn across the room, pausing {{for a moment to}} say, over his shoulder) You're talking nonsense; and you know it. (<b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sits down in almost {{listless}} despair on the couch. When he turns and sees her there, he feels that his victory is complete, and that he may now indulge in a little play with his victim. He comes back and sits beside her. She looks alarmed and moves a little away from him; but a ray of rallying hope beams from her eye. He begins like a man enjoying some secret joke.) How do you know I am a brave man? ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footsteps as of a policeman, very measured, {{pass on the}} [...] {{pavement}} outside, and die away. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> steals to the [...] window, draws one curtain aside so that a chink of {{the night}} is [...] seen. She opens the curtain wider, till {{the shape of a}} bare, [...] witch-like tree becomes visible in the open space of the little [...] Square {{on the far side of}} the road. The footsteps are heard [...] once more coming nearer. WANDA closes the curtains and cranes [...] back. They pass and die again. She moves away and looking down [...] at the floor between door and couch, as though seeing something [...] there; shudders; covers her eyes; goes back to the couch and [...] down again just as before, to stare at the embers. Again she is [...] startled by noise of the outer door being opened. She springs [...] up, runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door. By [...] the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the [...] dark window-curtains, listening. There comes the sound of [...] subdued knocking on her door. She stands in breathless terror. [...] The knocking is repeated. The sound of a latchkey in the door [...] is heard. Her terror leaves her. The door opens; a man enters [...] in a dark, fur overcoat.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, uncle," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looking round, [...] "it is {{time that}} we should go now; {{we have a long}} way to go, you know. Where is the boat?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Fanny still {{keeps her}} sofa; the first enthusiasm of her affliction [...] has worn away, {{and she has}} nothing to sustain her now but {{planning}} [...] our expeditions about the city. She has got the map and the history [...] of Quebec by heart, and she holds us to the literal fulfilment of her [...] instructions. On this account, she often has to send Dick and me out [...] together when {{she would like to}} keep him with her, for she won't [...] trust either of us alone, {{and when we come back}} she examines us [...] separately to see whether we have skipped anything. This makes us [...] faithful in the smallest things. She says she is determined that [...] Uncle Jack shall have a full and circumstantial report from me of all [...] that he wants to know about the celebrated places here, and I really [...] think he will, if I go on, or am goaded on, in this way. It's pure [...] devotion to the cause in Fanny, for you know she doesn't care for [...] such things herself, and has no pleasure in it but carrying a point. [...] Her chief consolation under her trial of keeping still is to see how [...] I look in her different dresses. She sighs over me as I appear in a [...] new garment, and says, O, if she only had the dressing of me! Then [...] <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> limps and hops across the room to where I stand [...] before the glass, and puts a pin here and a ribbon there, and gives [...] my hair (which she has dressed herself) a little dab, to make it lie [...] differently, and then scrambles back to her sofa, and knocks her lame [...] ankle against something, and lies there groaning and enjoying herself [...] like a martyr. On days when she thinks she is never going to get [...] well, she says she doesn't know why she doesn't give me her things at [...] once and be done with it; and on days when she thinks she is going to [...] get well right away, she says she will have me one made something [...] like whatever dress I have got on, as soon as she's home. Then up [...] she'll jump again for the exact measure, and tell me the history of [...] every stitch, and how she'll have it altered just the least grain, [...] and differently trimmed to suit my complexion better; and ends by [...] having promised to get me something not in the least like it. You [...] have some idea already of what Fanny is; and all you have got to do [...] is to multiply it by about fifty thousand. Her sprained ankle simply [...] intensifies her whole character.|$|E
50|$|The {{other actors}} end the play, running on to find Mommina dead.

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} she was visited by the squaw, released and fed as before. Allie made signs {{that she wanted}} to have her feet free, so that <b>she</b> could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> move about. The squaw complied with her wishes.
