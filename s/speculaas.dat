5000|$|The Netherlands and Belgium: Dutch/Belgian-style cheesecakes are {{typically}} flavored with fruit or melted bittersweet chocolate, are generally made with quark, {{and are not}} baked. Belgian cheesecake also includes a <b>speculaas</b> crust (<b>speculaas</b> is a traditional Dutch-Belgian biscuit).|$|E
50|$|<b>Speculaas</b> or speculoos (Dutch: <b>Speculaas</b> , Flemish: speculoos, French: spéculoos , German: Spekulatius) {{is a type}} of spiced shortcrust biscuit, {{traditionally}} baked {{for consumption}} on or just before St Nicholas' day in the Netherlands (5 December), Belgium (6 December), and around Christmas in Germany. <b>Speculaas</b> are thin, very crunchy, caramelized, slightly browned and, most significantly, have some image or figure (often from the traditional stories about St. Nicholas) stamped on the front side before baking; the back is flat.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Speculaas</b> dough {{does not}} rise much. Dutch and Belgian {{versions}} are baked with light brown (sometimes beet) sugar and baking powder. German [...] uses baker's ammonia as leavening agent. Indian, Indonesian, and Mediterranean spices used in <b>speculaas</b> are cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cardamom and white pepper; these were {{common in the}} 1600-1700s due to the Dutch East Indies spice trade. Family recipes may also include other small amounts of spices like anise, etc. Traditionally, <b>speculaas</b> were made from Frisian flour and spices. The name speculoos was coined for Belgian wheat flour cookies with hardly any spices. Today most <b>speculaas</b> versions are made from white (wheat) flour, brown sugar, butter and spices. Some varieties use some almond flour and have slivered almonds embedded in the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} interpretations for {{the origins of}} the name <b>speculaas.</b> It may derive from Latin speculum, which means mirror and refers {{to the fact that the}} images are cut as a {{mirrored}} bas-relief into a wooden stamp, which is then used to decorate <b>speculaas.</b> Another, less likely, word origin refers to the Latin word speculator which, among other meanings, could refer to a bishop or St Nicholas' epithet, [...] "he who sees everything". Still another possible source is Specerij, the Dutch word for spice.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] {{is often}} {{confused}} with [...] Kruidnoten, which translates to [...] "spice nuts" [...] in English, are harder, {{have a different}} colour and shape, and are made with the same ingredients as <b>speculaas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Dutch {{festival of}} Sinterklaas is held on 5 December. Saint Nicholas leaves gifts in the children’s shoes. On this occasion, the Dutch drink hot {{chocolate}} milk and eat spice cookies, like <b>speculaas.</b> Special treats distributed by Saint Nicholas' aide Zwarte Piet include pepernoten (irregular shaped small cookies made of rye, honey and anise, often confused with kruidnoten); kruidnoten (gingernut-like biscuits but made with <b>speculaas</b> spices: {{a mix of}} cinnamon, pepper, cloves and nutmeg); boterletter or banket (a baked pastry crust filled with a sugared almond paste filling and shaped into a letter); letters made from chocolate; marzipan (often {{in the shape of}} animals or other topical items), borstplaat (discs of fondant); and taai-taai.|$|E
50|$|In Western cuisine, ginger is {{traditionally}} used mainly in sweet {{foods such as}} ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, parkin, ginger biscuits, and <b>speculaas.</b> A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Ginger wine is a ginger-flavored wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle. Ginger is also used as a spice added to hot coffee and tea.|$|E
5000|$|In the Netherlands, {{almond paste}} (called amandelspijs) {{is used in}} gevulde <b>speculaas</b> (stuffed brown-spiced biscuit) and banket. It is used as filling in the fruited Christmas bread Kerststol, {{traditionally}} eaten at Christmas breakfast. In Germany, almond paste is also used in pastries and sweets. In the German language, almond paste is known as Marzipanrohmasse and sold for example as Lübecker Edelmarzipan, i.e. [...] "high quality marzipan from Lübeck".|$|E
50|$|Although Belgian gastronomy is {{connected}} to French cuisine, some recipes were reputedly invented there as e.g. French-fried potatoes (despite the name), stoofkarbonnaden (or carbonade flamande in French, a beef stew with beer, mustard and bay laurel), <b>speculaas</b> (a sort of cinnamon and ginger-flavoured cookie), Brussels waffles (and their variant, Liege waffles), waterzooi (a broth made with chicken or fish, cream and vegetables), endive with bechamel sauce, Brussels sprouts, Belgian pralines (Belgium {{has some of the}} most renowned chocolate houses), charcuterie (deli meats) and Paling in 't groen (river eels in a sauce of green herbs).|$|E
5000|$|Workers in the Low Countries have {{traditionally}} made a sandwich {{in the morning}} with butter and <b>speculaas</b> or speculoos cookies. This would develop into a spread-like consistency by lunchtime. In 2008, two competitors entered a contest on the Belgian television show, The Inventors (de Bedenkers), with a spread made from speculoos cookies [...] - [...] Els Scheppers, who reached the semi-finals, and the team of chef Danny De Mayer and Dirk De Smet, who weren't selected as finalists. Spreads made from crushed Speculoos cookies would subsequently go into production by three separate companies and become popular.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{going to}} bed, {{children}} put their shoes {{next to the}} fireplace chimney of the coal-fired stove or fireplace (or in modern times close to the central heating radiator). They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it {{and a bowl of}} water nearby [...] "for Sinterklaas' horse", and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes. Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include hot chocolate, mandarin oranges, pepernoten, <b>speculaas</b> (sometimes filled with almond paste), letter-shaped pastry filled with almond paste or a chocolate letter (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), chocolate coins and marzipan figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.|$|E
50|$|As the Dutch Republic enters its Golden Age in the 17th century, {{dishes of}} this kind became {{available}} to the wealthy middle class as well, often consisting of a rich variety of fruits, cheeses, meat, wine, and nuts. The Dutch Empire enabled spices, sugar, and exotic fruits to be imported to the country. The Dutch East India Company {{was the first to}} import coffee on a large scale to Europe. The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon. The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711. By the late 17th century, tea and coffee consumption were increasing and becoming part of everyday life. Tea was served with sweets, candy or marzipan and cookies. The availability of relatively cheaper spices resulted in a tradition of spiced cookies called <b>speculaas,</b> the exact recipes of which were kept secret by bakers.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{foods and}} drinks, such as Belgian beer, moules frites, <b>speculaas,</b> waterzooi, witloof, Brussels sprouts, Belgian chocolate,... are also seen as {{examples}} of belgitude, because they are often promoted abroad. People who were important to Belgian history are also often cited: Ambiorix, Godfrey of Bouillon, Charles V of Spain, Adolphe Sax, Baudouin of Belgium, as are cultural icons such as Manneken Pis, the Gilles of Binche, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Tintin, Inspector Maigret, the Atomium, Jacques Brel, René Magritte, Soeur Sourire, Django Reinhardt,... In the fields of sport Eddy Merckx and the Red Devils are a good example. The song [...] "Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)" [...] (1998) by Mr. John is also an expression of belgitude. The satirical comedy and film adaptation Sois Belge et tais-toi, the films of Jan Bucquoy and the comedy team Les Snuls are all loving and mocking tributes to the Belgian identity.|$|E
