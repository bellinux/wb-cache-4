40|$|The vast {{majority}} of both available information and cultural practices related to cocoa cloning focuses on plagiotropic vegetative material (mature fan branches) and ignores orthotropic material (juvenile chupons). Improved knowledge sharing related to the potentials of orthotropic scions and rootstocks is needed to help not just growers but also researchers and extensionists. Orthotropic scion and rootstock cloning offers potential advantages for growers such as seedling-like architecture, reduced <b>shape</b> <b>pruning,</b> improvement in tree anchorage and nutrient uptake and aspects of drought avoidance. Orthotropic rootstock clones {{may also be the}} preferred material used for development of superior rootstock clones in cocoa, such as those having “dwarfing ” characteristics. Breeding, extension, and nursery programmes {{can take advantage of the}} juvenile material to speed up evaluation, selection, distribution and multiplication. Here we demonstrate, from a review of the widely dispersed past and current research, some of these and other possibilities and realities for clonal orthotropic scions and rootstocks in cocoa.

40|$|The {{virtualisation}} {{project of}} Villa Arconati {{is part of}} the process involved in organising the aristocratic houses north of Milan. The project aims to test the use of virtual reality as an instrument of exploitation and multi-platform visualisation for villas and historic gardens. This paper describes the methodology utilised which allows us to create clear models of architectural and vegetation elements that will be contributing towards the final model: a successful compromise between realism and easy visualisation. While the modelling of the architectural components has followed a well defined process, as far as the garden is concerned, the development of the project presented greater problems since the methodology requires an hybrid approach between traditional software for garden design and representation and modelling activities for all the parts of gardens that require mankind intervention such as continuous <b>shape</b> <b>pruning.</b> The historical reconstruction of the house might therefore {{turn out to be a}} good basis for providing tourists and visitors with new instruments for learning and understanding, even using experiences in augmented reality, and may also offer planners further means to evaluate projects and support them in the decisionmaking process...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{cascaded}} face <b>shape</b> space <b>pruning</b> algorithm for robust facial landmark detec-tion. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candi-date shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specif-ically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly remov-ing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier {{is designed to}} assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient <b>shape</b> space <b>pruning</b> strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The pro-posed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images.

40|$|We {{propose a}} sketch-based 3 D shape {{retrieval}} {{system that is}} substantially more discriminative and robust than existing systems, especially for complex models. The power of our system comes {{from a combination of}} a contour-based 2 D shape representation and a robust sampling-based shape matching scheme. They are defined over dis-criminative local features and applicable for partial sketches; robust to noise and distortions in hand drawings; and consistent when strokes are added progressively. However, our robust shape matching algorithm requires dense sampling and registration, which incurs a high computational cost. We thus devise critical acceleration methods to achieve interactive performance: precomputing kNN graphs that record transformations between neighboring contour images and enable fast online <b>shape</b> alignment; <b>pruning</b> sampling and <b>shape</b> registration strategically and hierarchically; and parallelizing shape matching on multi-core platforms or GPUs.

As a consequence the sustainability of these agricultural landscapes is questioned. We studied changes in hedgerow management in a longterm ecological site in Brittany, France with an interdisciplinary approach. Importance, spatial distribution and relationship with the agricultural system have been assessed over 11 years in three contrasted hedgerow network landscapes, while management practices and farmers' perception were studied from an anthropological point of view. Two apparently opposed trends were found: first, an apparent decrease in the interest of farmers for hedgerows witnessed by the diminishing of the rate of pruning; second, changing attitudes of farmers not necessarily toward hedgerow abandonment but rather toward the production of novel <b>shapes</b> for <b>pruned</b> trees...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{management}} has important effects on soil properties, runoff, soil losses and soil quality. Traditional olive grove (OG) management {{is based on}} reduced tree density, canopy size <b>shaped</b> by <b>pruning</b> and weed control by ploughing. In addition, {{over the last several}} decades, herbicide use has been introduced into conventional OG management. These management strategies cause the soil surface to be almost bare and subsequently high erosion rates take place. To avoid these high erosion rates several soil management strategies can be applied. In this study, three strategies were assessed in OG with conventional tillage in three plots of 1. ha each. Soil properties were measured and soil erosion rates were estimated by means of the RUSLE model. One plot was managed with no amendments (control), and the other two were treated with olive leaves mulch and oil mill pomace applied yearly from 2003 until 2013. The control plot experienced the greatest soil loss while the use of olive leaves as mulch and olive mill pomace as an amendment resulted in a soil loss reduction of 89. 4 % and 65. 4 % respectively (assuming a 5 % slope). In addition, the chemical and physical soil properties were improved with the amendments. This combined effect will created a higher quality soil over the long term that it is more resilient to erosion and can provide better ecosystem services, as its functions are improved. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Plant {{plasticity}} refers {{the ability}} of a plant to change its observable characteristics, in response to the environmental changes in its lifespan. We present a method of simulating structural plasticity in trees reacting to different light intensities, pruning policies, competition, and obstacles. The method is based on a functional-structural plant model (FSPM) that simulates two basic underlying processes of plants: development/organogenesis (the formation of plant structure) and growth (expansion of organs biomass production and partitioning). Bi-directional feedback is constructed between these two processes by linking both bud break and biomass partitioning with the internal source-sink ratio of biomass. A secondary mechanism controlling bud break is its local light intensity, by imposing a light distribution in tree canopy, the computational efficiency for which is assured by implementation on GPU. Based on these mechanisms, the virtual trees produce naturally less branches at lower light intensities. In reaction to pruning, the same tree give different <b>shapes</b> as <b>pruning</b> changes the source-sink balance and triggers new branches. Neighboring trees compete for light and lead to different crowns, and the same mechanism can be used to simulate trees grown near buildings. The results show that by constructing the dynamic model describing the underlying development and growth process of trees in cyberspace, the simulated trees can adapt to their virtual environment without need of modifying their geometrical traits. Such property is interesting for simulating landscape, education and interactive training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{traditional}} methods for shape classification are based on contour. They often encounter difficulties when dealing with classes that have large nonlinear variability, especially when the variability is structural or due to articulation. It is well-known that shape representation based on skeletons is superior to contour based representation in such situations. However, approaches to shape similarity based on skeletons suffer from the instability of skeletons and matching of skeleton graphs is still an open problem. Using a skeleton pruning method, {{we are able to}} obtain stable pruned skeletons even in the presence of significant contour distortions. In contrast to most existing methods, it does not require converting of skeleton graphs to trees and it does not require any graph editing. We represent each shape as set of shortest paths in the skeleton between pairs of skeleton endpoints. Shape classification is done with Bayesian classifier. We present excellent classification results for complete <b>shape.</b> Keywords: Skeleton <b>pruning,</b> skeleton path, Bayesian Classification. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to matching and recognition of 2 D shapes, which uses a chord-based shape representation and matches shapes by finding correspondences between chords. Given a 2 D shape, we choose its basis chord such that both end points of the chord have high probability of being present under occlusion. Then the shape is transformed and represented in an internal reference frame uniquely defined by the basis chord. In this chord-based reference frame, we capture the coordinate distribution of all shape points using a point density graph. When a second shape is being matched against the first shape, we pursue a chord on the second shape based on which the second shape’s point density graph is the closest {{to that of the}} first shape. To avoid exhaustive search of all chords on the second shape, we use the Chord Length Distributions of the two <b>shapes</b> to <b>prune</b> a dominant portion of the search space. The distance between two point density graphs is measured using a symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence. Then when the correspondence between a pair of chords is established, a unique similarity transform is determined to match the two shapes so that the corresponding chords are aligned. Finally, we employ a hierarchical approach to extend our method to include Affine transformations. Matching and Recognition results from the Brown SIID project shapes, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, and the SQUID fish database, demonstrate our algorithm’s performance, its invariance properties and its robustness to occlusion, articulation, missing gaps, and spurious structures on shapes. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen and how harvest olives {{are among}} the most {{important}} issues to improve quality and quantity to ensure the best net return to growers. Trunk shakers are commonly used in mechanical harvesting to detach olives. Field trials showed that with this equipment less than 100 % of the production is detached, usually 70 % to 90 % (Michelakis, 2002). It is important to increase the percentage of fruits harvested, to reduce losses. To achieve this goal factors affecting mechanical olive harvesting must be known, {{to be used in the}} definition of harvest season. Some of these factors are the result of the orchard management, like tree <b>shape,</b> canopy density, <b>pruning</b> methods. Others depend on the cultivar, such as fruit removal force (FRF), fruit weight (P) and the ratio between them. FRF and P are considered decisive in the detachment process. Results of field trials carried out in the Northeast of Portugal with “Cobrançosa Transmontana” cultivar show the FRF, P and their ratio evolution in the ripening period. They have potential to become indicators of the mechanical olive harvest season...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{biological}} variability of anatomical objects {{is essential for}} statistical shape analysis and discrimination between healthy and pathological structures. This paper describes a novel approach that incorporates the variability of an object population into the generation of a characteristic 3 D shape model. The proposed shape representation is a coarse-scale sampled medial description derived from a fine-scale spherical harmonics (SPHARM) boundary description. This medial description is composed of a net of medial samples (m-rep) with fixed graph properties. The medial model is computed automatically from a predefined <b>shape</b> space using <b>pruned</b> 3 D Voronoi skeletons. A new method determines the stable medial branching topology from the shape space. An intrinsic coordinate system and an implicit correspondence between shapes is defined on the medial manifold. Several studies of biological structures clearly demonstrate that the novel representation has the promise to describe shape changes in a natural and intuitive way. A new medial shape similarity study of group di#erences between Monozygotic and Dizygotic twins in lateral ventricle shape demonstrates the meaningful and powerful representation of local and global form...|$|R
40|$|The {{sprouting}} {{capacity of}} some broadleaves {{has been used}} for their regeneration since ancient times. Often concurrently with taking advantage of sprouting stools, the trees used to be <b>shaped</b> also by <b>pruning</b> their stems, namely on pasturelands and in grazing forests. The activity of woodcutters and shepherds was obviously rather common in warmer climates with broadleaved stands because coppice and pollard trees appear relatively often in the visual arts from ancient works through the period if the Italian and German Renaissance up to the romantic and realistic landscape painting of the 19 th century overlapping into the 20 th century. For centuries, most frequently illustrated in European and Czech paintings have been pollard willows (Salix spp.). Other coppice and pollard tree species identified in paintings are oaks (Quercus spp.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European chestnut (Castanea sativa), and rarely other species, too. Artists apparently often used bizarrely shaped woods to increase the dramatic atmosphere of their landscape sceneries as well as figural compositions, and the coppice and pollard trees had certainly also a symbolic meaning in some of their works...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of this thesis, two {{scenarios}} are considered. In the first one, we contribute to feature extraction algorithms. In the second one, we use features to improve object detection solutions and localization. The two scenarios give rise to into four thesis sub-goals. First, we present a new <b>shape</b> skeleton <b>pruning</b> algorithm based on contour approximation and the integer medial axis. The algorithm effectively removes unwanted branches, conserves the connectivity of the skeleton and respects the topological properties of the shape. The algorithm is robust to significant boundary noise and to rigid shape transformations. It is fast and easy to implement. While shape-based solutions via boundary and skeleton analysis are viable solutions to object detection, keypoint features are important for textured object detection. Therefore, we present a keypoint featurebased planar object detection framework for vision-based localization. We demonstrate that our framework is robust against illumination changes, perspective distortion, motion blur, and occlusions. We increase robustness of the localization scheme in cluttered environments and decrease false detection of targets. We present an off-line target evaluation strategy and a scheme to improve pose. Third, we extend planar object detection to a real-time approach for 3 D object detection using a mobile and uncalibrated camera. We develop our algorithm based on two novel naive Bayes classifiers for viewpoint and feature matching that improve performance and decrease memory usage. Our algorithm exploits the specific structure of various binary descriptors in order to boost feature matching by conserving descriptor properties. Our novel naive classifiers require a database with a small memory footprint because we only store efficiently encoded features. We improve the feature-indexing scheme to speed up the matching process creating a highly efficient database for objects. Finally, we present a model-free long-term tracking algorithm based on the Kernelized Correlation Filter. The proposed solution improves the correlation tracker based on precision, success, accuracy and robustness while increasing frame rates. We integrate adjustable Gaussian window and sparse features for robust scale estimation creating a better separation of the target and the background. Furthermore, we include fast descriptors and Fourier spectrum packed format to boost performance while decreasing the memory footprint. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art techniques to validate the results...|$|R
