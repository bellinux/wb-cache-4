50|$|For {{an optical}} fiber, a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> is a {{refractive}} index profile characterized by a uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding interface so that the cladding is of a lower refractive index. The <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> corresponds to a power-law index profile with the profile parameter approaching infinity. The <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> is used in most single-mode fibers and some multimode fibers.|$|E
50|$|Multi-mode fibers are {{described}} by their core and cladding diameters. Thus, 62.5/125 µm multi-mode fiber has a core size of 62.5 micrometres (µm) and a cladding diameter of 125 µm. The transition between {{the core and}} cladding can be sharp, which is called a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile,</b> or a gradual transition, which is called a graded-index profile. The two types have different dispersion characteristics and thus different effective propagation distance. Multi-mode fibers may be constructed with either graded or <b>step-index</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For {{this class}} of profiles, {{multimode}} distortion is smallest when [...] takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite , the profile becomes a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{field theory}} of guided waves in optical fibers with <b>step-index</b> <b>profiles</b> {{and in which}} both core and {{cladding}} are chiral isotropic media is developed. We show that both surface and semileaky modes can propagate in optically active fibers. To {{shed light on the}} guidance and leakage properties of chiral isotropic fibers we present a physical interpretation and several numerical results. The new leakage effect associated with semileaky modes is an important property that cannot be neglected in the analysis of chiral optical fibers but that, nevertheless, has been systematically disregarded in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{refractive}} indexes, material attenuation {{and damage}} fractions of a multi-step ion implanted Lithium Niobate (LiNbO 3) waveguide were analyzed as {{functions of the}} annealing temperatures. An almost flat damage depth profile was designed to reduce the uncertainties related to the indexes profile shape, thus providing a better test-case for the characterizations. The measurements performed on the fabricated optical waveguides confirmed the predicted <b>step-index</b> <b>profiles</b> showing that the light is confined inside the damaged layer. The low measured attenuation (less than 0. 8 dB/cm @ 632. 8 nm) makes the obtained waveguide attractive for device fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Eigenvalues {{and field}} {{distributions}} for optical waveguides {{obtained from the}} WKB approximation have been compared with those found from geometrical optics and from more rigorous weakly-guiding LP mode theories {{in the cases of}} the <b>step-index</b> and parabolic-index <b>profiles.</b> In all cases it is found that the zero-order WKB approximation yields very accurate eigenvalues provided care is taken in the choice of phase factors in the eigenvalue equation. Expressions are deduced for the required phase factors for guides of arbitrary index profile in both two- and three-dimensions, and physical interpretations are given in terms of ray optics. The first-order WKB field distributions are found to give good agreement with the mode fields everywhere except {{in the vicinity of the}} caustics...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of mode {{scrambler}}s: the [...] "Step-Graded-Step" [...] (S-G-S) and the [...] "step index with bends". The S-G-S mode scrambler {{is actually an}} assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile,</b> a graded-index profile and another <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> fiber. [...] Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested. Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use [...] "Step Index with Bends" [...] mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber {{through a series of}} small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness. The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.|$|E
50|$|A {{refractive}} index profile is the distribution of refractive indices of materials within an optical fiber. Some optical fiber has a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile,</b> in which the core has one uniformly-distributed index and the cladding has a lower uniformly-distributed index. Other optical fiber has a graded-index profile, in which the {{refractive index}} varies gradually {{as a function of}} radial distance from the fiber center. Graded-index profiles include power-law index profiles and parabolic index profiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{optical media}} types include 200 and 100 μm {{diameter}} core (280, 240, or 140 μm clading) <b>Step-index</b> <b>profile</b> (depressed cladding) optical fibre. These are much larger-core fibres than {{are commonly used}} in short-haul commercial applications, which are more normally 50/125 or 62.5/125 μm. This is, in part at least, to reduce {{the problems associated with}} contamination of the optical connectors - a given size of particle between the end faces of the fibre in a connector or misalignment of such a connector has significantly less effect on the larger fibre - which is seen as a significant issue in avionic applications, especially where contaminating environments, high vibration, and wide temperature ranges can apply.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{theoretically}} {{analyze the}} loss and branching ratio of multimode optical branching waveguides {{by using a}} ray tracing method to obtain less mode-dependent branching characteristics. First, a 2 × 2 optical mixing and branching waveguide with a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> are considered. It is found that an optimum length to achieve a low loss and stable branching ratio exists. Second, a waveguide with mode scrambler is investigated. By sacrificing some amount of insertion loss, the mode dependence can be minimized...|$|E
40|$|The exact field {{solution}} of a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> fiber {{was used to}} determine the injection efficiency of a thin-film distribution of polarized sources located in the cladding of an optical fiber. Previous results for random source orientation were confirmed. The behavior of the power efficiency, P(eff), of a polarized distribution of sources was found to be similar to the behavior of a fiber with sources with random orientation. However, for sources polarized in either the x or y direction, P(eff) was found to be more efficient...|$|E
40|$|The exact field {{solution}} of a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> fiber {{is used to}} determine the excitation efficiency of a distribution of sources in the core of an optical fiber. Previous results of a thin-film cladding source distribution to its core source counterpart are used for comparison. The behavior of power efficiency with the fiber parameters is examined and found to be similar to the behavior exhibited by cladding sources. It is also found that a core-source fiber is two orders of magnitude more efficient than a fiber with a bulk distribution of cladding sources. This result agrees qualitatively with previous ones obtained experimentally...|$|E
40|$|By invoking Debye potentials, we {{formulate}} exact eigenvalue equations and {{the corresponding}} field distributions for general, three-layered, radially stratified, dielectric, and nonferromagnetic metal, optical fibers. By using cross products of Bessel functions, which may {{be regarded as the}} basic functional elements of the eigenvalue equations, a comparison is made between the properties of a three-layer structure and a simple <b>step-index</b> <b>profile,</b> and a simple graphical solution is obtained. The technique is applied to several practical structures, including two-layer fibers having a central index depression in the core, ring-core fibers, W fibers, and progressively stepped three-layered structures. The mathematical procedure is simple, and the results are of interest to optical fiber designers...|$|E
40|$|Planar {{optical waveguides}} {{fabricated}} by proton-exchange and annealed proton-exchange in LiNbO$ sb 3 $ are investigated. The {{use of a}} Fermi function was found to accurately model the proton-exchange refractive index profile resulting in a better agreement between the measured effective mode indices and the computed dispersion curves compared to the conventional <b>step-index</b> <b>profile.</b> Numerical simulations of the nonlinear diffusion equation {{have shown that the}} proton-exchange process cannot be adequately described by the well established ion-exchange equations. A generalized Gaussian function was used to accurately model the refractive index profile in annealed proton-exchanged waveguides resulting in considerable improvements over previous work. Annealing was found to allow for flexibility in the tailoring of the waveguide parameters. In addition to establishing single mode propagation criteria, changes in these parameters were correlated with the fabrication conditions using a general power law thus showing that the anneal process is not characterized by simple diffusion mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|We {{overview}} complex spatio-temporal propagation {{phenomena in}} nonlinear multimode optical fibers (MMFs) [1]. In the anomalous dispersion regime, longitudinal periodic intensity oscillations of optical multimode solitons [2] lead to controlled generation of ultra-wideband dispersive wave sidebands [3, 4]. Whereas {{in the normal}} dispersion, sideband series from the visible till the mid-infrared (MIR) are generated from parametric instability of continuous waves [5, 6]. Before the onset of temporal instabilities however, the Kerr effects leads to intriguing effect of spatial beam self-cleaning towards a well-defined and robust bell-shaped transverse profile in graded-index (GRIN) MMFs [7]. The interplay with Raman scattering generates spectrally flat, spatially single-mode supercontinua extending from the visible till the MIR from GRIN MMFs [8]. A temporally resolved analysis reveals that significant (tenfold) temporal compression is achieved in the spectral sidebands [8]. Spatial Kerr self-cleaning was observed with increased efficiency in active, ytterbium doped MMF with a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> [9]. When optically poling a GRIN MMF, mutual self-cleaning of pump and second-harmonic beams was obtained [10]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} from basic {{principles}} {{that the core}} modes of an air-core photonic-bandgap fiber (PBF) exhibit similar qual-itative and quantitative behavior as the linearly polarized (LP) modes of an equivalent conventional fiber whose <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> is entirely determined by the band edges of the PBF. This analogy leads {{to the concept of}} effective numerical aperture (NA), which is used to provide an intuitive interpretation of the qualitative behavior of PBF modes. By using this equivalence, several key properties, including the number of modes, their cutoff, effective index, size, and divergence, and the dependence of these quanti-ties on the PBF core and cladding parameters, can be predicted approximately by simulating the LP modes of the equivalent step-index fiber using standard LP-mode simulators or well-known formula. Besides providing a convenient tool to model the modes of a PBF, this analogy gives new physical insight into the fundamental characteristics of these complex waveguides.

30|$|A {{multimode}} interference {{refractive index}} (RI) sensor {{based on the}} coreless fiber was numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Two identical single mode fibers (SMF) are spliced {{at both ends of}} a section of the coreless fiber which can be considered as the equivalent weakly guiding multimode fiber (MMF) with a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> when the surrounding refractive index (SRI) is lower than that of the coreless fiber. Thus, it becomes the conventional single-mode multimode single-mode (SMS) fiber structure but with a larger core size. The output spectra will shift along with the changes in the SRI owing to the direct exposure of the coreless fiber. The output spectra under different SRIs were numerically studied, as well as the sensitivities with different lengths and diameters of the coreless fiber. The predication and calculation showed the good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed RI sensor proved to be feasible by verification experiments, and the relative error was merely 0.1 % which occupied preferable sensing performance and practicability.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the loss limitations of a splice between a hollow-core fiber and a conventional fiber, {{we use a}} numerical model to calculate the expected coupling loss between the NKT Photonics ’ HC- 1550 - 02 fiber and a sin-gle-mode fiber (SMF) of arbitrary <b>step-index</b> <b>profile.</b> When the SMF parameters are optimized, the splice loss is predicted to be as low as ~ 0. 6 dB. This minimum {{is believed to be}} largely due to mode-shape mismatch. These predictions are confirmed experimentally by optimizing the splice loss between this photonic-bandgap fiber and five SMFs with different mode-field diameters (MFDs) and V numbers. With the SMF- 28 fiber, the measured loss is 1 : 3 dB, in excellent agreement with theory. Using a SMF with parameters close to the optimum values (MFD 7 : 2 μm and V 2 : 16), this loss was reduced to a new record value of 0 : 79 dB. © 2010 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} bend-induced losses in a silica-based {{single-mode}} microstructured fiber with a core diameter ranging from 20 to 35 microns and increased relative air {{content in the}} holey cladding has been conducted. With {{the use of the}} equivalent <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> method in approximation of waveguide parameters of microstructured fiber (normalized frequency and normalized transverse attenuation constant) the effect of bending on the spectral position of the fundamentalmode short-wavelength leakage boundary has been analyzed. Upon measurement of spectral characteristics of attenuation in the considered fibers good accordance of numerical and experimental data has been found out. It is shown that increase of the air content in the holey cladding leads to expansion of the mentioned boundary to lower wavelengths for the value from 150 to 800 nm depending on the core size and bending conditions. A single-transverse-mode propagation is achieved on fiber length of 5 - 10 meters due to a substantial difference in losses of fundamental and higher-order guided modes attained by bending. Optical losses in all studied samples are less than 10 dB/km at the wavelength λ = 1550 nm. The results of the study can be applied in the design of high-power laser systems having such basic requirements as a relatively large mode spot and high beam quality...|$|E
30|$|Intermodal {{dispersion}} (also called modal dispersion) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of intermodal dispersion can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on multimode fibers, intermodal dispersion can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating intermodal dispersion is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but intermodal dispersion can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where intermodal dispersion is minimized. In case of graded index fiber, critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to core cladding interface. The wave which is internally reflected near axis travel less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no intermodal dispersion.|$|E
40|$|Optical, electrical, and {{microstructural}} {{effects of}} Ar ion bombardment and Ar incorporation on thermally evaporated Ag and Al thin films were investigated. The {{results show that}} as the momentum supplied to the growing films by the bombarding Ar ions per arriving metal atom increases, refractive index at 632. 8 nm increases and extinction coefficient decreases, lattice spacing expands, grain size decreases, electrical resistivity increases, and trapped Ar increases slightly. In Ag films, stress reverses from tensile to compressive; in AI films compressive stress increases. In both films, the change in optical constants {{can be explained by}} variation in void volume. The reversal of stress from tensile to compressive in Ag films requires a threshold level of momentum. The increase in electrical resistivity is related to the increase in the void fraction, decrease in the grain size, and increase in trapped Ar in both types of films. Many of these properties correlate well with the momentum transferred, suggesting that the momentum is an important physical parameter in describing the influence of ion beams on growing thin films and determining the characteristics of thin metal films prepared by ion-assisted deposition (IAD). With a low energy ion beam, the Ar concentration in IAD Ag films was negligible. When the bombarded film thickness was less than 5 nm, the electrical resistivity of IAD Ag films tended to decrease slightly from that of the non-IAD film. Using the Bruggeman effective medium theory, a formula for the void fraction at any given wavelength was derived. We investigated optical properties, stoichiometry, chemical bonding states, and structure of aluminum oxynitride thin films prepared by reactive ion-assisted deposition. Variations of optical constants and chemical bonding states are related to the stoichiometry. We found that our amorphous aluminum oxynitride film is not simply a mixture of aluminum oxide and nitride but a compound. A rugate filter using a <b>step-index</b> <b>profile</b> of aluminum oxynitride films was fabricated by nitrogen ion beam bombardment of a growing Al film with backfilled oxygen pressure as the sole variable. The effects of ultrasound-assisted deposition (UAD) on the optical properties of ZrO₂, Ta₂O₅, and MgF₂ films were investigated. UAD is likely to induce oxygen and fluoride deficiencies in oxide and fluoride films and increase the packing density of films...|$|E
