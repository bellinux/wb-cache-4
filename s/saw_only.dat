At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated Swiss airspace.|$|E

When the AAFC went out of {{existence}} after the 1949 season, Chappuis retired from football. In announcing his retirement in June 1950, Chappuis said he was through with professional football and that his ambition then was to enjoy a more leisurely lifestyle {{and to be able to}} visit Ann Arbor for those fall football games.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1610, Galileo wrote {{a letter}} {{containing}} the first mention of Jupiter's moons. At the time, he <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these celestial orbs from January 8 to March 2, 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also observed that the four were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The Sarah Jane Adventures {{merchandising}} {{revived the}} concept of the novelisation, which {{had been part of the}} Doctor Who franchise from the 1970s to the 1990s (principally under the editorship of author and former Who script editor Terrance Dicks). The first series and most of the second were adapted in this way, but later series <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.|$|E

Prince Dom João had been acting as regent on behalf of his mother, Queen MariaI, after she was declared incurably insane in 1792. By 1802, Pedro's parents were estranged; João lived in the Mafra National Palace and Carlota Joaquina in Ramalhão Palace. Pedro and his siblings resided in the Queluz Palace with their grandmother MariaI, far from their parents, whom they <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> during state occasions at Queluz.|$|E

The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone.

5|$|During Voltas {{service with}} the French Navy, she <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> limited action. Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, she took part in convoy escort duties initially before being withdrawn to Brest for refit. On 3 July 1940, when the British attacked the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir, Volta managed to escape without damage and sought refuge in Toulon. When the Germans tried to seize her {{along with the rest of}} the fleet on 27 November 1942, however, she was scuttled in Toulon Harbour by her crew to prevent her from being captured.|$|E

An incident-packed race <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> twelve cars reach the finish line, with Max Verstappen repeating his best result {{of the season in}} fourth and Jenson Button finishing a season-best sixth. After starting in damp conditions, both Red Bull drivers were initially able to challenge the Mercedes for the lead, but later dropped back as the track dried, with Daniil Kvyat retiring after a crash and Daniel Ricciardo eventually finishing tenth.|$|E
5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900. She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially {{under the direction of}} Alfred von Tirpitz. She, along with her three sisters, <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900–01, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–05.|$|E

5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the North Koreans could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E

Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, {{including}} a Game 2 where he <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 0–2 in the series. He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. The series then went to Portland, and Roy scored 16 points in 23 minutes off the bench to boost the Blazers to a 97–92 Game 3 win.|$|E
5|$|The Siegfried-class {{ships were}} {{obsolete}} by {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> limited service in their intended role before they were withdrawn from active duty. The ships then served {{in a variety of}} secondary duties, including barracks ships, target ships, {{and in the case of}} Beowulf, an icebreaker in the Baltic Sea. All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919, days before the Treaty of Versailles was signed. Five of the ships were sold for scrapping immediately after they were struck from the register (with Hildebrand being lost in transit), but Frithjof was purchased by a shipping company, and converted into a freighter. She served in this capacity until she too was scrapped in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Weissenburg {{served with}} the I Division during {{the first decade of}} her service with the fleet. This period was {{generally}} limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. Weissenburg, along with her three sisters, <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> one major overseas deployment during this period, to China in 1900–1901, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–1905.|$|E
5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> {{about a dozen}} delegates attend, {{representing}} {{only five}} states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz <b>saw</b> <b>only</b> {{intermittent}} use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the assassination of Luís' son Carlos I in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years later.|$|E
