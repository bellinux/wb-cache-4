5|$|Chinese sawmill owners at Sibu and Bintulu were {{instructed}} by the Japanese to produce timber for repairs at oil fields and ship building. During the Japanese occupation, sawmills at Bintulu produced {{a total of}} 4,000 tons of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The export-oriented {{economy is}} {{dominated}} by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which {{accounts for more than}} half of total exports. Crude petroleum accounts for 20.8%, while palm oil, sawlogs, and <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> account for 9.0% collectively. The state receives a 5% royalty from Petronas over oil explorations in its territorial waters. Most of the oil and gas deposits are located offshore next to Bintulu and Miri at Balingian basin, Baram basin, and around Luconia Shoals.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Forestry Group {{moved to}} Sussex in mid-1943. Shortly {{afterwards}} the Group departed the UK for Australia. By {{the time it}} left the UK the Australians had produced 30 million super feet of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> The foresters paraded through New York City in September 1943 while en-route to Australia. Following their return to Australia in November, the forest companies were deployed to the Northern Territory and New Guinea where they operated sawmills.|$|E

50|$|The name Dharan is Nepali, which {{literally}} means a {{place where}} you <b>saw</b> <b>timber.</b> A typical Dharan is constructed by digging a rectangular plot about 5 to 6 feet deep. This hole is large and deep enough for an adult to comfortably move about. A platform is constructed to cover half of the hole. A timber is placed on this platform and a two-man team, one standing on the platform and the other in the dug out proceed to <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> with a huge saw blade. This is very labor-intensive and dangerous process.|$|R
25|$|In 1983 a {{study by}} town and country {{planners}} of the Ministry of Works found that if a railway were to be constructed into the Taupo region, {{it would be very}} beneficial in transporting logs and <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> out of the region to the Pulp and Paper Mill at Kawerau and for export through the Port of Tauranga. It was also found that such a line would break even with revenue made from it covering the costs of constructing it.|$|E
25|$|Air drying is {{the drying}} of timber by exposing {{it to the}} air. The {{technique}} of air drying consists mainly of making a stack of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> (with the layers of boards separated by stickers) on raised foundations, in a clean, cool, dry and shady place. Rate of drying largely depends on climatic conditions, and on the air movement (exposure to the wind). For successful air drying, a continuous and uniform flow of air throughout the pile of the timber needs to be arranged (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).|$|E
25|$|Eucalyptus {{trees were}} {{introduced}} to Sri Lanka in the late 19th century by tea and coffee planters, for wind protection, shade and fuel. Forestry replanting of eucalyptus began in the 1930s in deforested mountain areas, and currently there are about 10 species present in the island. They account for 20% of major reforestation plantings. They provide railway sleepers, utility poles, <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> and fuelwood, but are controversial because of their adverse effect on biodiversity, hydrology and soil fertility. They are associated with another invasive species, the eucalyptus gall wasp, Leptocybe invasa.|$|E

2500|$|When {{grown for}} <b>sawing</b> <b>timber,</b> pine {{plantations}} can be harvested after 30 years, with some stands {{being allowed to}} grow up to 50 (as the wood value increases more quickly as the trees age). Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a [...] "thinning" [...] operation every five to ten years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow much faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Young trees removed during thinning are used for pulpwood, while most older ones are good enough for <b>saw</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{proposal}} was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line {{would be used for}} transporting <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not believe it would bring any new opportunities to them.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood.|$|E

2500|$|The Gembrook line {{always had}} a much higher {{passenger}} loading than the other narrow-gauge lines. The break-of-gauge station of Upper Ferntree Gully was a terminus for Melbourne suburban electric trains, so the line was popular with day-trippers and weekend visitors from Melbourne. Fifteen special excursion carriages, classed NBH, were built to cater for the tourist traffic. Travelling through a region with rich soils and high rainfall, agricultural products such as potatoes formed much of the freight traffic. Over the years, Nobelius Nurseries dispatched thousands of fruit trees from a packing shed located on the company's own siding between Emerald and Nobelius stations. <b>Sawn</b> <b>timber</b> was also an important item of freight, and sidings were located at Gembrook to serve several private [...] and [...] gauge tramways that brought the timber down from the surrounding hills.|$|E
2500|$|The ship, {{manned by}} a Russian crew of 15 people, was {{carrying}} what was declared {{to be over}} $1.8 million worth of timber from Jakobstad (...) , Finland, to Béjaïa, Algeria. The 6,700 cubic meters of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> were sold by Rets Timber, {{a joint venture between}} Stora Enso Oyj and UPM-Kymmene Oyj. The ship was between the islands of Öland and Gotland, in the territorial waters of Sweden, when it was allegedly boarded {{in the early hours of}} July 24, 2009, by a group of eight to ten English-speaking men, who approached on an inflatable boat, bearing the word 'polis' (Swedish for 'police'). According to the ship's owner, he learned from the captain that the intruders, claiming to be police officers, apprehended the crew, searched the ship and then left, leaving some crew members injured. The Swedish government said its police forces were not involved in boarding the vessel and launched an investigation.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the earlier}} buildings, {{the engine room}} and its annexe and the gas {{producer}} room are of two distinct types of construction. The engine room is constructed of a <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> frame with a trussed roof structure. Both walls and roof sheeting have been replaced at least in parts. The amenities wing east of the engine room is similarly of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> frame construction. The amenity rooms are clad in corrugated galvanised iron externally and lined internally with composition board. The workshop, constructed in 1934 is a <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> framed with trussed roof clad in corrugated iron without internal lining. By contrast, the gas producer rooms are constructed of large timber posts set directly {{into the ground and}} to which a <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> frame is attached. The building is clad with corrugated iron sheeting. Roof trusses, supporting corrugated roof sheeting, are themselves supported at mid-span by hardwood poles.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{for this}} study where to {{investigate}} the frequency of cutting cracks in <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> harvested in the storm-damaged forests in regions where the storms Hilde and Ivar hit. The idea for this work came {{from one of the}} region’s biggest actors, SCA Skog and Jämtlands district. The purpose where to find out how big proportion of the <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> that contains cutting cracks, their financial cost in lost wood value and also give advice and suggestions on how to work against the frequency of cutting cracks. For the field-study some guidelines where used {{to make sure that the}} samples were taken under the same conditions, they were: • The field-study must be performed under harvesting of storm-felled forest, which are horizontal/inclined trunks. • The averaged sized tree will make it possible to harvest <b>saw</b> <b>timber.</b> • The trunks can’t be root cut. A methodology called in Swedish “Trissmetoden” was used because it is the most frequent used methodology in earlier performed studies and the only one that can be used I field. Under the field-study data were collected from 570 <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> logs, 30 logs from each one of the tested harvesters. Logs of log-types middle- and topplogs of pine and spruce was cheched and were a part of the study. 56 percent of the logs were pinelogs and 44 percent of the cheched logs were sprucelogs. 85, 3 percent of the logmaterial had an diameter between 16 cm and 24 in rootdiameter and 74, 4 percent had lengths between 37 dm and 49 dm. In average of the 19 controlled harvesters there were 28 percent cutting cracks and it was a small different between the tree species, spruce had an higher frequency cracked logs but only 2, 7 percent higher frequency. The crack frequency increased especially for logs with a diameter ≥ 30 cm and length ≥ 49. A comparison between different harvesting-head manufacturers was made and the two manufacturers that had most tested harvesting-heads were John Deere and Komatsu. John Deere’s harvesting-heads produced timber with fewest cutting-cracks, they had a cut frequency of 18 percent in average and were the best among the manufacturers while Komatsu had 30 percent. Other manufacturers that were included in the study was Logmax, Ponsse and SP. The average crack for both tree species were 8, 4 cm long but the pine had a tendency to crack more. In average did the cutting crack occurred after that 75 percent of the trunks diameter were cut thru. The wood loss that occurs while harvesting windfalls due to cutting cracks and shortening of the average crack length to get crack free timber were 0, 54 percent of the harvested <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> volume. But with shortening of a length module at 30 cm the wood loss was 2, 01 percent of the harvested <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> volume...|$|R
